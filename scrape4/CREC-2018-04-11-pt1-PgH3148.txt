            By Mr. GRAVES of Missouri:
        H.R. 5475.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 7
        ``The Congress shall have power to . . . establish Post 
     Offices and Post Roads . . .''
       In the Constitution, the power possessed by Congress 
     embraces the regulation of the Postal System in the country. 
     Therefore, the proposed legislation in naming a post office 
     would fall under the powers granted to Congress in the 
     Constitution.
