         MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE AUSTIN BOMBER

  (Mr. McCAUL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, over this last month, my hometown of Austin, 
Texas, was terrorized by a serial bomber, a serial killer. Mr. Speaker, 
fortunately, this nightmare that my hometown of Austin has lived 
through has come to an end, and now is the time to heal the wounds for 
the victims and their families.
  I want to thank the 500 Federal agents who descended upon my hometown 
of Austin for their great work and magnificent job working with my 
Texas Department of Public Safety and my Austin Police Department--many 
of whom I have worked with when I was in the U.S. Attorney's Office 
down there--for their incredible work bringing this killer to his final 
justice.
  Mr. Speaker, I now ask for a moment of silence for the victims and 
their families of this horrible tragedy.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All Members and guests in the gallery will 
please rise and join us for a moment of silence.
