             POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
positive effects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already having on 
individuals and businesses in the First Congressional District of 
Georgia.
  Two weeks ago, I traveled the First District and visited high school 
students, university students, senior citizens, small businesses, big 
businesses, and more to get their feedback on the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act. The results from my trip and the benefits that the First District 
is already reaping were, frankly, astounding.

  For example, Lee Container Company in Homerville said that the new 
tax law has allowed them to purchase at least three machines a year and 
to fully amortize them, allowing their company to grow at a substantial 
rate.
  Businesses like Lee Container and the large number of individuals in 
Homerville that they employ are a reason it was so important to pass 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
  With the new tax law, businesses can employ more people, increase 
salaries, invest in their business and communities, and help our 
economy to thrive.
