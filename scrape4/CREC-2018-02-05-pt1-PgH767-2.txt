                      THREATENING WORKERS' RIGHTS

  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express grave concerns about 
the Supreme Court case Janus v. AFSCME Council 31.
  This case threatens the freedom of working people to join together in 
strong unions to fight for their right to fair pay, safe working 
conditions, and a voice in the decisions that will affect their 
retirement security, healthcare, and the fate of their families.
  Since 1980, incomes for most Americans have risen just 1 percent, 
while incomes for the wealthiest among us rose by 204 percent.
  Incidentally, organized labor membership has seen a precipitous 
decline in this time period.
  I want to recognize some of my own constituents who are fighting back 
against the Janus case, so-called right to fire laws, and the 
antiworker agenda:
  Lorraine Aumic of Schenectady from Local 688;
  Bryan Schaeffer of Delanson from Local 886 in Schenectady;
  Michele Kuiber of Amsterdam from Local 671; and
  Judi Aubin of Clifton Park from Local 655.
  I thank them for their leadership in fighting for an increase in the 
household income for the great majority of Americans coming through the 
strength of unions.
