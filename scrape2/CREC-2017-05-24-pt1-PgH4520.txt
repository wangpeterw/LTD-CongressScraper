                    HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVE SHAUL

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
life and memory of one of Illinois' great journalists, Dave Shaul, who 
passed away this month at age 75.
  For decades, Dave provided countless central Illinois residents with 
their local news as an anchor, producer, and news director at WCIA in 
Champaign, Illinois. During his storied television and radio broadcast 
career, Dave covered the biggest local, State, and national news, 
including covering every Presidential election from 1964 through 2016. 
Dave was known for his honest and trustworthy coverage of local and 
national politics.
  Dave won a number of awards during his career as a journalist. In 
1980, he won the UPI Best Television Sports Play-by-Play Award for his 
coverage of Illinois basketball. And in 1999, he was honored with the 
Associated Press Mark Twain Lifetime Achievement Award, was named to 
the Eastern Illinois University Hall of Fame, and was designated a 
lifetime member of the Illinois News Broadcasters Association. Dave 
also received an Emmy Award for his career accomplishments in 2011.
  Dave leaves a long legacy as a trusted figure on the news and in the 
Champaign-Urbana community. His family and friends continue to be in my 
thoughts and prayers.
