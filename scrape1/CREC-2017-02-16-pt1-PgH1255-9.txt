              RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF GARY PETERSEN

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for

  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement 
of my dear friend, and fellow WSU alumnus, Mr. Gary Petersen.
  Following his graduation in 1965, Gary began a distinguished career 
on behalf of our country and notable Washington institutions, such as 
the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Hanford, Energy Northwest, 
the State Department, and, recently, as vice president of the Tri-City 
Development Council.
  For 5 decades, Gary has been a devoted advocate for the Tri-Cities, 
and his efforts have been critical to the area's growth and 
development. He is also an unwavering proponent of PNNL and the defense 
nuclear waste cleanup mission at Hanford. In Congress, Gary has 
provided me with critical counsel, while generously serving on my 
Hanford Working Group.
  His integrity and distinguished career were recognized with his 2013 
induction into WSU's Murrow Alumni Hall of Achievement.
  I am honored to call Gary a friend, and will be forever grateful for 
his patriotism and dedicated service to the Tri-Cities and our great 
Nation.
