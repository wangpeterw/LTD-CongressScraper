                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Spirit, who is enthroned on high, thank You for the happiness 
we receive because of fellowship with You. Keep us grateful for Your 
sustaining presence that surrounds us with Your favor.
  Lord, bless and sustain our Senators. Remind them that You will not 
forget their faithful service to You and country. Deliver them from 
anxiety about what the future holds as they confidently trust You to 
care for them. Clothe them with Your righteousness, and prepare them to 
see Your face in peace. Help them to see themselves as Your servants, 
bringing the illumination of Your wisdom and peace to Capitol Hill.
  God of our hopes and dreams, we bless Your Holy Name. Amen.
