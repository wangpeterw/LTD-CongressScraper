                   WHITE HOUSE IMMIGRATION PRINCIPLES

  (Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the cruel 
immigration proposal unveiled by the White House this week. This 
proposal goes beyond some of the worst immigration bills. It demands 
billions more for border security, tightens asylum standards, cuts off 
legal immigration, and implements a faulty points-based system, 
undercutting our core values as a country and destroying our economy 
and our future.
  Mr. Speaker, two-thirds of all immigrants to the United States are 
women and children, and these policies will disproportionately hurt 
them. A points-based system eliminates family-based immigration, and it 
is insulting to the valuable contributions of women, especially.
  Nearly 70 percent of all women immigrants with legal status obtained 
it through the family system, and many are stuck in visa backlogs 
waiting years and even decades to reunite with their families.
  Mr. Speaker, immigration has never been just about immigration. It 
has always been about who we are as a country and what we are willing 
to stand up for. I believe the majority of my Republican colleagues 
want to pass the Dream Act, and I ask them to join us in rejecting 
these anti-immigrant poison pills and proposing real solutions that 
benefit the American people and unify our country.
