                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Bless the Members of this assembly as they set upon the work of these 
hours, of these days. Help them to make wise decisions in a good manner 
and to carry their responsibilities steadily, with high hopes for a 
better future for our great Nation.
  As legislation on taxes continues to be debated this week and next, 
may all Members be mindful that the institutions and structures of our 
great Nation guarantee the opportunities that have allowed some to 
achieve great success, while others continue to struggle. May their 
efforts these days guarantee that there are not winners and losers 
under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.
  May Your blessing, O God, be with them and with us all this day and 
every day to come, and may all we do be done for Your greater honor and 
glory.
  Amen.
