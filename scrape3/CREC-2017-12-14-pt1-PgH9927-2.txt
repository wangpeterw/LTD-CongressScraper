                            MOMENT OF TRUTH

  (Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump claims he has ``nothing to do 
with Russia,'' but we have seen damning revelations: secret meetings, 
business and financial entanglements, and elaborate attempts to conceal 
information.
  In any other era, these would be bombshells, but our nonstop media 
cycle, fueled by Trump's constant infusions of drama, make it hard to 
connect the dots. It is not that we lack evidence of Trump-Russia ties, 
it is that there is so much, it makes your head spin.
  So today, I am beginning a ``moment of truth'' series of speeches to 
point out facts that show an administration that is compromised and 
that not only colluded with Russia, but has obstructed justice to keep 
us from knowing the truth.
  One of many smoking guns is from 2015, when Trump's associate, Felix 
Sater, was seeking financing from a Russian bank facing American 
sanctions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. This email from Sater to 
Trump's personal attorney speaks for itself: ``I'll get Putin on this 
program, and we'll get Donald elected.''
  There is a lot more to come.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from 
engaging in personalities toward the President.
