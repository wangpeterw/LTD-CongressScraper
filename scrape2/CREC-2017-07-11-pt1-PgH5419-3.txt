                               VENEZUELA

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, for more than 100 days, the Venezuelan 
people have been courageously protesting peacefully on the streets 
against the abusive regime of Nicolas Maduro.
  Since June, more than 1,400 people have been injured, over 3,600 have 
been detained, and over 100 people have been killed by Maduro's thugs.
  Just days ago, Maduro moved opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez to house 
arrest after more than 3 unjust years in prison. But this diversion 
tactic is not enough. All political prisoners must be released.
  Maduro's fraudulent constituent assembly must be stopped. And more 
names must be added to the sanctions list, especially those human 
rights abusers who are responsible for the violent actions against 
innocent civilians.
  This will send a strong message that the United States stands with 
the people in their struggle for democracy and for justice for all 
Venezuelans.
