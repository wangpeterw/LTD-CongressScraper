                HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. JAMES E. CARTER

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Dr. James E. Carter 
from my hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky, who passed away on 
February 12, 2018.
  For over 50 years, Dr. Jimmy served generations of families in Monroe 
County as their physician, earning the title of Doctor of the Year by 
the American Academy of Family Physicians, as well as being named one 
of America's Top Family Doctors.
  Throughout his years of service to his community, he was not only a 
beloved doctor, but was widely respected for being the leader of one of 
Kentucky's greatest political families: the Monroe County Carter 
family.
  Dr. Jimmy's father, Abe, also held countless political offices. His 
uncle, Tim Lee, was a U.S. Congressman. His grandfather, James Carter, 
and his uncle, James, Jr., held the same circuit judgeship for nearly a 
century. Dr. Jimmy served on the Monroe County Board of Education and 
as Monroe County GOP Chair for most of my life.
  Although Monroe County has lost one of our greatest public servants, 
I join with the entire community in celebrating his accomplishments and 
reflecting on his meaningful, compassionate presence in our life.
  May God continue to bless his children, Jim, Tom, Cindy, and Mary 
Catherine, through whom his legacy lives on.
