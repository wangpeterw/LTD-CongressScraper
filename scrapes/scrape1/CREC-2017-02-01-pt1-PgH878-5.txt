            By Mr. KING of Iowa:
        H.R. 785.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       This act erases the forced-dues clauses in the National 
     Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and Railway Labor Act (RLA). As 
     such, this bill makes specific changes to existing law in a 
     manner that returns power to the States and to the People, in 
     accordance with Amendment X of the United States 
     Constitution.
