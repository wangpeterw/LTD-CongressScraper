      HONORING THE PASSING OF STANLEY COOLIDGE AND ROSEANN HANNAH

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness I rise tonight to 
honor the passing of Stanley Coolidge and his fiancee, Roseann Hannah.
  Their lives were tragically lost on October 9, 2017, while trapped in 
their northern California home as it was destroyed by wildfire. What 
began as the faint smell of a distant fire quickly turned to tragedy as 
the area surrounding Stanley's longtime home was ignited rapidly by a 
fast-approaching fire. As Stan and Roseann attempted a hurried 
evacuation, the house was engulfed by flames before they could escape.
  Stan was a retired attorney, born in San Francisco, but lived his 
last 50 years in the mountains of Loma Rica, California. Roseann was a 
resident of Grass Valley, California. Both she and Stan were very 
valued members of their communities.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with the Coolidge and Hannah families as 
we ask the Lord's blessings for comfort and healing at this very 
tragic, very sad time, as well as the families of all who we have lost 
as a result of the fires in the West.
  Stan and Roseann, you will be missed.
