                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the fountain of all wisdom and power, we are grateful 
that You still rule in Heaven. May our lawmakers continue to remember 
that Your purposes will prevail and that Your justice cannot be 
thwarted. Answer the prayers of our Senators as they daily seek Your 
wisdom, guidance, and protection. Lord, sustain them with Your 
unfailing love, rescuing them from the destructive forces that go 
contrary to Your will. Instruct our legislators even in the night 
seasons so that Your will may be done on Earth even as it is done in 
Heaven. Do for them exceedingly, abundantly above all that they can ask 
or imagine according to Your power working in and through them.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
