                       TRIBUTE TO ROSE ILES FEALY

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Rose Iles 
Fealy. Rose hails from Perth, Western Australia, where she studies 
political science at the Australian National University.
  While interning on the Commerce Committee, Rose has assisted the 
Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security 
Subcommittee. Following her internship, Rose intends to pursue law 
school. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Rose Iles Fealy 
for all of the fine work she has done for the committee and wish her 
continued success in the years to come.
