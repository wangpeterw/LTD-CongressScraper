                             NET NEUTRALITY

taxes, I am very pleased by the volume of mail that I have gotten from 
my constituents on all of those issues. But I have to tell you the one 
issue that my constituents have contacted me most on is net neutrality.
  I hear from young people and college students, many who have been 
calling for the first time about wanting an internet that is free from 
the meddling of a few large internet providers.
  As we know, the internet is perhaps one of the most important 
advances of our time. It is a tool that allows citizens to connect from 
all over the country and even the world and improves the quality of 
life.
  From elementary to graduate level students, all would be affected if 
the title II regulations were changed. From the student finishing 
homework to military families keeping in touch, we need a free and open 
internet.
  So why attack an institution that benefits millions for the gain of a 
few big cable companies?
  Please join me in contacting the FCC to tell them net neutrality 
matters to our constituents and it certainly matters to all of us.
