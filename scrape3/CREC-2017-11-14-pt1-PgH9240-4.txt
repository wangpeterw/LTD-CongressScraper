                            PASSING TAX CUTS

  (Mr. BLUM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Speaker, the only time I hear some of my colleagues 
express their concern about the deficit is when this body is 
considering policies to let hardworking American families keep more of 
their hard-earned money.
  This is not the government's money. It is the people's money. They 
earned it. If tax revenues to the government are a concern, then 
certainly we should pass tax cuts.
  After President Kennedy cut tax rates, revenues to the government 
increased from $95 billion to $280 billion. After President Reagan cut 
tax rates, revenues to the government increased from $600 billion to 
$1.35 trillion.
  Furthermore, annual GDP growth rates increased into the 4 to 5 
percent range following these tax cuts. We are going to witness this 
increase in economic growth again under President Trump with a tax bill 
this House will consider later this week.
  As Ronald Reagan said: ``We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because 
we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion-dollar debt because we 
spend too much.''
