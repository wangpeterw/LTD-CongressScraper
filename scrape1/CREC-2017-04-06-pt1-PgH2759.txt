                     HOUSE NEEDS TO STAY IN SESSION

  (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, in just a few hours, Members of this body 
are leaving for a 2-week recess without having resolved the significant 
question of funding the government.
  Funding expires only 3 days after we return--3 days--yet we are 
leaving. We are skipping town, but just yesterday, the chiefs of all of 
the military branches testified before this body about the damage 
another continuing resolution would do to our military.
  The leaders of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air 
Force all testified that a continuing resolution would put our 
warfighters in greater danger, our Nation at greater risk, and the 
world less secure; yet we are leaving with our work unfinished. Our 
troops continue to serve, but we are leaving.
  In what other profession would you take a 2-week pause without 
actually finishing the job?
  Now, I know I am new to the House, but someone please tell me how 
this makes sense. We should stay in session and do what the American 
people sent us here to do: our jobs.
