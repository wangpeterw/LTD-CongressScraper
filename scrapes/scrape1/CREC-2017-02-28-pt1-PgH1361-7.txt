                     WELCOMING CHAPLAIN HARVEY KLEE

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Conaway) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent of 
mine who is here with us today. Chaplain Harvey H. Klee, a resident of 
Llano, Texas, joins us today as the national chaplain of the American 
Legion.
  We just heard Chaplain Klee give a beautiful invocation, calling for 
us all to be unified in our actions, with the best interest of the 
American people at heart. Chaplain Klee has dedicated himself to living 
by those words, serving our Nation and its people in many ways.
  Chaplain Klee served in the Navy during the Korean war and later 
worked as a missionary helping drug addicts and designing training 
programs for inmates at a prison in California.
  Later, he founded the Texas Chaplains Association, and has been 
appointed Texas Department Chaplain nine times, which is more times 
than any other chaplain in the history of the department.
  Chaplain Klee, thank you for joining us today and reminding us of the 
great power of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
