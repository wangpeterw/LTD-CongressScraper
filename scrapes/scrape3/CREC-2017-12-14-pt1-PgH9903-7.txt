               TAX POLICY LEAVES BEHIND NATIVE AMERICANS

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, as Republicans continue to rush their tax 
plan through both Houses of Congress, they leave behind tens of 
millions of Americans to give deficit-exploding tax breaks to the 
absolute wealthiest. They are also leaving behind some really important 
Americans: our Native American brothers and sisters.
  For years, issues of taxation and how Federal tax policy impacts 
Tribal governments have been the subject of discussion, and for those 
years that we have talked about the need for tax reform, there have 
been continuous promises made to Tribal governments that we will deal 
with these inequities, these issues of double taxation in Tribes.
  For example, a Tribal member who gets an adoption through a Tribal 
court doesn't qualify for an adoption tax credit. That is just one 
example of the many ways that Federal tax policy does not anticipate or 
recognize Tribal governments. But they have been left behind again.
  This bill should be written in a way that actually addresses the real 
problems in the Tax Code. It does not.
