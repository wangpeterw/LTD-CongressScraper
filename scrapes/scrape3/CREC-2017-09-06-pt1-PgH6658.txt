 RECOGNIZING MINNESOTA'S FEMALE TRACK AND FIELD ATHLETE OF THE YEAR BY 
                                GATORADE

  (Mr. EMMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding 
athlete from my district who was recently named Minnesota's Female 
Track and Field Athlete of the Year by Gatorade.
  Anna Keefer, a 2017 graduate of St. Michael-Albertville High School, 
was chosen for this award due to her impressive ability on the track 
and the excellence she exudes in every aspect of her life.
  Anna is a sprinter and jumper. Her accolades include three individual 
State titles at the Minnesota State High School League AA State 
Championship meet. She holds the all-time State record in the long 
jump. Anna also helped bring home the track team championship title to 
St. Michael-Albertville at the 2017 State meet.
  In addition to recognizing Anna with this award, Gatorade also 
donated a $1,000 grant in Anna's name to a nonprofit of her choice. It 
gave the grant to the STMA Stallions, a local Special Olympics team, 
because of her friendships with some of the members on the team.
  Anna is attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 
this fall and plans to compete on the track team. We can't wait to see 
what she accomplishes next.
  Anna, all of us in Minnesota are so proud of you, and we wish you all 
the best in your future.
