                 WELCOMING FATHER MICHAEL D. GUTIERREZ

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
Napolitano) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to introduce to the 
House and bid welcome to Father Mike Gutierrez today. He is the pastor 
at St. John the Baptist Catholic Church and school in the city of 
Baldwin Park in California. Thank you, Father, for coming from Baldwin 
Park and for the wonderful prayer.
  Father Mike, as he is known--he doesn't use Gutierrez--leads a parish 
of 10,000 families with a focus on Filipino and Hispanic communities. 
He has increased participation in religious and educational programs, 
youth and family ministry, and allows the church to bring attention and 
encourage activism on issues impacting the area.
  He is an integral part of the 32nd District's, my district, annual 
immigration clinic event and is known for his joviality and smiling 
consistently.
  Since my move to the California 32nd, he has been helpful in many 
issues and events that I have put forth, recognized by the California 
State Legislature and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles for support of 
social issues.
  Father, thank you. Thank you for today's blessing and for the work 
you do to spread and promote Gospel throughout the San Gabriel Valley.
  May God continue to bless you and your ministry.
