                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, who transforms common days into transfiguring and 
redemptive moments, hallowed be Your Name. Make our lawmakers great 
enough for these momentous times, as they seek to live worthy of Your 
great Name. May Your precepts keep them from life's pitfalls, guiding 
them through the darkness to a safe haven. Lord, cleanse the fountains 
of their hearts from all that defiles, so that they may be fit vessels 
to be used for Your glory. Let Your peace be within them, as Your 
Spirit inspires them to glorify You in their thoughts, words, and 
actions.
  We pray in Your wonderful Name. Amen.
