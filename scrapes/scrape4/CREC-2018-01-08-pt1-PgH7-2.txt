            HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, each January, we honor the life of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., for all he did to help us live out the 
true meaning of our creed.
  Dr. King dedicated his life to justice and equality, and he died for 
it. But even with his ideals, Dr. King would have never had the impact 
he did if it weren't for his willingness to dedicate his life to 
service. That path of service is open to us all.
  As Dr. King said: ``You don't have to have a college degree to serve. 
You don't have to have to make your subject and your verb agree to 
serve. You don't have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve.''
  Dr. King knew that service isn't about your education or your 
background. It is about much more than that. He taught us all that all 
you need to serve is ``a heart full of grace, a soul generated by 
love.''
  That path is not an easy one, but it is one we can all take, and we 
should.
