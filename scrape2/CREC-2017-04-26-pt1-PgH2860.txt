                      BIG TALK AND BROKEN PROMISES

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, big talk and broken promises, that is what we 
have seen.
  As Trump's first 100 days come to a close, we see desperate times are 
leading to desperate measures. First, there is a push to revive 
TrumpCare. Really? Twenty-four million Americans would be kicked off 
health insurance in the first year, and there would be 15 to 20 percent 
increases in premiums according to the Congressional Budget Office. The 
big change to get a compromise is taking away essential benefits and 
preexisting conditions, the foundation of making sure Americans have 
health care.
  Second, we see Trump's threats to defund the subsidies. This is a 
blatant violation of law. Seven million Americans would lose health 
care immediately if that happened.
  Third, we see Trump's threats to cut Medicaid and Medicare by $1 
trillion. Block grants will mean cuts to senior's health care, cuts to 
children's health care.
  With these 100 days coming to a close, we see Trump as the least 
popular, least productive President in modern history.
  While Trump is breaking his promises, our constituents are depending 
on us to keep ours.
