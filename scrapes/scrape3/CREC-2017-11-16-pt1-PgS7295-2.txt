                          TRIBUTE TO VAN PACE

 Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Van Pace for all 
of her hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South 
Dakota while working in my Washington, DC, office.
  Van has spent the majority of her career in public service, including 
time with the U.S. Department of Energy, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, and most recently with the Department of Homeland 
Security. Immediately before her time in my office, Van was advising 
Federal offices and nonprofit organizations on regulatory requirements 
for grant awards.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Van for her years in 
public service and wish her all the best in the years to come.

                          ____________________
