                    REFUGES HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT

  (Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, each year, millions of Americans visit 
wildlife refuges throughout the country. They generate over $2 billion 
in economic activity and create 35,000 jobs. This wouldn't be possible 
without help from dedicated and hardworking volunteers.
  That is why we have introduced H.R. 3979, bipartisan legislation that 
reauthorizes the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer, Community 
Partnership, and Education Program. This program ensures public access 
to refuges for exploring, hunting, fishing, and studying wildlife.
  Refuges have a tremendous impact, even in Brooklyn, where Fish and 
Wildlife Service staff and volunteers work with local public schools to 
cultivate the next generation of conservationists and wildlife 
enthusiasts through hands-on learning.
  Carmen Wheeler, a second grade student in Brooklyn, recently wrote to 
me and said: ``I think we should keep the wildlife refugees safe, even 
if they are far away, because they will always keep our world 
healthier.''
  We are with you, Carmen.
