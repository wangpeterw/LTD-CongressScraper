  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  You are the father of us all, and Your divine providence has led this 
Nation in the past and guides all human affairs tothis very day.
  On this day the American people join Congress as we call upon Your 
holy name. We pray for Vice President Mike Penceand, most especially, 
for your servant, Donald Trump, our elected 45th President of these 
United States.
  May Your holy spirit descend upon him that he may see things as You 
see things. May he be strengthened in his work and growin understanding 
as he proves ever attentive to the people.
  May he respond to the Nation's deepest needs and lift up all of us to 
higher standards of equal justice, true goodness, andpeaceful union. 
Grant him health and protection, sincere collaboration and renewed 
faith.
  Lord, may the people of this Nation and those around the world stand 
with him to face any challenge, endure any difficultywithout fear, 
learn how to accept every success and every failure with grace, and 
support him with encouragement and prayer. Wepray that he become his 
best self.
  As always, may all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
