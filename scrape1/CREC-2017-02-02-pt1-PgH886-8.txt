               RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as our Nation celebrates National 
Catholic Schools Week, I rise to recognize the lasting contributions of 
Catholic education in my south Florida community.
  Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, 
and Immaculata-LaSalle High School are just a few of the many Catholic 
institutions serving my district. These schools do more than just 
provide their students with an excellent education, Mr. Speaker. Each 
one of them is also dedicated to instilling a religious grounding and 
moral values in our students so that they can dedicate their lives to 
serve our God, their families, and our community.
  Congratulations to the teachers, administrators, and staff at our 
fantastic Catholic schools. Thank you for your dedication to building a 
brighter future for all of south Florida.
