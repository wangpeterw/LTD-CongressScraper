 SENATE RESOLUTION 130--EXPRESSING GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION FOR THE 
              ENTRY OF THE UNITED STATES INTO WORLD WAR I

  Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. Risch, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cassidy, Ms. 
Baldwin, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Peters, and Mr. Kaine) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations:

                              S. Res. 130

       Whereas, on April 2, 1917, President Thomas Woodrow Wilson 
     asked Congress to convene an extraordinary session to 
     officially declare war on the Imperial German Government;
       Whereas, on April 4, 1917, the Senate passed a joint 
     resolution that declared a formal state of war between the 
     United States and the Imperial German Government;
       Whereas, on April 6, 1917, the House of Representatives 
     adopted the same joint resolution that the Senate had passed, 
     thereby marking the official entry of the United States into 
     World War I;
       Whereas, consequently, April 6, 2017, marks the 100th 
     anniversary of the entry of the United States into World War 
     I beside France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, the 
     countries of the Triple Entente;
       Whereas, on December 7, 1917, the United States declared 
     war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire;
       Whereas, beginning in August 1914--
       (1) a portion of France was occupied by German forces; and
       (2) France fought--
       (A) beside the United Kingdom and all countries of the 
     British Empire (notably, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and 
     South Africa), Belgium, Russia, Italy, and Portugal;
       (B) on land, at sea, and in the air;
       (C) along a front line of more than 460 miles; and
       (D) to recover full sovereignty;
       Whereas, before April 6, 1917, the United States had 
     supported France and the Allies economically, financially, 
     and with human support, including through 3,600 individuals 
     who served as volunteers, ambulance attendants, nurses, 
     philanthropists, and soldiers in the French Foreign Legion;
       Whereas the expeditionary force of the United States was 
     created on May 3, 1917, under the command of General John J. 
     Pershing, to provide military support to France and the 
     Allies;
       Whereas the United States started huge mobilization efforts 
     after Congress passed the Act entitled ``An Act to authorize 
     the President to increase temporarily the Military 
     Establishment of the United States'', approved May 18, 1917 
     (Public Law 65-15; 40 Stat. 76), thereby introducing military 
     conscription and enabling 4,800,000 individuals from the 
     United States to serve during World War I;
       Whereas the first forces of the expeditionary corps led by 
     General Pershing arrived quickly in France;
       Whereas General Pershing landed in Boulogne-sur-Mer on June 
     13, 1917, 14,750 members of the First Infantry Division 
     landed in Saint-Nazaire on June 26, 1917, and 7,500 soldiers 
     landed in Brest on November 12, 1917;
       Whereas members of the Armed Forces were involved in a 
     considerable logistics effort in France, building many 
     transportation infrastructure projects, including roads, 
     harbors, and railways, communications networks, and 
     accommodation buildings, which were crucial for the war 
     effort and the transformation of the French landscape;
       Whereas a debt of gratitude is owed to the 3 members of the 
     Armed Forces who fell in France during the first combat of 
     the Armed Forces in Bathelemont-les-Bauzemont on November 3, 
     1917;
       Whereas individuals from many different sectors of the 
     population of the United States, including African Americans, 
     Hispanics, and Native Americans, were involved in logistics, 
     support, or combat operations in France between 1917 and 
     1918;
       Whereas President Thomas Woodrow Wilson was deeply involved 
     in the peace process in Europe, notably through his speech to 
     Congress on January 8, 1918, the 14 points of which were 
     proposed as a basis for negotiation at the Versailles Peace 
     Conference, which began on January 18, 1919;
       Whereas approximately 2,000,000 members of the Armed Forces 
     fought in France and 126,000 died during the war, including 
     53,402 individuals who were killed in action in French 
     territory during battles in 1918, such as the Battle of 
     Belleau Wood, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, and the Meuse-
     Argonne Offensive;
       Whereas numerous reminders of the actions of the Armed 
     Forces during World War I remain in France, notably in 
     buildings and memorials; and
       Whereas the people of France will always be grateful when 
     remembering the sacrifices of members of the Armed Forces 
     during World War I: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the official entry 
     of the United States into World War I on April 6, 1917;
       (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to--
       (A) the members of the Armed Forces who participated in 
     World War I operations alongside the countries of the Triple 
     Entente; and
       (B) the members of the Allied Forces who participated in 
     World War I operations alongside France from 1914 until the 
     end of the war;
       (3) commends centenary commemorations to honor people from 
     France, the United States, and all countries involved in 
     World War I that aim to make future generations aware of the 
     acts of heroism and sacrifice performed by the Armed Forces 
     and the Allies;
       (4) recognizes efforts undertaken by France, especially by 
     port cities on the Atlantic coast and by the regions of 
     Hauts-de-France, Bretagne, Loire-Atlantique, Aquitaine, 
     Centre, and Grand-Est, to preserve the memory and celebrate 
     the legacy of the involvement of the United States during 
     World War I;
       (5) recognizes that the people of France plan to--
       (A) celebrate this anniversary with commemorations and 
     relevant programs to express gratitude to those individuals 
     who helped restore hope among the Allies; and
       (B) during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the 
     Armistice of November 11, 1918, express gratitude and 
     appreciation to every--
       (i) military force that fought alongside France, inside or 
     outside its territory, during World War I; and
       (ii) individual who died fighting or was injured during the 
     hostilities, whether physically or psychologically; and
       (6) encourages all countries involved in World War I to 
     participate in the centennial of the Armistice, which will be 
     celebrated in 2018, to the fullest extent possible.
