                        TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE ALISON

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Claire Alison, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office for all of the hard work she has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Claire is a graduate of El Camino Real Charter High School in Los 
Angeles, CA. Currently, she is attending California State University, 
Northridge, where she is majoring in history. Claire is a dedicated 
worker who has been committed to getting the most out of her 
experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Claire Alison for all 
of the fine work she has done and wish her continued success in the 
years to come.
