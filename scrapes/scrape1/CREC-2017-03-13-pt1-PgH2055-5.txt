                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Gracious and merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  In this Chamber, where the people's House gathers, we pause to offer 
You gratitude for the gift of this good land on which we live, and for 
this great Nation which You have inspired in developing over so many 
years. Continue to inspire the American people, that through the 
difficulties of these days we might keep liberty and justice alive in 
our Nation, and in the world.
  On this day the House anticipates weather which is already affecting 
millions of Americans. Grant that the severity of this late winter 
storm wane. But for those affected, may the assistance of first 
responders and more fortunate neighbors ease the passage through this 
weather, prove that the fiber of our national community is strong and 
reliable.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
