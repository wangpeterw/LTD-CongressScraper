                          PROTECTING DREAMERS

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today the President made clear that 
he refuses to protect DREAMers. It is now imperative that Congress acts 
to protect DREAMers before DACA ends.
  This issue is personal for me because I, too, was brought to our 
country by my parents as a child. The hope for a better life which 
carried my parents here from oceans away was no different from that of 
the parents of DREAMers and generations of immigrants before.
  DREAMers play a vital role in our economy, and ending DACA would cost 
our country nearly half a trillion dollars over 10 years. But the 
contributions of DREAMers go beyond any single statistic: DREAMers have 
built their lives here, started families here, built businesses here, 
and bled in uniform for the only home they have ever known.
  I urge Speaker Ryan and my colleagues from both parties to come 
together to defend DREAMers and to develop a comprehensive approach to 
immigration built on American values.
