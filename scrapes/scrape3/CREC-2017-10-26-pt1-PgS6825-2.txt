                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our King, we are grateful that righteousness and justice are 
the foundation of Your throne. Give our lawmakers such a connection 
with You that they will hate evil. Let the light of Your wisdom shine 
upon them, providing them with the joy of doing right. Save them from 
life's pitfalls, providing them with the protection of the shield of 
Your favor. Lord, remind them of Your faithfulness so that they will 
trust the unfolding of Your loving providence. Help them to remember 
that You have sustained America throughout its history. Remembering how 
You have led us in the past, may our Senators feel confident that You 
will complete the work You have started.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
