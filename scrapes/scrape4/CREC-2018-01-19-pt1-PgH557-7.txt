                     HONORING CHIEF RUSSELL ACHORD

  (Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
ultimate sacrifice of West Feliciana Deputy Fire Chief Russell Achord, 
who died Wednesday while responding to a car accident.
  Chief Achord served for 24 years and earned Officer of the Year and 
Valor in the Line of Duty recognitions during that time. He has also 
helped the community by implementing programs to teach high school 
students emergency care and improving the fire district's standard of 
care.
  It is because of the sacrifices of first responders like Chief Achord 
that we

enjoy the lives we are able to lead. Our first responders put their 
lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe, and for that 
we can never say ``thank you'' enough.
  Louisiana and West Feliciana Parish are better because of Chief 
Achord, and I ask that you keep his family and his firehouse in your 
prayers as they grieve.
