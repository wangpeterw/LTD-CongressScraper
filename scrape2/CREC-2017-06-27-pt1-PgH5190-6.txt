                           OPPOSING TRUMPCARE

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose TrumpCare, a bill 
that

[[Page H5191]]

will cause at least 22 million Americans to lose healthcare.
  Senate Republicans and House Republicans drafted their bill in 
secret, behind closed doors, and without a single hearing. But after 
seeing the bill, Mr. Speaker, I know why they kept it a secret.
  TrumpCare will allow States to eliminate essential healthcare 
benefits like emergency room visits, preventative screenings, and 
prescription drug coverage. TrumpCare will gut Medicaid $772 billion 
and allow insurers to charge hardworking Americans more money for less 
coverage.
  It will cost the State of Ohio, my State, more than $25 billion, 
giving 400 of the richest families a massive tax break.
  Hardworking Americans should not have to choose between going to the 
doctor and putting food on their table. Republicans should work with 
Democrats to create a healthcare system that gives all Americans fair 
health coverage.
