                BUDGET RECONCILIATION REPORTING DEADLINE

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 2001 of S. Con. Res. 3, the 
concurrent resolution on the budget Fiscal Year 2017, directs the 
Committees on Finance and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions to 
report changes in laws within their respective jurisdictions to reduce 
the on-budget deficit by not less than $1 billion each for the total of 
fiscal years 2017 through 2026. Those committees were instructed to 
submit their recommendations to the Committee on the Budget no later 
than January 27, 2017.
  For the information of colleagues, the reporting deadline has passed, 
and the Budget Committee has not received reconciliation 
recommendations from either committee. While committees have not 
complied with the deadline, the Senate retains the ability to utilize 
the instructions contained in section 2001 of S. Con. Res. 3.
