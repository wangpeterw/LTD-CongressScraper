                   BIASED JOURNALISM IS UNACCEPTABLE

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, many years ago I received an 
undergraduate degree in journalism, was a reporter on a daily 
newspaper, and taught journalism for 1 year. In those years, there was 
a clear separation between the front page and the editorial page.
  I don't believe I have ever read a more biased, partisan, opinionated

paragraph in a ``news'' story than one that was on the front page of 
yesterday's Washington Post. Philip Rucker does not now deserve the 
title of journalist but, instead, should be referred to as a Democratic 
or leftwing hack.
  He wrote that a traditional President would have reacted carefully 
``to the London attacks by instilling calm, being judicious . . . and 
appealing to the country's better angels.'' Instead, he accused 
President Trump of reacting ``impulsively . . . stroking panic and 
fear, being indiscrete with details . . . and capitalizing on it to 
advocate for one of his more polarizing policies and to advance a 
personal feud.''
  Apparently, Mr. Rucker is so blinded by hatred for the President he 
cannot see straight and has written one of the most unfair, one-sided 
articles I have ever read in a ``news'' story in what used to be a 
newspaper.
