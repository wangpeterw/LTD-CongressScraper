This week, thousands will gather in Augusta to take part in a tradition unlike any other.  Beginning in 1934, the Masters, hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club, has become the most prestigious golf tournament in the world. Known for its lightning-fast greens and gorgeous azaleas, this tournament captivates the world for both the talent of those playing and its beauty. Since its inception, many legends have conquered the greens to prove their skill and earn the coveted green jacket.  This year will be a little somber, as we will deeply miss another of the great legends, four-time Masters champion Arnold His presence will certainly be missed on that first tee as an honorary starter and throughout this great week.  I wish the best to all those competing in this truly remarkable event and invite those who are traveling from far and wide to experience and enjoy the wonderful hospitality of the 12th Congressional District of Georgia and my home,                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2639.txt,2239,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,4.0,February
4787,topic-id,1259,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to, one, thank my friend and colleague, the Senator from[[Page S1012]]Georgia, for making his comments about Tom Price, President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human  I have known Tom for over 20 years. We are both orthopedic surgeons. I know his professional ability. I know his passion for patients and health care. I am delighted and confident that he will be confirmed to be the Secretary of Health and Human I think he is the right person for the important task that lies ahead.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I also come to the floor today to talk about the President's nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Ever since the President made that nomination, we have had an outpouring of support for this nomination and not just those of us in Wyoming--of course, because his mom was born in Casper, WY--but there has been an outpouring of support all across the country and actually across the globe.  The Economist magazine out of London wrote: ``Neil Gorsuch Is a Good Pick for the Supreme Court.''  USA Today had a story with the headline: ``Neil Gorsuch, Stellar Resume and Scalia-Like Legal Philosophy.''  There was even an op-ed in the New York Times by a former Acting Solicitor General in the Obama administration. It was an op-ed by Neal Katyal under the headline: ``Why Liberals Should Back Neil Gorsuch.'' This top Obama administration official called Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century''--over the last century.  He went on to say that ``if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.''  I mean that, to me, is what it is all about--the rule of law. And that is from a former Obama administration official who knows the Supreme  I hope to be able to sit down soon with Judge Gorsuch to talk about his views. He and I had a brief visit today as he was heading from one Senator's office to another.  Everything I have seen in his background tells me that he has the temperament and the experience to be an outstanding Justice on the Supreme His background as a judge gives us powerful evidence of the kind of Justice that he will be.  In 10 years on the U.Circuit Court of Appeals, he has authored hundreds of opinions and dissents, and you can be assured that these will be dissected. This record will give Senators ample evidence of exactly how Judge Gorsuch views the role of the courts in applying the law.  From what I have seen so far, he appears to take the law and the Constitution at face value. He doesn't treat them like blank pages on which he can rewrite the laws the way he wishes they were. As he wrote in one opinion: ``Often judges judge best when they judge least.''  This view of judicial restraint in every example I have seen from Judge Gorsuch's record is squarely in the mainstream of American legal thinking today. You don't have to take my word for it. There is actual data to prove it.  There was an editorial in the Wall Street Journal yesterday with the headline, ``Gorsuch in the Mainstream''--``Gorsuch in the Mainstream,'' yesterday's Wall Street  The editorial cites a thorough study of something like 800 different opinions that Judge Gorsuch has written since joining the court of appeals. Less than 2 percent--less than 2 out of 100 opinions even drew a dissent from his colleagues on the bench, and 98 out of every 100 of his decisions were unanimous. This was on a court where seven of the active judges were appointed by Democrats, and only five were appointed by a The Wall Street Journal says that of at least eight cases considered by Mr.Gorsuch that were appealed to the Supreme Court--appealed to the Supreme Court--the Supreme Court Justices upheld his results in seven of the eight--seven out of eight. Four of them were unanimous in front of the U.Supreme So if you actually look at his record, I think it is clear that this is a judge who is very much in the mainstream.  CNN did a story on Judge Gorsuch, and they said that he is a laid-back, fly-fishing, fourth-generation Coloradan who also happens to have an Ivy League education, a brilliant legal mind, and an established judicial record.  I mentioned his established legal record, and I think it is also very important that he is a fourth-generation He would bring to the Supreme Court a much needed perspective from the Rocky Mountain Among the current Justices, only Justice Clarence Thomas is from somewhere other than New York or It is important that we get this kind of viewpoint on the  Judge Gorsuch is smart, fair, very well qualified. CNN mentioned his education, and it really is very impressive: Columbia University, Harvard Law School, a Marshall scholar at Oxford He was also confirmed to the circuit court by a unanimous voice vote of the U.Senate right here.  None of this seems to matter to the Democrats today--not the intelligence, not the distinguished career, not that he is squarely in the mainstream. None of it matters to some of my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle. They were sharpening their knives for anyone--anyone the President might nominate, regardless of their qualifications. They wrote their press releases months ago, full of attacks on a person most of them had never met. It is what Democrats always do when a Republican President nominates someone to the Supreme It is exactly what they promised to do this time as well. Even before President Trump was inaugurated, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that his party would fight ``tooth and nail'' to block the nominee. He said he was going to do his best to ``keep the seat open.''  Senator Schumer met with Judge Gorsuch the other day. He complained that the judge did not answer questions about some issues that are in the news and before the courts, things like the so-called Muslim ban. Well, according to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges--the code of conduct for judges--a judge is actually prohibited from making public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. Well, there are certainly ongoing court cases about a number of things that Senator Schumer asked about, so I think it is a very good sign that Judge Gorsuch would refuse to comment on these.  Democrats in the Senate are being told by the far-left elements of their political base to try to block this nominee. Many of these Senators are doing everything that they can to comply. Liberal activists have been planning a multimillion dollar lobbying campaign against this nominee or any nominee ever since election day. The reaction of these activists on the left has been hysterical, it has been irrational, and it has been disgraceful.  I hope the Democrats in the Senate will reject these calls from their base and will give this nominee a chance. I hope that they will take the time to consider his qualifications and that they will actually sit down to talk with him before they rush to condemn him.  I know I look forward to sitting down with the nominee and discussing his views more fully. Everything I have seen so far suggests to me that it will be a very good conversation.  I yield the floor.

4678,topic-id,183,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to highlight legislation I recently introduced, the VA GORDIAN KNOT Act, which would help improve and reform the Department of Veterans  In Greek mythology, the Gordian knot represents a complex problem that needs out-of-the-box thinking to solve, and that is exactly what we need.  The VA's Gordian knot is its repeated manipulation of key data and overall lack of accountability. The VA has been known to yield less-than-truthful information when it comes to collecting and reporting data about patient care, appointment wait times, and employee hiring and firing practices.  This behavior is an erosion of public trust and a disservice to our Nation's veterans, our true heroes. It also makes it difficult to properly address the VA's shortcomings and enhance its successes because there are successes as well.  The VA GORDIAN KNOT Act requires the VA to standardize its data collecting and reporting mechanisms and increases oversight of the integrity and accuracy of the information.  I believe this bill is absolutely necessary to reform the VA and assist in its mission to care for our true American heroes.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2639-3.txt,1838,1730,2017.0,4.0,February

4658,topic-id,1401,"Mr.President, I rise today to join a chorus of my colleagues in speaking out against the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to serve as Secretary of the Department of the  What I believe is, if you look at Mr.Mnuchin's record, he has spent a lot of time benefiting from--in fact, even exploiting--families who are struggling homeowners in my  I would like to read into the Record a report by NPR from November of last year which makes his pattern stunningly clear.       During the depths of the financial crisis, Mnuchin was      looking to make profits from the ruins of the housing bust.      In 2009, he put together a group of billionaire investors and      bought a failed California-based bank called It had      been taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation      after its sketchy mortgage loans went seriously bad.       Mnuchin and his partners bought IndyMac on the condition      that the FDIC agree to pay future losses above a certain      threshold. They renamed the bank OneWest Bank, and after      running it for 6 years, they sold it last year for a profit,      estimated at close to $1.5 billion.       Kevin Stein of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a      housing advocacy group, says that profit was made on the      backs of suffering Californian homeowners.  This is not in the text here, but homeowners who were suffering from a massive mortgage collapse that was created in many ways or stimulated by the greed and avarice of bad actors. I witnessed this myself in Newark, NJ, watching people feed upon a subprime mortgage environment where they were pushing bad loans on unsuspecting borrowers.  Back to the text:       In essence what they did is they bought a foreclosure      machine.       According to the coalition, OneWest foreclosed on more than      36,000 homeowners under During that time, the FDIC      made payments to OneWest totaling more than $1 billion. Those      payments went to the billionaire investors of OneWest Bank,      says Stein, to cover the cost of foreclosing on working-class      everyday American folks, many of whom lived in  So this was what we saw at the height of the financial crisis. Mr.Mnuchin, already very wealthy, already very successful, did not see Americans struggling, did not join efforts to try to empower, support, or deal with this crisis. What he saw was an opportunity to take over a financial institution and continue, if not accelerate, the foreclosures that were going on.  It has become painfully clear that in what Mr.Mnuchin oversaw in the operations of this bank that, as its business model, he set out to explicitly mislead and manipulate homeowners into foreclosure.  This one article that I read has been repeated by organizations and by news outlets all over the spectrum, talking about how Mr.Mnuchin, in this environment, worked very hard to accelerate foreclosures and take advantage of this and make a profit. From elderly widows, the stories continue, to families, to small business owners, to Active-Duty servicemembers, there were many, many victims of Mr.Mnuchin's bank's predatory tactics, taking advantage of folks in a crisis, as opposed to trying to figure out a way to support folks through it.  I would like to read one more from the Minneapolis StarTribune, an article that documented one instance of the disturbingly prevalent practices of Mr.Mnuchin's company.  The headline reads: ``Negotiating on foreclosure, then locked out in a blizzard.''       A Minneapolis woman who was negotiating with a lender to      find a way to stay in her foreclosed house--  Stepping back from the text, this is someone who is working hard to do the right thing in negotiations.  Back to the text:       They arrived home from work during Tuesday night's blizzard      to find that the locks had been changed. After spending the      night at her mother's, Leslie Parks went Wednesday to      Hennepin County Housing Court, where a referee ordered that      she be allowed back into her mother's former duplex at 3749      Park Avenue while negotiations continued. Locksmiths on      Wednesday reconfigured the locks that had been changed      Tuesday by a contractor for OneWest  These are the kind of tactics that were being used, the kind of hardball tactics that were being used by Mr.Mnuchin's company that really undermined a lot of hard-working Americans from a variety of backgrounds in many, many different  His record is clear. Mr.Mnuchin not only advocated in support of this company and its tactics, but even now he talks about trying to roll back the kind of protections that have been put in place to try to protect average Many of them are in the Dodd-Frank legislation that helped to protect against the creation of an environment in which such predatory practices can take place.  This position that Mr.Mnuchin has been nominated for, which is the Secretary of Treasury, has a critical role within our economy. But one of those roles has to be the idea that average Americans will be protected from the kind of financial victimization that was going on during the recession--actually, which lead into the recession.  We see that we can prevent Wall Street from burdening Main Street with the costs while they reap the rewards. This is the broken system that we saw in the past that needs fixing and needs healing. We don't need one of the architects of the system that caused so much pain to be in one of the most important positions in our land.  The head of this vital agency must be someone who understands their responsibility to look out for the struggling American trying to make it by playing by the rules and someone who is qualified and willing to direct the Department to fiercely protect the economic security of our Nation, the economic well-being of the American people, and the integrity of our financial system.  I don't believe Mr.Mnuchin is that person. He has made it clear in his decades-long career that he is willing for a profit to work hard to exploit hard-working families and shortchange homeowners for that personal gain. This is unacceptable. Mr.Mnuchin has built a career and has reaped literally millions of dollars of success by pushing people, by exploiting people, and by hurting people.  The American people cannot afford to suffer through another financial crisis. We can't afford to have a master Wall Street manipulator put in the position that we should be relying on to protect us from that kind of financial manipulation.  This is a difficult economy where people in our country are still struggling under challenging financial[[Page S1120]]times. I believe that we can make a nation where people can do good and do well at the same time, where we should not elevate or celebrate people who really fed off of the misery and the challenges of others, but, instead, that we can have a nation where we put people, regardless of their political background, in positions like the Department of Treasury to celebrate the best of who we are, the best of our values--people who are public servants, people who have shown a commitment to not only serve but even sacrifice for one another.  What we saw amidst this crisis--amidst a crisis that, in many ways, was aggravated and caused by greed and avarice in the mortgage industry and the banking industry, among rating agencies--was that many people showed who they were in a time of American struggle and American crisis. We saw with clarity where people's priorities were. Was it exploiting people? Was it manipulating systems for their own avarice and their own benefit, or was it for being there for our country, trying to make thing things better, trying to give people bridges that could carry them from financial struggle and strain to stability, or people that were trying to crumble those bridges and have people free fall in financial distress.  This is, unfortunately, what we see here today. We have President Trump trying to elevate someone who has not shown a record of someone who wanted to help but instead has shown a record of someone who wants to hurt. That to me is unacceptable, especially at this time where so many American families are still struggling to get back on their feet to find financial security and find the pathway to their American dream.  It is for this reason and more that I cannot support this nomination.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

(2) The select committee may disclose publicly such      information after the expiration of a five-day period      following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted      to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the      President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day      period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the      committee that he objects to the disclosure of such      information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies      that the threat to the national interest of the United States      posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs      any public interest in the disclosure.       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the      Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the      select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such      information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader      and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by      majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of      such information to the Senate for consideration.

4615,topic-id,1287,"Mr.President, this week, I introduced, along with Senators Perdue, Feinstein, Rubio, Blumenthal, Collins, Merkley, Booker, and Leahy, the Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017.  Global corruption is a fundamental obstacle to peace, prosperity, and human rights. It is fueling transnational criminal networks and violent extremism, and combatting it should be elevated and prioritized across our foreign policy efforts.  I know my colleagues understand the crucial importance of addressing corruption because it undermines public confidence in government institutions and fosters resentment and instability. There is growing recognition across the United States and around the world that corruption is a serious threat to international security and stability. The countries and names might be different, but the characteristics and the impact on innocent people are the same.  The bribery scandal surrounding the huge Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht has tarnished politicians and governments from Peru to Columbia to Rampant corruption in oil-rich Angola is depriving children of a quality education and contributing to the highest child mortality rate in the world. While progress is now being made, extensive corruption in Afghanistan resulted in billions of dollars of assistance winding up in the pockets of crooked elites.  The connections are clear: Where there are high levels of corruption, we find fragile states, political instability, and people suffering from hunger and violence.  Corruption is a global problem, but its consequences take the harshest toll at the local level, and it is very tough to fight. The problem of corruption, and the disruption and suffering it causes, involves many corrupt actors, from government officials to businessmen, from law enforcement and military personnel to street gangs. Corruption is a system that operates via extensive, entrenched networks in both the public and private sectors.  We know that corruption is the lifeblood of Vladimir Putin's Russia, and it is the glue for his regime's survival. Parasitic at home, deeply corrupt regimes like Putin's seek to enrich themselves, hollow out their own countries' institutions, and subvert rules-based democratic states abroad. An anticorruption platform run by opposition activist and aspiring, Presidential candidate Alexei Navalny recently released information uncovering four mansions, an Italian vineyard, yachts, and other high-value assets reportedly held by Prime Minister Dmitry Anticorruption demonstrations, in Moscow, Petersburg, and across the country in recent weeks reflect the ongoing resistance of the Russian people to government corruption. Hundreds were arrested. Prominent anticorruption activist Ildar Dadin, who has already spent over a year in prison for earlier protests, was among those arrested.  Corruption feeds the destructive fire of criminal networks and transnational crime. Citizens lose faith in the social compact between governments and the people. In Venezuela, we have seen how rampant corruption has collapsed the country's economy, sparked a humanitarian crisis, and produced chains of money laundering that span several continents. The ongoing crisis there now threatens to collapse the last few remnants of the rule of law.  Corruption also fuels violence by security forces. South Sudan's kleptocrats have either failed to pay or delayed salary payments to their soldiers who have in turn taken out their rage on innocent civilians, attacking them, looting and burning their homes, and engaging in other violent criminality.  We should take heart that in just the past 2 years, popular protests against corruption have broken out in Iraq, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Lebanon, Malaysia, Moldova, and In Romania, efforts to weaken anticorruption laws there prompted an estimated 500,000 protesters to take to the streets last month, even after the government repealed its decree, showing the degree to which citizens are fed up with graft and determined to push back. These were the largest demonstrations since the fall of communism.  Some victims express their frustration through peaceful protest, but not all. The revolutions of the Arab Spring and Ukraine began, in part, as determined anticorruption protests.  In every country where protests erupted in 2011, demonstrators condemned the corruption of detested ruling elites and demanded accountability and the return of looted assets. These[[Page S2419]]revolutions have degenerated into some of the chief security challenges we confront now--Russian aggression in Ukraine, 6 years of slaughter in Syria, the implosion of Libya, a brutal war in Yemen, the fraying of Iraq, and an expanding insurgency in  Official corruption fuels radical extremism and terrorism, too; it gives credibility to militant religious extremists and helps them gain recruits and increasing footholds in Afghanistan and Iraq to Pakistan, Central Asia, the Sahel, and West It may seem like a spurious example, but it can be persuasive to a young Nigerian man whose sister was molested by a teacher as the cost for attending school.  Let's be clear-eye. Any fight against corruption will be long-term and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people, powerful companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a mindset and a culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing laws.  As my colleagues and constituents know, my attention has long been focused on fighting corruption. I introduced the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act to target human rights abusers and corrupt individuals around the globe who threaten the rule of law and deny fundamental freedoms, but the problem is so big--we simply have to do more.  This is why this week I introduced with bipartisan support the Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017 in the U. We must meet the scale of entrenched corruption with greater resolve and commitment. To do that, I believe we must focus on three things which I will lay out in my legislation.  First, we must institutionalize the fight against corruption as a national security priority. In my bill, the State Department will produce an annual report, similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report, which takes a close look at each country's efforts to combat corruption. That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to combat modern day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption in our collective work, so that we hold governments to account.  The bill establishes minimum standards for combating corruption--standards that should be every government's duty to its citizens. These include whether a country has laws that recognize corrupt acts for the crimes they are--violations of the people's trust--and that come with serious penalties for breaking that trust; whether an independent judiciary decides corruption cases, free from influence and abuse; whether there is support for civil society organizations that are the watchdogs of integrity against would-be thieves of the state. This bill aims to build anticorruption DNA into the basic functions of government.  Second, the bill would improve the way we look at our own foreign and security assistance, and promote more transparency--let in some daylight. For countries that fall short on their corruption efforts, the bill calls for an assessment of the risk of corruption for our foreign assistance and steps to combat corruption, including the ability to claw back any funds diverted from their intended purpose and terminate compromised programs. American taxpayers should know how our foreign assistance is spent, and they should feel confident that we are doing the kind of risk assessments, analysis, and oversight that ensure our assistance to other countries is having the effect we want it to have.  Third, the bill consolidates information about anticorruption efforts abroad and puts it online, where citizens can see the numbers and the programs. That kind of transparency is essential to open government, but in my experience, it also has the effect of making us better at self-policing our work. We can use the data to capture redundancies and analyze trends, improving our decisionmaking.  I urge my colleagues to join me and the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation in this effort. The success of our diplomacy, and the ultimate impact of our international security efforts depend on it.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-04-pt3-PgS2418-2.txt,,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,4.0,February

4643,topic-id,1470,"Mr.President, I take this time to explain to my colleagues why I will be opposing Steve Mnuchin's nomination for Secretary of the  Mr.Mnuchin has an impressive record of accomplishment, and I admire his willingness to serve the public. But because of his advocacy for fiscally irresponsible and unfair fiscal policies, which I believe will add to the deficit of this country, I cannot support his nomination.  Let me go back a while, if I may. I was in the Congress when we passed a budget that balanced the Federal budget, where we were actually reducing the Federal debt. It was controversial at the time because we did it by cutting spending first--and we did--but making sure we had adequate revenues in the Treasury to pay our bills because we recognized that we had a moral obligation to pay our bills, that we are wealthy enough of a nation that we don't have to ask our children and grandchildren to pay for our spending today. We took the steps to balance the Federal budget, and we did it by making some tough votes. I was proud to be in the Congress that took those tough votes that balanced the Federal budget.  After we balanced the Federal budget, we saw unprecedented economic growth because we took the responsible actions. We should take a lesson from the past and recognize that there is no easy way to get our budget in better balance. It requires a fiscal policy that is fair--that is fair to middle-income families, that is fair to our children and grandchildren, that is fair to those who depend upon the services that are financed through the government sector, including our seniors with Medicare and Social We can do that if we work together.  But Mr.Mnuchin's economic plan, the one that he has submitted to Congress, I think, would put us at great risk. The main part of what he is advocating is tax cuts primarily for the wealthy. The top 0.1 percent under the Mnuchin plan will receive in excess of $1 million in tax breaks; the upper 1 percent in excess of $200,000 in tax cuts.  Here is the problem: How do we pay for this? How do we offset the cost of these tax cuts? Because I don't think any of us wants to add to the deficit.  So we asked Mr.Mnuchin that question during the confirmation process. Let me just read for the Record the questions that I asked him as to how he would offset the cost of the tax cuts. The Trump plan, including those cuts, is estimated by the Tax Policy Center to add $6.2 trillion to the deficit and by the Tax Foundation to add $3.9 trillion to the deficit.  I asked Mr.Mnuchin:       In your hearing, you discussed the importance of economic      growth in offsetting the revenues lost under the President's      tax reform plan. . . . For instance, you've said, ``[s]o we      think that by cutting corporate taxes, we'll create huge      economic growth and we'll have huge personal income, so the      revenues will be offset on the other side.''       Is it your view that the tax cuts in the President's plan      will be fully offset by economic growth?  That is the question I asked.  Mr.Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset by economic growth.''  I asked: ``If so, could you please share your team's analysis supporting that position?''  Mr.Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset by economic growth.''  I then asked: ``Will you commit, as we discussed in our meeting, not to put forward a plan that will increase the deficit and put our country in a worse financial position?''  Mr.Mnuchin's answer: ``Our objective is to have any tax cuts offset by economic growth.''  In other words, there is no effort here to offset the cost of this tax cut, other than borrowing money, putting our children and grandchildren at greater risk.  I want to repeat again the estimate that we have heard on the President's tax proposal--that it will add anywhere from $6 trillion to almost $4 trillion in deficit. Those estimates are from progressive and conservative groups, and they do consider that there will be some dynamic score keeping here, that there will be some economic growth. That is in those estimates. So even with economic growth, these proposals will greatly enhance the deficit of this country, something that we should not be doing.  What does that mean? You increase the debt of this country. America has to borrow more. Interest rates go up. Middle-income families have to pay more on mortgage payments or car loans.  Middle income families are the ones who get hurt by this. If we are going to see real economic growth, we have to help the middle class--the growing middle class--the consumers, those who buy the goods, those who are struggling every day to make ends meet. This plan doesn't help them. What they are going to be saddled with is more debt and higher interest costs, which will be a drag on our economic growth.  So for all those reasons, I think what is important to have is an advocate for the President as Secretary of the Treasury, someone who recognizes the balance here.  Let me tell you what else deficits do. They are used as justification to continue to cut our discretionary spending accounts, as well as to take a look at entitlement spending.  I acknowledge that, as part of the strategy to balance the Federal budget, we must look at our spending, but we have to have the revenues in order to make it balance. If you don't have the revenues, and you are taking another $4 to $6 trillion out of the equation, there is going to be a lot more pressure to make irresponsible cuts on the spending side.  I heard Candidate Trump talk about that we are not going to cut Social But can you really have $6 trillion of tax cuts without looking at Social Security? And how about Medicare? These are programs that are vitally important for our seniors. It provides them money to live on so they don't have to live in poverty, so they can pay their medical bills. For a majority of seniors, Social Security is their largest source of income. Are we really thinking about equating that with tax cuts for the wealthiest in this country of over $1 million? I don't think that is fairness. I don't think that is what we should be doing.  When you look at the programs that are financed through government, are we going to take away from our students? They already are suffering too high, as far as the cost of attending colleges. Interest rates are already too high in regards to what they do.  Are we going to put more pressure to make more cuts in regards to how we help our students? Are we going to cut maintaining our highways? We want to spend more on highways, bridges, transit systems, and water infrastructure, which I think we need to do. How do you do that if you cut $4 to $6 trillion of revenue on the revenue side without adding greatly to the deficit, which is something none of us wants to do?[[Page S1105]]  How about something like our national parks? We take pride and want to maintain that, but with the pressure on the budgets that is a result of taking the revenues out of government, we know what is going to happen. We have seen this movie before. We have seen what has happened before. The driving force behind all of this is that the most important thing, the most important part of the economic program, is to have these tax cuts primarily for the wealthy.  No, I think the center of our economic policy needs to be fairness--fairness for middle-income families, fairness so that Americans can afford to raise their families and send their kids to college and can afford to have decent opportunities in this country. That is how we all grow together, and that requires a balanced approach to our Nation's budget--one that, yes, looks at restraining spending but also looks at having a Tax Code that is fair and raises the revenues to pay our bills and not pushing that off to future generations.  I think for all those reasons, we need a person who is going to advocate on behalf of middle-income families and on behalf of a growing economy. I think the plan that Mr.Mnuchin is advocating will not accomplish that. For these reasons and others, I cannot support his nomination for Secretary of the  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

4789,topic-id,922,"Mr.President, first let me comment and thank my colleague from Maryland, Senator Van Senator Van Hollen may be a new Member to the U.Senate, but he is not a new Member to the Congress of the United  I think Senator Van Hollen said this very clearly: This nomination is very much about the type of health care system we want for the people in this country, whether we are going to have affordable, quality health care for all Americans, whether health care is going to be a right or a privilege. I thank Senator Van Hollen for the points he made.  I think the people of Maryland are not going to be surprised that I agree with my colleague from Maryland and that I take this time to explain why I will oppose Mr.Price for Secretary of Health and Human Services.[[Page S1017]]  Let me begin by talking about something that happened in Maryland during my first year in the U.I was elected in 2006. In 2007, in my very first year, we had a tragic situation that occurred a few miles from where we are right here, in Prince George's County, A youngster, 12 years of age, Deamonte Driver, died from a tooth problem. Let me give you the background on this because this is a very tragic situation. This is in the State of Maryland, one of the wealthiest States in one of the wealthiest nations.  Deamonte Driver's mother recognized that Deamonte Driver had pain in his mouth. She tried to get him to a dentist, but they had no insurance and no coverage. She couldn't get anyone to take care of her son. What was needed was an $80 tooth extraction. If he could have seen a dentist, that is exactly what would have happened. He couldn't get in because he had no insurance, and he fell through the cracks of our system. That tooth became abscessed, and it went into his brain. He went through two operations, hundreds of thousands of dollars of cost, and he lost his life.  That happened in my first year in the U.I vowed to do everything I could to make sure there were no more tragedies anywhere in America like Deamonte Driver's. Every child should be able to get access to oral health care. It is who we are as a nation. It is part of who we are, and it makes sense from the point of view of an efficient health care system.  I introduced legislation to provide pediatric dental care in this country. I worked with my colleague Elijah Cummings in the House of Representatives and with others here, and we were able to make some progress. Ultimately, we were able to get this as part of our national health policy in the Affordable Care It is now part of what is known as essential health services.  I start this debate on the floor of the U.Senate by saying that Price, the nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, is one of the leaders for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which would repeal essential health services, which would eliminate the right for all children in America to have pediatric dental care. So I then look at what Mr.Price would replace it with, and I am confused because I am not exactly sure what he would replace it with. I have looked at what he has done as a Member of the House, I have looked at what he has done as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I am not confident that we would maintain that type of guaranteed coverage for our children.  That is just one concrete example--one person--of why I am concerned about what would happen if we repealed the Affordable Care Act, and we don't know what is coming next.  The Affordable Care Act--30 million Americans now have affordable, quality health care as a result of the Affordable Care The repeal of that law would jeopardize those 30 million. In Maryland, the uninsured rate has gone down from over 12 percent to a little over 6 percent. We have cut our uninsured rate by about 50 percent. That is so important for so many different reasons. Yes, it is important for the 400,000 Marylanders who now have third-party coverage who didn't have third-party coverage before. They now can go see a doctor rather than using an emergency room. They don't have to wait if they have a medical condition; they can get care immediately. They can get access to preventive health care that keeps them healthy so they don't enter our health care system in a much more costly way.  Before the Affordable Care Act, these 400,000 people got their health care, but they didn't get it in the most cost-effective way. They used emergency rooms, which are very expensive. They didn't pay for their bills. They entered the health care system in a more acute way, using more health care services than they need, and they didn't pay their bills. As a result, we saw that those who had health insurance were paying more than they should because of those who did not have health insurance. That added to the cost, not just of those who didn't have the insurance but to all Maryland insured.  Mr.President, I see that the distinguished majority leader is on the floor. I will be glad to yield to him. I believe he has an announcement he wants to make.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Blunt).

4783,topic-id,2009,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes about the nomination of our congressional colleague, Congressman Tom Price, also known as Tom Price, to serve as our next Secretary for the Department of Health and Human When Senator Tester arrives on the floor, I will yield to him. I know he has reserved time. I will be happy to yield to him when he arrives.  But until then, I just want to make a couple of comments, if I could.  From the outset, my colleagues--our colleagues and I; not all, but a number of us--have had concerns, in some cases very grave concerns, about many of[[Page S1008]]President Trump's nominees. Having said that, a number of them have gotten overwhelming support from both Democrats and I checked as of sometime yesterday afternoon. There had been seven votes on nominees at that time. I think four of them had gotten overwhelming bipartisan support; three did not.  But from the outset, my colleagues and I have had grave concerns about many of President Trump's nominees. But we have a responsibility, I believe, to thoroughly consider every Cabinet nominee on the merits of his or her fitness to serve.  To evaluate Congressman Price's nomination, I looked--and a number of us have looked--at his career in the U.House of Representative, which I believe spans some six terms, which would be somewhere between 10 and 12 years. We did that in order to learn more about his guiding principles as a legislator.  All of us have guiding principles. I know the Presiding Officer, who has shared with me his guiding principles any number of times, but mine include trying to figure out what is the right thing to do--not the easy or expedient thing, but what is the right thing to do; to treat other people the way we want to be treated; three, to focus on excellence in everything we do. If it is not perfect, make it better. Four, when you know you are right, you are sure you are right, just don't give up. Those are sort of my guiding principles. I sometimes violate one or more every week. But I always know that I have them, and it is actually helpful to have sort of a compass to get me back on track.  But we wanted to learn more about the guiding principles for Congressman Price as we considered his nomination, his core values. During Congressman Price's time in the U.House of Representatives, he spearheaded efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which I regard as landmark health legislation that has provided 22 million Americans, including about 35,000 Delawareans with affordable, reliable, and comprehensive health insurance coverage.  Some people say: Well, is it perfect? No, it is not. No, it is not.  Well, I guess ever since Harry Truman was President, you had one President after the other, one administration after the other, bemoaning the fact that we had so many Americans who didn't have access to health care coverage.  So the question would be: Well, why don't you do something about it?  One of the things that we have done about it is to finally pass the Affordable Care Act, and I will talk more about that in a little bit.  Congressman Price has opposed the Affordable Care Act from day one, leading his colleagues in the House of Representatives to obstruct and sometimes undermine, first, the drafting of the law and, then, its implementation.  Instead of working with colleagues from both parties to offer improvements to the new law, he rallied against the need for essential benefits, such as contraception or mental health treatment or, frankly, access to medical procedures like colonoscopies, mammographies, prostate screenings--the kinds of things that, for individuals who are at risk of having colon cancer or breast cancer, if they had access to those kinds of screenings, could be detected earlier, with a lot of money saved, a lot of misery saved or avoided. In some cases, a loss of life is avoided as well.  Congressman Price introduced proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act, doubling down high deductible plans and high-risk pools, which have a failed history of inadequate funding, waiting lists, and annual or lifetime limits.  Over the past few months, our Republican colleagues have said loud and clear that they will repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Candidate Trump certainly said that many times during the campaign. When he was elected, he said that one of his major goals was to repeal the Affordable Care When he became President, it was the same message. But at the same time, we have heard from stakeholders across the health care sector about what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement. Plain and simple, doing nothing would unfurl chaos across the health care delivery system. The individual market, the marketplaces, the exchanges would collapse. Estimates project that more than 32 million Americans would become uninsured over the next decade. Health insurance premiums in the individual market would skyrocket, increasing by up to 25 percent immediately and doubling again by 2026.  From what I can tell, the cause to which Mr.Price has dedicated himself--and that is, repealing the Affordable Care Act with no plan to take its place--would devastate people's lives and our economy.  As we prepare to vote on his nomination, I think it is appropriate to remind our colleagues how we got here and the hard work that we did to approve a health care reform bill that is helping millions of people today.  I have a couple of charts that I would like for us to take a look at. We have on the right of this chart the United States of America, and on the left, we have Japan, a place I used to fly in and out of a lot when I was a naval flight officer during the Cold  One of the things that we learned a few years ago--6, 7, or 8 years ago--when we were debating what to do, if anything, in the last administration about extending health care coverage to a lot of Americans who didn't have it, we looked at countries around the world in the Finance Committee to see who was doing a better job and who was not. Among the interesting things that we found out about Japan was that they were spending about 8 percent of gross domestic product to provide health care coverage to the folks in their country--8 percent. In the United States, at the time, we were spending 18 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice of what they were spending in  Think about it: 8 percent of GDP to provide coverage and 18 percent of GDP in the United  You might say: Well, maybe that is because we were covering a lot more people in the United States than they cover in Well, as it turns out, just the opposite is true, because not only do they spend in Japan like half as much as a percentage of GDP as we do, but they actually get better results, lower rates of infant mortality, higher rates of longevity among adults, and they cover everybody. They cover everybody.  When the Affordable Care Act was adopted, we had somewhere between 40 and 50 million Americans who would go to bed at night without any health care coverage at all.  I like to say the Japanese are smart people, and they are good allies of ours, good customers of ours. They can't be that smart, and we cannot be that dumb.  So as we were going through the debate on the Affordable Care Act in the Finance Committee about 6 or 7 years ago, one of the things we did is to say: Well, let's look at some other countries and see if they are doing something that maybe we could learn from and maybe we could take to heart and sort of reshape our health care delivery system with that in mind.  One of the things they do really well in Japan is they provide good access to primary health care. If you happen to live in Japan, you don't have to go very far in your neighborhood to find a health care provider. It might be maybe someone like an RN, or it might be something like an advanced practice nurse and maybe a primary care doc, but they have easy access to primary health care.  What they like to do in Japan is to define problems and to address problems when they are small and when they can be treated. They focus a whole lot on prevention and wellness. That is a great lesson. If you look at the Affordable Care Act, that is a lesson that we learned and incorporated into that legislation.  The heading on this chart is this: The Affordable Care Act is a Republican plan. Why do I say that? Well, when you go back to 1993, we had a new President, Bill Clinton, and a new First Lady, Hillary She basically felt--and I think her husband did, too--that every President, every administration since maybe Truman, had been talking about the need to try to make sure a lot more Americans had access to health care--quality health care--but nobody could actually figure out how to do it.[[Page S1009]]  So Hillary Clinton began working in 1993 on health care, and people eventually called it HillaryCare--If my life depended on it, I could not explain the elements of HillaryCare, but I could explain the elements of the Republican alternative that was offered to it. It was introduced by a fellow named John Chafee, a Republican Senator from the State of Rhode Island, and it had a number of elements to it. So I just want to mention these five elements that were found in the Republican alternative in 1993 to  Senator Chafee's bill is the column right here. The next column over is called RomneyCare--right here. Farthest from me--my left, your right--is the Affordable Care  We will look at five different components. As to individual mandate, which of these proposals had the individual mandate and which did not? As to employer mandate, which of these proposals included the employer mandate and which did not?  There is the ban on preexisting conditions--the idea that insurance companies could not say: Oh, because you had breast cancer, because you had this or that--patient or health care--if someone needs health care but they have preexisting conditions, insurance companies can't say you can't get coverage because there was a ban included on that.  As to subsidies for purchasing health insurance, which of these had it and which did not?  And we are going to look at the idea of--we will call them exchanges--purchasing in bulk.  When we were debating the Affordable Care Act, people would say: Why do you want to do this?  I would say: Well, look at the Federal In the Federal Government, you have the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. If folks work as full-time employees, they can get access to health care. We get our coverage usually through private insurers. The Federal Government provides about 70 percent of the premium costs; the individuals provide about 30 percent of the premium cost. It is a large purchasing pool because we have over a million people in the Federal Government purchasing pool. We don't get free or cheap insurance, but it helps drive down the cost because you are buying health care coverage for a lot of people.  Somebody had a bright idea in 1993--John Chafee, I think, and the folks working with him, 20 Republican Senators and 3 Democrats, who said maybe we ought to give folks who don't have health care coverage the opportunity to buy their coverage in large group plans, much like we have in the Federal  I will just hit the pause button right there and stop my remarks for now and yield the floor to the Senator from  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS999-3.txt,179,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,9.0,February
4788,topic-id,3955,"Mr.President, I don't speak often on the floor, but it seems that whenever I do, you are the Presiding I have said this before, but you are a glutton for punishment. I thank you for your willingness to show up day after day.  I was going to talk a little bit about the Affordable Care Act as it relates to Congressman Price, who has been nominated to be Secretary for the Department of Health and Human  Before I do, I want to follow up on the comments of my friend Senator John Barrasso, who is the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee on which we both serve. He is the senior Republican, and I am pleased and really privileged to be the senior Democrat alongside him.  What I would just say in response is--if Senator Schumer were here, he would be perfectly capable of thinking for himself and defending himself, but I would say this: On the question of whether Judge Gorsuch will have a[[Page S1013]]hearing, I think he will have a hearing, and he should have a hearing. On the question of whether there will be a 60-vote margin--the last couple of people who have been confirmed for the Supreme Court, both Democrats, were confirmed by more than 60 votes.  I don't know Judge Gorsuch well, but I do know Merrick Garland pretty well, and I must say I am disappointed that he never got a hearing, although he was nominated by Barack Obama when there was almost 10 months remaining in President Obama's term. Not only did he not get a hearing, a lot of folks on the other side of the aisle couldn't find the time to meet with him, and he never had a vote--a 60-vote margin or even a simple majority, 51 votes.  For us to now hear it is important that Judge Gorsuch get a hearing and get an up-or-down vote, I just wish I had heard those voices here over the last year when a very good man was treated I think very badly--very badly. That was Merrick That is for another day, but I couldn't let the moment pass without saying anything.  Mr.President, to back up to about 30 minutes ago, I was talking about the Affordable Care Act, and I yielded to Senators Tester, Isakson, and Now I want to come back to where I was.  I am a I am proud to be a Democrat, a retired Navy Captain, and I went to graduate school, undergraduate at Ohio State, Navy ROTC, studied economics. After the Navy, after the Vietnam war, I moved from California to Delaware, got an MBA at the University of Delaware and studied some more economics and some other things in their MBA program. I became State treasurer, Congressman, Governor,  I have always been intrigued by how we harness market forces. How do we harness market forces for good public policy outcomes? You don't always hear Democrats say that, but that is the way I think. I think if we can find ways to harness market forces and achieve a good public policy outcome, that is a good thing. We ought to try to find them, and I think if we can, we can generate good bipartisan support for our ideas. At the end of the day, if it meets our goals, so be it.  I keep going back to 1993, which is when John Chafee, whom I knew--I was a Congressman then. Actually, in 1933, he introduced his own version of the Affordable Care Act, cosponsored, I think, by 20 other Republicans and maybe 3 Among the Republican cosponsors of John Chafee's legislation--which actually looks like the Affordable Care Act--were a couple of Republicans who are still here. One of them is the chairman of the Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch, and the other is the fellow on the Finance Committee who is actually senior in terms of the Finance Committee to Orrin, and that is Chuck They cosponsored the 1993 legislation that Chafee introduced.  I want to take just a moment and go through the five key provisions in Senator John Chafee's 1993 legislation. I will start here at the bottom of this chart.  One of the things we see in the Chafee legislation was the idea that folks who did not have access to health care and were not part of a large group plan would have an opportunity to have the benefit as we do in the Federal Government and, like half the people who get health care in the country, get coverage through a large group plan. So there would be a large group buying access to health care coverage for a lot of individual people who happen to be in that group; maybe they work for the same employer.  But Senator Chafee came up with a good idea, and the idea was that we might want to create in each State something called exchanges or marketplaces where people who didn't have coverage could find coverage and be part of a larger group and enjoy the benefits of being part of that larger group. I think they called them exchanges. They may have called them purchasing groups. But it was a 1993 idea.  He also said that folks who got their coverage through one of these exchanges or marketplaces in 1 of 50 States should get some help in buying down the cost of health care premiums if they are getting coverage through the exchange or the purchasing pool in their State, the marketplace, and we would call that a sliding scale tax credit. The lower the income of the person buying their health care coverage through the marketplace, the bigger the tax credit, and as a person's income goes up, the size of the tax credit goes down and eventually goes away. That was in Senator Chafee's legislation in 1993.  Also in Senator Chafee's legislation was something called an individual mandate, which basically said that under his proposal, people had to get coverage. You couldn't make somebody get coverage if they absolutely refused to, but the idea was to penalize people in one way or another, maybe with a fine or something like that, and say: If you don't get coverage, we can't force you to, but we are going to impose a fine or penalty on you, and over time, that fine or penalty will increase. Maybe eventually you will say: Well, I am paying this fine or this penalty, and it is going to be pretty expensive. Maybe I ought to get health care coverage to avoid the penalty. That is called the individual mandate.  Chafee's mandate was that employers of a certain size would be required to provide health care coverage for employees. It was a mandate, not for all employers but for a number of them when they reached a certain number of employees.  Then the fifth provision in the Chafee plan in 1993 was a ban on preexisting conditions. Some know that the Presiding Officer is a physician in his And a number of people in my State, I am sure in his State as well, lost coverage because they had a preexisting condition. Maybe they had coverage for a while, and they lost coverage or lost their job or something like that, and then they had a condition that could be a scare with colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer--you name it--and they eventually planned to sign up to get health care coverage, and because of the preexisting condition, they couldn't get it. So what Chafee said in his proposal to insurance companies was: You cannot refuse to provide coverage for someone because they have a preexisting condition.  The health insurance companies said: Well, if you are going to put that preexisting condition on us, then we have to have the individual mandate. In these State exchanges you are going to create, Senator Chafee, we have to make sure there are people in the purchasing pools in each of the States who are young and invincible, like our pages sitting here in front of me today--young, healthy. They just can't be people that are old and infirm and not well because they will consume a lot of health care costs. We need a mixed pool that is insurable so insurance companies can insure this pool for health care and not lose their shirts.  That was the long and short of it in the Republican plan from Senator Chafee, with some bipartisan support in 1993.  Mitt Romney became Governor of Massachusetts sometime after the turn of the century, and he was interested in running for He is a smart guy. Some of us know him, some better than others. But he is a very smart fellow. He is smart enough to know that if he wanted to run for President some day--and he did--one of the things he could do that could help bolster his chances was to be able to demonstrate after years and years of people talking about providing health care coverage to just about everyone in our country, he could actually say: We did this in our We actually provided coverage for just about everybody in Massachusetts who needed coverage. When he decided to do this, he was smart enough to go back to Senator Chafee's blueprint from the 1993 legislation.  It was a decade later that Mitt Romney became I say this as a recovering Governor myself: You are always looking for what works to see if it might be transferrable to your But he seized on Senator Chafee's proposal, and the similarities are pretty striking. Like the Chafee plan, RomneyCare--they call it RomneyCare--created these State exchanges, or purchasing pools, just as in Chafee's legislation. They had the sliding scale tax credits to help them buy coverage, buy their health insurance through the purchasing pool so people with a lower income could get a bigger tax credit, and as their income goes up, the credit gets smaller and smaller,[[Page S1014]]and then it finally phases out. That is what they did in  The third thing they had was a ban on preexisting conditions in If someone had a preexisting condition, the insurance company could not say: No, no coverage for you. They had to provide coverage. Just like insurers told Senator Chafee all those years ago in 1993; that if we are going to have to insure people because of preexisting conditions, you have to give us a pool of people to insure, that we can insure and not lose our shirts. That included individual mandates so we could have the young, the healthy in the pool, and at the same time call for the employer mandate so employers of a certain size had to ensure that their employees were getting health care coverage.  That was in the Romney plan. They launched it about a decade ago, and right off the bat it was warmly embraced by the people of They thought this could be cool. And it was good. It was the right thing to do. It might just work and be an example for the rest of the country. So they had a warm embrace and a good launch.  In the first couple of years, they did a good job in RomneyCare in covering a lot of people and reducing the number of people who did not have coverage. What they didn't do such a good job on, though, for the first several years, was on the affordability side.  Health care costs continued to rise in There were several reasons for that, one of which was the individual mandate. They had a fine. So if you happen to be young and maybe you didn't think you needed health care, you had to pay a fine if you were a certain age and didn't sign up. It was an increasing fine that went up over time. Eventually, people decided, Well, if I have to pay this fine, I might as well get health care coverage, but they didn't do it initially. They were negative in terms of coverage.  Eventually, in Massachusetts not only did they do a good job in increasing coverage, they actually did a pretty good job on affordability. One of the reasons is, they had a good mix of people in their pools and a fair amount of competition between health insurance companies and providers--competition.  Fast forward to 2009, the Affordable Care When the Affordable Care Act was reported out of committee to come here to the floor, what did it have? It had, 1, let's create these State large purchasing pools, State exchanges and marketplaces, and that is in Chafee's bill and in It had sliding scale tax credits to help buy down the cost of coverage in the exchanges and marketplaces. There was a ban on preexisting conditions, but insurers said: No, we can't insure the people you want us to, we will have to cover everybody, and those who have preexisting conditions, you have to make sure we have a good mix of people in the insurance pool.  So just like in Chafee and in RomneyCare, we had the individual mandate. You can't make people get coverage, but you can have an accelerating scale so people will eventually bite and get the coverage, and we also had the employer mandate. Not every employer but a certain size number of employers had to have--had to cover their employees.  It is kind of remarkable. I think if you talked to most people in this country, and you walked through this, they would be amazed to know that the Affordable Care Act, with these five major provisions, was actually stolen, plagiarized, from a Republican Senator, Chafee, in 1993; but from Governor Romney's proposal.  There is more to the Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of Medicaid coverage--not for everybody, but up to 135 percent or so of poverty, and the real focus on how do we move from a sick care system, where we just spend money on health care for people who are sick, why don't we spend some money to try and make sure people stay well, on prevention and wellness, early access to care, so folks can get a colonoscopy maybe before they come down with colon cancer or get a mammogram before breast cancer, those kinds of things.  One of the great things of the Affordable Care Act, little known to most people, is the idea that we need to collaborate in the delivery of health care so it is not just one hospital working by itself but maybe build a network of hospitals, and maybe with these, working with doctor groups, groups of doctors. The idea is to collaborate in the delivery of health care in ways that focus on wellness, prevention, and that is, I think, little noticed; the idea of better results for less money. I call it value, looking for value.  That is just a little bit of history, and I think it is worth looking at.  Could we look at the next one.  I have a pie chart I would like to share with everybody. I don't know if the Presiding Officer has seen this before. I have used it once or twice. This is a pie chart that has about 300 million people in it, and this represents the 300 million or so people in our country who have health care coverage. The blue represents those folks who get their coverage through their employer. It doesn't mean the employer pays for all the costs of their health care; the employer pays the majority, and maybe the employees pay some fraction or percentage of that coverage. Over half the people in the country today getting health care coverage are those in large group plans. If you look at what is going on with premium increases, and increases in copays and deductibles, my understanding is the premium increases for these folks--over half of the 300 million people in the pool--we actually compared premium increases before the ACA was adopted and the years after, and premiums still go up for these folks but not by as much as they had before the Affordable Care Act was adopted.  So that is how most people get their coverage here.  Next, about--let's see, this green area right here, it has anywhere between 15 and 20 percent of people who get health care coverage in this country, they are in Medicare, the 65 and over or totally disabled, unable to work, and qualify for Medicare because of that. One of the little known things about the Affordable Care Act is that the Medicare trust fund had been running out of money for quite a while, and the date at which it eventually runs out of money and will not be able to provide coverage can continue to get closer and closer. One of the benefits, little known or noted in the Affordable Care Act, is that since it was adopted, the life of the Medicare trust fund has been extended by 12 years. After coming down for years and years and years, the life of the Medicare trust fund has been extended by 12 years. Medicare people, they don't buy their coverage on the exchanges, but a lot of people can still use fee-for-service. Maybe it works for some people. I don't know if it is the best way to get good coverage for an affordable price, but we have seen a migration to what is called Medicare I think it is like managed care with a heart and a head, and now about one-third of the folks on Medicare get that coverage. Fifteen to twenty percent of the people get their coverage in this big 300 million-person pie chart from About 20 to 25 percent of the people who are getting health care coverage in the country today get their coverage through Believe it or not, it is not mostly part families or women with children, it is mostly people--maybe like our parents or grandparents who are in nursing homes, a lot of them with dementia. They spend down their resources and they end up going to nursing homes, and Medicaid pays to help keep them alive and cared for, and that is anywhere from 20 to 22 percent.  The States previously--virtually every State has a Medicaid plan, but one of the things we did with the Affordable Care Act was to say we want to encourage States to cover not just up to 100 percent of poverty but maybe up to 135 percent of poverty. The Federal Government will pay about 90 percent of that, and maybe someday less than that, but we want more people to be covered through Medicaid, which is actually more cost-effective than the purchasing pools I talked about earlier.  So we have 300 million people getting health care coverage. The lion's share of them--over 55 percent--get coverage from large group plans. About 22, 25 percent is Medicaid, about 15 to 20 percent Medicare, and what is left is about roughly 6 percent or so, they get their coverage through the exchanges, through the marketplaces.  When our Republican friends and others criticize the marketplaces and the sliding scale tax credits and the individual mandates, the employer mandate, and maybe the ban on preexisting[[Page S1015]]conditions, what they are criticizing is right here, a very small portion of the pie, the heart and soul of what was proposed by Senator Chafee in 1993 and the heart and soul of what was in RomneyCare in Massachusetts a decade later. There is a certain irony there not lost on me and I know not on others.  Can we do some things to improve the delivery of health care among all of these groups? Can we do it where it covers more people and does it in a more cost-effective way? Sure we can. But the idea of sort of getting rid of this--getting rid of particularly the piece down here and a lot of the other provisions that are represented in this pie chart, I don't think that makes a lot of sense.  A friend of mine is a firefighter. We work out in Wilmington at the YMCA before I jump on a train and come to work. We were talking not long ago about a situation you have with a building that is on fire, and the people are up in the tall building and maybe can't get down to the elevators, and they rush to the windows to look out to see if there is anybody down there. The firefighters are outside the building that is on fire, and they are yelling with a bull horn up to the folks on the fourth and fifth floors: Go ahead and jump. We will catch you. But the people who are being asked to jump notice that the firefighters don't have any nets.  The idea of health care coverage where we are actually covering a lot more people, and to say we are going to pull that away from you for 20 million, 30 million more people, and don't worry, somewhere down the line--a year or 2 or 3 years from now--we will provide the nets to catch you, I think that makes no sense--no sense.  We got this far, so maybe one more chart.  Who gets hurt by repealing the Affordable Care Act?  I will just say this and then close, I say to my friend from  The answer is everyone. We do not have a lot of rural space in I know we have a lot in Louisiana and quite a bit in But folks who get their coverage from the rural hospitals, whether it is in Delaware, Maryland, Delmarva, whether it is in Louisiana, the rural hospitals, they are going to get clobbered if we repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away the Medicaid expansion, take away the marketplaces. They will get clobbered and a lot of them will close. The federally qualified community health centers, they are going to get clobbered, and they provide coverage for 10 million people in our country.  When people are denied coverage in those rural hospitals or suburban, urban hospitals or the federally qualified community health centers, where people don't get coverage there, they will get health care somewhere, and it may be going to an emergency room at a hospital, getting really sick and having to get admitted and then spend a lot of money. Where does the money come from? From those of us who use the health care system, who are paying premiums and our employers are paying premiums. The costs are really absorbed by the hospitals themselves. It makes not a lot of sense.  The person in the House who has been really in the forefront of repealing the Affordable Care Act is the person that Donald Trump has now named to be our Secretary of Health and Human The idea of having a new Secretary overseeing the Department of Health and Human Services, someone who is trying to run this program and oversee it and make sure that it works in a way that provides more coverage at an affordable price, is actually a person who has been trying to kill it for as long as he has been in the House of Some people may not be concerned or upset about that, but I am. I think that before we put that person in charge in that job, we need to remember some of the lessons I just shared with folks here today. For these reasons, I cannot support the nomination.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS999-3.txt,179,TITLE X FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD,2017.0,9.0,February

4655,topic-id,3072,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the nomination of Steve Mnuchin to be Secretary of the Treasury and the concerns I have about his nomination.  I want to start with a Pennsylvania story. It is a story we wish we didn't have to highlight, but it is relevant to the discussion and debate on this nomination.  I am looking at a document that is a written summary of a television investigative news report from January of this year. It is from the Pittsburgh television station WTAE, and it is dated January 16, 2017. The headline on the document is ``Trump Pick for Treasury Secretary Foreclosed on Hundreds of Homeowners in Western Pennsylvania.'' The article says in pertinent part about this one Pennsylvanian:       Nellie Mlinek lost her husband to cancer. She lost her son      to an overdose. And then she lost her home to OneWest  It goes on to describe the interaction between this individual and the bank, and of course this is the bank of which Steve Mnuchin was a part owner.  I also want to read what she said about the circumstance she was in. She was hoping that because of the circumstances with regard to her home, that she would be able to work with the bank instead of having foreclosure. That was not to be.  The article goes on to talk about others in the region who had foreclosures as well. A house in White Oak, PA, was foreclosed in 2014; a house in North Versailles was foreclosed in 2013; a house in Penn Hills in 2012; a Pittsburgh house was foreclosed in 2011. These are all communities in Allegheny County, Southwestern Pennsylvania, and Nellie was from Westmoreland County, which is just to the east of Allegheny So that is what the article summarizes--foreclosures throughout a corner of Southwestern Pennsylvania, as the headline says, hundreds of foreclosures.  The article starts with this line: ``Critics say President-elect Donald Trump's pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, ran a foreclosure machine at a major bank,'' and it goes on from there. That is one in Pennsylvania, and then references to foreclosures that I read from are summaries of what happened to some others.  Then we go to the other end of the This is in Southeastern Pennsylvania, the region within which Philadelphia sits. In this case, the individual is Ruth Ruth is from South Philadelphia, and she remembers the day she got the letter that ``scared me to death.'' The letter threatened a foreclosure because of a reverse mortgage that she didn't know existed. The headline of this article is ``Reverse-mortgage nightmare can start after borrower dies.''  In this case, Ruth lost her husband. The article says that this particular piece of mail in October 2013 was from OneWest Bank, informing Ruth that it was foreclosing on the house in the 2800 block of South Hutchinson Street that she and her late husband had bought in 2006 for $200,000. Without her knowledge, Ruth Guerriero said, her husband, 23 years her senior, had taken out a reverse mortgage in September 2007. It goes on from there.  So anyone who has had that experience of losing a home or becoming the victim of a reverse mortgage when you didn't have prior knowledge can relate to what has happened to these individuals. This is part of the debate. These are not the only considerations we weigh, but when you have, in this case, a nominee for Treasury Secretary who comes into the nomination process not having held public office or not having held appointed government office, this is part of the record you are to review. It is really the only record--the record in this case as a banker or a businessperson, and in his case, his work on Wall  I had the opportunity, of course, as a member of the Finance Committee, to meet Mr.Mnuchin in my office and to question him more than once in the question period for the Finance In our meeting, I asked him, for example--and these are other relevant questions in terms of presenting accurate information, presenting information that will fully answer questions--I asked him how many times his financial institution chose to modify mortgages as opposed to foreclosing, and he told me that there were about 100,000 mortgage modifications. Yet we[[Page S1114]]know the documented evidence tells a different story; it is about one-third that number, closer to 35,000 modifications.  I realize that someone could not remember the exact number, but I was surprised at how far off he was in something so substantial in someone's life, whether it was a person like Nellie or other individuals. A mortgage foreclosure, as opposed to a modification, which is a better result for an individual or family--that is a substantial difference in their lives. And I would hope that when you are in any way involved in a foreclosure, as a banker or as a part of an entity that is foreclosing, that you would carefully weigh the consequences before you choose to pursue foreclosure or pursue a different path, the path of modification, which, of course, everyone would prefer in that circumstance.  I asked Steve Mnuchin how many Americans his bank had foreclosed on during the financial crisis, and he has yet to provide an answer to that question. I know others may have asked a similar question, and I wonder if they got an answer. We will see what the public record shows.  Mr.Mnuchin was also asked to provide a copy of a letter he said he sent to the Department of Housing and Urban Development raising concerns about the impact of the company's reverse mortgage guidance. It was almost a month ago that we asked for that information to be produced, that letter, and we still haven't seen it. So I wonder about the statement he made with regard to information from  I also asked Mr.Mnuchin whether his financial institution engaged in the predatory practice of so-called robo-signing, and this is a question which was asked by a couple of I asked him for that information, and he said that wasn't the case. But now we know from the documented evidence in an answer that he later changed that there was robo-signing taking place at the time we alleged that it did.  So when you ask a question in a hearing and you get an answer that was wrong or incomplete or misleading or otherwise, that is one thing. You could sometimes have a circumstance where someone didn't intentionally want to mislead or tell a lie, or they may have answered a question imprecisely or without a lot of information. But I think it is a little different when you ask a question in writing, where the individual had the time to analyze a question and provide an answer in writing with some time to reflect, some time to consult some other sources of information before they draft their answer and then submit it to you as part of the nomination process. In this case, Mr.Mnuchin had a different answer than the facts showed, and I will go through that a little bit later.  At some level, there is a question of accuracy, maybe even rising to the level of trust, and that is something we have to consider when we are making a determination about a nominee, because almost any Cabinet agency has to transmit information, very specific, detailed information. People have to be able to rely upon the information, the accuracy of it and the completeness of it. And if he has had problems in his nomination process, that causes us to raise some real questions.  I wanted to start with OneWest Bank--another entity called Financial I don't know how far we will get into this in the limited time we have. In 2009, Mr.Mnuchin and his business partners bought OneWest Bank at the height of the financial crisis for $1.6 billion, paying about 5 cents on the dollar for the bank's assets. Mr.Mnuchin was able to buy the bank at such a significant discount in part because he was entrusted to modify as many home mortgages as possible so homeowners could stay in their homes. He foreclosed on more than--I should say OneWest Bank foreclosed on more than 40,000 Americans, so we are told.  We don't know how many foreclosures they engaged in in Pennsylvania, but, as I read a couple moments ago from an investigative report from WTAE, it is at least hundreds in one region of the We have 67 counties. Depending on where you draw the line, Southwestern Pennsylvania is 10 counties, 12 counties, somewhere in that range, maybe as high as 15 if you went as far north as Let's say it is 15 counties. Hundreds of foreclosures in that region is substantial.  Later, after all of those thousands of foreclosures across the country, Mr.Mnuchin sold OneWest Bank for $3.4 billion in 2015. The sale itself yielded the group of individuals, including Mr.Mnuchin, billions of dollars--that would be Mr.Mnuchin and also investors.  I mentioned the foreclosures before and the individuals involved. I wanted to go a little deeper into the particular circumstances.  I mentioned and highlighted Nellie's story. Here is what took place in that circumstance--or what she had hoped would take place. Nellie was hoping that she would be able to work something out with the bank, so she asked OneWest to help her keep the house by adjusting her payment. That often happens when a bank initiates a foreclosure. It begins a process but works something out with a homeowner, and that would be called a modification. In this case, Nellie asked OneWest to help her keep her house by adjusting her payment, but she said the bank refused and then foreclosed on her. She said: ``They should have worked with me to meet a payment that I could make.'' She filed for bankruptcy, but even that did not save her house. She said it cost her ``a lot of depression.'' That is what Nellie said about her own circumstances, and I mentioned the other communities in Western  That is the reality foreclosure brings to bear on the life of one individual who is struggling, who, in Nellie's case, has had a series of setbacks, deeply personal, tragic circumstances compounded by the foreclosure. The same is true of Ruth in South Philadelphia, in terms of the impact of that decision. We have a lot of ways to summarize information like this, and I will just highlight maybe one or two.  For example, according to the National Consumer Law Center, in March of 2012, a Philadelphia senior citizen with a reverse mortgage from a wing of Mr.Mnuchin's bank--in this case, the name of the entity was Financial Freedom--sought assistance because he had been served with a preforeclosure notice. The reverse mortgage company owned by Mr.Mnuchin gave this individual 30 days to pay almost $5,000.  What was the bill for? Well, without his knowing it, Financial Freedom charged him over $2,000 for forced-placed insurance coverage from 2010 to 2012. Financial Freedom threatened to go forward with the foreclosure unless this senior citizen made immediate monthly payments equal to almost 35 percent of his monthly income. With legal assistance, those payments were reduced.  I would hope you would not need to hire a lawyer to get those payments reduced, but sometimes when you are up against a powerful financial institution, that is the only way to proceed.  Instead of immediately informing this senior citizen of his lapsed coverage, Financial Freedom charged excessive amounts for forced-placed coverage. Financial Freedom then waited 2 years to begin collection, but it expected this senior, who was living on a fixed income, to pay within 30 days. Financial Freedom also did not tell this senior citizen he could apply for a longer repayment plan due to his low income.  According to the National Consumer Law Center, in 2015, Financial Freedom notified a Pennsylvania reverse mortgage holder's heirs that the only way to avoid foreclosure on the family home was by repaying the loan balance or selling the property for at least 95 percent of its appraised value. They said the appraised value for the Pennsylvania home was $170,000, even though their own appraisal of the property just one month earlier was $67,000. There is a big difference between $170,000 and $67,000. It seems that $170,000 was the appraised value at loan origination, way back in 2007. Now, of course, it is years later, and that was, of course, before the market collapsed. So for the purposes of preforeclosure notice, Financial Freedom used an appraisal over $100,000 more than the actual value of the home. They were trying to force the heirs to pay more than $100,000 above the home's value to prevent foreclosure of the family home.  So these are a couple of Pennsylvania stories--Ruth and Nellie and then some others, whose names aren't in the text of my remarks, but give similar stories about some of the foreclosure practices[[Page S1115]]that Mr.Mnuchin was part of when he had these individual banks.  Here is the question on robo-signing that I mentioned earlier. I submitted a question for the record in writing and gave it to him, and here is what his response was to the question. The question was this:       One of the most significant scandals during the financial      crisis was the practice of ``robo-signing'' whereby bank      employees rapidly approved foreclosure documents without      thorough review. Many were wrongfully foreclosed upon on      account of these practices. Did OneWest Bank ``robo sign''      documents relating to foreclosures and evictions?  His response was pretty shocking:       OneWest Bank did not robo-sign documents, and as the only      bank to successfully complete the independent foreclosure      review required by Federal banking regulators to investigate      allegations of robo-signing, I am proud of our institution's      extremely low error rate.  The reason I say that it was a shocking answer is because he had signed his name to a 2011 document that found that OneWest Bank did, in fact, robo-sign. The findings from the Office of Thrift Supervision does not explicitly state robo-signing--that is not a legal term of art--but it does set forth a fact pattern for robo-signing, which involves an employee signing foreclosure documents without reviewing them. Instead of reviewing the details of each, robo-signers assume the paperwork is correct and sign it automatically. Almost anyone who lived through the financial crisis of 2008 knows what robo-signing is, and many were victims of this practice.  So that is a problem, obviously, when you answer a question in a manner that is totally inconsistent with the facts.  I know I am low on time, and I want to wrap up. What I will do for the record--or if we have time to come back later--is to get into some other issues. But one of the real concerns I have about his nomination is not just his record as a banker, as a person working on Wall Street and working in that world. It is one thing to say you did something in your prior life, but once you put on the mantle of public service and the heavy responsibilities of Treasury Secretary, you set aside that other work you did or that other position you had, maybe, on some issues. But, apparently, some of his work--or at least some of his points of view--will continue in the Treasury Department, because I think it is pretty clear, based upon some reporting back at the end of November, that Mr.Mnuchin believes that one of his prime responsibilities is to begin to dismantle, or substantially alter, what we know as the Dodd-Frank legislation.  We know what happened prior to that. We know what happened to the economy. We know that the United States lost about $19 trillion in household wealth. That is $19 trillion, with a ``t.'' More than 8 million jobs--by one estimate, 8.7 million jobs--were lost. So I would hope that as Treasury Secretary, were he to be confirmed, he would make sure that we never go down that path again--that before you dismantle Dodd-Frank, you better think about the consequences to real people's lives.  So I will wrap up because I know we have to go, but I will put more information in the  Let me conclude with one thought before we move on. One of the concerns I have about his nomination, also, is not something you can point to in a document. It is just a gut instinct or a judgment that I have made, and it is a judgment that can be summarized this way: I have a real concern about his commitment to public service. Why do I say that? It seemed that, in this whole process of disclosing financial information--turning over documents, answering questions, answering follow-up questions--Mr.Mnuchin was kind of resistant to scrutiny or seemed to be burdened by this, and that somehow he was disclosing too much. His demeanor, when you would ask him some questions, appeared to me to be a demeanor that was not consistent with what public service must be about. When you are in public service, whether you are elected or appointed, you are, in fact, a servant. You don't work for a bank, you don't work for a financial institution, and you don't work for a company. You don't even work for a You work for the people.  I was taught a long time ago that the closer you can get to this ideal--which is inscribed on a building in our State capitol in Harrisburg: ``All public service is a trust, given in faith and accepted in honor''--the way you accept your public duties is not only to disclose what you should disclose, to answer questions which you must answer, but to do it in a manner where you are doing it with a belief that you are a public servant and with the spirit of public service. If you are labored and if you are chafing under that or resisting, you should probably do something else with your life.  I hope I am wrong about that. I hope once he is in office--and it appears that he may be confirmed--and if he is confirmed, we see a different approach to the duties of public service and the burdens of public service. I hope I am wrong about him, but my instincts tell me otherwise.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from New  ",CREC-2017-02-13-pt1-PgS1095-5.txt,1828,1215,2017.0,13.0,February
4778,topic-id,1866,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the nomination of Tom Price to be the next Secretary of Health and Human  I wish to start this afternoon with a couple of names--just five, and I will use just first names--five Pennsylvanians whom I will refer to in my remarks. I am certain I will get to the first two, and I hope to get to all five. First is Anthony; second is Rowan; third is Rebecca; and fourth and fifth are Hannah and Madeline, two sisters whose story inspired me and continues to inspire me today. I will start with Anthony because I think his circumstance and that of his family are good reminders of how important the Medicaid program is to families across the country.  Anthony's mom wrote us a letter. I will read pertinent parts of it to summarize his circumstance. His mom writes in the opening part of the letter:       My son, Anthony, was born at 25 weeks and he weighed one      tiny pound. We were overcome with medical bills which      Medicaid thankfully paid for us. Since his birth he has had      multiple health crisis, seizures, sleep disorders just to      name a few.       Most recently, Anthony was diagnosed with Autism spectrum      disorder, Tourette's syndrome, severe obsessive compulsive      disorder, and  All of those in the life of one young boy--  She says:       Last spring, we were faced with the decision of putting him      in a residential treatment program. If not for his Medical      Assistance--  The name of the program for Medicaid in Pennsylvania--     this would have never been an option for us.  In other words, they wouldn't be able to get him into a residential treatment program. Ultimately, Anthony's family chose to get him intensive outpatient treatment, which Medical Assistance also covered. Anthony's mom Corey ultimately decided to stay home and care for Anthony, so she had to leave the job at which she had worked for 20 years. She said:       If we lost coverage, we would not be able to provide the      support he needs. We are sure of that.  Toward the end of the letter, she says:       My son Anthony is currently attending school almost      regularly and functioning the best he has for a very long      time thanks to the services he received from his medical      assistance. It gives me hope and encouragement that he will      someday grow up to be a contributing member of our next      generation.  That is Anthony's story of all of the benefits he and his family have derived from Medicaid or, as we call it in Pennsylvania, the Medical Assistance program.  The second Pennsylvanian I will talk about is I spoke about Rowan on the floor just a number of days ago. I am quoting from Rowan's mom's letter. Pamela wrote:       Rowan was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in March      of 2015.       He was extremely hyperactive and since he refused to nap,      he was a severe distraction. I cannot stress enough that we      had zero other options for our family. For months, I would      receive calls about Rowan being aggressive to other children.      This broke my heart. No parent wants to hear that their child      is hurting other children.       Late January 2016, I applied for Medicaid [Medical      Assistance]. After Rowan was awarded MA, we were able to      obtain wrap-around services.  Then she talks about a behavioral specialist consultant, a therapeutic staff support worker, and all the help that came with those individuals.       Specifically she helped to alleviate his aggression and      combat his over-stimulation. The wrap-around services have      been a  Ultimately, Rowan benefited from a social skills program.       This program is a social skills program specifically for      Autistic children ages 3-21. I enrolled Rowan in      Rowan has benefited immensely from [this program]. Thankfully      it is covered in full by  Then she concludes, in part:       Our family would be bankrupt or my son would go without      therapies he sincerely needs.       Overall, we are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical      Assistance and would be devastated if we lost these benefits.  So we have two young boys in Their stories are told by their moms, and they are telling us: Don't cut Don't destroy Medicaid, as some proposals have been not just debated here in Washington, not just theorized about; these are policies that Members of Congress have voted in favor of.  But now it is a little different. Now it is not just voting in favor of so-called block-granting--a very benign term, ``block-granting.'' I would rather use the word ``destroy,'' but we can debate that. This is a live issue now because we have people who are still proposing block-granting, and we have a President who--at least one member of his administration said he would sign such legislation or at least support it. That gets to the point of my basic disagreement with what Representative Price has not only supported but led the fight on in the House of  I disagree totally with his budget proposals to block-grant Medicaid for the reasons that I just outlined--because of Rowan and Anthony and lots of children in Pennsylvania like them, children with disabilities, children who happen to come from low-income families, seniors who want to get into nursing homes. All of those concerns are uppermost when I consider his nomination.  What I was hoping he would say to me in our meeting in my office--a very cordial meeting where we debated a little bit--and then after my questions to him both in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and the Finance Committee, the committee from which his nomination originated--I was hoping he would say: I was for block-granting Medicaid and changing Medicare and making all those proposals as a House Member, as a leader in the debate about the budget. But I am going to be in different place now, and I am not going to push those ideas. I am going to have a different position, and we are not going to go in the direction of doing that any longer, so I want to separate from what I was proposing as a Member of the I have no assurances that his advocacy or position on these issues will be any different.  Now we have the administration embracing the very issues that in the campaign the candidate said he was against. The Presidential candidate said that he wouldn't touch Medicare; he wouldn't touch You know the statements I am referring to.  When we talk about Medicaid and why it is such an important issue in this confirmation process, what are we talking about? In addition to Rowan and Anthony and children like that, we are also talking about the fact that 45 percent of all the births in the United States of America are paid for by A lot of people don't know that, but that is the truth. One in five seniors receives Medicare assistance through That is one of the reasons so many seniors are concerned about not just what happens to Medicare, but what happens to  Another reason for seniors to be concerned: Two-thirds of nursing home residents are covered by So when we talk about block-granting, which leads to massive cuts to Medicaid, we had better be concerned about it because it means nursing home residents are adversely affected.  Medicaid covers 40 percent of all the children in the country with health care--40 percent. For poor children, 75 percent get their health care through Medicaid, and 60 percent of all children with disabilities are covered by Medicaid--60 percent.  How about if you live in a rural area? Let me give a sense of what the circumstance is for We have 67 counties, 48 of them are rural, and a lot of people in those communities are covered by By one recent estimate, more than 278,000 rural Pennsylvanians are covered by We know that hospitals in rural areas depend upon In 15 rural Pennsylvania counties, hospitals were the top employer. Guess what program supports those programs, keeps the doors open: Medicaid.[[Page S1004]]  On and on, we could talk about job loss that results from cutting So if we are serious about helping children with disabilities and protecting seniors, we should think long and hard before voting for the block-granting of  One final point just with regard to Pennsylvania  If Medicaid were to be block-granted, as many legislators have supported and voted for, if that happens and if the Affordable Care Act were repealed without a replacement, Pennsylvania alone--one State--would lose $80 billion over 10 years. This is a 38-percent reduction in funding for I am going to fight anyone who tries to take $80 billion away from Pennsylvania for health care.  I would hope that if Representative Price were confirmed, he would abandon those reckless, extreme ideas to block-grant Medicaid because of the consequences for seniors, for children, and for individuals with disabilities.  I don't have a chance to get too far into Medicare today. If I can, I will a little later. I will try to come back to some of the stories people have written to us about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on their lives.  Let me quickly go through some points about We know that in a State like ours, one of the oldest States in the country, about 2\1/2\ million Pennsylvanians rely on Medicare to help them pay for health care costs. Thank goodness we have Medicare in place. What we would not want to have happen in Pennsylvania is the enactment--and as I said before with regard to Medicaid, now this is a live issue. You have Senators and House Members in both Chambers who have already voted for budgets that would do the following: change Medicare into a premium support program or a voucher program, which means basically you give seniors a fixed amount of money to buy their insurance and then say: Good luck buying your own insurance, buying your Medicare insurance.  I don't think there are very many people in my home State who think that is a good idea.  Of course, none of this has been on the table because these budget votes go by and people vote for the budget, and then it doesn't go any further, so no one feels the urgency to oppose it. Now we have, apparently, people in both Houses in agreement with President Trump to have him sign legislation which would change both Medicare and  I think these are among the many reasons why I would vote against Representative Price in his confirmation vote. After a lot of review of his record, after a lot of review on what his proposals would mean if they were to become law--and now we are at a point in our history where these issues are no longer theoretical; they are live issues. These are matters that could be the subject not just of debate but the subject of enactment into law.  I will try to return later to go through some other issues with regard to the nomination.  At this time, I will yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

4782,topic-id,1883,"Mr.President, let me pick up from where I left off earlier in my discussion of some of the issues that Representative Price, the nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, advocated for as a Member of the House, as a leader on the Budget These are issues I continue to be concerned about with regard to his nomination.  With regard to Medicare--I left off with a few comments about Here are some of the concerns that have been stressed by major senior organizations with regard to some of the Medicare proposals in  In a letter to President Trump, AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said:       The average senior, with an annual income of under $25,000      and already spending one out of every six dollars on health      care, counts on Social Security for the majority of their      income and on Medicare for access to affordable health      coverage.       Unfortunately, some congressional leaders have discussed      plans to use the health care debate to fundamentally change      the Medicare program and undermine the contract made with      generations of       Proposals creating a defined contribution premium-support      program; restricting access by raising the age of      eligibility; or allowing hospitals and providers to      arbitrarily charge customers higher prices than Medicare; all      betray the promise made to older Americans who have paid into      Medicare their entire working lives.  She goes on to say:       Indeed, these proposals do little to actually lower the      cost of health care. Rather, they simply shift costs from      Medicare onto individuals--many of whom cannot afford to pay      more for their care.  So says the leader of  So that is one of the reasons why the proposals that Representative Price has supported become front-and-center concerns in his nomination. I will move next to a consideration of Representative Price's record on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care If you go back to 2009, before we passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, over 50 million Americans were uninsured in 2009. People with any sort of medical condition were routinely denied health insurance or they were charged exorbitant rates because of their health history. Women were routinely charged more than men for their health insurance. Third, sick individuals were routinely dropped from their health care coverage because they had reached arbitrary caps on the amount of care an insurer would pay for in a given year. Of course, in 2010, the Affordable Care Act was passed.  Now we can say that 20 million Americans have health care coverage, and that includes 1 million more Pennsylvanians who have health care coverage because of that legislation. And 105 million Americans are protected from discrimination due to preexisting conditions. Over 9 million Americans are receiving tax credits to help them cover health insurance premiums, and 11 million seniors have saved over $23 billion from closing the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan doughnut hole. Pennsylvania hospitals, because of the Affordable Care Act, have saved over $680 million due to reductions in uncompensated care.  I would add to this that all those Americans, by one estimate as many as 156 million Americans--there is another estimate that is even higher than that; but at least 156 million Americans--with employer-sponsored coverage have a long list of protections against being denied coverage for a preexisting condition, against annual or lifetime limits, against discrimination against women because they happen to be women.  All of those protections are in place now for more than 156 million Americans because of the Affordable Care Yet, despite all of those gains that[[Page S1007]]have been realized in only a few short years, Representative Tom Price opposes the law.  In fact, he wants to repeal it. Rather than working with us to improve it, he has proposed a replacement that would strip away many of those critical protections. Again, they are not only protections for people who are newly insured but protections that are in place now that were not there for more than 156 million Americans with employer-sponsored coverage.  So I get letters from constituents concerned about his record or concerned about the direction that he would take the Department of Health and Human Services or the direction that the Trump administration would go. Now apparently, after the election, after inauguration day, the administration is supporting block-granting of Medicaid and supporting changing Medicare as we know it.  That is why we get letters from individuals across our I mentioned before that we have 48 rural counties in There are a lot of people--literally, several million people; 3.5 million by one estimate--living in rural counties in Pennsylvania, in rural communities.  I have a letter from That was one of the names I outlined at the beginning of my remarks earlier today. Here is what Rebecca said:  The Affordable Care Act allowed my husband to join me on the dairy farm where I worked for 8 years and am co-owner of the herd. Over the past 3 years, we have straightened out our finances and have gotten our student loan debt under control. Third, we have opened an IRA to plan for our retirement.  We live in a small trailer. We own one car. We shop at discount grocery stores and local Mennonite food stands. We have worked hard for financial stability. Over the past year we have begun discussions about having a child and starting our own business. Threats to the ACA are threats to our future, Senator, and to the future of small businesses, agriculture, and families.  She goes on from there to tell her story.  So that is Rebecca, who has some experience, not just in rural Pennsylvania but experience as a dairy farmer, trying to start a family, and trying to start even more of a business career. So that is another example of what we are hearing from people across  I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks Hannah and Hannah and Madeline are the daughters of Stacie She is from Manheim, She is the mom of four children, including Hannah and They happen to be twins. I met them way back, I guess, in 2009. At the time Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed with a rare and dangerous type of leukemia when they were just 4 years old.  Stacie and her husband went bankrupt trying to pay their daughters' medical bills. She wrote to me at that time--just around 2009--saying that, without health care reform ``my girls will be unable to afford care, that is if they are eligible, for care that is critically necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and rejected because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child.''  So said Stacie Ritter about her daughters, pleading with me at the time, as the Senator who would vote on the Affordable Care I just met with Stacie again. She is very glad that we passed the Affordable Care Act so that her daughters could have the health care that they need. Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. Hannah and Madeline are healthy young women now. They are freshmen at Arcadia University, and they are doing well. The Affordable Care Act protects them by ensuring they will have access to affordable coverage, whether on their parent's plan or on a plan on the individual market.  So when we talk about that legislation, when we talk about Medicaid, when we talk about Medicare--all of those issues--one of my basic points is that Representative Price, were he to be Health and Human Services Secretary Price, has to have an answer for those He can ignore the questions of Members of Congress, and sometimes he has done that. We don't have time to get into that today, but he has done that in the confirmation process.  But he has to have an answer for Stacie He has to have an answer for her daughters Madeline and He cannot ignore them and their health care needs. He has to have an answer for Rebecca, who is worried about what will happen to her, whether she will still be able to have a dairy farm, whether she will be able to have a family. He has to have an answer for Rebecca in  He also has to have an answer for the two families whom I cited at the beginning--for Anthony and Rowan's family, two young boys on the autism spectrum who need the services of  So this is not theory any longer. This is not some idea that is floating around These are real lives that will be destroyed by some of these proposals. So if you block-grant Medicaid, you are going to destroy a lot of lives. If you change Medicare as we know it, and turn it into a voucher program, ripping away the guaranteed benefit of Medicare, you are going to hurt a lot of people. If you choose to vote for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and you have no plan to replace it--after 7 years of complaining about it, criticizing it, and finger-pointing, and you don't have a replacement for it--you are going to hurt a lot of lives.  So this is not some debate that is not connected directly to people's lives. This is real life for those families. I have real concerns about them if Representative Price's view of the world or his proposals that he advocated for vigorously in the House of Representatives were to become law. Apparently, now his ideas have been embraced totally by the Trump administration.  Let me finish with this one point about Representative There are questions that remain surrounding Representative Price's stock deals. He told both the Finance and HELP Committees that the discounted shares of Innate Immunotherapeutics that he was able to purchase were available to every individual who was an investor.  But the Wall Street Journal reported not too long ago the following. I will just read one line from the story. The headline says:       Tom Price Got Privileged, Discounted Offer on      Biomedical Stock, Company  Here is what it says in the third paragraph:       In fact, the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.     investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares      of the company--an opportunity that, for Mr.Price, arose      from an invitation from a company director and a fellow       So says the Wall Street Journal story of earlier this month. So that is on the public record, based upon what the Wall Street Journal reported.  I, at the time, joined other Democrats on the Finance Committee to try and get this clarified. That request was denied. When we talk about the constitutional obligations to advise and consent--the Senate advising and consenting with regard to Cabinet nominations--we are not talking about a rubberstamp. We are not talking about some kind of automatic approval. We are talking about scrutiny, review, and getting answers to questions and having a long debate about someone's qualifications.  When you don't get clarified issues that have been raised and validated by news organization like the Wall Street Journal, I think we have more questions to have answered. It is a constitutional requirement--advise and consent--that needs to be honored.  For these and many reasons, I remain opposed to the nomination of Representative Price to be the next Secretary of Health and Human  With that, I yield the floor.

Eventually, she became the Senator's executive assistant, working alongside him every day until his retirement from the Senate in 2007.  Barb's first year in the Senate included Senator Jeffords switching parties, 9/11, and the anthrax and ricin scares. Any one of these events might have given a different person a reason to leave the Senate, but Barb stayed and worked as hard as ever. When Senator Jeffords retired in 2007, Barb helped Senator Bernie Sanders' office learn the ways of the Senate for 2 months, after which she joined my office.  From day 1, Barb was always the person who made the trains run on time in my office. Barb had the challenging and sometimes impossible task of keeping my day on schedule, while at the same time juggling phone calls, personal notes, briefing memos, and any number of inquiries that came across her desk. There were even a few times where she managed to track down particularly old and rare library books at my request. No matter the task at hand, Barb approached her work with good humor and a can-do attitude that impressed everyone.  Barb's contributions in my Senate office are immeasurable, but I thought it was worth trying to quantify some of the ways in which she has served the people of Pennsylvania and our During her decade of service to Pennsylvania, Barb welcomed more than 200 ambassadors, dignitaries, and administration officials to my office, drafted more than 500 letters, and greeted over 1,000 Pennsylvanians at my ``Keystone Coffees.'' She acted as a mentor and support system for all my staff members, and befriended everyone she worked with in the Everyone, from the Capitol Police officers she passed on her 3-block commute, to the photographers in the Senate Photo Studio who patiently waited while Barb shepherded our constituents for photos, knows how valued Barb was to our team and to me personally.  Having been in the Senate long before I was, Barb understood how to balance the everyday needs in the office with the overall goals we set for ourselves when we first began our service here. Barb provided everyone in my office, myself included, with the important perspective that is often lost here in the Senate: it is easy to get bogged down in details or small problems, but the work we do here is important, lasting, and honorable. Barb never lost sight of how fortunate we are to work in this institution, and I know our team is grateful to have always had that reminder.  It is hard to imagine my office without Barb, but I know she will enjoy her retirement, whether she is home in New Hampshire or traveling the world. I wish her and her children, Heather and Michael, well in this new chapter.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1968.txt,1828,1945,2017.0,23.0,February

Formerly the site of a pre-Civil War plantation, the first classes were held in a dilapidated mansion on the grounds. Benedict Institute was formerly chartered by the South Carolina General Assembly in 1894 and renamed Benedict  From its founding through 1930, Benedict was led by northern White Baptist ministers. In 1930, Reverend John Starks, an alumnus of Benedict, became the school's first African-American president. The heart of its campus has been designated the Benedict College Historic District, consisting of Morgan Hall, Pratt Hall, Duckett Hall, Antisdel Chapel, and Starks  Like Allen University, its neighbor, Benedict College has a long legacy of activism for civil rights and social justice. One of the very first civil rights campaigns in South Carolina was organized at Benedict College in 1937. Students participating in a national NAACP campaign led a demonstration in support of antilynching legislation pending in  One of Benedict's early graduates was Reverend Richard Born into slavery in Barnwell, South Carolina, Reverend Carroll was a prominent Baptist minister in the late 1800s who received honors and appointments from both President William McKinley and President Theodore Other prominent alumni include Modjeska Simkins, a prominent civil rights and public health champion; General Matthew Zimmerman, who served as Chief of Chaplains of the United States Army; and I.Leevy Johnson, the first African-American president of the South Carolina State Bar  In the modern era, under the leadership of President David Swinton, Benedict has grown to a student body of more than 2,800 undergraduate students. In 1995, Swinton revived the football program and marching band 30 years after they had been shut down. He also championed a new sports complex on Two Notch Road in Columbia, which includes a football stadium, tennis courts, baseball fields, and fitness facilities. The liberal arts curriculum now offers degrees in 30 different disciplines. President Swinton also has led the efforts to preserve and restore many of the historic buildings on the campus, in part paid for with Federal funds from the HBCU Historic Preservation Program that we in this Congress have championed.  President Swinton will retire this summer after 23 years of service to the institution. I wish him well and thank him for his leadership.  Today, on the same land where Blacks once toiled in slavery, their descendants are now learning the tools they need to live up to Benedict College's motto: to be powers for good. Like so many HBCUs, Benedict offers a unique religious experience in which students from many different backgrounds share a common struggle for equality, and I am pleased to recognize them today.

4846,topic-id,598,"Mr.Speaker, standing before almost entirely White crowds in North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, and Ohio, candidate Donald Trump painted a bleak picture of African-American life in 2016, full of crime, high poverty, and failing schools. He went on to say, ``It is a disaster the way African Americans are living,'' and asked, ``What the hell do you have to lose?''  In just 3 short weeks, Mr.Speaker, President Trump has shown the world exactly what a disaster looks like. He has put a White supremacist in the White House as his chief political adviser. He has given us an Attorney General who spent the last 30-plus years working against civil and voting rights. He has appointed a shamefully ill-prepared Secretary of Education whose only qualification seems to be her ability to contribute millions to Republic candidates in what can only be described as the textbook definition of pay to play.  Candidate Trump promised to be the hero of working people, but President Trump is doing the exact opposite. His actions tell a lot more than his tweets. His Cabinet is full of millionaires, many with ethical challenges and conflicts of interest. He has already raised the cost of mortgages for many He is proposing that we abandon the overtime rule that would ensure bigger paychecks for working people. He is working to dismantle Wall Street reform and is proposing a border tax that would give corporations a huge tax break while costing working men and women more on groceries, clothes, and other goods.  The policies of the Trump administration are an extension of the policies that Republics in the House have pushed for years. To candidate Trump's question what do you have to lose, for starters, your voice at the ballot box. A free and fair election is the hallmark of democratic governance, yet the Trump administration and Republics in Congress continue to threaten this basic pillar of democracy. They have promulgated blatant falsehoods about voter fraud, sowing fear and distrust. They have worked and are working across the country to prevent people of color from voting. They are refusing to investigate Russian interference in our elections and are currently moving legislation through the House of Representatives to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with helping Americans vote and protecting our voting machines from hacking.  As President Trump and his spokespeople continue to make demonstrably false claims about widespread voter fraud and cozying up to the country that attacked our democracy, House Republics just passed out of committee H.634, legislation to eliminate the only Federal agency tasked with certifying the security of our voting machines, the Election Assistance  Forty-seven out of fifty States rely on the EAC's voting machine certification program in some capacity. A recent report by the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology concluded, ``Voting machines are neither secure nor complex. In general, these stripped-down computers utilizing outdated operating systems possess virtually every conceivable vulnerability that a device can have.''  In my home State of South Carolina, we currently use voting machines that were rejected by the State of Ohio in 2007 for being ``buggy, unstable and exploitable.'' And even though machines are not supposed to be connected to the internet, they are well past their shelf life and, therefore, more likely to break down, crash, and produce errors. Replacing these outdated machines with updated ones will cost a significant amount of money, and the burden is on the States to do so.  Mr.Speaker, if House Republics are serious about election integrity, they ought to stop working to prevent people of color and start investing in voting infrastructure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1136.txt,208,STATEMENTS ONINTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,14.0,January

4718,topic-id,553,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of two important measures, which would overturn two significant onerous regulations finalized in the waning days of the Obama administration.  First, the resolution provides for the consideration of H.36, providing for congressional disapproval of the so-called BLM methane rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and provides for a motion to recommit.  In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.37, providing for congressional disapproval of the so-called blacklisting rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and provides for a motion to recommit.  Mr.Speaker, burdensome regulations are crippling our businesses. The Obama administration finalized 38 major rules between election day and inauguration day. It is estimated those rules will cost our economy $41.2 billion. Sadly, this was just par for the course with the previous administration. In 2016, the Obama administration finalized over 400 regulations at a cost of over $160 billion to the economy. Over the entire Obama Presidency, over 3,000 regulations, at a cost of $873.6 billion, were finalized.  I am heartened by President Trump's regulatory freeze, which has been estimated to save over $180 billion in regulatory costs, followed by his executive order which aims to revoke two regulations for every new regulation put forward.[[Page H889]]  Specifically, H.36 overturns the BLM methane rule. The rule is a significant regulatory overreach by the Bureau of Land Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate methane emissions, which it currently does. Instead, the BLM has decided to also assert authority over methane in a way that is both duplicative and unnecessary, yet has significant negative impact on jobs, energy production, and Federal, State, and local revenues.  Mr.Speaker, this is a regulation in search of a problem. According to a 2015 EPA study, methane emissions from both natural gas systems and crude oil production have fallen by significant margin, even while oil and natural gas production have exploded. The BLM flaring rule is both costly and unnecessary.  The second rule considered by this resolution is similarly a solution in search of a problem. For decades, the Federal Government has had a suspension and debarment process in place to deny Federal contracts to bad actors who violate basic worker protections. However, President Obama signed an executive order directing various agencies to add another layer of bureaucracy onto the Federal procurement system. Prior to awarding a contract, each agency's contracting officer and a newly created labor compliance adviser will be required to review both violations and alleged violations to determine whether an employer should be awarded a Federal contract. Even the courts have agreed this is overreach. In October of 2016, a Federal district judge blocked enforcement of these rules, citing concerns with the violation of due process rights and executive overreach.  For these reasons, Mr.Speaker, it is critical that we prevent implementation of these rules which are unnecessary and add even more regulatory burdens to our struggling businesses and anemic economy.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH888-3.txt,2259,PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S CABINET,2017.0,2.0,February
4720,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Not surprisingly, my friend and I have a number of disagreements on the wisdom of getting rid of these particular regulations. We do agree on the importance of actually capturing methane gases. Frankly, my friend is right. That is a profitable thing, and most companies try to do it on their own.  We do, frankly, need more infrastructure in this area, no question about that. The BLM has been less than cooperative in allowing that infrastructure to be built on Federal land, and that has made this problem more difficult than it needs to be.  But it is important to recognize, overall, the amount of methane gas that actually escapes has gone down steadily and, frankly, dramatically, even as production has moved up. So additional regulation is unlikely to change that process. It may actually complicate it.  In terms of where the appropriate authority lies, again, I would just remind my friend, as he knows, the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to do this. So if it felt like it needed it, it could.  The BLM has actually moved into a new area beyond its traditional jurisdiction because it does not have authority, under the Clean Air Act, to draft these kind of rules and regulations. The Clean Air Act, again, is already in place. The EPA has the authority. If we need to do something, let's do it.  In terms of the disbarment procedure for contractors, what we have is already awfully robust. Almost 2,000 firms, or on 2,000 occasions, companies were disbarred in 2015 from Federal contracting work. It was the same in 2014. So there is something in place. We don't need additional regulatory expense, additional people working for the government. We can rely on the procedures we already have.  My friend is concerned about the lack of hearings. I would remind him, while we haven't had hearings on these items in this Congress, we certainly did on both of them in the last Congress, in some cases, multiple hearings. There is not any need to rehash and go over the same ground, in my view.  Finally, in terms of just the process itself, the Congressional Review Act actually limits the form in which these sorts of things can be brought forward. If amendments are made in order, frankly, the item loses its privilege in the United States Senate, which, obviously, changes the speed at which you can move and perhaps even the number of votes that are required to actually move forward.  So we think, again, these are items that have been explored, looked at, debated. The evidence is pretty clear. We think it is important to move quickly in these areas, and I would urge the body to do so. Adopt the rule. Support the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

4722,topic-id,342,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to make a couple of good points. Remember, my friends, disbarment is already a very common procedure. It was invoked over 2,000 times. So having another regulatory hurdle and hoop to jump through, just simply isn't necessary.  Again, these regulations were, frankly, generated in the final waning months of the Obama administration. They haven't been in action, and there is sort of a regulatory fit. It is not, by the way, unusual for just the last administration. All administrations have this tendency near the end, and that is one of the reasons why we have the Congressional Review Act in the first place, so that when administrations, in their waning days, decide they want to leave difficult situations or push through things that they didn't see fit to do over an 8-year period, Congress can expeditiously make sure that those regulations aren't put in place and businesses are forced to begin to comply with them.  As I pointed out in my opening remarks, the regulations released by the last administration--over 3,000 of them in an 8-year period--cost the economy over $870 billion. The regulations that were issued between election day and Inauguration Day cost the economy over $40 billion. That is real money. That is real investment that could go elsewhere and could hire people.  So I would think that these, along with the other Congressional Review Act bills that will be coming forward, and have already come forward, will actually give the economy a much-needed shot in the arm, will help stimulate job creation and movement, and we have a timeframe in which we have to operate.  So if we actually followed all of the procedures my friend suggested, many of these regulations, frankly, would never get reviewed before they went on the books.  So it is better to act quickly. I think it is better for American business.  Again, I urge the support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.

4727,topic-id,1359,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank my friend. As always, he is always thoughtful, always a good person to hold a debate and a conversation with.  On this one, we simply disagree. My friend referenced some of the ``conservative groups'' that are supporting the maintenance of the flaring rule, the  Just for the record, I want to add some that I am actually more familiar with: the Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Americans for Prosperity, and Taxpayers Protection All of those are in favor of the repeal of this regulation, and all of them think it will actually save businesses money and increase activity as opposed to the regulation which we think actually discourages economic activity.  Again, these are regulations--in both cases, they were adopted in the final waning days of the administration. These are things that Congress had serious doubts against, but, obviously, couldn't override an administration when they were in office.  The Congressional Review Act itself is done, so we can do this sort of exercise after an administration leaves, and actually go back and undo some of the damage that I think is routinely done by both parties in their waning days, when they would actually be better off to just simply let the new people get into their jobs and actually go about their business.  We have appropriate regulatory authority in both of these areas. Again, the Environmental Protection Agency has the power under the Clean Air Act to issue whatever regulations it cares to on methane. And here, frankly, we ought to pat business on the back because, as we have increased production of both oil and natural gas, methane has consistently gone down dramatically and steadily over the years.  I suspect that process will continue with or without the regulation of the Federal Government because, quite frankly, it makes good business sense. And, quite frankly, most people in private business want to be good stewards to the environment. They are not out to try and damage our air or our water.  The same thing is true in terms of bad actors--and there certainly are some bad actors--that engage in activities that are inappropriate for Federal contractors who violate the law. That is why, under current law, almost 2,000 companies were disbarred in 2015; a similar number in 2014.  So, again, what we have in place appears to be working. Why we would create an additional hurdle, hire additional people, and force companies to do additional paperwork is beyond me. I don't think it is the wise thing to do; I don't think it is the necessary thing to do.  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support the rule.  H.36 and H.37 both undo regulations that should never have been made in the first place. By preventing the implementation of these onerous, duplicative regulations, we will relieve the burdens faced by American small business.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 74 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3.

General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on the After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule.

The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.724.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's[[Page H893]]     ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal      of the House to sustain the demand for the previous question      passes the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in      order to offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of      the majority party offered a rule resolution. The House      defeated the previous question and a member of the opposition      rose to a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

H.132 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey certain lands and buildings of the Arbuckle Project in Murray County, Oklahoma, to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy  In 1962, Congress authorized the payment of reimbursable costs for construction, operation, and maintenance of the Bureau of Reclamation's Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in south-central The district completed repayment of the capital costs of the project in September of 2012.  In accordance with the Bureau of Reclamation's policy framework for title transfer, in December 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation and the district executed an agreement to transfer, in fee title, certain facilities that could be more effectively and efficiently managed at the local level.  The title transfer involves approximately 2.83 acres of land. On this land is a small house, associated structures, and the conservancy district's headquarters office building. The house and property are used to accommodate a district employee who maintains and inspects the dam and the pumping facilities. The headquarters office building is the base of operation for the district.  This bill also divests the Federal Government of its responsibility and liability associated with the district's facilities. Reclamation and the district have worked cooperatively and successfully to address all of the elements necessary to bring this legislation forward and make this transfer proceed as smoothly as possible.  I am pleased this bill is an agreement in which both the Federal and local interests are satisfied. I want to urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation once again.  I want to again thank the chairman for his help in expediting this matter.

4637,topic-id,722,"Mr.President, I rise to express my strong support for the nomination of David Shulkin to be the next Secretary of Veterans I believe his impressive record of service in both the public and private health care sectors as well as his firm grasp of VA health care issues make him extraordinarily well qualified to lead the Department through the coming period of major reforms and continuing transformation.  Shulkin has served in numerous executive roles at hospitals across the country, including Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, the University of Pennsylvania Health System, and the Atlantic Rehabilitation In fact, he has been named one of the top 100 Physician Leaders of Hospitals and Health Systems and one of the 50 Most Influential Physician Executives in the country.  In 2015, Shulkin brought his extensive experience in the private sector to the Department of Veterans Affairs and served as the VA Under Secretary for Last year, I had the opportunity to host Shulkin in my hometown of Caribou, ME, as he toured the community-based outpatient clinic and our local hospital, Cary Medical Center, to see the innovative work being done there to provide veterans with top-quality health care closer to where they live.  Cary Medical Center partners with the VA through the Access Received Closer to Home or ARCH Program to provide veterans in Northern Maine with high-quality care, including specialty care close to home and close to their families, rather than forcing them to drive 250 or more miles to receive their care at the Togus VA Medical Center in Augusta, the location of Maine's only VA hospital.  This partnership between Cary Medical Center and the VA has been a huge success, with an approval rating from our veterans exceeding 90 percent. Last spring, when we were faced with the potential expiration of the ARCH Program, Shulkin, at my invitation, came to Maine and announced his commitment to ensure that veterans using this innovative program in our State would maintain seamless community care. He has kept his word.  During his visit to Maine, Shulkin also toured the Togus VA Medical Center, the oldest VA facility in the Nation and the community-based outpatient clinic in I would note that he drove the 4 hours from Augusta, where the VA hospital is located, to Caribou to get a better sense of the distances in our Right now, when we are in the midst of a fierce blizzard, you can imagine how important it is for veterans in need of care to be able to access that care close to home in an emergency.  I was truly impressed, and remain truly impressed, with Shulkin's understanding of the needs of rural veterans and the challenges of providing health care in rural settings. While in Maine, Shulkin listened to veterans health care providers, VSO advocates, and the VA staff alike to ensure that our veterans received the care they[[Page S1099]]have earned through their service to our  In fact, he remained in Caribou and had a town meeting in which he heard from people representing a variety of views but all of whom encouraged him to continue this wonderful program. Shulkin's nomination to be VA Secretary has drawn support from our veterans service organizations throughout the country, including the American Legion, the VFW, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS, and the Vietnam Veterans of  That does not surprise me because he has demonstrated, in very concrete ways, his commitment to the veterans we are serving. At a time when bipartisan consensus, unfortunately, has been all too rare in this Chamber, Shulkin's nomination has been one of the few areas where Republicans and Democrats have found common ground. His nomination was approved unanimously by the Senate Veterans' Affairs  During this time, when crucial reforms and organizational changes are necessary to ensure consistent, high-quality care for our Nation's veterans, it is critical that the VA have a talented, experienced, and committed leader to spearhead the Department's transformation as we seek to improve the quality and timeliness of health care for our veterans.  Shulkin is an excellent nominee and I urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation.  Seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the absent of a quorum.

4593,topic-id,1485,"Mr.President, in 2005, theFederal Government enacted the REAL ID Act, imposing Federal standards established by the Department of Homeland Security to theprocess and production of the issuance of States' driver's licenses and identification cards.  This law was an underfunded,top down, Federal mandate, infringing on personal privacy, increasing the personal information susceptible to cyber-attacks, andundermining State sovereignty. Furthermore, a REAL ID compliant State ID will be required for all ``official federal purposes,''including boarding commercial aircraft, impeding the movement of American citizens.  Montana led opposition to this In 2007, Montana enacted a law, after both chambers of the State legislature unanimously passing legislation, refusingto comply.  That is why I am reintroducing the Repeal ID Act--to allow Montana and other States to implement their laws,protecting their sovereignty and citizens' information. Consistent with the Montana State legislature, this legislation willrepeal the REAL ID Act of 2005.  Montanans are fully aware of the power that big data holds and the consequences when thatdata is abused. Montana has shown how States are best equipped to make licenses secure, without sacrificing the privacy andrights of their citizens.

In the world of bullriding and in life itself, Jess Lockwood's Montana wisdom rings true. Jess focuses on what needs to be accomplished and gets the job done. And he didn't arrive at his level of success by circumstance, coincidence, good fortune, or luck. His accomplishments are the fruit of efforts sown many years in advance and watered by a steady stream of hard work. In high school, these successful habits led Jess to three Montana High School rodeo State championships.  Back home in Montana, we all hope that his string of success continues, and are confident he has what it takes to maintain his performance.

His clarity of purpose to rise to the top in his chosen field should be refreshing and rejuvenating to us all.

4650,topic-id,1991,"Madam President, on January 20, at his inauguration, President Trump stood before the American people and said: ``For too long, a small group of our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.''  President Trump is right. The people have borne unimaginable costs: the cost of foreclosure, the cost of inequality, the cost of poverty, and the cost of injustice. Sadly, it doesn't look like that is going to change soon with this administration. Three weeks into this administration, President Trump has already begun to restore power back to Wall Street and the very same people who he said have caused tremendous problems for us. The nomination of Steve Mnuchin, someone who spent his entire career working on behalf of Wall Street at the expense of hard-working Americans, is a clear example.  Let me say at the outset, I have not met him, but I tried to, but we couldn't get an agreement as to when we might be able to get together. I wanted to talk to him about some important issues that many of us remember.  We know what happened with the recession that greeted President Obama when he was sworn into office 8 years ago. We know about the foreclosures. We know of families being literally wiped out, all their savings gone because of misleading tactics by financiers.  I still look at this, and as much as I respect President Obama and his administration, I shake my head and think: Nobody went to jail for all that occurred. People at the highest levels of the financial community on Wall Street and others were engaged in practices that we know now were unfair and just plain wrong and, in many cases, illegal.  I have taken a look at Mr.Mnuchin's record. I have read a lot of stories about him. I have heard from homeowners' personally impacted by his conduct, and let me tell you, what I have seen and heard leads me to believe he is not the right person to be Secretary of the  Like most of President Trump's nominees, Mr.Mnuchin was not chosen for his knowledge and experience on critical issues he will face if confirmed as Secretary of the He was not chosen for his commitment to work for average working families. He was chosen for his loyalty to the President, the new litmus test in the Republican  Before serving as President Trump's chief fundraiser on the campaign, Mr.Mnuchin worked to help wealthy individuals and powerful special interest groups reap the benefits of what the President has called ``a rigged system.'' He served as an executive at Goldman Sachs and as a hedge fund manager.  Perhaps what troubles me the most about Mr.Mnuchin's experience is his tenure at the helm of a group known as OneWest, which came to be known as a foreclosure machine in America because of the aggressive and questionable practices it used to foreclose on the homes of thousands of American families.  Mr.Mnuchin was the head of the company that was doing the foreclosure. After our country experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Congress worked around the clock to prevent the economy from going into free-fall and end some of the worst practices that helped bring the American economy to its knees.  As we were working to save American homes, Mr.Mnuchin--like President Trump--saw opportunity to make a profit, personally earning millions from OneWest's success as a foreclosure machine.  As the head of OneWest, Mr.Mnuchin had the power to destroy lives through foreclosure or find ways to help homeowners stay in their homes. He chose to aggressively foreclose on families.  During his nomination hearing, Mr.Mnuchin defended OneWest's foreclosure practices and said he was proud of the work of the bank during the foreclosure crisis.  Let me tell you about some of the stories, and you can decide whether Mr.Mnuchin should be proud of the record of the company he was managing.  Rex Schaffer and his wife Rose lost their home of nearly 50 years, despite having qualified for a loan modification.  Ossie Lofton, a 90-year-old woman, was foreclosed on because she was short 27 cents in her mortgage payment--27 cents.  The locks were changed on Leslie Park's Minneapolis home in the middle of a blizzard.  We have seen how organizations headed by Mr.Mnuchin treat people. If confirmed, Mr.Mnuchin would have the ability to use the power of the U.Treasury Department to stand on the side of Wall Street and on the opposite side of millions of working I don't have confidence, based on his professional record, that Mr.Mnuchin will put the needs of hard-working families first over Wall  While the foreclosure crisis and its aftermath seem like something in the past for so many people, that is not the case in my home State of Foreclosures are devastating for the families forced out of their homes, but they are also devastating to surrounding communities and neighborhoods.  If you want to know what a community looks like 50 years after the foreclosure crisis, visit my birthplace, my hometown of East Louis, IL, or even some of the neighborhoods on the south side of Chicago, or the west side, for that matter--vacant lot after vacant lot, neglected buildings and homes, an economy devastated. And what is left? Some of the poorest families on earth.  While we have made significant progress since the recession of 2008, many families in my State and across the country are still suffering. There is work to do. If confirmed, Mr.Mnuchin[[Page S1112]]will be responsible for protecting these families and ensuring that we don't have another financial crisis. All we have seen from him is his ability to profit from the foreclosure crisis and the devastation left in its wake. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, Congress got together with the President and passed Dodd-This was Wall Street reform determined not to let another economic crisis follow. The consumer protection act was also passed to prevent these crises and to reform the problems that caused them.  Mr.Mnuchin has made no secret of the fact that his 1 regulatory priority is to roll back Wall Street reform, to return the barbarians to the gates. Despite the promises President Trump made during his campaign, including ``not letting Wall Street get away with murder,'' Mr.Mnuchin has an ally in President Trump in undoing Dodd-President Trump signed an Executive order that would begin rolling back the important consumer and financial system reforms we passed as part of Dodd-The President signed this order sitting among the biggest beneficiaries of his actions, some of Wall Street's high rollers. Make no mistake, if President Trump gets his way and Steven Mnuchin is confirmed, the banks are going to have the best friend they can think of in the Treasury Department, just like they did before the economic crash of 2008.  It is clear the American people can't count on Mr.Mnuchin, based on his business experience, to decide with them over Wall But, certainly, he should be committed to basic fairness of the Tax He said he was until he wasn't. Shortly after his nomination, Mr.Mnuchin said there would be ``no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' Yet he has not spoken out against the significant tax cuts the wealthy would receive from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or under the President's and the House Republican's tax reform plan. We shouldn't be surprised by this because we are asking Mr.Mnuchin to close the loopholes and raise the taxes on the very people he helped to avoid paying taxes by using offshore tax havens as a hedge fund manager.  We are still recovering from the devastation of that financial crisis 8 years ago. We can't afford to have our Nation's top economic official be a man who has only been looking out for Wall For a President who ran on bringing back jobs and being a champion of the working people, the choices of President Trump for his Cabinet are the opposite and have taken advantage of the very system he has derided as rigged against the people.  The American people deserve better. When Mr.Mnuchin's nomination is brought to the Senate floor for a vote, I will vote no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                      Nomination of David Shulkin  Madam President, I want to take a moment to address the nomination of David Shulkin to be confirmed soon as the next Secretary of the Department of Veterans We all know the Veterans Affairs Department faced a number of challenges in recent years: long waiting times, disability claims backlogs, issues related to accountability, whistleblowers, and the quality of care. The list is too long. As the second largest Federal agency, employing more than 350,000 people across America and serving as our largest integrated health care system, some challenges are unavoidable.  As the VA provides for the brave men and women who fought and sacrificed for this country, as well as their families, it is critical that it be held to a high standard. We in Congress must work to ensure that, in addition to holding the Department to a high standard, we also ensure that it is well funded and that it has the tools and flexibility to do the job.  It is critical that we strengthen the VA system and not weaken it through privatization, which would only lower the quality of health care for our veterans. That is why I am pleased with the nomination of Shulkin by President Trump to be the next Secretary of Veterans  Despite years of people playing politics with the VA--efforts which have only been counterproductive and have made it difficult for the VA to fill critical vacancies--and despite months of President Trump's talking about privatization without offering real solutions, today we have a nominee who appears to understand that, while there is a role for expanded care options, weakening or dismantling the VA is not the answer. I was heartened by Shulkin's commitment during his hearing in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on February 1, where he said: ``The Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch.''  Shulkin may not be a veteran himself, but I am encouraged by the fact that he comes from a military family and has decades of medical experience, including serving for 2 years under former VA Secretary Robert McDonald as head of the Veterans Health Administration after being nominated by President May I add that he left a lucrative private sector job and took a huge pay cut to join the  It is no surprise that a number of veterans service organizations actively support his nomination. Although progress has been made in recent years, there are still challenges at the VA that we need to continue to address. I worry about the veterans' health care, education, homelessness, accountability, and a host of other issues. I look forward to working with Shulkin on these matters.  But we must not forget that, overall, in terms of health care, the VA is consistently found to provide care in key areas that is better than or on par with care in the private sector. It is significantly more cost effective, as well. And most veterans across the country prefer their veteran-centric health care that they receive in the Despite what some may claim, most of them do not support privatization. I want to be clear that this includes a myriad of efforts under the guise of expanding access or choice.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Shulkin to be the next VA I shared then-President Obama's sentiment that he was the right person to head up the Veterans Health Administration back in 2015, and I believe he is the right person to head the VA today.  Just 3 days ago, I was in Marion, IL, and visited our veterans hospital there. I met with the administrator.

4873,topic-id,709,"Mr.President, this past Sunday was the 44th anniversary of Roe v. I wish to take a moment to reflect on how far we have come since the Supreme Court decision.  Because of Roe v. Wade, American women for the last 44 years have had the right, the freedom, the privacy to make their own decisions about their own bodies with their doctors and with their families, without the Federal Government barging its way into the conversation and telling them what they can or can't do with their own bodies.  Roe v. Wade was one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in the history of women's rights in this Nation, but it was only a start. In the 44 years since, we have made so much progress with women's health, and much of that progress has to do with what we accomplished in the Affordable Care  Millions of American women now have access to health care coverage that used to be extremely difficult and expensive for a lot of women to get. Millions of American women now have access to affordable preventive health care services, including contraception, birth control, STD screenings, mammograms, breastfeeding support and supplies, and cervical cancer screenings, and since the Affordable Care Act was passed, the number of unwanted pregnancies has gone down, in part, because more women have access to affordable contraception.  There is no doubt that American women have better access to safe and affordable health care because of Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act, but some of my colleagues are committed to turning back the clock on women's health and taking away women's access to this lifesaving care. They are doing everything in their power to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and they are determined to see Roe v. Wade get overturned.  One of President Trump's first Executive orders was so extreme that it would take away funding for any international organizations that even talk about whether a woman might want to terminate a pregnancy. We should never let this happen. If we take away women's access to the health care they need, it would be devastating--even life-threatening--for millions of American women.  This weekend, a massive group of women and men and children joined together in women's marches across the globe. They were there to speak out, to be heard, to protest some of these issues that would deeply affect American families and women in particular. I was so proud to march with them. I was inspired by them--their passion, their determination, and their commitment to never give up.  The women's marches were truly the biggest outpouring of support and activism I have seen in my lifetime and certainly that we have seen in this generation. They were loud and clear statements that we will not let the government dictate to us how we should manage these most personal decisions--when you are going to have a family, how big your family is going to be. Those are decisions that are made by husbands and wives, by spouses all across this country about what their family is going to look like.  I urge all of my colleagues in this Chamber to listen to the millions of Americans, the millions of women who would like to make those decisions themselves, who would like to choose their health care, who would not like to be charged more just because they are women, who would not like to see their health care coverage dropped the minute they become pregnant, who would not like to be told: You have a preexisting condition and we will not cover you. That is what we go back to.  We have to fight for the Affordable Care Act, and we have to make sure the Supreme Court does not overturn Roe v. Listen to your constituents. These marches weren't just in New York; they were in every State across the country. These marches were real, they were powerful, they were determined, and these men and women want to be heard.  Members of Congress, I hope you are listening to them. That is our job, to represent our country. Their voices must be heard. We shall not ignore them.  I yield the floor.

4843,topic-id,6101,"Mr.Speaker, in our Judiciary Committee today, we have been marking up what should have been a couple of rather simple bills, but it is really as if the instructions on the Soros-funded website, manual, things telling people how to obstruct the current majorities in the House and Senate and administration, could possibly be carrying over here into the Capitol itself because there are so many amendments being offered and things being drug out and people saying the same thing over and over. It is about Russia and corruption and one thing and the other--on and on and on.  It is just interesting when people are talking about their dramatic concerns over Russia, who, for years, have been totally silent. When everybody I know of on the Republican side here had been asking that President Obama and his administration do something about the terrible hacking problem from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, he didn't seem terribly bothered.  I mean, it was as if he were afraid he might hurt Putin's feelings or Khamenei's feelings in Iran and maybe they would want to kill Americans in a more brutal way, the Iran terrorists being paid. I can't help but think that there will be people in the next 4 years who are Americans, who are Muslim, Jews, Christians--especially those groups--who would be killed because of the billions and billions of dollars that this administration forced into the hands of the largest supporter of terrorism in the world:  It was as if the world--and in particular, the United States--had not been punished enough for the mistakes of the Carter administration in thinking that by pushing the Shah of Iran--not a great man. Apparently, he could be pretty brutal in his own right, but he kept radical Islam at bay.  When President Carter encouraged his forcing out of office, much as President Obama did the same thing with the President of Egypt, in both cases, it created a vacuum that was immediately filled by radical The Muslim Brotherhood is who filled it in In Iran, yes, it was radical And probably for the first time since the Ottoman Empire, radical Islamist leaders were given a country, a country's military with which to wreak their havoc on the world.  It is just hard to believe that, in the intervening years between President Carter leaving office in January 1981 and President Obama coming in in January of 2009, all history had been forgotten or possibly even not really learned.  I guess, if you are learning at the hands or at the feet of Jeremiah Wright, who has such contempt--GD America was his feelings and expression--or if you are at the feet of Bill Ayers, who felt that blowing up police stations, things like that, hadn't quite served the purpose, or perhaps if we take over educating college students who will one day train elementary students and high school students, then we can ultimately create the anarchy that we were trying to create in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Back then, we were unsuccessful, but great inroads have been made here recently. You would just have to believe that America was the problem for the world in the last 100 years, and apparently there are those who feel that way.  But for those of you who have talked with friends of different religions--Muslim, Christians, Jews, secularists--in different parts of the world, those who are actually fair minded make it very clear: the United States has been the greatest force for good as a nation that the world has ever known since the Dark It just has.  And thank God we have had such wonderful allies in the endeavors that we have undertaken. Of course, in the liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's hands, we had many other countries who joined us. President George H.Bush was going to liberate So many Democrats had screamed at President George H.Bush as troops were moving into Iraq after the liberation of Kuwait, screaming: Stop, stop, stop. They are giving up. They are giving up.  President George H.Bush ordered the stoppage, and immediately thereafter, the Democrats that screamed for him to stop began berating Bush because he didn't finish the job in Some of those same people were around to condemn his son George Bush when he actually did finish the job.  There was yellowcake uranium that was taken out which showed that Joseph Wilson had apparently said one thing to CIA agents and testified to something totally different, who said something totally different from his original interview when he got back from Of course, he was heralded a hero by the mainstream media.  But it has just been amazing to see the ebb and flow of international relations. And reflecting back as I did earlier today, as so much from my Democratic friends in Judiciary was made about connections between the Trump administration and Russia, it is just hard not to remember so vividly the comments by Mitt Romney in a debate with President Obama in 2012 that Russia was potentially the greatest threat.  I may be mistaken, but it seems like President Obama even said something glibly like, you know, ``The 1980s called and they want their foreign policy back,'' something rather cheeky like that, when, actually, my friends across the aisle, in Judiciary at least, have come to realize that that was one thing Mitt Romney was right about and President Obama was wrong about.  But if you look at what the Obama administration did, as soon as President Obama took office, instead of taking a principle stand--and I know there was a lot of perceived hatred by those coming in with the Obama administration for George Perhaps it goes back to President Obama's days when he was growing up in Indonesia and he commented in his book, ``Dreams from My Father,'' about how his stepfather was apparently paid off by these fat-cat guys from Texas, oil guys, fat cats from Texas and Louisiana, something to that effect, and you realized, holy smokes, he has had a great disdain for Texas, for Louisiana going back to, you know, preteen years. You couldn't help but wonder if, in policies, it was carried through. Of course, he didn't appreciate his stepfather for working, and working with the Americans back in those days. But perhaps that has affected him.  So if George Bush took a principled stand against Russia after Russia assaulted the independent nation of Georgia--I mean, some of us remember that President George Bush, trying to look for the good in people, came back from meeting Putin and said, you know: I looked into his eyes and saw his soul. He thought that is what he saw--may have been looking into shark eyes. But in any event, he soon learned the error of his ways. And that is one of the things I liked about President George If he made a mistake, he was big enough to say that wasn't the right way to go, and he would try to fix it.  That is exactly what he did in his relationship with When Russia attacked Georgia--unprovoked, really--President George Bush, his administration, properly took a very principled stand. Some didn't think it went far enough, but he immediately caused a cessation of the great relations that had been going on and took some steps to chill those relations because of Russia's unilateral attack against Georgia, hoping to wake Putin up that you can't just go attack a neighboring country like that. Even if you want the old Soviet Empire back, you can't just do that without repercussions. So because of Putin's imperialistic attack, Bush took a strong stance and let Russia know: We don't approve of what you have done, and we are cooling things, we are freezing things.[[Page H1232]]  One of the first things that occurred after President Obama took office, he sent his new Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to meet with the Russians and they had this red plastic button--looked pretty cheap, but it was supposed to have said ``reset,'' but apparently, they couldn't get the translation right. I am not sure what it said, peregruzka. I don't know what it said. I don't know what it was. But somebody that didn't know how to translate ``reset'' put it on and delivered the wrong message.  But the more important message that Secretary Clinton and President Obama delivered to the rather ruthless imperialist leader of Russia was this: George Bush overreacted when you attacked your neighbor, Georgia, Mr.Putin, and we want you to know, we don't have a problem with you attacking Georgia, attacking your neighbors, trying to take over their territory. So we are here with big smiles and big laughs because we want to be such a good friend of yours, and we think it is perfectly fine what you are doing. We think you are terrific.                              {time}  1845  That is the message after Bush let Putin know: Wait a minute. We are not going to let you be the big bully in the world.  But the Obama administration sent a very clear message: We are not We don't have a problem with you attacking  And it is hard to think anything but that message that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, as our President, sent to Putin was clear: We would be okay if you attacked Ukraine, You know, we are okay with that. If it is adjoining, yeah, yeah, attack away.  What else is Putin supposed to think when President Bush reacts harshly when he attacks a neighboring country, and the new President comes in and says: We are fine with everything you are doing. We are nothing but smiles and plastic red buttons. We are good. We don't mind anything you have done. We want to be your good friend.  If the message from that was not clear enough, before he was reelected in 2012, a microphone he didn't realize could pick him up, picked up our President telling the President of Russia: Basically tell Vladimir I will have a lot more flexibility after the election.  Well, now that could only have one meaning, and that is, I got to look tough and like I am standing up tough to Putin right now before the 2012 election, but make sure Putin knows that after the election I can give the farm a whole lot easier. I can let him do a whole lot more that he wants to do. We can be a lot more chummy once I get past my second and last election as So you make sure Vlad knows--my bosom buddy over there, my best friend forever--I am going to be able to work with him like he wants me to once I get past the next election.  So with those kind of messages, then, as if it wasn't enough, followed up by another message to Russia and the world when he stated that, basically, if President al-Assad in Syria used gas on people in Syria, that would be a red line. And if he crossed it, obviously we would have to do something. He created a red line. Nobody asked him to.  Putin picks up messages like that. For all of the problems he presents, one problem he does not present is where he stands, where he wants to go, and what motivates him. He's very clear.  I have never met the man, but I have studied enough about Russia, and I have learned enough about Putin to know exactly who he is, what he is capable of, what he wants to do. And it is pretty clear: He wants to rebuild his empire. He hates the United He blames the United States for the fall of the glorious Soviet Union, that great USSR that once ruled the waves and the world. He wants a grand return to those days, and he wants to be the leader like Khrushchev or Really, he would rather be in the nature of  As Stalin himself once said, a translation: With power, dizziness. Stalin said that, and he should certainly know.  I think probably Putin has run into that as he has gotten all this glamour. During the Obama years, so many magazines and journalists just couldn't get enough of Putin with his shirt off. I mean, it may have helped the sex status of--as the status symbol of people who were bald. Maybe I should be proud and happy for that, but it didn't seem to affect me at all.  But there was so much laid on the shoulders--the mantle laid by the Obama administration on the shoulders of And when that didn't seem to work out very well, it looked like the next big step was to ingratiate this Nation's Presidency, administration to the most evil leaders in the world, those who are leading  They can be an evil empire all by themselves. They have wreaked so much havoc in the world. So many of the Americans that died liberating Iraq, lost their lives at the hands of IEDs or other weapons of war inflicted on them by Iranians--are sent to Iraq from  There is a big price to pay for mistakes in judgment of  I believe Donald Trump will ultimately end up being one of the greatest Presidents in foreign relations because I think he is going to figure out, as George Bush did, Putin is not someone you can trust. You need to understand where he is coming from and where he wants to go. And you can use him when it is to our advantage against a common enemy. But make no mistake, he would glory in the fall of the United  He is wrong about why the Soviet Union fell. It fell because it was based on communism, totalitarianism, and it was destined to fall.  I could see that during the summer that I was there as an exchange student, and I went out to a collective farm. And being from East Texas, I worked on farms and ranches. And during summer, as this was sometime in July, I went out to a collective farm there; and there were massive acres, huge numbers of acres out there.  I couldn't really tell what was being cultivated and what wasn't, what even the crop was. It didn't look good. It was brown. I couldn't get over how sad things looked out there. This was down in the Ukraine, the bread basket of what was the Soviet Union at the time.  I know that if you are going to work around the latitude that that was in Ukraine--similar to ours back in Texas--in the summer, you best start around sun up so that you don't have to work when the Sun reaches its hottest time in the day.  Seeing all of the farmers gathered in the shade there near the center of the village--a little town they had there--they were all sitting in the shade midmorning. I tried to use my best Russian that I could speak at the time and asked them, tried to use a smile: You know, when do you work out in the field?  They laughed. I thought, well, maybe I messed up a word and made it into a weird translation.  Then one of them spoke up in Russian, and he said: I make the same number of rubles if I am out there in the field or if I am here in the shade--if I am out there in the Sun or here in the shade, so I am here in the shade.  I thought at the time that is why socialism, communism could never work. If you are going to pay people the same thing not to work as you do the people who are working, then eventually most people are not going to work.  It is a good thing to have a safety net for those who, through no fault of their own, find themselves unemployed; but you can't turn into a Socialist nation where you reward people--provide the safety net, sure--but you can't provide incentives to sit in the shade and not work at all. Because eventually some day, your people will go hungry and your nation will fail as a nation-state, and it did. There were many factors that contributed, but the bottom line is that type of system can never work in this world, in this life.  The Pilgrims tried it in that beautiful Mayflower Compact where they were all going to work and bring into the common storehouse and share. It was just a beautiful, lovely way to approach things.  I have loved looking, as I did last night, at the painting there in the rotunda reflecting the Pilgrims' famous prayer meeting there in It says ``Speedwell'' right under the platform where they were. They were on the ship, the Speedwell, before they left in two ships--the big Speedwell and the small Mayflower--and went over to  The Speedwell, the big ship that was going to allow them to take so many more to the new land, America, began[[Page H1233]]taking on water, for whatever reason. There were different things said about what may have been the cause.  But for whatever reason, they had to do a bit like Gideon did. They had to winnow it down to the people that had the best chance of making it to America so they could fit on that small So they winnowed the group down. They came over on the  It was a beautiful thing, loving, working hard as they did. But when such a huge number of their settlers died during that first winter, basically, the short version, they ultimately tried something new resembling private property: You take your property. You grow. You use it however you want. And whatever you grow and produce, that is yours.  It's amazing that worked out so well. Unlike the collective farms in the Soviet Union, there was incentive to work hard, produce, and people thrived, did so well. That actually gave a lot of incentive to others. Hey, this private property thing can work out well.  Here, all these years later, we have people wanting to go back to that way of life that has failed every time it has been tried. Even when the Apostle Paul tried it, he ultimately had to throw up his hands and say: New rule. If you don't work, you don't eat.  Because the socialist way of doing things in this world is not going to work.  I am glad that my friends who were so vocal about not wanting a strong relationship with the current leader of Russia, I am glad they finally realized what those of us on the Republican side--most of us--have been saying for a very long time. Yeah, we can work with the Russians to defeat our common enemy, but you should never lose sight of the fact Putin does not really want us for friends. He wants to see this country gone. He wants to see our way of life fail. So just don't lose sight of that.  It is also interesting--we had amendments being proposed today with the same theme being repeated constantly about a Muslim ban, in essence, that we should not ever take religion into account when it comes to immigration. That has no place.  Yet, when our chairman, one of our other Members brought up the--I believe it was Raul Labrador--the Lautenberg amendment that so many of us support, when you know a group of people--such as the Jewish people in another part of the world--are being killed and they are being persecuted, when we know that is taking place, it is a good thing to consider who they are and that their religion is being persecuted.  When there are Christians in another part of the world being persecuted beyond what other religions are, it is a good thing to try to help them.                              {time}  1900  When there were Muslims being persecuted in Eastern Europe, the Clinton administration responded, came to their aid. And for those that say, gee, standing up to radical Islam will only encourage more recruitment--my word--how much worse can it get than it has gotten during the last 8 years?  There was no President Obama took office, Afghanistan, they were still fighting; but actually, the Taliban had been totally--any organized Taliban had been destroyed by February of 2002, and we hadn't lost a single American life. We had used--we had let the Northern Alliance, residents, citizens in Afghanistan, we let them fight our enemy because, though they were Muslim, most of them, they didn't want radical Islamists running  A mistake was made after our friends in the Northern Alliance totally routed the We sent in tens of thousands of American troops, and our friends, who loved us and heralded us for our liberation from the Taliban in Afghanistan, began to look at us as occupiers. I have been to Afghanistan enough. I have seen the way that relationship has gone, from us being the heroes that liberated their country from these radical Islamists that were a bane to the existence of just peace-loving Muslims wanting to live and not be terrorized by radical Islamists, and somehow we ended up becoming bad guys to so much of the country because of our massive presence.  I do believe, Mr.Speaker, there is potential with all of the chaos that is beginning to raise its head again in I heard a report this morning that Afghans had confided to a Republican here in town when he was over there visiting that al-Qaida is even back in So it is not just the Taliban back stronger than ever; now al-Qaida is back in  And what was the cost to America, to our military over the last 8 years in allowing the Taliban to come back stronger than they were originally, to al-Qaida, to come back in Afghanistan stronger than they were originally? My personal opinion, I believe it was because of President Obama's rules of engagement. But we lost four times more precious military lives in Afghanistan during President Obama's command than were lost during just under 8 years under Commander George  How could we lose four times more American military and suffer such a setback over the last 8 years, where we are back maybe a little worse off than things were when we went in to Afghanistan in October of 2001? Well, it has to do with the commitment. I heard former Vice President Cheney say that when President Obama announced he is committed to Afghanistan and he sent a surge into Afghanistan, he also announced, what seemed almost simultaneously, and we are going to be out in 18 months.  As we know from history, nobody that ever won a war, a police action, a confrontation, ever set a deadline: We are going to win by this date or we are coming out, whether we have won or not. That message went out loud and clear to the Taliban that was growing back that if we can just hang on for 18 months, we will own Afghanistan all over again.  I understand that, apparently, General Harwood, that has apparently been named by President Trump as the new National Security Adviser--and Mr.Speaker, I am sorry. I have got to say this because of what Billy and Karen Vaughn have come to mean to me since I met them some years back, after the death of their SEAL Team 6 son, Gosh, I have come to know--I never met him while he was alive, but I have come to know him and feel like I knew him as a friend and as one of his admirers, vicariously, through his parents, Billy and  When I heard the general's name come back up as one of those being considered, I thought, oh, please, surely not, because Billy and Karen made clear, you know, as family members were finding out what happened there in Afghanistan that took the most SEAL team lives we had ever had, they went onto a Chinook that should not have carried our SEAL team members. They went onto this Chinook and, supposedly, going on a mission, and yet because of the rules laid down by President Obama and his administration, they had to make sure that the Afghans knew exactly what was going to occur, where they were going, what they were going to do.  Even knowing that after Vice President Joe Biden's gaffe, where he released classified information, that it was the SEALs who took out Osama bin Laden, it wasn't supposed to come out. It was another gaffe. But immediately, Bill and Karen said, after Biden outed the SEALs and it came out it was SEAL Team 6, they got a call from Aaron saying: Hey, you need to get off social media. The radical Islamists are going to be looking for us, for our family members.  So this administration put big targets on SEAL Team 6 by disclosing classified information that ultimately led to their deaths, and it put targets on family members of SEAL Team 6. I know they didn't mean to do it. I know it wasn't intentional. They just didn't realize how serious things were.  I know they must not have realized, or at least President Obama must not have realized, how serious it was when I watched the video of the gentleman that was called his body man, was with him through so many days, and he was answering questions at a university in It has been some years back that I watched. But he was asked, in effect, what was it like being with President Obama when he went into the room where they were watching SEAL Team 6 go after Osama bin He basically said: Oh, we didn't stay in there long. The President looked in but said, ``I'm not watching this,'' and they[[Page H1234]]went and played cards, several hands of cards, while the SEAL Team 6 was putting their lives on the line for their country.  So if that is your way of thinking, then it is understandable that you wouldn't appreciate the dangers in which you put SEAL Team 6 when you out them as the people who went after Osama bin But they knew, and the chatter was clear, and it was loud. They wanted to take casualties and get a price back with lives of SEAL Team 6 members.  The mission that they were on should have ended right then, when the Afghan commander came up. They knew where they were going. He comes up and pulls off their elite soldiers, off the Chinook helicopter, and replaced them with people whose names were not on the manifest. Well, under the rules, that should have ended the task, should have ended the operation right there. They were told to go on, so they went--I have seen the transcript of testimony, statements--by gunship, C-130 gunship in the area. They had all kinds of imaging.  And this isn't classified because this was on the DVD that was given to the family members. They were later asked if they would give it back. They didn't realize quite how much information they had put. Yeah, they sure didn't because the family members, like the Vaughns, watched it, read it, found out what was on it.  We had a C-130 gunship, and I--my 4 years on Active Duty in the Army, I was never in combat. I think we should have gone into combat in Iran when an act of war occurred and our embassy was attacked. But that was Commander-in-Chief Carter's call, and he decided not to send anybody. I think if he had responded within 48 hours and said, ``You either release our hostages, or we are sending our United States military, and you better not hurt them or there will be a powerful price paid by you and your country,'' I think they would have released them. I think that is why, probably--I mean, I was watching closely from Fort All of us were watching the news. Were any of us going to be sent?  The Ayatollah had a spokesman. I have not seen anything about it since I watched back in those days, `79, but I recall him. It was very interesting. For a few days, he kept distinguishing that it was the students that attacked the U.It was the students that had the hostages.  I said to some of my Army friends at Fort Benning: I think he is afraid Carter's going to send our military, and he is using the students as a back door for him. So if Carter shows a backbone and says, ``You either release our hostages or we are sending--you are going to feel the full vengeance of the United States military,'' they had a back door. It gave the Ayatollah an opportunity to save face by saying: You don't have to do it. We have negotiated with the students. Here are your hostages back. You don't have to invade Iran and take out our administration. See, we are your friend. We helped you out.  But after a few days, I am not sure exactly what it was, but after a few days, it was clear, I think, to the Iranian leaders that this President is not going to do anything. He is just going to ask us to let their people go, and so we don't have to worry. They began to say ``we have the hostages'' because they knew Carter wasn't going to do anything.  I still believe, based on what I learned at Fort Benning, that if President Carter had allowed all the helicopters to go that I was told were originally requested, then there would not have been one chopper--they had to have six to be able to make it the 500 miles into the staging area there in As has come out publicly, they all knew, if we don't get six choppers out of the--eight was all the Carter administration would allow to go. They should have sent 12 because they expected to have a 50 percent loss, turbine engines going across sand like that 500 miles. They knew they had to have six or the mission was an automatic abort.  As we know, when only five got there and it was clear there was not another one coming, then it was aborted. As I understand, the investigation indicated the helicopter pilot, as sand swirled around his chopper, must have gotten vertigo and not relied on his instruments. The helicopter tilted. The blade went through the C-130, and everybody on the chopper and the C-130 was killed.                              {time}  1915  But, once again, we were embarrassed because we didn't have a Commander in Chief that was totally committed to doing what it took to get our hostages out. Again, I will always believe, if he had shown a backbone within 48 hours of our embassy being attacked and our hostages being taken, there would be thousands of American military lives still in being today.  So having witnessed firsthand lessons of poor decisions by Commanders in Chief, having seen the data, the statistics of dead American military in Afghanistan, four times more under Commander Obama than under Commander Bush in approximately near the same amount of time, we haven't learned the lessons of the past very well.  I feel absolutely confident that the President is going to learn his lessons. He has made a couple of mistakes. And certainly I agree, you can't have a National Security Adviser that is not completely honest with the Vice President and the President; you just can't. You have to be able to totally trust him. That has been a problem in our intelligence community. They were leaking and undermining President Bush, and now it is happening again to President  So as I was talking about SEAL Team Six, these devastated families that had lost the greatest military members that we could have lost at that point, their every life is just priceless, invaluable. But there was so much money spent in training up these SEAL teams. It is an investment. You need to make sure they have the right equipment, that you don't have Afghans pulled off that are the best fighting members that Afghanistan has, and you put what they considered expendable Afghanistan soldiers on with our elite SEAL Team Six, especially when you know there are targets on their backs.  But when the families met General Harward, they said they were just so crushed, they were so devastated, and they found out that this AC-130 gunship, that there were opportunities to take out this patrol, this team, that shot down the Chinook and our SEAL team members. And there were other precious American lives on that helicopter in addition to the SEAL Team Six members, and they should not be shorted in when we owe them and their memories.  But they asked if they had an opportunity to take these guys out. And the crew said they did. They had the thermal imaging. They could see these guys moving like military. They could see them moving up to the high point and getting ready to fire. They asked for permission to take them out, and they were denied permission to take them out. They watched them fire over and over at the helicopters with the rocket-propelled grenades apparently of some kind, and they missed with the first one. As I understand it, they were still not allowed to shoot them down, take out the Afghan rebels. They fired again, and they fired again. And the second and third took out our precious American military members along with those precious Afghan lives who should never have been on that helicopter to begin with.  Then they watched them dismantle their equipment and start to climb down. They asked permission to take them out, it is my understanding, and, once again, they were told there may be civilians in the area, so, no, do not fire; and they watched them fade back into the population of Afghanistan after killing so many of our SEAL Team Six and others on the helicopter.  They asked the general who is now apparently going to be our National Security Adviser: Why didn't you take out these people, these Afghan radical Islamists? Why didn't you take them out before they took out our military members, our SEAL Team Six? Why?  His statement, from their memory, as related to me, was, in essence: Because we were trying to win hearts and minds.  Our National Security Adviser is going to be more interested in--or at least he has in the past--apparently has been more interested in winning hearts and minds of people that hate our guts than he is of protecting the most precious assets the United States of America has: American lives.[[Page H1235]]  We haven't won any hearts and minds by allowing SEAL Team Six--so many of those members on that Chinook--to be killed. We haven't. That strategy didn't work.  I am sorry. I want to be supportive. I was excited President Trump won, but when I know how this man, who I understand today has now been named to be the new National Security Adviser, was given the task of encouraging and being empathetic to the family members who lost those precious American family members in that Chinook that should never have been shot down, it should never have been allowed to take off, and the best he could do is say: Sorry, they had to die because we were trying to win hearts and minds instead of win the war.  I hope that his mentality has changed. I hope he will not be willing to expend the best trained, the best and brightest military members we have, as he tries to win hearts and minds instead of trying to win a battle and win the war; but I guess time will tell.  Mr.Speaker, I want to finish by saluting all those brave Americans that have defended freedom, that have fought for America, and who have responded in a voluntary military since 1979 and given their lives at the hands of radical I hope and pray this President will pick people from here who will have the same feelings about precious American lives.  I know Donald Trump does, and I think he will be a good I think he blew it on this call, but time will tell.

4592,topic-id,1097,"Mr.President, for too long, American families, farmers, and job creators have suffered under President Obama's regulatoryonslaught. His administration threw caution to wind, pumping out regulation after regulation and further entangling thegovernment into Americans' daily lives.  In November, the American people issued a strong rebuke to President Obama'soverreach and his administration's way of doing business.  They want a new direction. They want more accountability. They wantmore transparency. They want the government off their backs so that they can get back to making this country greatagain.  President-elect Trump has committed to working with Congress to roll back the regulatory overreach of the Obamaadministration, and to making the government more answerable to the people.  So, I rise today to introduce an important pieceof legislation that will help achieve these goals and ensure a more accountable and transparent government going forward.  Bysome estimates, Federal Government regulations impose over $2 trillion in compliance costs--on the American economy. The cost ofcomplying with all these regulations falls particularly heavy on small businesses.  It is no wonder why many Americanbusinesses have shut down or moved overseas. How many innovators dreamed of starting a small business but decided against itwhen faced with the burden and uncertainty of our regulatory state?  We have to do better.  The Federal Government should doeverything possible to promote job creation. To accomplish that, common sense would tell us that the government needs to removebureaucratic barriers rather than put up new ones.  But as we all know, the Obama administration showed time and again that itwould rather push forward with its regulatory agenda than ease the burden on our economy and job creators.  Adding insult toinjury, the Obama administration often kept folks in the dark about new regulatory initiatives.  Through secretive litigationtactics, the administration took end-runs around our nation's transparency and accountability laws. It is a strategy known assue-and-settle, and regulators have been using it to speed up rulemaking and keep the public away from the table when key policydecisions are made.  Sue-and-settle typically follows a similar pattern.  First, an interest group files a lawsuit against afederal agency, claiming that the agency has failed to take a certain regulatory action by a statutory deadline. The interestgroup seeks to compel the agency to take action by a new, often-rushed deadline. All too often, the plaintiff-interest groupwill be one that shares a common regulatory agenda with the agency that it sues, such as when an environmental group sues theEnvironmental Protection Agency,  Next, the agency and interest group enter into negotiations behind closed doors toproduce either a settlement agreement or consent decree that commits the agency to satisfy the interest group's demands. Theagreement is then approved by a court, binding executive discretion.  Noticeably absent from these negotiations, however, arethe very parties who will be most impacted by the resulting regulations.  Sue-and-settle tactics undermine transparency,public accountability, and the quality of public policy. They can have sweeping consequences. For example, the Obamaadministration's so-called Clean Power Plan, which is the most expensive regulation ever to be imposed on the energy industry,arose out of a sue-and-settle arrangement.  These tactics alsoundermine congressional intent.  The Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which has been called the citizens' ``regulatory billof rights,'' was[[Page S316]]enacted to ensure transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. A key protection is thenotice-and-comment process, which requires agencies to provide notice of proposed regulations and to respond to commentssubmitted by the public.  Rulemaking through sue-and-settle, however, frequently results in re-aligned agency agendas andshort deadlines for regulatory action. This makes the notice-and-comment process a mere formality. It deprives regulatedentities, the States and the general public of sufficient time to have any meaningful input.  The resulting regulatory actionis driven not by the public interest, but by special interest priorities, and can come as a complete surprise to those mostaffected by it.  Sue-and-settle litigation also helps agencies avoid accountability. Instead of having to answer to the publicfor controversial regulations and policy decisions, agency officials can just point to a court order entering the agreement andsay that they were required to take action under its terms.  We should also keep in mind that these agreements can havelasting impacts on the ability of future administrations to take a different policy approach--such as to remove regulatoryburdens on farmers. Not only does this raise serious concerns about bad public policy, it also puts into question theconstitutional impact of one administration's actions binding the hands of its successors.  Sue-and-settle, and theconsequences that come from such tactics, is not a new phenomenon. Evidence of sue-and-settle tactics and closed-door rulemakingcan be found in nearly every administration over the previous few decades.  But without a doubt, there was an alarmingincrease under the Obama administration. The U.Chamber of Commerce found that just during President Obama's first term, 60Clean Air Act lawsuits against the EPA were resolved through consent decrees or settlement agreements.  And since 2009, sue-and-settle cases against the EPA have imposed at least $13 billion in annual regulatory costs.  But we now have an opportunityto curb these abuses, and an incoming administration that has committed to reining in the regulators.  That is why today I amintroducing the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Senators Blunt, Inhofe, Cornyn, Cruz,Fischer, Rubio, Flake, Hatch, and Tillis are cosponsors of this important bill. And I'm pleased thatRepresentative Doug Collins introduced a companion bill today in the  The Sunshine bill increases transparency byshedding light on sue-and-settle tactics. It requires agencies to publish sue-and-settle complaints in a readily accessiblemanner.  It requires agencies to publish proposed consent decrees and settlement agreements at least 60 days before they canbe filed with a court. This provides a valuable opportunity for the public to weigh-in, which will increase accountability inthe rulemaking process.  The bill makes it easier for affected parties, such as States and businesses, to intervene in theselawsuits and settlement negotiations to ensure that their interests are properly represented. It requires the Attorney Generalto certify to a court that he or she has personally approved of the terms of certain proposed consent decrees or settlementagreements. And it requires courts to consider whether the terms of a proposed agreement are contrary to the publicinterest.  The bill also makes it easier for succeeding administrations to modify a prior administration's consent decrees.That way, one administration won't be forced to continue the regulatory excesses of another.  The Sunshine for RegulatoryDecrees and Settlements Act will shine light on the problem of sue-and-settle. It will help rein in backroom rulemaking,encourage the appropriate use of consent decrees and settlements, and reinforce the procedures that Congress laid out decadesago to ensure a transparent and accountable regulatory process.  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-12-pt1-PgS315.txt,457,1215,2017.0,12.0,February
4867,topic-id,799,"Mr.Speaker, as I have said before, we hope for the best from the new President, but we must prepare forthe worst.  Everyone who has looked at the record of the key advisers to President-elect Trump on the issue of immigration has reasonfor very deep concern that the new President is going to follow the advice of some of the most extreme voices in the immigrationdebate.  As for the new President himself, he is a bit of an unknown because he changes his mind on key issues just as quickly as hisTwitter feed refreshes. He says he has a plan for this and a plan for that, but they are secret plans, and, as far as we know,they are even secrets to him.  He knows more about computers and the Internet, ISIS and terrorists, Russia and NATO than all of the policy experts puttogether, and he thinks of himself as kind of the ultimate Presidential adviser to the new  But it is Trump's lieutenants who worry most of us. They are the most clearly ideological and dangerous set of leaders everassembled in American Government on immigration and any number of issues we care about.  They are vindictive when it comes to our immigrant community. The truth is that among the new President key advisers aresome of the staunchest opponents of legal immigration. They are against legal immigration. That is right.  While we all oppose illegal immigration, and some of us have been working for years to upgrade the American system so thatimmigrants come with visas instead of smugglers, the people with access to the Presidency disagree, and they don't wantimmigrants to come here at all from anywhere.  Look, we have made legal immigration extremely difficult for everyone and simply impossible for most people. And then wehave been relying on deportation, walls, enforcement, and curtailing due process rights for immigrants, and that constitutestheir immigration control strategy for the past 25 years. And it hasn't worked for 25 years.  But the American people want a humane, sustainable, secure, and effective legal immigration system and a way for people whoalready live and work here peacefully in America to be able to do so within the law.  So, Mr.Speaker, this is why I will join a few thousand allies here in Washington this Saturday at the historic MetropolitanAME Church on M Street to send a clear message that immigrants and their allies are standing up for immigrant communities.[[Page H305]]  And check out the Web site. The D.rally will be one of more than 50 public actions and marches across America on or aboutthis Saturday the 14th, where leaders of the immigrant rights' movement will stand alongside elected officials, faith, labor,education, and LGBTQ leaders to say: we will not allow mass deportation or immigrant roundups on our watch.                              {time}  1015  That we do not want endless delays that keep families waiting 10, 15, 20 years for a visa. That we don't want people to haveto choose between 10 years in exile or the green card for which they qualify under U.law because our laws have been craftedto punish people by keeping them in an undocumented status even when they can apply to be here legally. That we are committed todefending immigrant communities if and when the new President and his henchmen develop Muslim registries or neighborhood sweepsor mass roundups disguised as ``fugitive sweeps.''  We will fight attempts to criminalize immigrants and fight attempts to take away documents from people who are now in thesystem and working on the books, like the 750,000 young people who signed up for With the BRIDGE Act, we will fight sothat DREAMers are protected from deportation and can lead the fight for millions and millions of other immigrants who have nooptions under our current law.

And for Latinos under 18, the percentage of Latinos who are U.citizens is 93 percent. Sodon't think you can deport us into silence.

I will not begrudge any Senator for taking advantage of the privileges offered to them under the rules of the Senate; however, I think we have ample reason to question some of our colleagues' judgment and priorities with regard to how we have dealt with the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to the Office of Treasury Secretary.[[Page S1102]]  Let's get the obvious points out of the way. Mr.Mnuchin has 30 years' experience working in a variety of capacities in the financial sector. He has experience managing large and complicated private-sector enterprises and in negotiating difficult compromises and making tough decisions--and being accountable for those decisions. He has the support of a number of key organizations and associations within the finance industry, and experts across the ideological spectrum have endorsed his nomination.  Long story short: Under any objective standard, Mr.Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials, and qualifications for this important position. Yet my colleagues have done all they can under the rules--even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate--in order to delay his confirmation.  I will not relive the entire chain of events that got this nomination through the Finance Committee, bringing us to this point. For now, I would urge my colleagues to look fairly at the record. In every case, as the committee processed his nomination, Mr.Mnuchin responded to questions and allegations with full and complete answers and demonstrated no signs of acting or responding in bad faith toward the committee or its members.  People are free, I suppose, to walk into the confirmation process with an assumption of bad faith. But throughout my time in the Senate--and keep in mind, I have been here a long time--that isn't usually how we operate around here.  My colleagues on the other side have put forward a number of claims and allegations about Mr.They have essentially thrown everything, including the kitchen sink, at this nominee in a desperate attempt to block his confirmation. Well, so far, nothing has worked. That is because none of the allegations my colleagues have raised can withstand even a modest amount of scrutiny. But that hasn't stopped some of them from trying.  I have found it particularly interesting to see my friends raise concerns about matters that did not bother them in the least when it came to voting for Democratic nominees for Treasury Indeed, with regard to Mr.Mnuchin, my Democratic colleagues have created a wholly new set of standards from those that were applied to the most recent previous Treasury Many issues that seemed to be of little or no concern to my colleagues and my friends on the other side during the confirmation process for Secretary Jack Lew have been considered disqualifying for Mr.By the way, many of these problems existed in the prior Treasury Secretary too. But we, in good faith, brought him through and allowed him to go through without a lot of fuss and bother.  Let me review just a few of the discrepancies that are claimed.  Mr.Mnuchin placed some investments offshore, in full conformity with the law and not for the purpose of avoiding U.taxes. But my friends have simply asserted that no one uses offshore financial vehicles unless they are trying to avoid U.taxes, and, therefore, Mr.Mnuchin's investments disqualify him to serve as Treasury Yet Secretary Lew, prior to his confirmation, actually made investments in the famous Ugland House in the Cayman Islands, which President Obama described as ``outrageous'' and ``the biggest tax scheme in the world.'' My Democratic colleagues knew this, but did not care, and happily confirmed Secretary Lew with hardly a mention of this matter. We allowed him to go through, in the interest of civility and getting along with our colleagues.  Democrats have argued that Mr.Mnuchin unduly profited from the housing market collapse. Yet Secretary Lew, prior to his nomination, ran ``proprietary trading'' groups at Citigroup, where they invested in a hedge fund that bet heavily on the collapse of the housing market. My Democratic colleagues knew this, but did not care, and happily confirmed Secretary Lew without really ever acknowledging this part of his record.  Democrats claim that Mr.Mnuchin unfairly foreclosed on homeowners, despite evidence to the contrary. Yet Secretary Lew, prior to being nominated, ran a Citigroup division that was, according to arbitration panels at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and later the SEC, ``defrauding investors.'' When asked about the toxic securities sold by his Citigroup unit, Secretary Lew's answers varied between not remembering any specific securities to claiming he somehow wasn't involved in the investment decisions made at the Citigroup unit he oversaw. My Democratic colleagues knew this, but they did not care, and happily confirmed Secretary Lew without anything resembling full and complete answers to these questions.  Despite ample evidence to the contrary, Democrats claim that Mr.Mnuchin ran a ``robo-signing'' foreclosure machine. Yet Citigroup, while Jack Lew was in senior management, sliced and diced mortgages and was alleged to have ``robo-signed'' mortgage documents. Democrats knew this, but they did not care, and happily confirmed Secretary Lew without ever really asking him about these issues.  I can go on and on. There are many other issues that my colleagues were willing to overlook, if not outright ignore, with regard to Secretary Lew that have resulted in hyperbolic attacks on Mr. I wish to remind my colleagues that despite the numerous concerns that I and others have had about Secretary Lew and the many significant disagreements that I had with President Obama's agenda, I voted in favor of Secretary Lew's confirmation. On this very floor, I stated the following:       I have always believed that . . . [the] President--any      President, regardless of party--is owed a certain degree of      deference when choosing people to work in his administration.

4639,topic-id,3531,"Mr.President, it is observed that we are being asked to confirm a Treasury Secretary who helped bring about the 2008 financial crisis and profited off the misery that followed.  During his campaign, President Trump promised to crack down on Wall Street abuses. In one of his campaign ads, the President said that the CEO of Goldman Sachs was part of a ``global elite'' that was ``robbing our working class.'' He said that on Wall Street, ``It's the powerful protecting only the powerful.''  Given his campaign promises, it is astounding that President Trump nominated Steve Mnuchin, someone whose business record embodies the worst abuses from the financial crisis, to serve as Secretary of the  In the fall of 2008, when I served in the U.House, then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson came to Capitol Hill and painted a dire picture. He told us that without drastic intervention by Congress and the White House, the entire global financial system would collapse. The situation was so dire, he argued, that we could not even pause to provide additional, meaningful relief to the millions of families across the country facing home foreclosures.  In the years that followed, we learned a lot more about just how bad things were. Many banks sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them, packaged those mortgages into complex financial instruments, colluded with ratings agencies, and sold those ``products'' as solid investments.  The American people stepped in with hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out Wall But without effective, broad laws in place before the financial crisis to prevent predatory lending, millions of people lost their homes and trillions of dollars in household wealth. Many of those victims have yet to recover.  That was bad enough as it was unfolding, but in the years that followed, we learned more and more about the numerous abuses these banks perpetrated on the American people.  After years of pushing subprime loans on minority homeowners who couldn't afford them, foreclosures devastated minority communities across the country. According to a 2010 study by the Center for Responsible Lending, minority homeowners were 70 percent more likely to lose their homes in foreclosure proceedings.  Many banks also violated judicial foreclosure proceedings when they signed hundreds of thousands of foreclosure documents without reviewing them, also known as robo-signing.  Some of my colleagues might argue that it isn't worth rehashing this devastating economic history, but I disagree because today we will be asked to vote for a Treasury nominee whose questionable business practices earned him the title of ``Foreclosure King.''  As a senior executive at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, Steve Mnuchin was an evangelist for the types of financial transactions--credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations--that crashed the economy in 2008. He said these instruments were ``an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses effectively.'' What was essentially just business to him devastated the economy and the lives of millions of people.  As the CEO of OneWest, Mnuchin was deeply involved in subprime lending and was responsible for tens of thousands of foreclosures across the country. Under Mr.Mnuchin's leadership, OneWest was among the worst offenders in robo-signing foreclosure documents. While he denied this fact during his confirmation hearing, a vice president at OneWest admitted to signing 750 documents per week while spending less than 30 seconds on each one. In other words, he was very busy robo-signing these documents.  Under Mr.Mnuchin's leadership, a OneWest subsidiary, Financial Freedom, foreclosed on more than 16,000 seniors who were living on fixed incomes and who had reverse mortgages with that company. In one case, the company foreclosed on a 90-year-old woman's home over a 27-cent debt.  Hundreds of families across Hawaii who had mortgages with OneWest felt the impact of Steve Mnuchin's business practices personally.  In 2013, I received a letter from Suzanne on the Big Suzanne is a retired Navy civilian. She depends on her disability and retirement income to afford her modest home in She had her mortgage through When she wrote to me, her home was in court-ordered mediation pending foreclosure. Suzanne went into mediation in good faith, assuming that OneWest would assist her with a loan modification. Well, she was wrong. Suzanne and OneWest agreed that before she signed any modification, she would receive a written offer that included the full terms of the agreement. But during their second mediation meeting, in violation of the agreement, OneWest told Suzanne that she owed $30,000 more than her records showed and made a unilateral offer without disclosing any of the terms, contrary to what they had agreed to.  Suzanne wisely refused to accept the so-called offer. At the time that she wrote to me, OneWest was pushing a judge to proceed with her foreclosure. ``I can afford my home,'' she wrote. ``I want to keep my home, but the difference between $1,300 and $1,500 a month is huge.''  OneWest has billions and is considering going public this year.  She went on to say: ``They have made unreasonable offers, lost paperwork, ignored requests. All the nightmares you hear about on the news, well, consider me a poster child.''  Suzanne asked us to write to Steve Mnuchin on her behalf, even though she knew that OneWest had a record of hanging homeowners like her out to dry. She said: ``It seems to me that Mr.Mnuchin was one of the architects of our meltdown.'' She is right.  There are tens of thousands of stories from OneWest customers like Suzanne across the country, and Mr.Mnuchin is responsible for each one of them as CEO of Now President Trump is asking us to confirm Mr.Mnuchin to serve as Treasury  Throughout his campaign, President Trump made it clear that he wants to dismantle Dodd-Frank, eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and roll back financial regulations that would prevent another financial crisis. As Treasury Secretary, Mr.Mnuchin would be charged with implementing this agenda.  Credible economists have warned that we could end up in another financial crisis. My question is, Who would a Secretary Mnuchin try to save--Wall Street or the millions of people who will be adversely impacted? His record shows which path Steve Mnuchin[[Page S1100]]would choose. That is why I call on my colleagues to oppose this nomination.  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Young).

I will have more to say on Mr.Mnuchin and Shulkin tomorrow, but for now I look forward to their confirmation this evening.  After we work with these nominees, we will continue to put the rest of President Trump's Cabinet in place.  It has been really disappointing to see the historic level of obstruction by Senate I would like to remind our colleagues across the aisle of the very real consequences their actions have on our country and on the men and women forced to work grueling hours to keep the Senate running overnight last week.  There are so many who worked around the clock to keep the Senate operating and I would like to offer some words of thanks now.  First, I would like to start with our floor staff led by Laura Dove on the Republican side and Gary Myrick on the Democratic side. They, along with the cloakroom staff and floor teams, worked nonstop to allow us to keep the floor running smoothly. So I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication.  I would also like to recognize the Senate pages, who didn't miss a beat just 2 weeks into their new job. They are Hailey Maggelet, Cameron Mabry, Shelby Hogan, Elizabeth Flachbart, Chris An, Sammy Potter, Sydney Jones, Cynthia Yue, Avery Beard, Wade Quigley, Eddie Owens, Hannah Seawell, Chloe Smith, Bryant Reynolds, Taylor Ball, Mitchell Heiman, Drew Beussink, Harrison Bushnell, Lauren Cavignano, Mitchell Durbin, Allie Glassman, Pablo Gomez Garcia, Julia Graham, Savannah Hampton, Argenis Herrera, Riley Johnson, Holly Newman, Colin Solomon, Katrina Turner, and Kayla I know we are all impressed by these young men and women, and we all appreciate the role they play in our Nation's government.  There are so many others, like Sergeant at Arms Frank Larkin and his Deputy, Jim Morhard, who work tirelessly behind the scenes to keep the Capitol running smoothly. I would like to thank their team: the doorkeepers, the Senate recording and television studio, the Press Galleries, the IT and technical support, and the help desk, the security and operations teams, the executive office, and the Capitol exchange operators, who oversee the many calls that come into Senate offices. Many of these teams provided support literally around the clock, and we are thankful.  Of course, none of this would have been possible without the Capitol Police, headed by Chief of Police Matthew These men and women worked overtime to ensure the safety of the Senate Chamber and the entire Capitol as Members and their staffs worked through the night. We thank them for their service and for keeping us safe every day.  I would also like to thank the Secretary of the Senate, Julie Adams, Assistant Secretary Mary Suit Jones, and their entire team.  Specifically, I would like to thank the following offices and staffers, many of whom who worked for more than 50 straight hours: the Official Reporters of Debates, which include Patrick Renzi, Susie Nguyen, Julia Jones, Mary Carpenter, Patrice Boyd, Octavio Colominas, Alice Haddow, Andrea Huston, Carol Darche, Desirae Jura, Megan McKenzie, Wendy Caswell, Diane Dorhamer, Mark Stuart, and Julie Bryan; the Captioning Services team, which includes Sandra Schumm, Brenda Jamerson, Doreen Chendorain, Jennifer Smolka, and Laurie  In addition to the offices I just named, I would also like to recognize the following legislative offices: The Bill Clerk, the Enrolling Clerk, the Executive Clerk, the Journal Clerk, the Legislative Clerk, the Daily Digest, and, of course, the  Lastly, I would like to thank our subway drivers and the Government Publishing Office, which worked tirelessly to get the Record printed.  We are also grateful for the long hours and sacrifice that each of these offices and staffers made last week. Of course, it was completely unnecessary but, nevertheless, they were here through the night.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, now, one final matter. When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named his first nominee to the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's nomination was not without controversy. She had argued for positions that are still quite controversial today. For example, she had questioned the constitutionality of laws against bigamy because they implicated private relationships. For the same reason, she had opined that there might be a constitutional right to prostitution. She always advocated for coeducational prisons and juvenile facilities. She even proposed abolishing Mother's  So you can understand why Senators wanted to get her views on issues that might come before her as a Justice, but when pressed at her confirmation hearing, here is what she had to say:       You are well aware that I came to this proceeding to be      judged as a judge, not as an advocate. Because I am and hope      to continue to be a judge, it would be wrong for me to say or      preview in this legislative chamber how I would cast my vote      on questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide.      Were I to rehearse here what I would say and how I would      reason on such questions, I would act injudiciously. Judges      in our system are bound to decide concrete cases, not      abstract issues.  She went on:       A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecasts,      no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the      specifics of a particular case, it would display disdain for      the entire judicial process.  So summing it up, she said: No hints, no forecasts, no previews, and that is what has become known as the Ginsburg standard. Supreme Court nominees of Presidents of both parties have adhered to it.  For example, President Clinton's second nominee, Stephen Breyer, noted that ``there is nothing more important to a judge than to have an open mind and to listen carefully to arguments,'' and so he told the Judiciary Committee he did ``not want to predict or commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court.'' That meant, he said, not discussing ``how'' a ``right applies, where it applies, under what circumstances'' it applies.  When his nomination to be Chief Justice was pending, John Roberts said that adhering to the principle embodied in the Ginsburg standard is ``of great importance not only to potential Justices but to judges, which most nominees to the Supreme Court already are.''  ``We're sensitive,'' he said, ``to the need to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court.''  Let me repeat that. The Chief Justice said this principle was necessary ``to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court.''  He then explained how the Ginsburg standard helps maintain that independence. Nominees, he said, ``go on the Court not as a delegate from [the Judiciary] Committee with certain commitments laid out and how they're going to approach cases.''  Rather, ``[T]hey go on the Court as Justices who will approach cases with an open mind and decide those cases in light of the arguments presented, the record presented, and the rule of law.[[Page S1101]]And the litigants before them,'' he concluded, ``have a right to expect that and to have the appearance of that as well. That has been the approach that all of the Justices have taken.''  At the time, my colleague from New York and other Senate Democrats were upset that the Chief Justice followed Justice Ginsburg's approach--even though many of them didn't complain when she refused to preview or prejudge legal issues during her confirmation hearing.  But guess who came to the Chief Justice's defense. Justice She felt compelled to depart from protocol and weigh in on the matter. She said: ``Judge Roberts was unquestionably right'' in refusing to preview or prejudge legal issues at his confirmation hearing.  Both of President Obama's nominees adhered to the Ginsburg standard as well. His first nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, explained that what her ``experience on the trial court and the appellate court have reinforced for me is that the process of judging is a process of keeping an open mind. It's the process,'' she continued, ``of not coming to a decision with a prejudgment ever of an outcome. . . . `' That process, she said, applied not only to the cases that would come before her on the Supreme Court if she were confirmed but that could come before her in her then-current capacity as a circuit court judge.  Most Senators of both parties have respected the Ginsburg standard.  For example, during her hearing, Senator Leahy told Justice Ginsburg that he ``certainly'' didn't want her ``to have to lay out a test here in the abstract which might determine what [her] vote or [her] test would be in a case [she had] yet to see that may well come before the Supreme Court.'' Even my friend from New York has recognized the Ginsburg Standard is a ``grand tradition.''  The far left has been pushing my counterpart and other Senate Democrats to oppose anyone--anyone--whom the President nominates to the Supreme So the Ginsburg standard is given way to the double standard.  My friend from New York now says this Supreme Court nominee has to pass some ``special test''--some ``special test''--to show his judicial independence. He says Judge Gorsuch, a highly respected, experienced jurist, must preview his approach or even prejudge legal issues that could come before him, like whether the President's Executive order on refugee vetting is ``constitutional.'' This is clearly an effort to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge not a matter that could be in the Federal courts but to prejudge on a matter that is in the Federal courts right now.  Senator Schumer is not alone in wanting to replace the Ginsburg standard with a new double standard. His colleague who serves on the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Connecticut, also says that Judge Gorsuch, for the first time with Supreme Court nominees, has some ``special obligation''--some ``special obligation''--to give his views on ``specific issues,'' without the benefit of the judicial process that Justice Sotomayor noted was so important.  Under our colleagues' approach, there is no need to review the record in the case, no need to do any legal research, no need to hear the best arguments from each side, no need to deliberate with your colleagues on the bench to arrive at a correct result. Just give a driveby legal conclusion on a complicated and consequential matter of constitutional law.  Let's be clear about what is going on here. This new ``special test'' and ``special obligation'' aren't about ensuring Judge Gorsuch's judicial independence; they are about compromising it. Our friends on the other side of the aisle want to constrain his ability to rule in a later case according to the facts and the law by holding him to what he said in their meetings or what he said under oath at his hearing.  In the upside down world of my Democratic friends, Judge Gorsuch must lose his judicial independence--both as a sitting circuit court judge and as a future Supreme Court Justice--in order to prove his judicial independence.  As Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor all noted, the process of judging is about having an open mind, seeing what the facts are in a particular case, hearing the arguments on both sides, and making what the judge believes is the correct ruling according to the law. It is not about a judge hemming himself in before a legislative body by previewing how he would view a legal issue, or, as Senator Leahy noted, announcing the legal test he might apply in a particular case, and it is definitely not about that judge saying whether something in the abstract is constitutional.  So under this double standard, Senators must respect the need for judicial independence of the Supreme Court nominees of Democratic Presidents, even when those nominees espouse views that are far, far outside the mainstream, like suggesting there is a constitutional right to prostitution or urging the abolition of Mother's  Under this double standard, Senators can compromise the judicial independence of clearly mainstream Supreme Court nominees of Republican Presidents, even when those nominees are, like Judge Gorsuch, well-known proponents of maintaining judicial independence, who have a long record on the issue.  That is not just my view of Judge Gorsuch's commitment to judicial independence, by the way; that is according to prominent Democratic lawyers like President Obama's top litigator in the Supreme  This Democratic double standard, though, is not surprising. Recall that the Democratic leader said he was prepared to keep Justice Scalia's seat open for 4 years--4 years. That was made difficult by the nomination of an outstanding candidate like Judge  So our colleague came up with a new supermajority standard for his confirmation--a standard that didn't exist for seven of the eight Justices currently on the Court--a fact my friend later had to admit.  The Democratic double standard on requiring nominees to prejudge issues is just the latest attempt to come up with something, with anything--anything--to justify opposing an exceptional nominee like Judge Judge Gorsuch is one of the most impressive, most highly qualified nominees to ever come before us. He has won kudos from across the political spectrum. Even the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee couldn't help but praise him.  Instead of appreciating that our new President has nominated an accomplished, independent, and thoughtful jurist, Democrats are viewing this outstanding nominee as a political problem. Their base is demanding total resistance to everything, but they can't find a good reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch on the merits. They are in a pickle.  So we have this attempt to replace the bipartisan Ginsburg standard with the double standard. I understand the difficulty of their situation, but the standard we are going to follow with this nominee is the same one--the same one--we followed for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and every other Justice on the Court since then: no hints, no forecasts, no previews, fair consideration, and an up-or-down vote.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

I hope that this trip--and the response that the American people across these great States--showed, as an example to our colleagues, that bipartisanship is a real thing; that people care and want to see folks working together and to stop retreating to their tired corners and instead try to talk about what we need to do to do the work of the American people.

4781,topic-id,3071,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, and the answer is, yes, I am prepared.                       Bilateral Trade Agreements  Mr.President, President Trump is meeting this weekend with Japanese Prime Minister Abe, and so I want to take this opportunity to talk about the need for bilateral trade deals.  We have heard during the campaign and since he has been elected President of the United States that Donald Trump has not been adverse to trade. He said he is for fair trade. I think that makes sense, that we should have it.  I would like to talk about some of the problems that are there that I think he can correct that had not been corrected by the previous administration.  Bilateral trade agreements with our key allies should be a priority for this Congress, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to ensure that these agreements grow American exports, especially for our agriculture and our energy producers.  For full disclosure, I must admit that my State of Oklahoma is a major ag State and also a major energy  Of our many key allies, I want to highlight three opportunities for the United States to engage in bilateral trade agreements with three countries: Japan, Taiwan, and then many of the countries in Sub-Saharan  Japan has the third largest economy in the world, but American farmers and ranchers are limited in their ability to access them, and this is why: They have very high tariffs on things we would want to export to At the same time, we are buying their automobiles. We are buying their products. And that is one of the typical examples of what I think our new President has been referring to. He wants to have the deals that benefit equally America and our partners. I think we can really do that.  We should engage with Japan to develop bilateral trade agreements with a focus on providing new and commercially meaningful market access for agricultural exports and smoothing the way for increased energy exports. In particular, Oklahoma beef producers are chomping at the bit to get more access to the Japanese market.  In addition to agriculture, my State is an energy State, as I mentioned, and Japan is a nation that is hungry for energy. In fact, Japan has accounted for 37 percent of global LNG purchases since 2012. LNG is liquefied natural gas. I am biased because we are a major producer in the State of It is something they need, and they need to get it from someone. We ought to make this a bilateral arrangement. A trade agreement with Japan would streamline the current lengthy and pretty cumbersome process for LNG exports to Japan, ensuring that they have a reliable source of energy production and providing jobs to Oklahoma at home.  In addition to Japan, Taiwan is a close friend and ally to the United States and our ninth largest trading partner. As I happen to be the chairman of the Taiwan Caucus, I know firsthand how important it is to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, which we can do by engaging in direct bilateral trade agreement negotiations with that country. There is no reason for us not to.  I believe that a key component of any trade agreement, including with Taiwan, is an effort to ensure that food safety and animal health regulations are aligned and based on science to ensure that any differences do not become non-tariff trade barriers. This would enable us to directly address the ban Taiwan has against U.pork because we use an ingredient called ractopamine in our feed to keep the hogs lean. It is perfectly safe, but Taiwan uses that as an excuse to block imports of our pork to their country. This is an issue I have already brought up with the Trump administration and with Wilbur Ross, who is waiting for confirmation as the next Secretary of That is why we need bilateral trade agreements with Japan and  Our trade relations with counties in Africa are also important because, according to the Economist magazine, six of the world's fastest growing economies were in Sub-Saharan Africa from the year 2000 to 2010. For too long Sub-Saharan Africa has been ignored as a trading partner for the American In fact, they pretty much have been ignored anyway.  I can remember when the continent of Africa was in three different commands. They had the Pacific Command, European Command, and Central For this continent with its significance, I was somewhat instrumental in changing that, in establishing a new command, which is called the The same thing has been true in terms of not using it as a trading partner.  For the last 20 years, I have been--I think I made my 144th African country visit--working with that continent, and I have seen firsthand the vast potential that is there. When they say[[Page S1005]]their economies are growing--and a lot of times they say ``Well, we are not interested in doing that'' because they are not large enough yet.  Last year, Congress enacted my ``Africa Free Trade Initiative Act,'' which requires government agencies--the USTR, USAID, and other agencies--to collaborate on efforts to build trade-based capacity in African nations. This is a step in the right direction for America to partner with and secure deeper ties to the fastest growing economies in Sub-Saharan  While some in our government may not deem Sub-Saharan African countries ready for deeper collaborations on trade with the United States, let me tell you what is going to happen if we don't. We still have this country called Right now, China has become very active in What you hear in Africa is, America will tell you what you need, but China builds what you need. The problem with that is, that doesn't help Africa, and Africans know this, because China imports their own labor to build all these things.  So this is one of the things we are looking at where we can actually come out ahead if we will get in on the ground floor and get involved with these economically active countries. And we need to focus more on building trade in legal capacities so that they are ready to do trade agreements, and when that time comes, they will be doing it with us and helping their economies grow. That is what our economic assistance should be all about. They grow, and we are going to grow with them.  That is a go of what was enacted in last year's African Free Trade Initiative Act, and I will continue my work with the new administration to ensure that African nations are not left behind.  With China's rising economic might, we need to strengthen America's current relationships with some of our strongest Asian allies, such as Japan and Taiwan, with new bilateral trade agreements, and this will help counter China's growing influence if that region too.  Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and manufacturers need competitive access to international markets to sell Oklahoma-grown and Oklahoma-produced products. New agreements with our allies would generate more economic activity and create jobs not just in Oklahoma but throughout  I think this is the thing that the new administration is talking about when he says we need to have--there is no justification for arrangements where we are not able to have a comparable tariff arrangement where the countries can trade with each other, and that is what we anticipate doing.  Let me mention one other thing. I know that the Senators on the other side of the aisle are spending a lot of time blocking or trying to block the nominations by this Every once in a while, I have to get on the floor and remind them that it is not going to work. You know they are all going to be confirmed. The votes are there, and you can say anything you want about some of the fine people who have been nominated by this  I was privileged to visit with President Trump in Trump Tower before he was I can remember going up there to visit and seeing the people who would be advisers and the types of people he was going to be nominating, and it was very impressive. Now we have gone through a situation where the Democrats in the Senate have stalled these nominations. They stalled them longer than they have ever been stalled in the history of America, going all the way back to George All we are doing is wasting time that we could be acting productively in correcting some of the problems we have in this country.                             Overregulation  There is another issue. I was fortunate enough to spend several years as the chairman and ranking member of a committee in Congress called the Environment and Public Works It has a very large jurisdiction. It is a committee that deals with--as the title infers--environment and public works, environmental and some of the overregulation that we have had, and created real serious problems.  Also, we have been successful in passing a lot of the initiatives, such as the FAST That was the largest transportation reauthorization bill since 1998. So we have done a lot of good things there.  One of the problems we have had--that we dealt with in that committee and will continue to under the chairmanship of Senator Barrasso--is doing something about the overregulation. This has been a problem, serious problem. In 2\1/2\ months between the Presidential election and Inauguration Day, the Obama administration produced over 200 rulemakings; 41 of which are considered economically significant rules, rules that would result in $100 million or more in annual costs. Over the course of his administration, President Obama added 481 economically significant regulations to the Federal registry, over 100 more than the Bush or the Clinton administration.  Regulations cost our citizens, at the current time, $1.89 trillion a year and more than 580 million hours of paperwork in order to comply with this staggering amount of rules. People don't realize the cost of rules. When they made such an effort, starting way back in 2002, to pass legislation that was aimed at trying to get into some type of an arrangement on global warming--and all of this to restrict emissions--they didn't realize at that time, until the bills got on the floor, that the cost to such cap and trade--a type of regulation--is between $300 and $400 billion a year to the American people.  Every time I see a large figure coming from Oklahoma--I get the latest figures from Oklahoma, in terms of what has happened economically in the previous year--those regulations would cost the average family who pays Federal income tax in my State of Oklahoma an addition of $3,000 a year, and by their own admission, it wouldn't accomplish anything.  I can remember as chairman of that committee, we had Lisa Lisa Jackson was the Administrator of the EPA, the first one that President Obama had appointed. I asked her the question live on TV, in an open meeting, I said: If we were to pass, either by regulation or by legislation, the cap-and-trade legislation that they are talking about passing, and have been talking about, would this reduce CO2 emissions worldwide? Her answer: No, it wouldn't because this isn't where the problem is. If it is not going to accomplish something, even if you believe the world is coming to an end because of fossil fuels, doing something in the United States is not going to correct it. But that is the cost of rules. That is what we are looking at right now.  We went through 481 significant regulations during the Obama administration. At the last minute, after President Obama realized that Hillary Clinton was not going to win, he got involved in what we refer to as ``midnight regulations.'' He had several of these last-minute regulations he was trying to get in after the election took place--and he knew who was going to be the next President--before the next President took office. One such midnight regulation, finalized January 13, is the Environmental Protection Agency's rule entitled ``Accidental Release Prevention Requirements for Risk Management Programs Under the Clean Air Act.'' EPA states that the purpose of the updated rule ``is to improve safety in facilities that use and distribute hazardous chemicals.'' As you can imagine, environmentalists will not be happy if this rule is changed, but I argue this rule does not make facilities or surrounding communities safer. In fact, it could put them at greater risk.  There are several concerns with this rule, but the biggest one is the national security implications due to the rule's public disclosure requirements. Under this rule, facilities are required to share information on the types of chemicals stored there and the security vulnerabilities with emergency responders, and upon request, to the general public. The rule does not provide for the protection of this information from further disclosure once it is provided. It is well known that terrorists have considered attacks on chemical facilities as a way to kill citizens and cause mass destruction in our communities, and of course requiring the disclosure of this information to anyone whose asks is very reckless and impossible to understand. We can't figure out why they would do that. The terrorists would have access to the same information, which would make their job a lot easier.[[Page S1006]]  Congress has passed several bills to protect just this kind of information. I was even the author of one of these bills. Under the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 1999, the distribution of sensitive information from chemical facilities is limited to publicly available Federal reading rooms and certain Federal, State and local officials and researchers who are then barred from further disseminating the information. This makes sense. We need local officials to know what they should do in the event there is a problem, but our enemies should not be able to get this information. It is fine, except you don't want to give it to our enemies, those who are in the terrorist community.  The new rule by the EPA does not provide any of these protections to the information now required to be shared upon request, to include audit reports, exercise schedules and summaries, emergency response details--all of which would provide those intent on criminal acts with a blueprint of facility and emergency response vulnerabilities. This is exactly what they want to perform their terrorist activities. The requirement does not make these facilities safer but actually increases the chance of harm to be done to them.  The sole reason this rule was updated by the Obama administration stems from the West, TX, chemical plant explosion of 2013. Yet this rule on accidental release prevention would do nothing to prevent another West, TX, because that explosion and fire was intentional. It was an act of arson. The Obama administration used this tragedy that took 15 lives as an excuse to make these facilities and surrounding communities less safe, and it doesn't make sense, unless you look at what else the rule does.  This rule is the first step in EPA expanding its authority under the Clean Air Act to mandate how chemicals are manufactured and used. We just passed a bill, on a bipartisan basis, that takes care of this problem. You don't have to worry about that anymore. The EPA is requiring paper, petroleum, coal, and chemical manufacturing industries to conduct safer technology and alternative analysis, STAA, as part of their process hazard analysis. In conducting this STAA, these industries must consider what they call inherently safer technologies, IST, or inherently safer designs, This sounds good, but it is something that is so ambiguous nobody knows what the real definition is.  While the rule stops short of requiring EPA's approval of these STAAs or requiring the implementation of IST and ISDs, it is only a matter of time before the environmental groups begin to litigate the issue and act as escorts to force EPA to mandate these majors. This is the proverbial camel's nose under the tent. Industry will tell you that the best time to assess inherently safer technologies and designs is during the initial design phase.  Furthermore, industries are constantly evaluating their processes and making changes at the margins based on what works best for the products and customers. Allowing the EPA to become a part of that conversation adds a third party to the question that does not care about the company, the product or the consumers. The inherent safety of a technology or design is a relative standard. What might be safer in one company or product, does not mean it is going to be safer within a process that is completely different and in a different company.  For example, it may be inherently safe to store or use less of a hazardous material, but that would likely increase the number of shutdowns and startups due to not having enough materials on hand. Research shows that the shutting down and restarting of a chemical process poses a greater risk than continuous operation would.  Additionally, you would increase deliveries and movement of hazardous material throughout the surrounding communities, shifting the risk elsewhere. How can we say definitely that is safer? As you can see, there is no definitive answer to what would be inherently safer. It is an ambiguous term. It means it is very difficult to define.  Allowing the EPA's foot in the door on this would only lead to a heavier hand mandate that would hurt industries, consumers, jobs, and ultimately the valued public. This rule is promulgated on the premise of preventing another West, TX, tragedy, but this rule does nothing to protect facilities from intentional actions of a criminal or a terrorist and in fact would actually be in a position to aid them in their quest to do us harm.  I only outlined a couple of the many concerns this rule creates. I believe we should take a look at what this actually does.  It is not just this rule. As I said, President Obama went in at the last minute and did these midnight rules. This is one of the things we can look forward to doing away with, some of the overregulation that has cost Americans so much over the last 8 years.  With that, I yield the floor.

4785,topic-id,1387,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that these answers to four questions that have been raised in the last few days in the media be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Four Examples of the Liberal Character Assassination of Tom Price       Even the great Perry Mason would be stumped by this one.      Democrats, with the help of an eager media, have attempted a      character assassination of Tom Price, M.D., President      Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human      Despite an impeccable record in both public service and      medicine, they insisted Price's good name, built      throughout decades of serving others, did not belong to him      anymore.        And they almost got away with it. Here's how it happened.       Exhibit A: New York Magazine forecasts Price character      assassination.       Buried in a December 27 story in New York Magazine, then-     incoming-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY)      broadcasts that he has unanimous Democratic opposition to a      single Trump nominee: Tom He plans to inflict as      much pain as possible on the HHS pick, and Democratic      staffers indicate they'll delay the process as long as      possible.       ``Senate Democrats appear to be unanimous in their      opposition to Tom Price, Trump's choice for Health and Human      Services secretary, and they hope to raise such a ruckus      about Medicare during Price's hearings that at least three      Republicans decide to vote against Price, too, thus handing      Democrats their first scalp of the Trump era.       ``According to various Senate aides, Schumer doesn't      believe his party has a chance of torpedoing any other Trump      nominees, but he hopes to make their confirmations as      bruising--and, with smart floor management, as prolonged--as      possible. (Schumer himself decided to comment.) `The goal      will be to show the public how controversial these      nominations are,' explains a Senate Democratic aide.''       Evidence A: http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/12/who-will-do-what-harry-reid-did-now-that-harry-reid-is-gone.html       Exhibit B: Democrats, with help from media, begin Zimmer      Biomet smear.       In mid-January 2017, CNN began nonstop coverage of what      they believed was a bombshell story that would rock the HHS      nomination process. Price, they claimed, introduced      legislation to benefit a medical device manufacturer, Zimmer      Biomet, whose stock he owned.       ``Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical      device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that      would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics      concerns for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for      Health and Human Services secretary.''       The written piece breathlessly continues that theirs is the      ``latest example of Price trading stock in a healthcare firm      at the same time as pursuing legislation that could impact a      company's share price.''       Predictably, Schumer and his henchmen began gleefully      alleging on television that Price potentially broke      federal law--a law that calls for up to 15 years of      imprisonment if broken.       Except none of what CNN said happened actually happened.       1) Price's Morgan Stanley broker purchased the Zimmer      Biomet stock without his knowledge as a part of a routine      rebalancing of his portfolio on March 17, 2016. They notified      Price on April 4, 2016. He disclosed it in his filings on      April 15, 2016.       2) The 26 stocks, totaling less than $2,700, were so small,      in fact, that even Zimmer Biomet, like Price, was not      even aware that he was a stockholder.       3) The legislation CNN and others keep referencing concerns      Price's well-documented efforts, including a 2015 letter      and subsequent bill, requesting the delay of a rule issued by            4) While CNN claims this would have benefitted Zimmer      Biomet, the company actually supports the CMS rule and      publicly opposed Price's legislation,       So, CNN (and Congressional Democrats musing about alleged      crimes punishable by imprisonment) runs--and reruns and      reruns--a story about Price potentially breaking the law      or behaving unethically and doesn't even get the story      correct about Zimmer Biomet's position on the very      legislation they claim he introduced for them? Way to go,      guys.       Evidence B: http://www.freebeacon.com/issues/dem-accusations-regarding-tom-prices-stock-trades- unsubstantiated.       Exhibit C: Democrats, with help from media, go low with      Innate Immuno play.       In a salacious twist, media and Democrats turn their      attention to Australian medical company Innate At the      recommendation of another Member of Congress, Price      decided to purchase Innate Immuno stock through a ``friends      and family'' referral program. Any eligible buyer referred to      the company by a current stockholder received a 12 percent      discount to fund a research project the innovator was      launching.       This fact didn't stop Democrats from claiming he received      ``insider information'' as a Member of Congress, a rather      strange accusation about a company based in       Then, they pointed to what they insisted--and insisted and      insisted--was his active support for the 21st Century Cures      Act, legislation they said would help Innate Immuno gain      access to American markets.       That would be pretty suspicious, except for the fact that      Innate Immuno went on the record with the Wall Street Journal      back in[[Page S1011]]     December to express that they didn't care about the bill one      way or the other because they were governed by Australia and      New Zealand law.       And then, of course, there's the little detail that      Price was not a co-sponsor of the 21st Century Cures He      never whipped for the bill. He never even voted for it. In      fact, he was one of only a handful of Republicans to vote      against it when it was introduced in the U.House of      As House Committee on the Budget chairman,      Price had concerns that the law would bust spending      limits set by the budget. Thus, he could not vote for the      bill. So, a lawmaker doesn't co-sponsor the bill, doesn't      whip for the bill and doesn't even vote for the bill, and yet      he's being accused of crafting it, pitching it to his      colleagues and promoting it to the public? Seems a bit odd,      doesn't it?       Months later, the conference committee on the bill (of      which Price wasn't a member, since he voted against the      legislation) repaired the funding mechanisms for it, moving      it from mandatory spending to discretionary spending. Then,      Price felt comfortable voting to approve of the      conference report, which, again, is not the same as      ``actively supporting the legislation.'' And to top it all      off, it was because of Price's opposition to it that the      American taxpayers weren't on the hook for 21st Century Cures      as mandatory spending.       So, another swing-and-a-miss from the media and the      He didn't ``actively engage'' in supporting legislation that      they insist he spearheaded, and funnily enough, neither did      the company!

In 2004, Congress enacted the Section 199 deduction for      qualified U.manufacturing activities. Realizing a      technical omission, in 2006 Congress extended the 199      deduction for Puerto Rico on a temporary basis. As a result,      Puerto Rico was returned to a level playing field and would      no longer be competitively disadvantaged against the      mainland. The 199 deduction was temporarily extended in both      2011 and 2014.       The Section 199 deduction was not extended as a part of the      PATH Act in 2015. Price's bill would simply make      permanent the 199 deduction, no longer requiring periodic      reauthorizations, just as it is for the mainland. This would      not give Puerto Rico or any U.company (and thus, a      shareholder of such a company) a tax advantage. It merely      creates a tax neutrality so a company can make a decision to      invest in a jurisdiction for economic purposes, rather than      tax. Price was never lobbied by PhRMA on this      legislation. However, it is a priority of American companies,      such as Georgia-based Coca-Cola, who would prefer to maintain      their operations in Puerto The Puerto Ricans they      employ, who already face perilous economic circumstances,      would be inherently disadvantaged if these extenders did not      occur.

They can't deny his      qualifications or expertise, so they've resorted to an      attempted character assassination. The media, eager for      flames to fan, ran these baseless attacks time and time      again, despite easily accessible information (i.e. a Google      search) that would disprove these outrageous claims.       Both the Left and their media support must be held to      account for conjuring up lies and spreading them for the past      two months.

So we represented the organization AARP at their request. We wanted to save Social Security and save We have never spent a minute of our time talking about taking it away from anybody. If there is anybody who is going to be able to make sure Medicare works for the senior citizens of the 21st century, it is Tom Price, of Georgia, and he is going to do it as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the United States of  Secondly, there have been a lot of things impugning Tom and his investments--the investments he has made.  I introduced Tom to the Senate Finance I introduced Tom to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions I went through his application. I have seen everything on it. Everything that he is being accused of doing, he disclosed in his report. They are just using a technique that trial lawyers use called desperate impact, where you take two facts, put them over here, and put them together to make them a negative, rather than a positive. It is all in how you explain it and how you describe it. It is not how the act took place.  As the chairman of the Ethics Committee and the one that administers the STOCK Act for this body, I know what we have to submit and make public; I know what we don't. Every single thing he has been accused of doing is from information taken out of his own disclosures, which anybody who owns a computer can get today to make him look like he is bad and a bad guy.  In fact, I told the Senate Finance Committee when I went to introduce him there--after listening to Chuck Schumer on the Sunday shows for 2 weeks talking about Tom Price--that I felt like I was going to have to be a character witness for a convicted felon at a sentencing hearing. That is not right for us to do that to people.  Tom Price is a great man. He has done a great public service. He has done a great job, and he will do a great job as Secretary of Health and Human  I am proud to have introduced him. I am proud to know him as a friend, and I am proud that he is going to be my Secretary of Health and Human America and all of her citizens will be better off because the doctor will be in the house.  I urge a vote for Tom Price and yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-02-09-pt1-PgS999-3.txt,1608,GORDIAN KNOT,2017.0,9.0,March

4774,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, I would like to resume my remarks following the swearing in.  I also offer my congratulations to my new colleague.  Ann Odenhal, Richmond, VA:       On New Year's Eve, 2013, we were informed that our youngest      son, Patrick, 18 years old, had Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), an      incurable disease that comes with a lifetime of insulin      dependence, injecting oneself six to eight times a day. The      cause is unknown, it is not a lifestyle disease and there is      no escaping it once diagnosed. The beta cells on our son's      pancreas just stopped working. T1D is extremely dangerous and      when not managed can cause blindness, kidney failure, limb      loss, other issues and death. We were knocked off our feet,      numb, confused and overwhelmed by the danger and the medical      requirements to stay within an acceptable insulin range.      People with the disease must balance insulin doses with      eating and other activities throughout the day and night.      They must also measure their blood-glucose level by pricking      their fingers for blood six or more times a day. Our son      still can have dangerous high or low blood-glucose levels,      both of which can be life threatening. He will die without      insulin; he could die from too much insulin. In the midst of      our fog of sadness and confusion, we remembered the ``At      least the ACA will be there when Patrick is on his own. He      will be able to get health insurance regardless of his prior      condition,'' was our mantra. One day, Patrick came home and      announced, ``Great news! The ACA allows me to stay on your      health insurance until I'm 26!''  I changed my retirement schedule. I can do that. I have watched and worried as insulin prices soar. Pat takes two types of insulin, a single carton of which costs between $400 and $500 retail. I run the math in my head and I worry some more about lack of insurance. We are covered by my employer's insurance, which pays for most of the drugs, equipment and the additional health care he needs, but what would happen if we found ourselves without insurance? What if I lose my job? Public service runs deep in our family. My husband is a retired teacher and our older son is a policeman. It appears Pat may be moving toward nonprofit or public service work as well. Will he have health insurance? Will he have it without the ACA? I can promise anyone reading this that you know someone whose life has been or will be positively impacted by the There are 20 million people like our son, Don't allow a repeal of the Fix the problems, work the issues, but don't play politics with our son's life.  Linda Crist, Lynchburg, VA:       I had employer provided health care for 38 years. In 2013 I      lost my eyesight to macular degeneration and could no longer      work. An insurance company covered me for $695 a month (just      me). With the lost income, I could no longer afford      insurance. I contacted them and was told there was a new plan      I could apply for. I applied and was denied due to a ``pre-     existing condition.'' You see, in 1984--  Decades before--       I was diagnosed with kidney disease. I was treated and,      according to my physician, cured. The insurance company      didn't care. I applied for insurance under ACA and got a      silver plan that cost me $345 a month. I was given a tax      credit of $500 monthly and I chose to only use a portion of      it. The ACA saved me while I was waiting for Medicare to kick      in after receiving I am sure my premium would      have gone up with the ACA but it saved me when I needed it.''  John Carl Setzer, Winchester, VA:       My son was born in 2009 with a severe congenital heart      defect, called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).      Basically, he was born with half a heart and required three      open-heart surgeries. All of his treatment is considered      palliative. In 2009, he had the first two heart surgeries, in      addition to another on his diaphragm. He was hospitalized for      many weeks. He had insurance under my employer-based      coverage. Clearly he had a pre-[[Page S1000]]     existing condition. But the other issue is that he almost      maxed out his insurance coverage in the first year of life.      My understanding is that the ACA eliminated the lifetime caps      on insurance coverage, and my wife and I blew a major sigh of      relief. Otherwise, we would have had to switch his coverage      from my insurance to hers. However, he required another      surgery a couple years later and will at some point likely      require a heart transplant. Thus, the insurance games would      have continued. The ACA eliminated that burden on us, at      least until he is an adult. The lifetime cap is not something      I hear debated much these days, but it is something to      consider for people that have major health complications.      Please consider this in future legislation, in addition to      coverage for pre-existing conditions.  I will read one more story and then cede to my colleague. I have so many more that I want to read, and this is just 1 or 2 percent of the 1,654 stories that my office has received in 3 weeks.  Jennifer Smouse, Midlothian:       In 2008, my husband started his own construction company      after the national home building company he worked for pulled      out of It was our first time being self-employed      and along with adjusting to the idea of not receiving a      paychecks on the 15th and 30th of each month, we needed to      secure our own healthcare coverage for our family of 5. We      submitted our applications for insurance, and were notified a      short time later that we would not be offered coverage for      our oldest child. He is on the autism spectrum and they were      denying him coverage based on his Autism diagnosis. We were      shocked--our son was high functioning and was not in need of      any special medical services. . . .  And he still received this denial.       With the passage of the ACA, we no longer had to worry      about being denied coverage due to a medical diagnosis. The      system is not without its flaws. Our premiums were extremely      high in addition to the high deductible, and it was a stretch      to afford the plans even with the credits available to us.      But at least we felt on even ground. That in addition to      parenting a child on the autism spectrum, we didn't also have      the challenge of securing healthcare coverage for him.  I have other stories.

4777,topic-id,3156,"Mr.President, I thank the Chair for allowing me to retake the floor to speak about the nomination of Congressman Price to be HHS Secretary, and to read stories from Virginians who are afraid about repeal of the Affordable Care  Mark Priest, Alexandria, VA:       I am a self-employed entrepreneur and consultant. Since I      work for myself I do not have access to a special pool from      an employer that would make health insurance more affordable.      Starting in 2014 I was insured through the ACA and I was able      to find an affordable policy to cover myself. I think that      there is a mistaken notion that if you are employed, you      automatically have access to affordable health insurance. The      ACA isn't just for the unemployed. I work hard and I am a      small business owner. The ACA makes it possible for me to      afford health care.  Constance Burch, Fort Valley, VA:       I am a 53 year old single female who is self employed as a      Voice and Piano teacher. I have always prided myself on being      able to care for myself and provide the basic necessities.      Before the ACA I had to pay over $450 a month for health care      on a net income of $19,000. This meant some months having to      use credit cards for other necessities such as food and      gasoline to get to my lessons. Thanks to President Obama,      that all changed and based on my income, my fee was reduced      to $33 a month. I literally cried for joy that someone      finally did something to help those of us who work hard and      deserve the same quality health care that the more fortunate      are able to have. It is fair and quite honestly it was the      first time in my life that I truly felt that the government      actually did something to help me personally and those in the      same position.  Deb Fuller, Alexandria, VA:       I rely on the ACA for my health insurance because      otherwise, I would not be able to get it. My job, writing K12      textbooks and other educational material, has largely been      outsourced, and full-time permanent positions with benefits      are nearly nonexistent these days. The majority of the work      is as a ``flexible workforce'', which is the fancy term for a      freelancer or contract employee. Having the ACA means I can      continue working these contracts instead of trying to figure      out how to completely change professions because I need a job      that provides health insurance. Before the ACA, my saint of a      doctor went back and forth with health insurance companies      trying to convince them that I wouldn't cost them too much      money in the long run. They literally looked for anything to      deny me coverage. One rejection letter mentioned cold sores      in the litany of reasons why I was completely uninsurable.      Ninety percent of the population has cold sores. Now,      insurance companies make back their money on me because I pay      them vastly more than they cover because I don't get sick      that often or visit the doctor that often outside of routine      checkups. I also have peace of mind that if I am out on      horseback riding or hiking on a trail, I won't be put in the      poor house because I landed in a heap and had to go to the       Lauren Carter, Lovingston, VA:       My 39 year old son has cerebral palsy and a blood clotting      disorder. His ``preexisting conditions'' started at      conception. Three years ago, he lost his full-time job with      health insurance benefits. The ACA allows him to continue      receiving medical care and purchase his lifesaving      medications. He supports himself through multiple part-time      jobs, but employer-based insurance is just not an option for      him at this time.  Shannon Linford, Leesburg:       My name is Shannon Linford, I'm 24, and from the age of 10,      my life has been a series of doctors office visits. I suffer      from over a half dozen chronic illnesses, physical and      mental, and require frequent checkups and take up to 15      prescriptions a day. I have spent the last 14 years balancing      illness with my attempts to build a life. That would not have      been possible were it not for the provisions of the ACA that      prevent insurance companies from denying me service for my      illnesses or allowing me to stay on my parents' insurance      until I am 26. I've had to take a detour from pursuing higher      education due to these illnesses, as well as getting a job,      and instead spend the days I'm well enough volunteering with      nonprofits that advocate for others with illnesses like mine.      My team of doctors and I work together personally to create a      plan that is best for me. We are exemplifying health care at      its best. They know me by name, they know each other by      name--across disciplines, they work and collaborate together.      I would not have this luxury were it not for the If      insurance companies could deny me coverage due to my      preexisting conditions I was born with, my family and I would      go into bankruptcy trying to give me basic care. My health is      finally under good management. I'm going into remission with      my depression thanks to new experimental treatment with my      psychiatrist. Things are looking up, thanks to the provisions      in this remarkable legislation. Revoking this law would be      criminal and would destroy lives, destroy futures. Thank you      so much for your hard work.  Anna M., Vienna, asked that I not use her last name:       Without the ACA, I would likely be dead. I live with      bipolar disorder, an incurable mental illness that causes my      moods to swing uncontrollably from intense anxiety to      crushing depression. I began seeking help five years ago and      once spent two weeks in an intensive outpatient hospital      program because I was suicidal. I got help, but later lost my      job and my insurance, making my disorder a preexisting      condition. Thankfully, the ACA prevents my new insurance from      refusing coverage, and I was able to continue treatment. I      will need to control my bipolar disorder with medications and      therapy for the rest of my life. Without treatment, I am at a      higher risk for long-term unemployment, becoming homeless,      incarceration, and dying by suicide. With treatment, I work      full-time, pay my taxes, volunteer for local charities, and I      am a loving daughter, sister, and friend.  Katie Rugg in Henrico:       I was paying half of the cost of my rent and health      insurance every month and still having to pay for services      every time I went to be seen. I never knew how much things      would cost when I needed to be seen, either! So I was paying      an outrageous amount for health insurance and also afraid to      go see a doctor if I had any issues because it was going to      cost me more money than I had on top of everything else. I      was already living paycheck to paycheck, with a full-time      professional job in my field and a masters degree, and      seriously considering going without any insurance at all.      When the ACA was passed, my employer offered a discounted      option through the affordable care exchanges. I[[Page S1002]]     decided it was worth trying. It cut my monthly costs by more      than half and it pays for services at 100 percent of the      Medicare fee schedule. The cost is deducted directly from my      paycheck, and every provider that I have seen has been happy      with the prompt and predictable payment, even if it requires      some explanation at first. The way it works is that I would      pay the difference if there was any between the cost of      service and the Medicare fee payment. So far, any additional      cost to me, besides occasional lab work, which has been very      minimal. And my regular chiropractic care has been completely      covered. It has been phenomenal, like the difference between      day and night for me. Not only did this option allow me to      feel comfortable going in to see a doctor when I had an issue      instead of when I had to and was already sick, it also helped      me put some money away into a modest savings. Most      importantly, with housing costs continuing to rise and my      paycheck staying absolutely static for 3\1/2\ years, I was      finally able to buy my own house through a first-time      homeowners Assistance loan. It took a year of looking and      saving aggressively, but I have done it. I have done it!      Losing my ACA insurance would be devastating. I have come too      close to homelessness with the financial pressures I face in      this economy. I don't want to lose now what I have worked so      hard to gain. Thank you, Kaine, for what you are able to      do to help people like me.  JoAnne Loiselet, Clifton:  Clifton,       My story is I'm sure like many other women. I was a stay-     at-home mom and in 2009 my husband, who owned his own      business, and I separated and ended up divorced 3 years      later. He is not required to keep my children insured and he      cancelled their health insurance without me knowing it. The      company I started working for doesn't offer health insurance,      and we went without, until the ACA went into effect. Our      pediatrician didn't charge me for office visits and only for      vaccines. When needed, we borrowed money to help pay the      bills. If the ACA gets repealed, what would we do? What would      happen if my son breaks his arm or my daughter breaks her      leg? How could I pay for that? I make $50,000 and live in      Fairfax County and I could end up in bankruptcy. We have a      right to have insurance and live with peace of mind.  Laura Kreynus, Mechanicsville:       My daughter was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease in April of      2013. That September, my husband was diagnosed with      Parkinson's We are farmers, we raise food for      As such, we are independently insured. Prior to      finding a plan through the ACA in January of 2015, our      monthly insurance premiums were increased to nearly $3,000 a      month--yes, a month. On top of that, our health care      insurance had an annual cap on prescription coverage of      $5,000. The Humira that my daughter takes to combat Crohn's      retails for $3,800 a month, and that is not the only      medication she needs. So basically, after one month, we reach      the prescription coverage cap, meaning we would have to pay      $3,800 a month for her medication on top of $3,000 a month in      premiums. Who has an extra $6,800 a month to pay for this?      This is way more than we earn every month. With the health      insurance plan we got through the ACA, our premiums for 2015      were $1,500 a month, less than half of what we would have      been paying. But the real saving grace was no prescription      cap, so my daughter's medications are covered with a copay      after we reach the deductible. This is still a lot of money,      but at least we can treat our daughter's disease and      hopefully keep her healthy. And even though our premiums have      gone up $2,000 a month under the ACA, at least we still have      insurance. Under the Republican Senate's repeal of the      preexisting condition provision, we will not be able to get,      much less afford, any insurance in the future. This will have      devastating consequences to my daughter's health. She is only      15 years old. She deserves a chance in life. I have not even      touched on how no our insurance will affect my husband's      Parkinson's We are upper middle class income      I am not asking for a handout. We are paying more      that 25 percent of our income for health care related      expenses. And I can't imagine the affect this has on people      with less resources than we have. Do you know what happens if      you get sick or a disease and you don't have or can't have      health insurance or medical treatment? You die. Seriously,      health care costs are out of control in America and health      care is a basic right, and people are dying.  Cynthia Elliott, Hillsboro:       Kaine, Without the ACA, I and many other younger      seniors whose jobs do not provide health care would simply be      without until Medicare kicks in. I was paying $1,000 a month      for HMO care. Until I couldn't. But with the ACA, I was able      to get coverage for a reasonable $300 a month. And this one      includes dental care! It is simply a lifesaver for me.  Mary Lloyd Parks, Richmond:       We have excellent insurance coverage (though expensive)      through my husband's partnership in a large law firm, and      we've been grateful. We have two daughters, now 21 and 23.      Our oldest has cystic fibrosis. The Affordable Care Act has      allowed her to stay on her health insurance policy through      college, and now in her first year as an Urban Teachers      fellow in Washington, DC where she is teaching first grade      and studying at night to get her master's degree in      elementary and special education. While her health is      currently good, the medicines she requires to maintain her      health are extremely expensive and without our insurance, she      would not be able to afford them. The prescriptions cost      thousands of dollars every month. We are quite fearful that      when she turns 26, her preexisting condition--a very      expensive and lifelong disease that requires routine      hospitalizations and even lung transplants--would make her      virtually uninsurable. We are counting on the ACA to be in      place when she can no longer be insured as a member of our      family. She has chosen a profession that may not allow her to      afford the care she needs, and she was born with a chronic      serious illness that would be a pre-existing condition that a      future insurer could use to deny her coverage or to charge      her prohibitively high premiums.

Diagnosed with      a fatal liver disease in 2007, he needed a liver transplant      and he ended up getting two. On July 19, 2012, he received a      new liver at UNC hospital. He regained his life and we were      able to move home to Richmond to take new jobs and begin a      family, knowing that his preexisting condition would be      covered under the We were able to live without fear that      an employer would deny us coverage because he was high risk.  Sammye Newman, Richmond:       Before the ACA became law, I was paying more than $1,200 a      month for health insurance. Quitting altogether was one      alternative, but it would have meant paying possibly double      for health care, procedures and lab tests because I would no      longer be eligible for the negotiated prices contracted by      the health insurance company. Still, I was almost out of      money. Then the ACA was passed. My rates fell to between      $50 and $60 per month for better policies than I had      before making the switch. At 62 years of age, I am faced      with health care needs that continue to increase. As a      cancer survivor (21 years and counting!), it is imperative      that I be proactive regarding health care. In fact, having      a good doctor under an affordable employer-sponsored      health care plan is what saved my life 21 years ago.      Please, don't allow this lifeline to be abolished!  Heidi S., of Richmond, asked me not to use her last name:       Thanks to the passage of the ACA, I was able to stay on my      parents' health insurance plan until I turned 26 years old.      This policy change allowed me to go back to school at 24      years old to pursue a Masters degree, during which time I was      diagnosed with a malignant melanoma. The mole was not of      concern to me at all and was found during a routine check-up.      If I did not have access to my parents' health insurance      during that time, I surely would not have had access to the      pathologists and surgeons who diagnosed and removed the      cancer before it had the chance to spread.

I      worked as many years as I could, but eventually I became      unable to. The company I worked for insurance plan had a      $10,000 deductible, so for me having to go to the hospital      twice a month for most of the twelve years, it has taken all      of my savings and retirement I had accumulated to cover my      medical bills. Seven years ago we had to cancel my wife's      health insurance due to the high cost. Due to the high cost      of medical care, my wife would not see her doctor at times      she really needed to. The amount of disability I receive      barely covers our basic needs, so she felt we could not      afford a doctor bill. Under the Affordable Care Act, she      qualifies for a decent policy that cost us $30 a month. This      has enabled her to start seeing her doctors again and made      her prescriptions for asthma affordable and obtainable again.

4831,topic-id,1117,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Veasey) for his great leadership in bringing us together in this Blue Collar I feel very comfortable. I actually have blue on today.  I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Brendan Boyle) of the greater Philadelphia area, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Norcross), and myself from the Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio, part of our country to bring to the attention of the American people the fact, for example, that workers in northern Ohio, since the year 2000, earn on average $7,000 less than they did at the beginning of the century. They have taken some great hits. They are hardworking people. They are fighting back, but they need our help.  In the last 3 weeks, if we take a look at President Trump's term thus far, we begin to see the real Donald at work, if I might quote one of the news media. After months of grandiose campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA, bring back American manufacturing jobs, and make America great, we can begin to assess where he is putting his attention. I think this is really important for us, as we represent blue-collar America, what is he doing for them. I think the proof is in his actions, or lack thereof.  After roughly 20 executive orders and actions, we see President Trump has a penchant for mediagenic events and moments with a hodgepodge of executive orders, but apparently not sending any legislation up here yet. And most striking is his clear motivation to assist his wealthy friends on Wall Street with appointments to the administration, such as Secretary of Treasury, rather than paying attention to average Americans who voted for him. He exhibits a great penchant for public approval rather than a focus on efforts to improve the current economic stagnation of average  We are noting that he is filled his Cabinet with billionaires and multimillionaires who simply can't figure out how to walk in the shoes of blue-collar His actions to help the wealthiest Americans will have significant consequences.  So what happened with his promise to drain the swamp?  I thought in the first month we would have had something that would really resonate out in the heartland.  While all of this happens just miles away at the White House, our Republican congressional colleagues remain either silent or moving the car in reverse.  Why would they criticize activity that helps those who fund their elections?  We need campaign finance reform to dominate their political focus and write their policy objectives, like taking away today here in the House the ability of workers to save money for their own pensions, for heaven's sake.  In Trump's first days, he took action to roll back the financial reform bill called Dodd-Frank and tried to eliminate protections for seniors as they seek retirement investment advice. We know there are a lot of sharks out there in the financial waters.  Why wouldn't you want to help the American people rather than hurt them more?  He did nothing to address the trade issues, which were in his power to do on day one, and propelled his victory through our part of the country. I note my colleagues come from Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and me being from It was actually the Midwestern States that lifted this President to victory. He hasn't declared China as a currency manipulator. He could have done that already.  He had no elimination of the Buy America waiver, which affords access to U.Government contracts for all firms and goods from 45 World Trade Organization nations and 16 additional U.Free Trade Agreements that exist. Not a word about that.  No NAFTA renegotiation. He could have pulled the plug on that on day one.  Where is the negotiating team in place to take care of what NAFTA has done to the people of the heartland and our country in general?  What will President Trump do for ongoing negotiations he inherited on the U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty, the Trade in Services Agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? Will he put American workers, global workers, and environmental concerns at the forefront of negotiations? Or will he continue to allow corporate and wealthy financial interests to dominate and run roughshod over workers and communities?  Candidate Trump promised the 15,000 steelworkers laid off due to a flood of unfairly traded imports that he would support America's manufacturing and industrial base. He came to Ohio and said that. He promised to protect our industries from the Chinese and to keep jobs at home. But in the pipeline of executive action, he actually enforced the trade agreement Buy America waiver, negating his promises to help America's steelworkers. How about that? That was done in the first month.  Just recently, the U.Department of Commerce released a report that showed the U.trade deficit hit a 4-year high as it rose to over half a billion dollars for 2016. Middle America isn't surprised this trade deficit continues to hollow out U.manufacturing jobs and depress incomes across our great Reducing our trade deficit should be a top priority for the new administration. I hope the President puts a big scoreboard in front of the White House on his progress on this front. It would do wonders to fix the economy for working Americans if we balanced that trade deficit.  As Congressman Veasey has said, the Democratic Party has long championed issues for blue-collar America that create real life success for working class people. Lost in the political dialogue is the reality that Democrats have always stood for individual and economic rights for average Americans of all backgrounds. Each of us in our own lives represents that, and it is a privilege to serve here in this  For blue-collar families, education remains a vital stepping-stone in upward mobility. Democrats continue to prioritize early childhood literacy and STEM education, efforts to make Americans globally competitive in advanced manufacturing, science, medicine, and research and development. Democrats continue to expand apprenticeship options to allow young people to enter the workforce trained and without the enormous burden of student loans.  Meanwhile, Republicans push policies that exacerbate the ever-expanding wealth gap, even allowing it to invade our school systems.

4647,topic-id,628,"Mr.President, today the Senate will confirm the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be the Secretary of the It is a nomination I simply cannot support.  The Treasury Department plays an essential role in the development of the economic policies that financially secure the United States in world markets, that expand the opportunities available to all Americans, and that help set the stage for a sound and growing economy. Our country's economic engine must be one that is accessible to all Americans, not just the wealthy few. Regrettably, while Mr.Mnuchin may have a knowledge of the inner workings of Wall Street, he seems to know shockingly little of the hardships faced on Main One need look no further than his role during the height of the housing crisis in foreclosing on tens of thousands of American families. Reducing these actions to mere administrative matters belies the true struggles of those who don't boast the personal coffers Mr.Mnuchin enjoys. I simply cannot accept his explanation of his role in these actions.  We cannot forget the devastation and hardship that the recent financial crisis brought upon our country, its people, its neighborhoods, its small businesses, and its communities. People lost their homes and their jobs, and our markets crashed. Many have still have not recovered from those losses. As Congress worked to find the answers, it became clear that many large investment banks and insurance companies hid the insecurity of their finances from stockholders and from the American people. While many people lost their life savings, corporate executives received outrageous severance packages. As the country lurched into a financial downward spiral, Mr.Mnuchin's company, One West, administered aggressive foreclosure tactics that added to the devastation of these families, including veterans. It was wrong. Mr.Mnuchin, in his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, may have tried to convince the American people that his was an innocent role in the crisis. But given that he could not provide a valid reason for failing to disclose that he was the director of an offshore account worth more than $100 million, domiciled offshore in the Cayman Islands, I just cannot buy what he is selling--and neither can  In 2010, Congress worked hard to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection This legislation included a number of financial reforms to change the way financial institutions and banks take on risk, while adding protections for customers of these institutions, and creating a new regulatory council in order to provide more effective oversight of the industry. President Trump has indicated that he will seek to roll back Dodd-Frank regulations, and Mr.Mnuchin reinforced this pledge in front of the Finance Since its inception in 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPBP, has received and sent to companies for review upward of 700,000 complaints from consumers across the country, ranging from abuses in debt collection and credit reporting, to student loans. I worry about the future of the CFPB under President Trump's administration. Its value and importance in protecting Americans from predatory practices, like those of OneWest, cannot be overstated. I cannot support a Secretary who would unravel the reforms we worked hard to enact and that protect the American people from the devastation of runaway corporate greed.  For the last 8 years, we have focused with considerable success on rebuilding our economy. The unemployment rate is lower than it was before the financial crisis. Small businesses are growing. It is imperative that we continue to make economic progress and that we find additional ways to help those who have been left behind, without returning to the destructive policies that brought about the crisis in the first place. I am not convinced that Mr.Mnuchin is the right nominee to lead the Treasury Department and to continue this forward progress.

I think, in some cases, we have drifted from that.  I do want to talk about the blue-collar economy and what is happening to people who work in the building trades and work as truck drivers and nurses and people who are really the backbone of this country.  As Brendan mentioned, I was an ironworker for about 20 years. I know what it is when you are trying to work from paycheck to paycheck, strapping on a pair of work boots every single day.  I also want to focus tonight on one part of Mr.Trump's executive orders and policies that have really hurt people in our demographic: regular working people. I want to speak specifically about veterans.  As most people heard, President Trump, when he came into office, initiated what was called a Federal worker hiring freeze, stopping any workers from going to work for the Federal I just want to remind people out there that about 30 percent of those workers are veterans. So 30 percent of the people who go to work for the Federal Government are veterans. By putting a freeze on Federal workers, you are blocking almost one-third of workers who are veterans who would be trying to go to work.  The Federal Government is expansive. That includes workers at the VA; it includes workers at the FAA; it includes workers at the Defense Department, the State Department; on and on and on. So this is really freezing out veterans from going to work.  I had a young veteran in my office the other day who had some skills in radiology. He learned that through his military service in the Navy, but also when he got out, with the GI bill, and trying to go to work at the I had to explain to him that President Trump, when he came into office, put a hiring freeze on, and that we were going to have to try to figure out another way to put him to work.  Well, that case is playing out over 50 States, and thousands--probably tens of thousands right now--of veterans are being denied the opportunity to go to work for the Federal Many of them have skills that are necessary.  We have people retiring and leaving Federal employment on a daily basis. We have nurses that are retiring at the VA and folks that work for the EPA are leaving at the end of their working lives. They are retiring. Yet, we are blocking these veterans from filling those positions because of the President's hiring freeze.  Seeing that, I actually drafted a bill that I am happy to share. It is H.1001. It will basically create an exception. It will keep the President's freeze in place, except for veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans who have served in previous conflicts. Anyone who has put on this country's uniform as a veteran would be exempt from the hiring freeze so that we can do the right thing.  Each and every one of these young men and women--and there are a lot of women--I have been to Iraq 17 times now; Afghanistan, about 9 times; and I am amazed at the number of young women who serve our country in uniform.  I already have, including my colleagues here, 23 Democrats who have signed on. I would love to get some of my Republican friends on this bill. This should not be a partisan issue, trying to put veterans to work. I am sure we have got some good Democrats and Republicans out there that agree on this, and this should be a bipartisan issue. We can stop the--let's be hopeful it was unintended consequences of the hiring freeze. We can stop this by coming together. Sign onto H.1001.  Again, I thank my colleagues for their advocacy on behalf of workers.  I notice today that the President's nominee for Labor Secretary, Mr.Puzder, who had a very bad record with workers, withdrew his nomination. He has withdrawn from consideration. I think it is because of the hard work that Mr.Veasey and Mr.Boyle have done in speaking out on behalf of American workers and pointing out the[[Page H1227]]bad decisions and the wage and garnishment issues that Mr.Puzder had.

4656,topic-id,1229,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak in opposition to President Trump's nominee to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, Steve  From his days at Goldman Sachs, on the frontlines of developing the very products that brought our economy to its knees, to his reign as chairman of OneWest Bank, quantified by tens of thousands of foreclosures and qualified by years of despair, to his plan to get rich off cash-strapped seniors, to his investments in Sears that stripped pension benefits from low-wage-earners, Mr.Mnuchin made a career out of exploiting the financial turmoil of hard-working American families, never once stopping to consider the impacts of his profiteering on the people of this country.  At every step of the way, Mr.Mnuchin's mantra has been to privatize profits and socialize losses.  While our President spent much of his campaign railing against Goldman Sachs and Wall Street's stranglehold on Washington, it should be lost on no one that Wall Street has the majority vote in this administration. With friends like Mr.Mnuchin and Gary Cohn in high places, the country's largest and most complex financial institutions can rest easy, knowing this administration is firmly committed to their bottom lines. As Treasury Secretary, Mr.Mnuchin will be a chief architect of the GOP's ``Wall Street First'' policy.  Despite his self-described humble beginnings at Goldman Sachs in the 1980s, Mr.Mnuchin was on the frontlines of developing the now-infamous collateralized debt obligations known as CDOs and credit default swaps.  I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by Mr.He was part of the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees.  In its 2011 report on the great recession that wiped out nearly $13 trillion in household wealth and cost nearly 9 million Americans their jobs, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described Goldman Sachs' role in the crisis as follows:       Goldman engaged in securitization practices that magnified      risk in the market by selling high risk, poor quality      mortgage products.  It said:       Conflicts of interest related to proprietary investments      led Goldman to conceal its adverse financial interests from      potential investors, sell investors poor quality investments,      and place its final interests before those of its clients. .      . .''  Despite the damage they caused, Mr.Mnuchin never learned his lesson, and, as recently as 2012, he praised these instruments, calling them ``an extremely positive development in terms of being able to finance different parts of the economy and different businesses efficiently.''  Now, after he left Goldman Sachs, Mr.Mnuchin started a hedge fund, Dune Capital, which started investing in an exotic financial instrument called life settlements, which are made up of life insurance policies purchased from cash-strapped seniors. The investor, Mr.Mnuchin's hedge fund, had a plan to pay the premiums on the policies until the seniors died, at which point they would cash in on the insurance claims.  So let's be clear. Under Mr.Mnuchin's plan, the sooner seniors died, the more money his hedge fund would make. While the markets for[[Page S1116]]this product collapsed before Mr.Mnuchin could cash in, we have to ask ourselves if this is the type of leader whom we want at the helm of our economy? Do we really want a Treasury Secretary who had a plan to get rich off of dying seniors?  That brings us to the end of 2008 and early 2009. Wall Street had brought our economy to the brink of collapse, and 13.2 million Americans were facing unemployment. Home values were plummeting, having fallen 12.5 percent in just one quarter. And where was Mr.Mnuchin? He was negotiating the deal of a lifetime. In the darkest days of the financial crisis, when Rome was burning, Mr.Mnuchin and his friends were looking for stores to raid.  Boy, did they find a gem in He purchased IndyMac's $23.5 billion of assets for a mere $1.55 billion in March of 2009. With the FDIC, Federal Deposit Insurance entity backing, its too many loans went south. So he had a governmental guarantee for $23.5 billion of assets for about $1.5 billion, and he had the government's guarantee. All that Mr.Mnuchin had to do was to agree to help homeowners struggling with their mortgages, but Mr.Mnuchin didn't hold up his end of the bargain. He wanted more. Apparently, the profit margins of foreclosure were just too sweet to ignore.  After buying IndyMac and renaming it OneWest Bank, Mr.Mnuchin was installed as chairman. But instead of working to achieve sustainable loan modifications and workouts for struggling borrowers, as Mr.Mnuchin had committed to doing, OneWest's business model centered on kicking borrowers out of their homes at the first sign of default.  In April of 2011, the former Office of Thrift Supervision hit OneWest Bank with a consent order because the bank was actually putting homeowners on a fast track to foreclosure, robo-signing foreclosure documents.  In a sworn deposition in 2009, a OneWest vice president admitted to robo-signing 750 foreclosure documents a week without ever reading or reviewing them. In 2014, an independent government review of OneWest's foreclosure activities in 2009 and 2010 alone identified more than 10,000 homeowners, including dozens of active-duty servicemembers, who were owed $8.5 million in damages due to the bank's foreclosure practices.  OneWest's practices were especially egregious when it came to seniors with reverse mortgage loans. During Mr.Mnuchin's tenure at the bank, OneWest's reverse mortgage subsidiary, Financial Freedom, had approximately 17 percent of the reverse mortgage shares but was responsible for nearly 40 percent of reverse mortgage foreclosures. In other words, Mr.Mnuchin cornered the market on focusing and foreclosing on seniors in Whether it was foreclosing on a 90-year-old woman over a 27-cent--27-cent--missed payment or threatening to kick an 84-year-old widow out of her home of 54 years, Mr.Mnuchin was ruthless.  What did Mr.Mnuchin have to say about all of this when we asked him during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Finance Committee? He dodged responsibility at every step. First he blamed IndyMac for the quality of mortgage loans; then he blamed government regulations, which he falsely claimed forced his bank to kick people out of their homes. If that wasn't enough, Mr.Mnuchin had the audacity to tell us that his bank did not robo-sign documents despite clear evidence to the contrary.  To make matters worse, Mr.Mnuchin had the gall to call OneWest a loan modification machine. He repeatedly misled the committee that OneWest provided more than 100,000 loan modifications when, in fact, they modified less than one-quarter of that amount.  On top of misleading the committee, Mr.Mnuchin has been unwilling to provide information on the number of borrowers who lost their homes during the time that he ran the bank. We believe that number is at least 60,000 families and seniors, but those numbers could even be higher.  At the end of the day, this is about much more than numbers. It is about the seniors who are barely hanging on to their homes--their only source of wealth. It is about communities that were hit with a one-two punch of subprime loans in the years leading up to the crisis, only to face banks like OneWest with unrelenting foreclosure practices that stopped at nothing until they had kicked people out of their homes.  It is about people like Sylvia Oliver of Scotch Plains, After her employer cut her hours in 2009, like so many other hardworking Americans at the time, she ran into difficulty paying her mortgage.

Month after month out on the campaign trail, President Trump attacked Wall He said, time after time, that he was going to take on Wall He attacked his opponents in the primaries and in the general election by saying that they were too close to Wall Street and, specifically, too close to Goldman  He said, regarding Secretary Clinton: She will never reform Wall I know the guys at Goldman Sachs; they have total control. But he countered this by saying that he would do it differently. He promised to take on Wall He promised to fight for middle-class He promised to drain the swamp and reduce and eliminate the powerful entrenched special interests here in Washington,  But what a change can happen within a few weeks. Less than a month after winning the Presidency--I should point out, winning the electoral college but losing by a massive margin the popular vote, the citizen vote--who does Mr.Trump pick to be Treasury Secretary? A 17-year Goldman Sachs veteran, a foreclosure king--Steve  So here tonight, not even a decade after the second worst financial crisis[[Page S1113]]in U.history, we will be holding a vote on whether Steve Mnuchin is a fit character to be Secretary of the  What is particularly puzzling is not only the Goldman Sachs background, in contrast with the President's campaign promises, but also that this individual was a contributor to many of the predatory practices that nearly destroyed our economy in 2008, and he is someone who made a fortune throwing struggling American families out of their homes and onto the streets.  I am somewhat shocked we are here tonight and that some of my colleagues are considering voting to put a man in charge of our Nation's financial system who played such a role in bringing it to its knees just a couple of years ago.  Let's remember the massive impact on American families. They lost jobs by the millions. The unemployment rate soared. They lost their retirement savings and often they lost their homes--not just because they lost their jobs and couldn't pay their mortgage but because of the predatory design of the mortgages.  So I am shocked that I am here tonight and we are holding this vote and that we are particularly considering an individual who worked to tear down the protections and throw American families to the Wall Street wolves.  Maybe we should have a Treasury Secretary who succeeded in the past to build up the economy, not one who participated in tearing it down. Maybe we should have a Treasury Secretary who worked hard to put tens of thousands of people into homes, rather than someone who personally profited by throwing tens of thousands of American families out of their homes. I would be feeling much better about the vote we are holding tonight if that was the case because the American people have endured too much pain and suffering at the machinations of Wall  I thought we had perhaps learned our lesson. We worked hard to pass the Dodd-Frank reforms that would end those predatory mortgages, that would end those liar loans, that would end those teaser rate-exploding interest rate loans that brought families to their knees, that would end the securities designed in such a fashion that you couldn't evaluate whether they were AAA or AA, that would end this process and this formulation that turned the dream of American homeownership into the nightmare of American homeownership--this nightmare in which, instead of building wealth for American families, homeownership became a predatory instrument for draining wealth from American families.  What was Steve Mnuchin doing when the Banking Committee was working to save the economy he had helped to tear down? Well, he was foreclosing on more than 36,000 struggling homeowners, conducting more than one-third of all the reverse mortgage foreclosures, running a bank with a record of discriminating against minority home buyers, running a bank with a record of discriminating against minority neighborhoods.  So for all these reasons, this is the wrong man; the wrong man because he does not fit the promise the President made to take on Wall Street; the wrong man because he participated in destroying our economy, which harmed millions of American families; and the wrong man because he wants to dismantle Dodd-Frank, which had been put together specifically to end the predatory practices, including the illegal robo-signing he participated in.  This individual has no business overseeing the financial future of the American people so I will be voting no on his confirmation, and I passionately urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

4594,topic-id,1684,"Mr.President, fraudulent and abusive phone scams plague thousands of Americans eachyear. These deceitful practices cause serious financial harm to victims, and have even led to tragedy in a few cases. Both theCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, where I serve as Ranking Member, and the Special Committee on Aging, where Ipreviously served as Chairman, have explored the continuing severe impact of these scams. Consumers continue to lose millions ofdollars each year to fraudulent phone scams, many of which originate from other countries. And the impacts of these scams arevery real to the consumers who suffer. According to an October 2015 press report from CNN, one poor soul took his life earlierthat year after being tricked into spending thousands of dollars in a vain attempt to collect on his winnings in the Jamaicanlottery--winnings that were non-existent because it was all a scam perpetrated by phone-based fraudsters.  Nearly all of ushave trained ourselves to ignore phone calls and text messages from numbers that are not familiar to us. But these sophisticatedscammers know that--and have changed their tactics. Scammers today impersonate government institutions, promote fraudulentlottery schemes, and tailor their calls to individuals in order to coerce victims into paying large sums of money. Many scammersuse spoofing technology to manipulate caller ID information and trick consumers into believing that these calls are local orcome from trusted institutions.  In 2009, I introduced the Truth in Caller ID Act to prohibit caller ID spoofing when it isused to defraud or harm consumers. That law provided important tools for law enforcement and the Federal CommunicationsCommission, FCC, to go after fraudsters and crack down on these phone scams. I was pleased when my Congressional colleaguesjoined with me to pass that legislation and the President signed it into law. This was a huge win for consumers and the firststep toward ending these abusive practices.  Recognizing the pace at which phone scam technologies evolve, the law directedthe FCC to prepare a report to Congress outlining what additional tools were needed to curb other forms of spoofing. In 2011,the agency provided its recommendations to Congress on how to update the law to keep pace with new spoofing practices, such astext messaging scams.  The bill Senators Fischer, Klobuchar, Blunt and I have introduced today responds to theFCC's recommendations and builds on the 2010 Act to ensure the law keeps up with these spoofing scams. As these scams becomeincreasingly sophisticated, we need to make sure that consumer protections and tools for law enforcement[[Page S318]]keep up. That iswhy this legislation is so important.  The Spoofing Prevention Act of 2017 would extend the current prohibition on caller IDspoofing to text messages, calls coming from outside the United States, and calls from all forms of Voice over Internet  Additionally, for the first time, this bill would ensure consumers have access to information on a centralized FCCwebsite about current technologies and other tools available to protect themselves against spoofing scams.  Finally, the Actdirects the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct a study to assess government and private sector work being done tocurb spoofing scams, as well as what new measures, including technological solutions, could be taken to prevent spoofed callsfrom the start. I know industry, in cooperation with the FCC through its Robocall Strike Force, already is making great stridesin this area, and I would expect the GAO to review that work closely.  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Fischer,Klobuchar, Blunt, and me in supporting the Spoofing Prevention Act of 2016 to ensure that law enforcement andconsumers have the updated tools they need to protect against this fraudulent activity. And make no mistake, I will press theFCC to continue to use its full authority under the Truth in Caller ID Act to stop these scams, including consideration oftechnical solutions--like call authentication--to protect consumers.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text ofthe bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in theRecord, as follows:                                 134       Be it enacted by theSenate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

4775,topic-id,1222,"Mr.President, just like the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I, too, have had so many Floridians reach out to me. And sometime in the next 12 hours--literally in the next 12 hours--we are going to vote on the confirmation of the President's nominee for the Health and Human Services The reason so many people are reaching out to us, giving us these personal stories, is that HHS is the primary agency for protecting the health of all Americans as an agency. You could certainly say we ourselves are primarily responsible for our health, or in the case of children, their parents, but when you get to an agency of the U.Government, it is It provides health coverage through Medicare and Medicaid, the Federal marketplace, and the Children's Health Insurance  I don't want it to be lost on the Senators--you know a little bit about Florida and that the percentage of our population that is elderly is very high, which translates into 4 million people in my State on Medicare for access to health services, and another 3.5 million Floridians rely on Medicaid and CHIP for care. So that alone is reason to be concerned about this appointment.  Another nearly 2 million Americans signed up for coverage under healthcare.gov--specifically 1.8 million in the State of That is more signing up under the ACA under healthcare.gov than any other Nine million other Floridians get their health coverage from their employers and benefit from some of the ACA protections, such as prohibiting insurers from imposing lifetime limits or discriminating against people with preexisting conditions. That is another 9 million  I am concerned that, if confirmed, Congressman Price would be the President's top adviser on these important issues and that he would be responsible for upholding President Trump's promise to protect Medicare and He would be responsible for upholding President Trump's promise that any ACA replacement plan will ``have insurance for everyone.'' That is what Candidate Trump said.  This nominee would be responsible for upholding President Trump's promise to keep in place the protections that prevent insurance companies from discriminating against individuals with preexisting conditions. How many times before the ACA did we have some of our constituents tell us they were denied coverage because they had a preexisting condition--a rash. Because of the law, no one can be denied health insurance now.  Yet Congressman Price's record and the policies he has supported throughout his seven terms in Congress are in direct conflict with President Trump's stated goals. In fact, Congressman Price's proposed budget in the House cuts nearly $500 billion from Medicare and turns it into a voucher program. His plan would give seniors a fixed dollar amount--that is the voucher--to buy insurance. Most every economist would tell us that means higher monthly premiums. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, turning Medicare into a voucher program would cause seniors to pay 11 percent more out of their pockets. Is that what we want to do to our senior citizens? I don't think so. We better think about it.  I can state that the seniors in my State are petrified when folks start messing with their One of my constituents said in a letter that he wrote to me:       I hear that Congress is proposing changes to Medicare,      which would provide a fixed-dollar amount to purchase medical      insurance in the private sector. This monumental shift would      put an undue financial burden on fixed income retirees.  Linda, another constituent from Tampa, wrote to me back in January and said:       I am 68 years old. I am a woman who depends on Social      Security and My years in the workforce were meant      to help cushion my retirement with money I invested from      dollars earned, and now my living and my access to health      care are threatened. Please, please, do all you can to      prevent the loss of these important hard-earned necessities.  That is what she wrote to me.  These are just two examples of seniors for whom we need to stand up and fight.  Half of all Medicare beneficiaries have incomes of less than $24,000, and they have savings of less than $63,000. I want to say that again because that is the condition of many senior citizens. Half of all Medicare beneficiaries have incomes of less than $24,000, and half of those beneficiaries have savings of less than $63,000. Based on these numbers, seniors simply can't afford to pay 11 percent more out of their pocketbooks for benefits. Seniors can't take a chance on Congressman Price as their HHS Secretary by virtue of what he has already said and what his record is in the  The Congressman also supports raising the Medicare eligibility age to 67, forcing seniors to wait for benefits they earned during their working years. They have been waiting patiently until they reach age 65, and now it is being pushed up another 2 years. By increasing the age from 65 to 67, Congressman Price is forcing Americans to work longer to maintain the health coverage they were promised or forcing them to go without insurance.  Approximately 92 percent of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and 77 percent of older adults have at least two chronic diseases. Forgoing critical health coverage is not an option for these folks, and who is going to stand up and fight for them? I know Senator Kaine and I will.  The Congressman refused to answer my question in the Finance Committee on whether he supports the ACA that saved seniors money on the cost of their prescription drugs by closing the Medicare D gap that we call the doughnut hole. Under the ACA, more prescription drugs were paid for by Medicare than had been the case before. What that translates into in Florida is seniors saved $1,000 a year, thanks to the reduction of the gap in the prescription drug coverage. So why in the world would we want to get rid of something that is saving our seniors money and is doing exactly what it was intended to do--save them money on their prescriptions? We should be looking for ways to lower, not raise, the cost of prescription drugs for our senior citizens.  In November of last year, Congressman Price said that he wants to overhaul Medicare in the first 6 to 8 months of the Trump administration using a fast-track procedure known as reconciliation--getting around the 60-vote threshold requirement that forces us to have bipartisan compromise on the floor of the Senate in legislation. That[[Page S1001]]is what he said he wanted to do to force it through on a reconciliation bill. Well, I don't think that sounds too good.  So when you look at all of this, what is the conclusion? The Congressman's record and statements made as recently as 3 months ago do not match President Trump's promises. Our country deserves an HHS Secretary who will uphold those promises, not inflict deep, harmful cuts that fundamentally alter the health and financial security Medicare provides Americans in their later years.  For these reasons and others, sometime in this next 11\1/2\ hours when we vote, I am going to vote no on this nominee. There is too much at stake for our seniors to give this nominee control over these programs.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

4829,topic-id,938,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Brendan--Representative Boyle--and Marc for putting together a Blue Collar Caucus just to remind ourselves what we should be doing here is focusing on jobs. Jobs, which is the best social program I have ever been with.  I entered my professional life as an electrician, as an electrical apprentice. I went through the other 4 years of school. It was called an apprenticeship. I worked on bridges, refineries, pipelines throughout the Delaware I understood how tough it is sometimes for people to make it. When work got slow, we got laid off. We collected unemployment. Those are the struggles that men and women in our great country are going through each and every day. If anything, this last election cycle reminded us of that, that sometimes the dignity of being able to take care of your family, send your kids to school, and retire with dignity is the most important thing we can do.                              {time}  1815  I have seen firsthand what happens with minimum wage. They tend to think it is all a bunch of kids flipping hamburgers. Well, it is much more than that. It is a woman I spoke to, who had a child 8 years old, who had to work two jobs just to make sure that in the winter, when her daughter needed a coat for winter, that she could take care of her. And she recalled to us how badly she felt that her daughter's teacher for PTA wanted her to come in and help. She had to decide whether or not to keep food on her table or participate in her child's school. That is a tough decision when we both want to help.  When we look at what we have done as a country, as compared to elsewhere in the world, it is very different when we look at the blue collar, particularly in the building trades where I came from. Throughout Europe, particularly in Switzerland and Germany, they look at working with your hands with just the same dignity as going through college. This country doesn't always do that. Guidance counselors tend to push them into college as the only measurement.  College isn't for everybody. I have three brothers. They went the traditional college route. I decided I really enjoyed working with my hands. I went and became an electrician. Those jobs, we are on over 20 years ago, I still talk to my kids about it today--the dignity of working with your hands.  This country is starting to change, particularly when you need an electrician. When Mr.Boyle's lights in his house go out, who does he call? That electrician is worth his weight in gold, isn't he?  And I know Mr.Boyle's story. His parents came over here as first generation and are living the American They have to be so proud of him.  And in Mr.Veasey's district, those refineries are important for jobs, as they are in mine. I think we absolutely have to keep the focus on making sure that we have renewables, that we have clean energy. But we also understand with each of those decisions comes whether or not somebody is going to be able to go home and say: Honey, I lost my job today.  Today was a remarkable day--the first withdrawal of a nominee for the Department of And I guess this is where, during the election cycle, I see the difference.  It is very clear that the President wanted to talk about jobs, good jobs, putting America back to work. And then we have the secretary nominee put up--who talks about minimum wage is a bad thing, talks about robots are things you don't have argument with. He wants to outsource. That is not the way to rebuild the economy.  Mr.Boyle talked about the discrepancy between those who work for a living, the average worker on the line, and those who are the When I grew up, there was an implied partnership with so many of those companies. Those who went to work in a first-generation company, that CEO knew every employee's name. But time after time, when that company gets sold, that disconnect comes in. They forget about that. And that is where those relationships, that partnership that is so important, starts to break down.  We had a conversation in our Education and the Workforce Committee the other day about the NLRB, which is the group from the Department of Labor that judges whether or not elections with unions are done fairly. There was a suggestion somehow that they are not being treated fairly. It couldn't be any further from the truth. If workers want to have a voice, they should have that voice and choose whether or not they want to join with the union. That is the American way--that democracy. Yet, the nominee for Labor wanted to do away with the In fact, when we look at the total case history, it is like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, unless, of course, you own the henhouse, and then it is okay.  I want to finish up by saying to Mr.Veasey and Mr.Boyle how appreciative I am of keeping this focus on the forefront of what we do here in I created a Building Trades Caucus, along with a colleague, Mr.McKinley, out of West We could try to move this forward, create an infrastructure package that puts America back to work and keeps our roads, our bridges, and our grid safe.

We also are very concerned about how Gorsuch is a Justice Department Official treated a Georgia election law. As we know, election laws from the South--of course, there has been a historic decision that has made the Voting Rights Act far less effective than it was--but certainly during most of the time of the Act, Southern states had to go through the Justice Department to[[Page H2622]]see if the laws in southern States, that had kept African-Americans from voting for reasons of race, to see if newly enacted laws affecting voting rights, in fact, discriminated against African-Americans and others or not.  A Georgia election law was found by the Civil Rights Division to be discriminatory. Judge Gorsuch was part of the team that overturned the Civil Rights That was, of course, challenged in the courts. And the ruling of the Justice Department that pre-cleared the law--that said it was all right to go ahead with this law that the Civil Rights Division had found discriminated against Blacks--the court overturned that finding of the Justice  It used quite pregnant language. The District Court said that the Georgia election law was reminiscent of Jim Crow laws. Those words have special meaning in our history--and I speak not here about African-Americans alone. But if you have found yourself in the minority on any issue--it could be a First Amendment issue, it could be a criminal justice issue--you want a court that will protect your rights, not only the rights of the majority.  But this nominee has shown a hostility to litigation in the courts that have been the primary ways we have vindicated constitutional rights and the rights of minorities of every kind. In a telling op-ed, this nominee, Mr.Gorsuch, said: ``American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda.''  What? What else was there? The majority had enforced laws against the minority--in this case, African-He conceded that Brown v. Board of Education the school desegregation decision. But he went on to say that liberals should ``kick their addiction'' to constitutional litigation. This is a man who wants to get on the Court whose most important mission is constitutional litigation.  I submit to you that even the Justice who epitomized conservatism, Justice Scalia, never showed hostility coming to Court to vindicate the rights of people who felt themselves to be offended. So in that respect, I think it is clear that--and this is a very important respect--Judge Gorsuch is more conservative than Justice Scalia was on the  Nothing could be more concerning than a Justice who says: Look, the preferred way to vindicate your rights is the political process.  Who would disagree with that?  It is the failure of the political process that sends people to the court.  It shows, it seems to me, little appreciation for the Bill of Rights itself. The entire Bill of Rights is about the rights of the minority. And again, the word ``minority'' means any of us could be in that minority at any given point. You could be in that minority when it comes to religious rights. You could be in that minority because of a search and seizure case. You could be in that minority because of a free speech case. And, yes, you could be in that minority because you are part of a classic minority group.  That is why the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments were added to the Bill of The Framers, of course, shared Gorsuch's preference for the political process. A Constitution is a, small D, democratic document. But they created a separation of powers government knowing full well that majoritarian democracy sometimes treads on the rights of minorities. That is why we have the Supreme Court of the United States which Mr.Gorsuch seeks a seat.

4688,topic-id,1385,"I thank my friend for her comments.  Mr.Speaker, I was the chair, before I came to Congress, in another life, of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, dealing with job discrimination in our country. I was interested, in my own research on Judge Gorsuch to find that he has written more opinions in discrimination cases than other cases.  Now, the Rocky Mountain States of the Tenth Circuit do not have large numbers of African Americans, but the way in which the Supreme Court has interpreted antidiscrimination laws doesn't, in fact, basically differ from one group.  The EEOC also has jurisdiction over disability discrimination. For example, the Court has always indicated that anti-discrimination laws should be read broadly in order to capture discrimination. Whether we are talking about the antidiscrimination laws as they affect women or racial or ethnic minorities or religious minorities, the Supreme Court simply will not read these laws narrowly.  But that is not how Judge Gorsuch has operated on the Tenth He has given a cramped interpretation of the antidiscrimination laws, and yet it is interesting to note that, when there is a claim of discrimination based on religion, he gives a very broad interpretation.  He is perhaps best known for his opinion in the so-called Hobby Lobby case. This is the case in which he found that a closely held corporation was within its rights when it refused to adopt the Affordable Health Care Act's mandate that women and men be granted contraceptive protection as a part of health insurance. Judge Gorsuch found that this was a violation of the rights of the closely held corporation, the first time there has been such a holding.  It is very interesting also to note that right after that, there was a case called Little Sisters of the Now, the Little Sisters of the Poor, unlike the closely held corporation, is, in fact, a religious organization, and they too said they do not wish to have contraception be a part of any of the institutions that they govern.  Remember, we had a religious organization there, not a closely held corporation. The Court found that, to accommodate both women and the religious scruples of the Little Sisters, the Little Sisters had only to acknowledge that they did not desire to enforce the contraceptive mandate, and then it would be taken away from them and would be done by a third party, by the government. That was allowed as a way to accommodate the Little Judge Gorsuch opposed that and wrote an opposing opinion.  So to see this difference in the way he treats discrimination, reading antidiscrimination statutes affecting minorities of every kind in a narrow fashion; when he finds religious discrimination by statute, he reads those statutes very broadly.  His technical rulings are of statutes that the Supreme Court has broadly interpreted, would have made these statutes worthless. You simply cannot enforce antidiscrimination statutes by treating them as though they were technical statutes that, for example, govern financial dealings. And yet this nominee has brought that kind of interpretation of antidiscrimination statutes.  I was shocked at his holding in Hwang v. Kansas State University, which illustrates what I am saying. There, a professor brought a case because her university had refused to follow the guidance of the Equal Employment Opportunity She was entitled to a 6-month leave to accommodate her condition. This is a statute involving disability rights. She took that 6-month leave and asked to have it extended until a day certain, not indefinitely, to recover further from cancer and a bone marrow transplant.  Now, the EEOC guidance said that an additional leave beyond 6 months was possible as an accommodation to an employee unless there was an undue hardship. There was no undue hardship.  But this nominee, Judge Gorsuch, found that the ``6 months was more than enough to comply with the law in nearly every case''--yes, in nearly every case--but the EEOC guidance said that there obviously could be extensions. I can think of no case that would call for more of an extension than a professor who said: I will come back on a date certain, but I have a cancer diagnosis, and I have had a bone marrow transplant.  I hope that that case would give some pause to anyone who hears about it. The nominee has been quite consistent in how he has ruled in the Tenth Circuit, which gives every reason to believe that he is going to carry that consistency to the Supreme  I was very interested to see how he ruled on a Planned Parenthood case where the Governor of Utah had seen these notorious false videos that purported to show the sale of fetal tissue.                              {time}  2030  Now, those videos--every court that has considered those videos have found that they had nothing to do with Planned Parenthood and what it actually did. So this matter has been litigated in a number of circuits. It was litigated in the 10th Circuit in a case called Planned Parenthood Association of Utah v. Herbert; and the 10th Circuit found, as the other circuits have, that these videos were not, in fact, associated with Planned Parenthood--the false videos that surfaced.[[Page H2625]]  Interestingly, the court, on rehearing, which Judge Gorsuch had sought, characterized his dissenting opinion as ``mischaracterization of this litigation and the panel opinion at several turns.''  Here again, we see Judge Gorsuch going out of his way to rule in a fashion that he sees as necessary to sustain his broad views of religious claims. I am trying to give you an overview of Judge Gorsuch's opinions in a number of different areas, and I am mystified by how he would reach the conclusions he has reached in discrimination cases.  Here is one that is very revealing: A.ex rel Christine v. Espanola Public Schools, where a student was found by Judge Gorsuch not to be able to sue for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act because she had earlier settled a suit for violations of another act, the so-called IDEA  Well, she has a right under both laws. She would have obviously raised perhaps different claims, but his view was that she should not be in court. This closing of the courts must be taken seriously in evaluating Judge Because if you can't get into court in the first place, particularly if you are a member of a minority group, or for the moment find yourself in the minority on a particular issue, then you are out of court before you are in court. You have lost before you cross the threshold.  I can't imagine why Judge Gorsuch didn't allow a student to continue when she had, in frustration, left her school because of violations of her disability rights. That frustration, as far as he was concerned, closed the courthouse door to her.  Why would we want to interpret discrimination laws in a fashion that you can't get into court to make your case?  A particularly cruel case, Compass Environmental v. OSHRC, a case where Gorsuch wrote the dissent, involved a worker who was electrocuted and died as a result. The corporation had trained its workers. This worker happened to be hired after the training had taken place; therefore, was not aware of all of the safeguards.  The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission found that the electrocution of the worker could have been avoided if the corporation, Compass Environmental, had provided the necessary training. So it cited Compass and it fined Gorsuch dissented. He found that the company had not violated the law. The company hadn't provided the requisite training. The man was electrocuted, and it is very instructive what Judge Gorsuch said:       ``Administrative agencies enjoy remarkable powers in our      legal order. Their interpretations of ambiguous statutes      control even when everyone thinks Congress really meant      something else.''  He didn't like the administrative ruling, so he dissented and would have ruled against the family of a man who was electrocuted.  That is not a man I want on the Supreme This is not a man who knows how to interpret the discrimination statutes which have always been interpreted broadly by the Federal courts. This is not a man who should sit on the Supreme Court of the United  Mr.Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (",CREC-2017-04-03-pt1-PgH2621-2.txt,868,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,3.0,February

4686,topic-id,635,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia's leadership throughout the years on many of these issues.  Mr.Speaker, confirmation of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court would be detrimental to the interests of working Americans, particularly African-Americans and other vulnerable communities.  Just as President Trump's agenda prioritizes special interests, Judge Gorsuch's record shows that he favors powerful interests and businesses over regular people. His hostility to class action lawsuits would threaten protections for workers, especially African-Americans and other minorities.  What is particularly of concern to me is Gorsuch's opinion in what is known as the ``frozen trucker'' case. Gorsuch ruled against an African-American truck driver who, after breaking down in freezing weather, ignored his supervisor by unhitching the broken trailer from his truck and driving away in search of assistance.  In freezing cold weather, the truck driver is nearly freezing to death. He has a truck that won't work with frozen brakes. They are telling him to move--to use the truck and drive away. If he takes his truck with frozen brakes, the harm potentially to other citizens is great. An 18-wheeler truck with no brakes, that doesn't seem logical.  Gorsuch believed that the employee should have followed the orders, even though the driver's life was at risk. Gorsuch was the sole vote against the driver, who was put in the position of having to choose between freezing to death, driving an unsafe vehicle and endangering the lives of others, or unhitching his trailer and seeking help.                              {time}  2000  Judge Gorsuch's record is also troubling when it comes to issues around police accountability. Gorsuch believes in granting police qualified immunity, which protects law enforcement from being held liable for any excessive use of force. Now, this is deeply concerning given the widespread use of excessive force against African Americans by police and the increasing number of police shooting deaths of unarmed African  This is particularly concerning to me. I come from Newark, New Jersey, and the police department is being overseen by a Federal monitor following a 2014 review that determined officers repeatedly violated citizens' civil rights.  Additionally, Gorsuch's record on civil rights is deeply troubling. The National Bar Association, our Nation's oldest and largest national association of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges, notes that Gorsuch has shown a strong tendency to be biased in favor of powerful corporate interests and unapologetically biased against workers and victims of civil and human rights violations.  The confirmation of Gorsuch would threaten the protections and the rights of African Gorsuch is in lockstep with the President, favoring the wealthy over ordinary This is why I oppose his confirmation.  Even those who disagree that Gorsuch would bring a biased view to the Court should see the necessity in delaying consideration of Gorsuch, given the ongoing controversy over the Trump-Russia connection. It is inappropriate to rush forward with a lifetime appointment made by a President who is under investigation by the FBI and trapped in scandal. The Senate should delay consideration of Gorsuch until an independent commission investigates Russia's election interference and any ties between Trump and  Let me just say that Judge Gorsuch has put on a very good show in front of the Senate, seeming to be very confident and thoughtful, but never really answering a lot of the questions that were asked of him.  We feel that this jurist should not sit on the highest court in the land because of the bias that he has shown against working people and regular citizens in this country. Justice is supposed to be blind, but it seems that this jurist has a bias against the American working class person, the normal Joe, the minority looking for an equal break, and to have him sit on the highest court in the land would be a grave, grave mistake.

4719,topic-id,2635,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying resolutions.  The resolutions that this rule provides consideration for threaten our air and don't protect the American people. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that somehow repealing these rules will create jobs. It will actually destroy jobs, jobs that are associated with recapturing methane.  This is what a methane flare looks like. I drive by them in Colorado, and the potential for capturing, rather than flaring that methane, is important for the quality of our air and to reduce our emissions.  The House majority has made it their priority to instill fear and uncertainty in hardworking American families. People, who come here legally on visas who have lived here for many years, even small businesses, rather than focusing on jobs or having constructive conversations about immigration, are worried about their employees and, in some cases, even their owners being deported or not allowed back after conducting business overseas.  Republicans apparently would rather help shield large corporations from transparency, eliminate regulations that protect families from water and air pollution, and require companies to follow wage rules.  To add to this uncertainty and fear, President Trump has signed an executive order already that bans refugees and citizens from predominantly Muslim countries. Well, America is a nation of immigrants--those who fled political and religious persecution, violence in their home countries, and those seeking to build a family in a country that values freedom and upholds civil rights.  Our new President has decided that the best use of taxpayer money is to build a wall on our southern border. Our President has used his first 2 weeks in office to generate fear and uncertainty among vulnerable households who may lose their health insurance rather than create jobs and improve our economy. The new President has even limited the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to communicate with the public about things like methane flaring.  The two Congressional Review Act resolutions we are discussing today--like the previous ones that, I should point out, do not follow regular order--they didn't receive any hearings in this They were a closed rule with no amendments allowed. I offered two amendments to the methane rule amendment. Neither were allowed to even be debated on this floor of this House, no less adopted.  I would like to quote from Speaker Ryan when he took the gavel in October of 2015. He said: ``We need to let every member contribute--not once they have earned their stripes, but right now.'' In a further quote, Speaker Ryan said: ``The committees should retake the lead in drafting all major legislation. If you know the issue, you should write the bill. Open up the process.''  ``In other words, we need to return to regular order.''  Yet, here we are again with two CRAs that did not come through regular order, did not have a hearing with no opportunity for Members on either side of the aisle, Democrats or Republicans, with good ideas to make these pieces of legislation any better. Apparently, Speaker Ryan's commitment doesn't apply to CRAs or issues that keep our air and water clean or protect workers.  I would like to ask that Speaker Ryan explain to his colleagues how he is sticking to his commitment of regular order and to clarify what that means.  Not one amendment was allowed to be heard on the floor on either of these bills. This is a closed rule, including two of mine.  First, let's talk about the methane waste rule. It is very important to my constituents where fracking has worsened the quality of the air and upset neighborhoods across my district in                              {time}  1230  The first amendment offered in the Rules Committee was to the methane waste rule, and it would have added Bureau of Land Management scientific findings. It would offer transparency and truth to this Congressional Review Act, providing facts about methane, methane waste, and why it is necessary for this rule to be moved forward. Without this rule, we would be seeing a lot more of this in areas like my district and my  In the last few weeks, a war on science has been begun by this administration. If we support facts, then we should let facts speak for themselves and be as objective as possible. We should have allowed that amendment which would have listed the scientific truths around methane and this rule.  Scientific facts are clear. The current rule would supply energy for up to 740,000 more households per year. Rather than burn that methane into the atmosphere, we can actually provide energy for 740,000 more households; and that methane is 25 times more dangerous and potent as carbon dioxide for worsening the impact of global warming.  Even if you want to ignore the energy impact of helping more Americans have power or the climate impacts of increasing climate change, if we look at this rule from a jobs perspective, this CRA would destroy American jobs.  I would like to explain how this methane waste CRA rule will affect the jobs of thousands of employees of the more than 70 companies headquartered in the U.that provide services and equipment to identify and capture natural gas and methane leaking from pipelines, processing equipment, and wells, including many in my home State of This rule directly threatens the livelihood of many businesses and employees in my home  If, for some strange reason, the job creation argument isn't enough for you, how about the hundreds of millions of dollars American taxpayers would collect over the next decade from additional royalties?  Oil and gas companies are required to pay for the methane they collect and sell from public lands, and the more that is captured rather than burned off, the better not only for the companies and the employees, but also for taxpayers as we try to reduce our budget deficit.  An estimated $140 million in royalties over the next decade would be lost if this CRA moves forward. That is $140 million more in deficit spending that this rule signifies if it were to pass, and[[Page H890]]that is why it is opposed by Taxpayers for Common Sense and most other fiscally conservative groups.  Again, if job creation, science, and taxpayer savings aren't enough, how about the cancer-causing impacts, carcinogenic effects, of oil and gas drilling?  Stacy Lambright lives in Thornton, Colorado, near my district with her husband, Eric, and her two kids, Jack and Stacy became a community activist and a member of Moms Clean Air Force after she found out her neighborhood park frequented by children and families was directly next to a leaking oil and gas fracking well.  Stacy and her family have been living in the neighborhood for over 14 years, and they have started to experience health concerns after oil and gas drillers moved in. Since 2015, Stacy's been documenting an unusual amount of nosebleeds in her family. Just as recently as Monday, her daughter had a nosebleed, while her son had six nosebleeds last month, something they never had before. And Stacy's husband's asthma has significantly increased.  They have lived in the neighborhood for 14 years and only recently, since the drilling occurred, have they had these health impacts. There have been no changes in their home or surrounding neighborhood other than the increased amount of fracking and oil and gas wells and leaks, documented leaks, to existing wells.  This methane rule further threatens the health of constituents as we gather additional data, and that is why Stacy is advocating for stronger legislation and better management practices, not worse management practices, with regard to existing oil and gas wells.  The safety and health of Stacy's family should be a top priority for Congress, but it appears, instead, the Republicans' top priority in this resolution is bringing us back to a time when our water is polluted, our skies are smoggy, and health issues from dirty air are a burden for families.  I know it has been argued--we probably will again--that oil and gas companies are fixing and capping leaks on their own, but that is false. There is a massive amount of gas leaked every day, and these companies have not reduced methane emissions from the field one bit. Again, absent this rule, we will see more of this kind of activity, not less.  Another argument is that infrastructure, like pipelines, is important to prevent methane flaring. And of course that is true, but a GAO report says that only 9 percent of venting and flaring is due to the lack of infrastructure, so it is only a small part of the overall issue.  And, by the way, this rule doesn't block or in any way impede any new infrastructure projects, and more infrastructure alone clearly won't solve the problem of leaking wells and flaring methane.  The issue of leaking methane, in particular, is partially addressed by this rule, which, by the way, doesn't go far enough. However, what they wrote has been proven to work in creating jobs and cleaning up our air.  In Colorado, we have a methane rule that, frankly, this rule is largely based on, and I know it has worked in And while we need to do a lot better in my home State, at least some level of baseline can work for the whole country.  Oil production on Federal lands went up 28 percent between 2010 and 2015 under the Obama administration. There is no question that BLM has and still has authority to regulate methane. It is a waste of taxpayer money, a misuse of our public lands to do anything other than to reduce our methane emissions.  Just as an aside, the benefits of this rule include increased job creation, cleaner air, healthier families, and the climate.  BLM was extraordinarily conscientious when drafting this rule. They held eight public forums. They extended the comment period for 75 days. Over 300,000 public comments were collected and addressed. The BLM's methane rule was done out in the open with public input as opposed to, by the way, this process, which was done behind closed doors, without a public hearing, and didn't even have a committee hearing.  It doesn't make sense to use the CRA to repeal this BLM methane rule. This BLM methane rule creates jobs, protects our families, saves taxpayer money, and reduces our budget deficit.  The second amendment I offered got to the heart of the problem with CRAs in general. Regardless of the rules that they are impacting, they are a reckless, blunt tool, and they are not the right instrument for honest, thoughtful legislating.  If Congress has a problem with the authority under which the methane rule was issued, we should amend the statutory authority of the agency, not use a congressional resolution of disapproval.  My other amendment simply said that the agency has the right and authority to write a rule impacting this issue which, otherwise, the CRA could effectively prevent; and due to that uncertainty, passing the CRA creates even more uncertainty for the industry.  As the Denver Post, a newspaper that has endorsed dozens of Republicans over the last few years, said in regards to this methane waste rule: ``Congress is getting ready to use an ax where it needs a scalpel.''  The Congressional Review Act is one of the most ridiculous tools to be used by Congress, and, regardless of whether you disagree or agree with the policy, the better way to approach it would be to amend the statutory authority of the agency to make it clear whether they have the authority to issue this kind of rule and under what conditions.  While we may disagree on that, and we may be able to offer and bring to the floor amendments regarding agency authority, that is the appropriate venue for this discussion.  Let's move on to the other bill under this rule, the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces bill. My Republican colleagues continue to refer to this order as a problematic order. Unfortunately, it is another attempt to mislead the American people. This is a tactic the Republican elite have called ``providing alternative facts.''  The rule under CRA today comes from the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces executive order, and it is sorely needed legislation. What this rule says is, if you are a company that consistently breaks the law, without regard for your workplace, workers, taxpayers, or the community, you should not receive millions of dollars in taxpayer contracts.  It makes common sense to me. If you are abusing workers, have engaged in tax fraud, why would we want to contract with you with our taxpayer dollars?  Companies that cut corners in safety or fair pay, dozens of other areas, shouldn't get to compete for our taxpayer money against good actors and companies that play by the rules. Everybody needs to start from a level playing field.  Now, to be clear, there are only a few bad actors. The vast majority of companies have no issue at all with this rule. But unscrupulous actors who have ignored the law, violated the law, cut corners, should not be rewarded; and, to this day, there are a few bad actors that continue to receive billions of dollars of your taxpayer money in Federal contracts.  In 2010, a GAO report proved that there was a problem. GAO investigated 15 Federal contractors cited for violating hundreds of Federal labor laws enforced by the Department of Labor, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations The Federal Government awarded these 15 Federal contractors over $6 billion in government contract obligations, your money going to known violators in 2009 alone.  How about that for waste, fraud, and abuse?  Now, look, I don't know about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but fiscal responsibility is core to my beliefs as a Member of That is why I am a proud cosponsor of an amendment to require a balanced budget.  I believe in the value of hard work and personal responsibility. If we know a company is cutting corners, taking the easy way out, and avoiding the responsibility of the law, why would we reward them with your money?  Organizations throughout the country, representing a diverse group of stakeholders, agree. The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Service Employees International Union[[Page H891]]all join me in opposition to this Congressional Review They recognize the value of hard work. They don't support companies who cheat. I don't know why my Republicans colleagues do.  This rule modernizes an antiquated system. Right now it is virtually impossible for procurement officials to know if company A has had any violations when they are up against company B for a contract. If company A has been cheating workers out of overtime and that allows them to underbid Company B, they shouldn't get the contract and be rewarded for violating the law.  This executive order will increase coordination, simplification, access to information, and streamline the system.  This executive order does not set up any way for companies to be banned or disbarred. That process has always existed and will still exist alongside this as a separate, independent process. In fact, what this process does is it provides a remedial path for companies to right the ship, to get right with the law, to be eligible, once again, for Federal contracts.  A simple or rare mistake should, of course, not bar a company from participating in the Federal recruitment process. Instead, companies with repeated and excessive transgressions should be helped to follow the law and create a better workplace and be rewarded to be better stewards of taxpayers dollars.

4725,topic-id,403,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  First of all, the gentleman from Oklahoma referenced that these have been the subject of hearings. I would point out that there are over 50 new Members of this body who were not part of the last Congress who have not had a chance to look at it. And there has been time.  They could have had hearings and markups last week or the week before[[Page H892]]prior to these bills coming to the floor. I just came from a hearing in one my committees today. So they certainly could have been done consistent with the timeline, had that been the desire.  But, again, the better approach, the correct approach, would be to amend or change the authorities of the authorizing agency for these rules, rather than use the CRA process.  Mr.Speaker, President Trump's immoral and unconstitutional executive order banning Syrian refugees and suspending immigration from many countries is an attack on our core American values as a nation of law and a nation of immigrants.  This callous indifference of human suffering not only has tarnished and hurt our image abroad but harmed our national security by alienating allies and providing terrorist groups with new recruiting tools.  If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund this dangerous executive order.  Let me be perfectly clear for people watching what this vote means. A ``no'' vote on the previous question gives us the opportunity to overturn this order and bring up Representative Lofgren's bill. A ``yes'' vote means the House will continue to do nothing to stop President Trump's executive action and, instead, choose with allowing more methane to be spewed into the atmosphere.  This will be the third such vote the House takes this week, and, so far, every vote cast by a Republican Member in Congress has been in favor of turning a blind eye to President Trump's unconstitutional and dangerous order.  The American people should take notice and insist that their elected Representatives vote ``no'' and reject this administration's disgraceful policy.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.

4605,topic-id,2304,"Mr.President, I had very serious concerns about the nomination of Attorney General Scott Pruitt for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and opposed his nomination. His record on the environment is abysmal. My office received a great number of comments from people in the State of Vermont, which takes environmental protection very seriously, as well as from all over the country. They fear that Mr.Pruitt is bought and paid for by the fossil fuel industry and the protection of our environment is in serious jeopardy. Make no mistake, the nomination of Scott Pruitt was a nomination designed to protect the fossil fuel industry and not the environment.  In many ways, Scott Pruitt is the worst of the worst of all of Trump's nominees. Donald Trump was going to drain the swamp. He promised to ``break the cycle of corruption'' and ``give new voices a chance to go into government service.'' Well, guess who is running the swamp now: the same corporate cronies Trump promised to drain out of  Scott Pruitt wants to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but he is no friend of the environment. He boasts on his website that he is a ``leading advocate'' against the He said, ``The agency's actions are at best incompetent, and at worst reprehensible.'' He testified to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology in May 2016 that ``the EPA was never intended to be our Nation's frontline environmental regulator.''  What is particularly troubling is his record as Oklahoma's attorney general--as Oklahoma's chief enforcer of clean air and water protections for his constituents--he sued the EPA 14 times and still has 8 active cases against the In all but one of these 14 cases Pruitt brought against the EPA, he was on the side of corporate interests. And in 13 of the 14, these companies or trade associations were also financial contributors to Mr.Pruitt's political causes.  Shockingly, Scott Pruitt disbanded the Environmental Protection Unit of the Oklahoma Attorney General's He claims that he continued environmental protection, but the State budget shows that funding for ``environmental law'' in the attorney general's office fell from $486,000 in 2011 to 0 in 2014. In the State's 2016 budget, there was a line item for ``environmental law''--with $0. In fact, of the more than 700 press releases he issued as Oklahoma's top law enforcement official, not one touts an environmental enforcement case in It seems clear that he abandoned all meaningful environmental protection. This is concerning because reports show that the Trump administration is considering eliminating the EPA's Office of Enforcement, which would mean that the Agency would no longer be able to independently enforce our Nation's antipollution laws.  At a time when we have to strengthen environmental protection, Mr.Pruitt will be working overtime to carry out President Trump's goal to destroy the Does this sound like someone who should be running the EPA? Not to me. More than 230 different environmental, health, and public interest groups agree that Pruitt is unqualified--so do former EPA employees. More than 770 of them from across the country all signed on to a letter that asked us to reject Pruitt as the next EPA When hundreds of environmental groups and former EPA employees tell us that this guy is not qualified, maybe we should listen.  The scariest thing about Scott Pruitt being the Administrator of the EPA is that our EPA should be working nonstop to address the most pressing environmental issue of our time--the global crisis of climate change. In 2009, the EPA Administrator found that the carbon pollution causing climate change threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations; yet President Trump has called climate change a ``hoax.'' In November 2012, he tweeted: ``The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.manufacturing non-competitive.''  Perhaps it should come as no surprise that Mr.Pruitt takes the same page from President Pruitt said in March 2016, ``Reasonable minds can disagree about the science behind global warming, and disagree they do.'' He also said ``The debate about climate change is just that, a debate. There are scientists that agree, there are scientists that don't agree, to the extent of man's contribution and whether it is even harmful at this point,'' he added ``We've had ebb and flow, we've had obviously climate conditions change throughout our history and that is scientific fact. It gets cooler. It gets hotter. And we do not know the trajectory is on an unsustainable course. Nor do we know, the extent by which the burning of fossil fuels, and man's contribution to that, is making it far worse than it is.''  When I questioned Mr.Pruitt in his confirmation hearing on January 18, he said: ``I believe . . . the degree of human activity's impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it.'' He even told me that he thinks that his opinion on climate change is[[Page S1443]]immaterial to his role as EPA This is ludicrous. It is not immaterial--it is in fact essential--that we have an EPA Administrator who agrees with the scientific data and is willing to lead the fight against climate change. Yet, in his answers, he stated, ``there is a diverse range of views regarding the key drivers of our changing climate among scientists. I believe that these differences should be the subject of robust and open debate free from intimidation. If confirmed, I will continue to encourage an honest debate on our changing climate, the role of human activity, our ability to measure the degree and extent of human activity, and what to do about it.''  Almost all--97 percent--of scientists have concluded that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity. And it is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. If we do not move aggressively to transition our energy system away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy like solar, wind, and geothermal, the problem will become much worse.  Just this month, a report in the peer-reviewed journal The Anthropocene Review, researchers found that humans are causing the climate to change 170 times faster than natural forces. This is just another reason why it is unacceptable for Mr.Pruitt to say that he ``believe[s] the ability to measure with precision, the degree of human activity's impact on the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it.''  For 200 years, we have been burning increasing amounts of fossil fuels to heat our buildings, generate electricity, and power our vehicles. When we burn fossil fuels, we release significant amounts of carbon pollution into the atmosphere. In fact, today, humans release more than 35 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere every year. According to NASA, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has never exceeded 300 parts per million in the past 650,000 years. In 2013, CO2 levels reached 400 parts per million for the first time.  So it should not come as a surprise to hear that the planet is warming at an alarming rate: 2016 was the hottest year on record, and 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred since 2000. Nor should it come as a surprise that we are already seeing devastating effects of climate change all across the United States and around the globe: more intense wildfires, heatwaves, drought, extreme storms, flooding, rising sea levels, and more. Americans are worried. A study released last month shows that more than 6 in 10 Americans say that they worried about global warming.  But climate change is not the only area that makes Americans worried about Pruitt being the EPA They are worried about Pruitt's inaction in the face of a growing number of earthquakes in In the past few years, Oklahoma has been plagued by thousands of earthquakes, which the U.Geological Survey said are tied to fracking wastewater injection. Oklahoma's current earthquake rate is now 600 times higher than its prefracking rate. Oklahoma now has more earthquakes on a regular basis than  In 2011 in Prague, OK, The Oklahoman newspaper reported a 5.6 earthquake, stating that scientists ``believe the earthquake was caused by injection wells in the area.'' To put that in perspective, an earthquake in the magnitude 5 range, like the one reported, releases as much energy as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. But, before 2009, there were, on average, two earthquakes a year in Oklahoma that were magnitude 3 or greater. By 2013, there were 109 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes; by 2014, that had grown to 585 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes; and by 2015, there were 907 magnitude 3 or greater earthquakes.  The damage was extensive; 40 to 50 buildings in Cushing, OK, were substantially damaged in a November 2016 earthquake. In reaction to the then-largest earthquake in September 2015, the Pawnee Nation passed a resolution against fracking activities after suffering damage to seven historic tribal buildings. The Ponca Nation also passed has a moratorium on fracking because the earthquakes have caused damage to their crumbling water infrastructure and buildings. Scientists say that Oklahoma is ``almost certain'' to have more earthquakes, with heightened risks of a large quake probable to endure for a decade.  The Attorneys General in my State of Vermont, California, and New York have all frequently acted quickly to address environmental problems; yet, during Mr.Pruitt's hearing, he told me he did nothing to help folks in Oklahoma who had been hurt by earthquakes caused by fracking in Pruitt's sole response to my questions during his hearing about what he had done to address the earthquake problem in his State was to say he has ``acknowledged that he is concerned.'' That is it. ``He's concerned.'' He did not stand up and say he will do everything he can to stop future earthquakes as a result of fracking. He did not sue the corporations who were causing the earthquakes on behalf of the people of He did not hold a press conference. He did nothing.  These earthquakes are so concerning because the EPA ``regulates the construction, operation, permitting, and closure of injection wells used to place fluids underground for storage or disposal'' as part of its role in preventing contamination of drinking water. So, if we let Pruitt will nor lead the EPA, there is nothing to say he will not abandon efforts to regulate waste fracking water injection to protect the American people from earthquakes. If his past record is any indication, it is very questionable that he will take action to protect communities from harmful effects like these.  Maybe the reason so many are concerned he will abandon efforts to enforce environmental laws and why he was willing to abandon Oklahomans when they needed him is because he is in the pocket of corporate industry. Pruitt received more than $350,000 in contributions from the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt raised huge amounts for his two Federal PAC--known as Liberty 2.0 and Oklahoma According to Politico, Liberty 2.0 has raised more than $168,000 from energy interests, and Oklahoma Strong leadership has raised $72,000.  In 2014, in a Pulitzer Prize winning investigation, the New York Times exposed that Pruitt and numerous other Republican attorneys general had formed secret alliances with energy corporations. The New York Times also exposed the Defense Fund, which is a dark money offshoot of the Republican Attorneys General The Defense Fund received $175,000 in 2014 from Freedom Partners, which coordinates the Koch brothers' political activities. The New York Times also detailed how, in 2011, Pruitt wrote a letter to the EPA Administrator claiming that Federal regulators were grossly overestimating the amount of air pollution caused by energy companies drilling new natural gas wells in his Pruitt did not write the letter on behalf of Oklahoma residents; he did it on behalf of one of Oklahoma's biggest oil and gas companies, Devon As he fought for corporate donors, the American Lung Association named three urban regions in Oklahoma as having the 25 most heavily polluted air regions in the United  These examples of Pruitt's corrupt relationship with corporate polluters are so shocking and dangerous because he wants to lead the EPA, an Agency which is most responsible for protecting our kids and grandkids from the very polluters he has protected for so long. For the sake of our children and grandchildren and the future of this planet, were there none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would speak out to say that Mr.Pruitt should not be confirmed as head of the EPA?  The last time I checked, no one voted to pollute the environment in the last election. The majority of Americans do not agree that we should be dismantling protections that ensure clean air and clean water. In fact, according to Gallup, more than 7 in 10 Americans worry about drinking water pollution and air pollution. That is why we cannot allow Scott Pruitt to drive the EPA into the ground. He has shown that he wants to dismantle basic air, water, and climate protections.  We cannot rollback decades of progress. In fact, we are in desperate need of strong laws and regulations to[[Page S1444]]protect the environment and fight climate change. Do not be fooled. Scott Pruitt is not for protecting American citizens and the environment, but for protecting giant polluting corporations. With a record like his, we cannot expect Pruitt to safeguard our drinking water and air from pollution. With Pruitt, the environment will be auctioned off to the highest corporate bidder no matter the cost to the American public. It was for all these reasons that I strongly opposed Mr.Pruitt's nomination, and I urged my colleagues to join me in voting no.

4632,topic-id,1264,"Mr.President, candidate Trump ran a populist campaign that promised so much to working Many of those themes were actually echoed in his inaugural address, but ever since President Trump took the oath of office, he has gone about breaking promise after promise to the working people of this country.  A predictable pattern is beginning to emerge. This President uses populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda. We still hear the remnants of candidate Trump's populism in his speeches, but his actions as President don't match up. Just an hour after he had delivered populist words on the steps of the Capitol in his inaugural address, the President signed an Executive order--his first, I believe--that jacked up the price on Americans trying to afford a mortgage.  Ever since, we here in the Senate have been working through the President's Cabinet, which is filled not with champions of the working class, not with people who came from the working class but with a slew of superrich nominees, Washington insiders, and corporate types who have spent their whole careers sticking it to the working man.  A President's Cabinet provides insight into how they will govern and what their priorities will be. The President has shown his hand by selecting the most anti-working class Cabinet we have ever seen.  The slate of nominees we will soon consider, including Steve Mnuchin for Treasury, Andrew Pudzer for Labor, and Rick Mulvaney for OMB, show the yawning gap between the President's audacious promises to working America and the practical reality of his administration, which is steadily stacking the deck against them.  This evening we will debate the nomination of Steve Mnuchin for Treasury, a Cabinet post that will have oversight over Wall  Candidate Trump spent the campaign lambasting elites and criticizing Wall He said:       I'm not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall      Street has caused tremendous problems for us.  Those are his words, but what does President Trump do? With one of his first Executive orders, he started the process to try to roll back Wall Street reform, undoing protections we put in place after the financial crisis to prevent another one from occurring. He wants to eviscerate the one agency that sticks up for consumers when they are being ripped off by payday lenders or debt collectors--the That is a broken promise.  Candidate Trump said at his rallies: ``When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street board room filled with the special interests . . . and imagine the look on their faces when you tell . . . them: `You're fired!' ''  But President Trump told Steve Mnuchin, a Wall Street insider with[[Page S1096]]decades of experience in that board room he described, ``You're hired,'' as his Treasury Secretary, no less. That is a broken promise.  A President who is a true champion for working America would never consider unwinding protections that were designed to make our financial system more secure and protect hard-working Americans from the risky practices too often seen on Wall  For the Secretary of Labor, the President picked Andrew Puzder, a man who once said he prefers robots to human employees because, in his words, they are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there is never a slip and fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.  Secretary Nominee Puzder, the guy who is supposed to be protecting laborers--working people--actually said that.  I want to read it again. It galls me that this man is nominated for Labor Why does he prefer robots to human employees? Secretary Puzder: They are always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there is never a slip and fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case.  This is a man who has such disdain for workers that he said the minimum wage is a big mistake, and while at CKE Restaurants, his company, he continually outsourced American jobs.  A President who is a true champion of working America would never even consider selecting a nominee like Andrew Puzder to run the Labor It is another broken promise to the working men and women of  What President Trump did during the campaign and said during the campaign and in his inaugural address is almost the exact opposite of what he is doing now. You could not find a more anti-labor nominee for Labor Secretary than Mr. Now, what about OMB? The President selected Representative Mike Mulvaney, whose congressional career is a direct rebuke to key promises Candidate Trump made to working Candidate Trump promised that he was ``not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''  That is a quote from Candidate  But who does he choose for OMB? A pick who has relentlessly argued to cut both of these programs, including bill after bill that would end both Medicare and Social Security as we know it.  Our new Health and Human Services Secretary--who, unfortunately, passed this Chamber because our Republican colleagues are just marching in lockstep to the President--is in exactly the same vein.  A true champion of senior citizens, of the working man and woman, wouldn't hire someone like Representative Mulvaney or Representative Price to take an ax to the programs they have relied on for generations.  Just 3 weeks in, the administration is stretching the boundaries of cognitive dissonance. The President still speaks like a populist but governs like a hard-right conservative. He promises to stick up for working families, but every decision he has made is rigging the system further against them.  Every American who works hard for their paycheck, who desperately deserves fairer overtime pay, who is counting on Social Security and Medicare to be there when they retire should look at this Cabinet and be very worried.  I know many working people voted for President Trump in hopes that they would change the power structure in Washington, as he promised so many times. His Cabinet is the first way to see if he really meant it. His Cabinet is the first way to measure: Is President Trump measuring up in his Presidency to what he promised in his campaign?  It turns out President Trump was using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda, which will be carried out by this bevy of billionaires and bankers and hard-right idealogues--broken promise after broken promise.  Candidate Trump said that Washington was a place where ``the hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors . . . and the powerful [protect] the powerful.''  ``But I'm fighting for you,'' he said to working  If these first 3 weeks are any indication, that is a broken promise.

4691,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon, like much of America, angry and perturbed but in resolute opposition to the President's Executive order issued on This Executive order was mean-spirited and un-It made us less secure. It put our troops in the field at increased risk. It was implemented in a way that caused chaos and confusion across the country. It must be reversed immediately. Let me give three reasons why.  First, it ought to be reversed because it will not make us safer, as the President argues. It will make us less safe.  The President's Executive order targeted seven Muslim-majority countries. Not one terrorist attack has been perpetrated on U.soil by a refugee from one of these countries--not one. Moreover, it could alienate and inflame the communities we need most in the fight against terrorism.  As my friend Republican Senator John McCain noted, it could increase the small number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of terrorism. Both the San Bernardino and Orlando attacks were done by lone wolves, American citizens importuned by the evil This rule would have nothing to do with that.  As my friend John McCain has noted, it could increase the small number of lone wolves, which pose the greatest threat of terrorism. As both Senators McCain and Graham expressed yesterday, this order is a valuable propaganda tool for We saw that happen today. They predicted it yesterday, McCain and It happened today. They want nothing more than to paint the United States as a country at war with all of This order feeds right into the perception ISIS and other extremists want to create. The bottom line is, the policy will make us less safe, not more safe.  Second, while there is no way to defend the order, it was poorly constructed and even more poorly executed. The order was signed into effect without the consultation of the Federal agencies that are responsible for enforcing it: the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, or the Department of State, and possibly others.  People across America saw utter chaos and confusion that resulted in our airports over the weekend. The people in charge of implementing it weren't even told about it. Folks were caught in detention at airports around the country, young children separated from their mothers, husbands from their wives, green card holders and legal residents being denied the right to see an attorney. Some folks were pressured into signing away their permanent legal status. We are looking into that right now.  It raises serious doubts about the competence--the basic competence--of the new administration when such an important order is so poorly vetted and executed, just like some of their Cabinet nominations. Such a far-reaching and impactful Executive order should have gotten extreme vetting. Instead, it was rushed through without much thought or deliberation. I could not disagree more with the intention behind the order, but the haphazard and[[Page S463]]completely incompetent way in which it was implemented made matters even worse.  Third, and most important of all, the order should be reversed because it is un-We are a nation founded by the descendants of asylum seekers, a nation that has been constantly invigorated, replenished, and driven forward by immigrants, many millions of whom came under duress, seeking a new birth of freedom in The ability to find refuge from persecution, whether based on one's religion or race or political views, goes to the very foundation of the country, starting with the Pilgrims and Plymouth The Executive order is antithetical to everything we are about.  President Trump seems to want people to believe that all immigrants are terrorists or criminals, but when you meet immigrants, you see they are not the face of terrorism; they are families just like ours. Yesterday I met two. They were at my office. Mr.Hameed, an Iraqi refugee, worked at a local university department in English literature and, because he loved our country and what we were trying to do, he chose to use his language skills to be a translator for American soldiers in He worked as a translator for the U.Army in Iraq for 10 years. He endured death threats and harassment to himself and to his family because he was helping us and our soldiers. So he began the refugee process about 2 years ago.  He arrived on January 5. If Donald Trump had been inaugurated on January 1 and enacted his order 6 weeks sooner, Mr.Hameed would have had to stay in His life would have been threatened for cooperating with our military.  What kind of message does this send to the untold millions of people just like Mr.Hameed throughout the Muslim world who today will be less likely to work for and with our great country?

On the most sensitive matters of national security, the President should be relying on the informed counsel of members of the military and intelligence agencies, not political advisers who made their careers promoting a White nationalist Web site.  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the President's primary military adviser, and his voice, along with that of the Director of National Intelligence, are the only independent, apolitical voices. President Trump's move to strip them of their seats is baffling. It endangers our national security and is contrary to the spirit and intent of the National Security  This morning, Michael Hayden--I can't think of a more respected general and intelligence leader. He has served bipartisanly, the Clinton, Bush, Obama administrations. He said that the move--and these are his words, not mine, General Hayden's--``puts ideology at the center over the professional kind of information that the DNI and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs bring to the party.''  That is a deeply disturbing thought. It reinforces this administration's preference to propagate its own reality, rather than grapple with the facts on the ground, and if that continues, America is going to have real trouble.[[Page S464]]  It is one thing when it comes to a dustup about the size of the inauguration crowd; it is an entirely different story when it is the most sensitive activities undertaken by our Nation's government.

4753,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, one other issue is our nominee today, Mr.I want to spend a minute on him. He is the nominee for Secretary of One of the most important issues handled by the Interior Department is the stewardship of our national parks. These are some of the great national resources of our country.  When my children were younger, my wife and I would take them to national parks, and we would go hiking. We loved it. We so looked forward to going out I remember the reward at the end of a big hike was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I probably wanted it even more than my kids did. I loved peanut butter and jelly.  From Niagara Falls to the Erie Canalway, to places like Seneca Falls, Stonewall, and Ellis Island, my dear State of New York is home to some of our country's most famous national parks and monuments. They are places I have visited and treasured my whole life. I have been concerned in recent years about the reluctance on the other side of the aisle to properly care for these great national beauties, these great national resources. Currently, there is a $12 billion maintenance backlog for our national parks. Our Republican majority has not seen fit to address them.  Now, adding insult to injury, the new administration's hiring freeze across Federal agencies has already affected parks like the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, which I have visited many times. It has had to cancel tours due to insufficient funding.  Most troubling, our Republican colleagues want to make it easier to sell off or give away public lands and expand the footprint of the oil and gas industries on public lands--as usual, helping those narrow special interests, hurting the average That seems to be the trademark of this administration, which our friends on the other side of the aisle are happily going along with.  That is the context in which I approach Congressman Zinke's nomination. He claims to be a conservationist in the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, a great New He has demonstrated support for rules, however, that would make it easier to sell off public lands. It is the opposite of what Teddy Roosevelt wanted.  Congressman Zinke claims to be a conservationist, but he said he would revisit actions taken by the last administration to use the Antiquities Act to permanently protect endangered places of cultural, tribal significance. He claims to be a Roosevelt conservationist but pledged his support for the Trump administration's energy agenda--once again, centered on efforts to expand drilling and mining on Federal lands and waters. A few big oil companies would be made happy, but America would lose a great resource that is an economic resource as well as a beautiful natural resource.  I would say to Mr.Zinke: You can't be a Roosevelt conservationist when you vote to make it easier to sell off public lands. You can't be a Roosevelt conservationist when you support opening up public lands to increased extraction and drilling. You are not much of a conservationist when you downplay the authority of the legislation that allows the President to create national monuments.  In sum, Congressman Zinke says he is a dyed-in-the-wool conservationist but doesn't have the record to back it up. That should concern every outdoor enthusiast, every lover of our great and grand national parks.  Unfortunately, because of his record, I will vote no on Mr.Zinke's nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1511.txt,1036,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,1.0,February
4872,topic-id,1283,"Mr.President, I am pleased to follow my neighbor from Vermont, Senator Patrick We also had a very inspiring march in the capital of New Hampshire on Saturday that Senator Hassan and I both attended. But I am not here to talk about that so much as about the 44th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision. That anniversary happened this past That ruling affirmed the constitutional right of women to control our own reproductive choices. It made birth control safer and more accessible for women across this country.  On Saturday, as Senator Leahy said so eloquently, we saw millions of women and men come together in Washington and Concord, NH, and other cities across New Hampshire and across the United States and all across the globe. There were events in all 50 States and in 32 countries. We came together to defend this constitutional right, as well as other critical gains for women in recent years. Our message, expressed peacefully and powerfully, was that we will not allow these gains to be taken away. We will not be dragged backward.  Despite the progress since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, women's reproductive health care remains under constant assault. States have passed restrictions intended to shut down clinics and limit access. Sadly, Republican leadership here in Congress has repeatedly attempted to defund Planned Parenthood, which is one of this Nation's leading providers of high-quality, affordable health care for women, and over 95 percent of the work that is done by Planned Parenthood is done to provide preventive services and health care to women, such as mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and other important preventive care.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration and Republican leaders here in Congress have exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive rights. President Trump has promised to nominate Supreme Court Justices who will overturn Roe v. It is interesting--he has talked about court decisions around LGBT rights as being settled law, and yet we have the Roe v. Wade decision, which is 44 years old, and for some reason he doesn't include that as settled law.  Just yesterday, in one of his first official acts, the President signed an Executive order reinstating the global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City policy that began with Ronald Reagan's Executive order. That Executive order prohibits U.financial aid to many international organizations that offer contraception and comprehensive family planning services to women. But what we have seen with this Executive order that President Trump signed is a broad expansion of that Mexico City policy.  The new Trump administration has joined with Republican leaders in Congress in pledging a much broader assault on women's rights and the gains women have made in recent years. In addition to terminating funding for Planned Parenthood, which more than 12,000 Granite Staters depend on for quality, affordable health care, they have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have profoundly negative consequences for women's health. The repeal would end ObamaCare's ban on discrimination against women in health insurance. Depending on how the law is crafted, it would allow insurers to once again classify pregnancy as a preexisting condition and to deny many women coverage; it would allow insurers to charge women more simply because we are women; it would reverse women's access to contraception without cost-sharing; and it would end access to preventive health services, such as mammograms and cervical cancer screenings, without cost-sharing--all very significant benefits of the Affordable Care  Last week, we also saw reports that at the Justice Department, the Trump administration plans to eliminate the Office on Violence Against Women, including all 25 grant programs that have been working to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, and other forms of violence against women for more than two decades--this at a time when one in five women in this country still reports being the victim of a completed or attempted rape.  Taken together, these actions amount to more than a dangerous obsession with throwing back women's reproductive rights, they amount to an assault on the safety and well-being of women and girls in the United States and across the globe. This is exactly what millions of women and men were protesting on  Sadly, people are not just concerned, they are frightened, and unfortunately with very good reason.  As those of us who gathered and marched on Saturday made very clear, we are not going to stand still for this assault on our rights and gains. We are not going to be taken backward. This week, I am introducing bipartisan legislation to permanently repeal the global gag rule, with Senator This rule bans Federal funds for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services or information about abortion as part of comprehensive family planning services.  As I said earlier, the Trump administration's reinstatement of the global gag rule is even more extreme and harmful than it has been in previous[[Page S420]]Republican administrations. Previously, under President Reagan and the Bush administration, this policy applied only to family planning funding, but under President Trump's order, it applies to every program that falls under global health assistance. This means that it puts at risk 15 times more funding and millions more women and families. This targets some of the most effective health organizations that work in the developing world--organizations that are doing great work to provide HIV services and maternal health care and to counsel women on the risks of the Zika infection--and it ignores decades of research. We know that when family planning services and contraceptives are accessible, there are fewer unplanned pregnancies, fewer maternal deaths and child deaths, and fewer abortions. So if you want to prevent abortion--something I think we all agree on--then why not give women and their families access to family planning services? I don't think we can allow extreme ideology to triumph over the urgent practical needs of women and families across the world.  The facts make clear that when family planning services are accessible and contraceptives are affordable, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortions go down. Here in the United States, the abortion rate has dropped to the lowest level since 1943--a success that is directly attributed to reduced cost-sharing for contraception under the Affordable Care And what do we have? We have the leadership and Congress trying to reverse that assistance to women and families.  In recent days, we have been presented with a fateful choice. We can stand aside and allow the Trump administration to lead an across-the-board assault on women's rights--on women's access to health care, on programs that protect women from sexual assault and other forms of violence--or we can come together on a bipartisan basis to protect the important gains women have made in recent years and decades.  Back in the early 1980s, I chaired a committee in New Hampshire that was working on women's employment in the One of the conclusions we came to was when women are supported, their families are supported. So this is not just about women in this country; this is about families. It is about women and their children and their husbands and their brothers and their fathers and their mothers. This is about what is in the best interests of the American people.  Millions of Americans joined together on Saturday, peacefully and passionately, to urge Congress to make the right choice, to protect women's constitutional rights, to protect our access to health care. I urge my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen to those voices, and I urge my colleagues to join with me in ending the global gag rule once and for all.

4645,topic-id,2298,"Mr.President, the Secretary of the Treasury is one of the most powerful positions in our government, as we know. The Treasury Secretary has broad responsibilities--for the economy, for our tax system, trade, our pensions, housing, and so much more. It is critical that anyone who holds that position use their power to help working people. It is clear to me that Mr.Mnuchin's policies will, in fact, hurt middle-class families and working people.  There are also serious ethical concerns that neither he nor my Republican colleagues have been able to address. As a result, I will be voting no on his nomination.  I would like to talk about something that has not received the focus that I think it deserves and certainly that the people of Michigan feel it deserves, and that is the question of pensions and what is happening to pensions in our country.  Mr.Mnuchin has a history of fighting against working people and profiting off their misfortune. As we know, pension funding can have a significant impact on a company's bottom line. But losing a pension can destroy a family's bottom line, and it seems that Mr.Mnuchin doesn't know this. When serving on the board for Sears, Mr.Mnuchin played a critical and direct role in how to fund the company's pensions. So what happened? Sears routinely underfunded the company's plan throughout his tenure. Analysts predicted that Sears ``massively underfunded'' their pension plan. They said their ``massively underfunded'' pension plan was ``a ticking time bomb'' that could even hasten or bring down the financial collapse of the company.  The company used investment return projections that were too optimistic, along with accounting gimmicks so they could avoid paying into the pension fund. They inflated their earnings on paper while contributing less to the pension.  Sears did such a bad job managing their pension fund while Mr.Mnuchin was on their board, that the fund only made a return of 1.5 percent, putting their fund in the bottom 5 percent of all the pension funds over $1 billion. Is this the kind of result the American taxpayers want when he manages their money?  Already, Sears has been cutting its employees' pensions. In 2014, the company eliminated the monthly health care subsidy that helped its retirees afford their health care premiums. That saved Sears and Kmart about $6.2 million a year.  I have received a lot of letters from Michigan families a lot from families who are very concerned about their pensions. One of my constituents who worked in the trucking industry said:       We took small raises on our paycheck each contract so the      company could put more in the pension fund--  That is what people do. They take less every month in their paycheck so they can have more in the pension fund. I know in the Presiding Officer's State and my State, that is what they do. He continued--     and [we] were told we would receive a certain amount for the      rest of our lives. That is what we based our retirement on.      Through no fault of ours, over the years, government      deregulation of the trucking industry, passing trade      agreements and other laws that have devastated the economy,      have made our pensions become doubtful.  Can you imagine paying all your lifetime? My brother drives a truck and counts on the fact that he is working hard every day and putting money into a pension fund for his family when he retires, and it is supposed to be there, right? The pension is a promise that is supposed to be there.  Another woman from West Michigan wrote in worried about her Central States Pension That is the pension plan my brother is in as well. She said:       My husband retired from Grocers Baking of Grand Rapids      and has a pension in Central States Pension As you      know, that pension fund is in critical status and the      Treasury Department turned down a plan to save all the      pensions. My husband is 74 and I am 78 and we rely on that      pension and Social Security to live on. We try to save, but      it is difficult. We are hoping that the pension will last      more than 10 years, but who knows.  I also hear from people in Michigan all the time about how little accountability there is when it comes to the management of people's pensions.  One man wrote in from Macomb County about his own pension plan:       Why are none of the trustees being held accountable for the      bad investments or failure of the plan? I'm sure they all      have their golden parachutes in place for when they retire.      Why do we, the hard workers, have to suffer because of their      incompetence? I am just an average guy hoping that you can      help protect the benefits that are due to me, so I can enjoy      retirement when my time comes.  The Treasury Secretary nominee sat on the Sears board when they were making changes that created the investments that were not as good as they should have been, when they underfunded their pension system, cut back on help for health care, and he is asking for a promotion. I wonder what my constituents in Macomb County will be saying about that.  The Treasury Secretary plays a very important role in the security of our pension system--one of the basic tenets in our country, the way we support each other, the way people have trust in the system, you know that when you pay into the pension and then when you retire you get the pension.  The Treasury Secretary oversees implementation of the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act and serves on the board of directors of the pension overseers. I asked Mr.Mnuchin in committee: What is your position on the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, which Treasury is responsible for administering?  How do you propose to shore up our multiemployer pension system and protect people who are counting on their pensions? His answer was: ``You have my commitment to work with you to find solutions to the multiemployer pension crisis.''  That is it. I resubmitted the question, hoping for a more detailed response.  His response was: ``If confirmed, I will consult with you and other interested parties on the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014.''  That is not much of an answer for the people whom I represent, who want to know how he feels and what he is going to do to protect their pensions. The American people deserve a better answer than that.  People are struggling, retirees are struggling after trusting the system and paying into their pensions their whole life--the whole time they have been working, paying in, counting on having that dignity in retirement. We need a Treasury Secretary who understands that a pension is a promise. Mr.Mnuchin's actions have not demonstrated that he understands that.  Even when it comes to something as basic as Social Security, during our Finance Committee hearing, Mr.[[Page S1106]]Mnuchin couldn't tell me the average monthly benefit when I asked him, which, by the way, one-third of our seniors virtually rely on that alone, and the rest are putting together a small pension, and most seniors are counting on Social Security and their pension to have dignity and a quality of life in their retirement. The Treasury Secretary is a key overseer of the laws and management process and accountability for both of those systems. So for me this is a very big deal who is in this spot, in terms of how this affects working people, middle-class families, and retirees.  I didn't mention earlier that when I asked him what the average Social Security payment was--which he could not answer--he also couldn't tell me what he meant about a ``cut'' in Social Security; if he wasn't going to cut, what that meant. Did that mean putting in place a lower cost of living? What did that mean? He did not answer that.  Let me talk about another pretty basic area. Pensions are critically important so is the ability to have a home. Up until the financial crash, the disaster in 2008 and 2009, most families' savings for retirement, savings to put their kids in college, were through the equity in their home. In 2008 and 2009, for millions of Americans, that disappeared.  Mr.Mnuchin has made his career profiting from the misfortunes of working people, and let me talk about the financial crisis and how he benefitted from that as well. During the financial crisis, he put together a group of investors to purchase IndyMac Bank, which was renamed During that time, OneWest was notorious for taking an especially aggressive role in foreclosing on struggling homeowners. OneWest Bank pushed people into foreclosure and made their last-ditch efforts to save their homes through a mortgage modification or other means all but impossible.  When their voices were not allowed at the hearing on this confirmation, I was pleased to join with colleagues in putting together a forum where homeowners who had been impacted could share their experience. We held this forum for homeowners who were repeatedly given hope by OneWest that they might be able to avoid foreclosure, only to have it snatched away every time. One small business owner at the forum told us her story of how OneWest defrauded her and ultimately foreclosed on her. She told us that ``despite how difficult OneWest made the process, I did everything I was told, because I wanted to keep my home.''  Twice she applied for a loan modification. She submitted two checks with her new modification offer. OneWest cashed the checks--they cashed the checks--but told her that both offers were never received.  Wait a minute. What is that? They cashed the checks, then told her the offers were not received, and therefore the offer was void.  Eventually, she said: ``I received a knock on my door and a man introduced himself as the owner of my house.'' Shortly thereafter she had to leave her home. OneWest was Mr.Mnuchin's company. This is one of the many stories about OneWest's abusive conduct. When OneWest Bank sold, Mr.Mnuchin and other investors made about $3 billion off the backs of folks who lost their home and many were like the women we heard from who tried desperately to work it out to keep their home. I wonder if the checks they cashed from her after they said they didn't get them were a part of that $3 billion.  Finally, I want to express my concern over statements that Mr.Mnuchin made at the Finance Committee hearing that just don't line up with the facts; particularly, Mr.Mnuchin was asked whether his bank, OneWest, robo-signed foreclosure documents. To be clear on what this is, the banks, during the foreclosure crisis, had sworn documents robo-signed, automatically signed so they could foreclose on homeowners quickly without anyone even reading the documents. They just signed the papers--signed the papers--nobody reviewed whether they added up or whether they were right, whether they could help them. They just had the machine signing, signing, signing, foreclose, foreclose, foreclose.  Mr.Mnuchin said in the hearing his bank didn't do that. He said his bank didn't do that. The Columbus Dispatch did an investigation that found that OneWest did do that in A source in Texas reported that OneWest did do it in New Jersey temporarily banned OneWest from foreclosing on homeowners at all in New Jersey because of its history of robo-signing documents. Sign, sign, sign--don't look at it, just sign away. We heard the story of one woman who lost her house because of a 27-cent difference. I wonder if she was in one of those piles they just signed away. Mr.Mnuchin said they didn't do that. There is evidence to the contrary.  Mr.Mnuchin also forgot to disclose to the committee that he owned a company organized in the Cayman When I asked him about that, his best defense was that ``I did not use a Cayman Islands entity in any way to avoid paying taxes myself.'' At the time, I said: Oh, so you just helped other people avoid paying their taxes.  We find out now he did use it to help foreign investors avoid paying U.taxes. I have a funny feeling that he made money by helping those investors avoid paying their U.taxes.  He also forgot to disclose that he owned $95 million in real estate in various locations. I forget that all of the time. I have so many houses all over the place, it is easy to forget. So $95 million in property that he ``forgot'' to disclose. He said he didn't know his real estate was an asset. He didn't know his real estate was an asset. That is alarming.  I don't mean to be flip, but this is so shocking when I listen to some of this. The idea that we would believe someone who says this, that it somehow is making sense--that is why we as Democrats on the Finance Committee, before this final confirmation vote, asked that he be required to come back in and answer questions, because these are serious questions.  This nominee has not been properly vetted. He supports policies that do not have the interests of the working men and women in Michigan at heart or people across the country. He adheres to policies that don't protect the pensions of hard-working men and women in Michigan and across the country or people's retirement systems. I don't know where he really is on Social Security, which is the other big piece of the promise we made as Americans, where people pay into Social Security and are counting on that being there. He has personally profited off the misfortune of those who need help the most.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.

4784,topic-id,1573,"Mr.President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware, and I also want to thank the Senator from Georgia, who has about the same length speech as I have here--short and sweet.  Mr.President, I rise today on behalf of thousands of Montanans who have reached out to me in opposition to the nomination of Congressman Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human  Health care in this country is a very complex thing. It has many moving parts. It impacts patients, doctors, nurses, hospitals, families, and rural communities in Montana and across this country.  Recently, I traveled across Montana, speaking with folks from most of the 60 hospitals that we have in There is no doubt our health care system has some problems. Costs are rising, and families are being priced out of health care. There is no doubt about it--not all but some. But these problems to be solved require thoughtful, responsible solutions. These problems require folks to put politics aside and work together for the health of our country and for rural America and for our next generation.  Over the years and throughout this confirmation process, Congressman Price has shown that he is not equipped for this vital and formidable job. Health care in this country is too important to turn over to a man who wants to reverse the progress, cut up the safety net, and rip away the health care that our seniors have earned.  Everyone in this body knows that we have work to do to fix the Affordable Care Act, but each and every Senator also knows that the ACA has expanded coverage for millions of Americans, improved rural America's ability to recruit and retain health care workers, and moved us closer to closing the Medicare doughnut hole. We cannot make any of these improvements if we do what Congressman Price has promised and repeal the ACA, especially without a single plan to replace it. I would tell you, if one exists, I would love to hear it, and I would love to hear it today.  So I want to work to fix the problems with the ACA, not send us back to a time when folks couldn't afford to get sick or couldn't change jobs due to preexisting conditions.  Don't take my word for it. Joseph from Missoula wrote to me and said:       I am a practicing cardiologist in I am adamantly      opposed to the nominee, Congressman His approach takes      us back to the 1980s, ignores the reality of life for a large      portion of our population, and is inconsistent with our      obligation to care for the least of our brothers.  Joseph knows Montana cannot afford to go back to the old system. But Congressman Price has indicated that is exactly what he wants to do.  In his confirmation hearing, when Congressman Price was pressed about President Trump's replacement plan, he played it off with a joke to a laughing audience.  The health care of the American people is no laughing matter. We need a serious plan to address rising premiums and deductibles, but Congressman Price and President Trump have come up empty. In fact, Congressman Price's plan to repeal the ACA without a replacement is a serious threat to the health of our country.  But the Congressman's attack on our health care system does not end with dismantling the He wants to take a chainsaw to the safety net that helps our hardworking, low-income families stay afloat.  Last year in Montana, under the leadership of Steve Bullock, the Montana Legislature worked across party lines to expand Medicaid to thousands of Montanans, giving folks coverage for the first time in their lives. A man in Butte, MT, looked me in the eye, and he told me that because of Medicaid expansion--listen to this--for the first time in his life, he was able to go see a doctor, get his diabetes under control, and ultimately find full-time employment. Because of Medicaid expansion, this man was finally able to provide for his family.  Congressman Price's proposals will rip that coverage away from that man and make it more difficult for others to use Medicaid as well. His plan to block-grant Medicaid will do exactly that, and I have heard from health care providers from across our great State that this will cripple rural  In Montana, with the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid, it has created hundreds of jobs in the health care industry, and we can't afford to let those jobs go away. Rural America cannot afford Congressman Price's reckless plan--or lack of plan--to replace the  But Montana's working poor aren't the only ones threatened by Congressman Our senior citizens often fall into the crosshairs of Congressman Price's irresponsible battle with the Affordable Care  President Trump campaigned on protecting Medicare for seniors, and I am with him on that one.  If Congressman Price had his way, Medicare, as we know it, would cease to exist. He has supported budgets that would turn Medicare into a voucher system and cut the program by nearly $500 billion. Congressman Price's plan moves more of the burden of health costs onto our seniors.  Under Congressman Price's plan, a senior in Glasgow, MT, who is struggling with dementia would receive a fixed amount of money and would be expected to go out, shop for insurance, and buy a private insurance plan. A couple retired in Whitefish would be forced to spend less time enjoying their final years together in order to comparison shop and wrangle with insurance companies--not really how most of us would envision retirement. A farmer from Fort Benton, who has[[Page S1010]]given his blood, sweat, and tears to feed our country would be hanging up his dirty baseball cap for the last time and will have to worry about finding extra money in his savings to cover higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  Does that sound like a fair way to treat our seniors? I think not.  America's seniors have earned their Medicare over a lifetime of hard work, and because most of them live on fixed incomes, they can't afford to see it privatized. We cannot allow this administration to gamble with our seniors' future and their health care.  Ann from Stevensville agrees. She wrote to me and said:       Please do not support anybody wanting to privatize      No to Tom  But that is not all. Congressman Price's track record of fighting against affordable health care for all Americans is disturbing. Throughout his confirmation process, a disturbing pattern has emerged.  Congressman Price has spent his 12 years in Congress pushing legislation that would make health care less accessible for the poorest among us and enrich himself by corporate special interests. In 2016, Congressman Price used an exclusive sale of discounted stock of a foreign biotech company to line his own pockets. Now he is nominated to lead the agency that would directly impact this company.  Congressman Price underreported his holdings in this company by as much as $200,000. Now, I know $200,000 may not seem like a lot to some folks, but I am going to tell you, to this Montana farmer and to farmers across this country, we would remember if we had $200,000 or so invested in a company.  He introduced legislation to lower the tax bills of three pharmaceutical companies that he personally held investments in. CNN reported that during his time in the House, Congressman Price invested in a company and then 1 week later, introduced legislation to delay regulations that would have hurt that company's bottom-line profits.  Patients, nurses, doctors, and hospital administrators got a raw deal while Congressman Price and his corporate special interests got richer and richer.  As an elected official, as a potential Secretary, you are held to a high ethical standard. Congressman Price failed to reach that standard.  President Trump pledged to drain the swamp. Congressman Price's record shows that he swam with the alligators for a while.  It is clear to me that Congressman Price's priorities put him at odds with the fundamental job of HHS  Congressman Price's record is not one of expanding access to affordable care, increasing coverage to rural America, and protecting the Medicare that our seniors have earned. The legislation that he has carried in the House enriched himself and the companies he has invested in.  I think Elaine from Lolo, MT, said it best when she wrote to me and said this:       I believe we should be expanding health care coverage for      Americans, not making it more difficult to access and afford.       Price wants to scale back Medicare and Medicaid, is out of      touch with the realities of the challenges and needs for      reproductive freedom and safety, and has financial conflicts      of interest that would potentially skew his judgment.       A better choice should be demanded for the person who will      lead Health and Human Services to ensure our country has the      best possible healthcare and service support for the needs      for all humans, not just those in line with Price's      interests.       I urge you to vote no on Price's appointment. I will be      watching the vote closely. Thank you.  Well, I couldn't have said it better myself, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote no for Elaine, for Montana seniors, for Montana families. Well, they are all going to be watching closely.

4822,topic-id,880,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the leader for his comments and for participating tonight. I really appreciate his words and that recognition.  I want to thank everyone that is with us today to talk about our Blue Collar Caucus and jobs in this country. I think that there is nothing more important to any individual--any man or woman--than the ability to be able to have a good job, to take care of your family, and to be able to be a part of the American economy and to contribute to that economy.  I want to start off talking about President Barack Under President Barack Obama, the American economy added 9.3 million jobs and overcame one of the worst economic crises our Nation has ever seen.  In Arlington, Texas, which is part of the district that I represent in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, we have a General Motors plant. As you know, we could have lost our car industry. We have probably the most profitable plant in the General Motors family. All of the cars that you see around here at the Capitol, all of the Yukons, all of the Suburbans, the Tahoes, the Escalades, we make those in Arlington, We are very proud of our plant, very proud of the company being there all those years and for the UAW workers there that help make that plant great.  Despite the gains that we have seen with President Obama's saving the auto industry with the 9.3 million jobs and our overcoming one of the worst economic crises, again, that our country has ever seen, many workers across the U.felt that the economic recovery had left them behind. The rise of automation and outsourcing pushed many of those workers out of jobs that they absolutely loved. The frustration felt by these workers is understandable. Everyone--everyone--wants a good job that lets them, for their family, be able to take care of themselves, be able to pay their bills, send their kids to college, and buy a car.  President Trump appealed to many blue-collar workers during his campaign with a populist message and pledges to help working America, but his actions since taking office directly contradict so many of his promises. President Trump is playing one of the slickest political scams we have ever seen on hardworking American families. It is a scam. It is not real.  On his first day in office, President Trump signed an executive order that raised mortgage rates for new homeowners. Those same people that live in those Rust Belt States are those same individuals that were Democrats that went on television and went on social media and said they were going to give this guy a chance. What does he do on the very first day? We are going to raise interest rates on new homeowners, people trying to live the American There is nothing more that embodies the American Dream than being able to buy that first home. It was a slap in the face to those blue-collar workers and a boost to Wall  President Trump also signed an executive order that made it easier for Wall Street bankers to make money on risky bets. His Labor and his Treasury Cabinet nominees both have track records that are very unfriendly to the middle class and have no understanding what middle class workers face.  It is clear that President Trump does not have a plan to fight for the working man and woman as he promised on the campaign trail. That is why my colleagues and I--Brendan Boyle who is here with me from the State of Pennsylvania, we formed the Blue Collar Caucus to address challenges facing[[Page H1226]]blue-collar workers in today's economy. We are going to stand up to the Trump administration when he turns his back on working class  Our mission is to listen directly to middle class America's concerns and translate their needs into policies that allow them to adapt to the changing job market. We have to be able to equip our blue-collar workers with training that leads to jobs and opportunities. We just can't say ``job training.'' Those training opportunities have to lead to something of substance, which is a real job with a paycheck and some benefits.  This year alone, the U.is expected to add 2.5 million middle-skill jobs, the majority of which employers are telling me--and they have been to my office, and Mr.Boyle has probably heard the same thing. They are saying that these jobs are hard to fill.

4826,topic-id,1054,"One of the things I remember growing up in Fort Worth, Texas, was that we were blessed to have several manufacturing facilities that were union shops. We had General Dynamics, which is now Lockheed When I was growing up, it had about 30,000 employees out there.  We had Bell Helicopter, which is owned by Textron now. There are lots of employees out there. We had Miller Brewing Company, which is still there. Now it is We had several places, like General Motors, which I think I mentioned a little bit earlier.  So we had several places that had good benefit. I had family members that worked at many of those places. Good benefits, good jobs that people could really be proud of. One of the reasons why we have seen the decline of pay in this country is because of the Republicans and their efforts to undermine labor.  When you start talking about undermining labor and when you turn on these talk radio shows--you turn on The Rush Limbaugh Show, you turn on Mark Levin, you turn on these shows--they are always talking about how bad unions are in this country. But when I think about my own experience growing up in Fort Worth and I think about towns like White Settlement; towns like Benbrook; the community that I grew up in, Stop Six and Como; and I think about the middle class jobs that many of these union shops brought to all communities, again, whether it was the White community, the Hispanic community, or Black, they allowed people to be able to put some food on the table.  I have got to tell you, I was really kind of tickled and shocked at the same time by an article in the opinion section in The Wall Street Journal back on September 3, 2015. It was titled: ``The Shop Steward in the White House.'' It was taking a shot at President Obama for all of the things that he was doing for American workers, and many of the things that the Wall Street guy that wrote the article was complaining about, saying all these things about President Obama, they were all actually really good things that the President was advocating for.  My question and what I want to know and what I want Rust Belt workers and people all around the country to ask: Is this Presidency, is this administration going to embody and really embrace those same principles that were talked about for President Obama when he was really trying to protect these workers? Is this President going to do the same thing? Are his partners in the legislative branch, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Senators on the other side of the Capitol that are Republicans, are they going to also stop going after American wages, stop going after American workers and their benefits, and start standing up for these workers so they can put some more food on the table?  That is what I want to know. Those are the type of questions that we should be asking and we should be talking about.  President Trump can put out a statement on this right now if he wanted to, but obviously he has a lot of other things going on.  The Davis-Bacon Act, as many of us know, is the rule that ensures all Federal contractors are paid a fair wage while they are working on public works projects.  If there was ever a repeal of Davis-Bacon, we would see a decrease in the quality of blue-collar jobs, and we can absolutely not afford that. Stagnating wages, like I talked a little bit about earlier, has left workers unable to care for their families. As a result, one-third of blue-collar families are enrolled in one or more social safety net program.  That is not what blue-collar workers want. They want the ability to be able to take care of their own families. They don't want these social safety net programs. They want to be providers and be proud of their jobs.  The Blue Collar Caucus intends to defend the Davis-Bacon Act and fight any attempts to decrease wages for America's already struggling working class. We know that we can build an economy that works for everybody if we just work together. So work with us as we stand against President Trump's unfulfilled promises and stand up for these blue-collar workers. That is what we want our friends on the other side of the aisle to do.  But what I would really like to see right now, even before President Trump reaches out to, again, his Republican friends in the legislative branch, is for him to come out and make a statement for these blue-collar workers, for these people in the Rust Belt, for these people in the South, for these people in Dallas-Fort Worth, and all over the country. I want him to come out and make a statement on where he stands on Davis-                             {time}  1800  It is one thing to just talk in broad categories about bringing jobs back to[[Page H1228]]our country, stopping our jobs from going overseas. This is an actual policy that we know has been good for many workers in Mr.Boyle's district and in mine and, again, everywhere. Where is the President on this issue? Why is he not saying anything about Davis-Bacon? I want to hear what he has to say. I know that Mr.Boyle knows about just how important things like Davis-Bacon are and other issue areas are.  Another area is the Supreme Court nominee, Mr.Where is he going to rule when it comes to working families? That is what I want to know. That is the type of thing that I hope that people on the factory floors and shops across this country start talking about is how is this man going to rule? We already know that he has made several bad rulings as it relates to working families, rulings that will directly affect how big their paychecks are, literally has made rulings that have taken money right out of their pockets, right out of their bank accounts. Those are the types of things that we need to be talking about, not all this 35,000-feet-up-in-the-air-type stuff, but actual policy details that we know can impact and hurt families.

We want to see some of these good jobs come back. I have got to tell you, the President made a lot of promises when he was on the campaign trail about bringing some of these jobs back, and I want to see those jobs come back, too.  I think that with everything going on right now, with the resignation of General Flynn and there being so much talk about campaign operatives on the Trump campaign talking to Russian intelligence officials, I think that he is going to be too distracted to help these workers. I think that Republicans are going to be too distracted to help these workers in the Rust Belt, to help these middle class, these blue-collar workers.  I have got to tell you, during our retreat last week while we were in Baltimore, I opened up The Wall Street Journal first thing in the morning. I saw this article about how--and it was about jobs still pouring in to Mexico, and it was really one of the saddest things that I ever read. For some manufacturers, Mexico is still the best move. They specifically were talking about a corporation called the Rexnord  It really broke my heart when I was reading the articles about how they were asking the workers at this plant[[Page H1229]]in America, in our country, to actually train individuals from foreign countries to replace them. They wanted them to train them for the jobs that they currently had here in our country and asking them to, you know, train these people so we can ship your job out of the country and you can be replaced. How demoralizing to go to work knowing that you are training someone next to you for your job to be sent overseas or sent out of the country, your livelihood, everything that you have known. For a lot of these little, small towns, these companies really are the face of the town.  In Texas, and I am sure it is like this in Indiana and in other parts of the Rust Belt and other parts of blue-collar America, Friday night football is a really big deal, maybe the local high school basketball game is a really big deal, but also that ranks right up there with both of those two athletic activities in these towns, their identity is driven by their job. I thought that was such a sad commentary about where we are now.  Again, with all of the executive orders, when you start talking about the travel ban on citizens from Muslim countries, when you start talking about the executive order to raise interest rates on first-time homeowners, no executive orders whatsoever to protect the American worker. We are a month into the administration. No executive order, no action, no comments on Davis-Bacon, nothing to reinforce the fact that we are with these guys, and it is really sad.  I am sure that these workers out there, in America, in New Jersey, in other States, I bet you they are sitting back watching, saying: How in the world is this President going to help us with all of the distractions that are going on over there? When is he going to help us? He has done all these other things with the executive order, why not do something for the American worker?

4676,topic-id,1036,"Mr.President, last week Republicans in the House released a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid to the bone. On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office--those are the independent budget experts who analyze policies under consideration here in Congress--estimated that the plan would rip health insurance coverage away from 24 million Americans and cut $880 billion in the Medicaid program. And as a bonus, the plan provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the rich. Who comes up with a plan like this? What kind of healthcare bill has, as its central feature, ripping away health insurance from tens of millions of American citizens?  What kind of politician thinks they were sent to Congress to destroy the financial stability of millions of middle-class families and give wealthy donors a tax break that they certainly don't need? Who thinks that the central problem in America is that middle-class families have too much healthcare coverage and that the richest people in America need government to hand them more money? There is no other way to say it: This bill is just part of a Republican plan to help the rich get richer and kick dirt in everyone else's face.  This bill is an economic disaster, and at its center, it is cruel--cancer survivors losing coverage, seniors facing premium increases of $12,000 a year, people with disabilities forced into nursing homes. And one of the cruelest things is what this bill will do to individuals, to families, and to communities struggling with the opioid crisis.  Last year in Massachusetts, nearly 2,000 people died from opioid use. That is more than double the number who died in 2013. That is right, double. Between 2014 and 2015, Massachusetts had a bigger jump in its death rate from drug overdoses than any other State except North  Last week, I was on the front lines in Lynn Community Health Center, where dedicated staffers are trying to meet this opioid epidemic head on. This week, I went to Manet Community Health Center, where a coordinated team in Quincy is battling the opioid crisis. While I was there, I not only met with the professionals, I saw the mamas and the babies, the people who are in recovery, and people who reach out to those who are still in the grip of drugs. The opioid crisis isn't happening to someone else's family or in someone else's community. It is happening to our families in our communities, and we need to do more to stop this plague before it takes another of our loved ones.  We need to do more; what we absolutely cannot do is less. We cannot take away the resources already committed to fighting the opioid crisis so that some millionaire can get a tax break. Current law, the ACA, requires all insurance plans to cover substance use disorder treatment and prevention as an essential health benefit. That means that your insurance company can't turn off the access to treatment just when you need it most by saying: Sorry, we just don't cover that. Current law, the ACA, gave people the chance to get that insurance through health exchanges and subsidies. Millions more people got private insurance. And through Medicaid expansion, millions more were covered by So there it is, our first line of defense in the war on opioid addiction.  The ACA currently means that more people are covered, and that coverage includes substance abuse treatment. What does the Republican plan do? It[[Page S1833]]takes away coverage for 24 million people. That is 24 million people who no longer have any access to substance use disorder treatment and prevention services. And then they want to let insurance companies jack up the out-of-pocket costs for substance abuse programs and mental health programs. In fact, some Medicaid plans would be able to drop this coverage altogether. So millions more people would lose their one lifeline if someone in their family is taken by drugs.  Don't get me wrong. What we are doing right now is not enough. Even now, only 10 percent of those who need treatment for substance use disorder receive it and 90 percent can't get help, but that means we need more, not less help.  Repealing the protections for mental health and substance use disorders in the ACA would yank more than $5 billion in actual funding that is currently going to mental health and treatment services. That is the Republican plan to deal with the opioid crisis. Ask any family trying to get treatment for a loved one who is addicted to drugs. We already have an opioid treatment gap. Gutting the ACA is like shoving a stick of dynamite into the treatment gap and then lighting the fuse. And if the Republicans get their way, people will lose health coverage. People will lose access to recovery services. People will die.  Now is the time to stop this cruel bill in its tracks before it hurts real people. Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA and Medicaid to you and to your family.  If you or someone you know has been touched by the opioid epidemic, you know how much this matters. Maybe you have a sister, a child, a church member, or a high school friend who has struggled with substance use disorder. Maybe you know someone who has fought on the frontlines of this crisis as a healthcare provider, community advocate, as a first responder.  If you do, then you know the stakes in this debate over the ACA and Now is the time to act. Don't wait. If the Republicans end up destroying help for millions of people, don't wake up the next morning and wonder if you could have said more or if you could have raised your voice back when it mattered. No, the Republicans are trying to pass this terrible healthcare bill now, now is the time to speak out. It is time to stand up and to tell Republicans to end their cruel healthcare plan.

4646,topic-id,3590,"Mr.President, I, too, will be voting no on the candidacy of Mr.Mnuchin to become Secretary of the  Rhode Island got hit so hard by the mortgage meltdown that Wall Street created. Frankly, I can never forget the Rhode Islanders who lost their homes in the course of that debacle. We were able to help some of them in my office.  As the Presiding Officer knows, when you come to the Senate, you put together a constituent office, and your constituent people work on usual constituent business. In the ordinary course, constituent business is dealing with Federal agencies. It is making sure Social Security is fine, getting people replacement passports that they put into the laundry by accident, dealing with veterans issues and getting veterans their benefits, helping people with Medicare and Medicaid confusion. It is all generally involving people who have gotten somehow fouled up in the Federal programs of which they are beneficiaries.  In our case, we had to open a constituent wing for dealing with the big banks because they were foreclosing so recklessly and in such a mercenary fashion on Rhode It was such torture for Rhode Islanders, once the foreclosure process began, because they could never get the same person twice on the phone; there was always a mismatch between what they were being told on the phone and being told on paper. It was a nightmare of bad information and bad practice by these big banks.  What we would often be able to do is to say: Look, at least give this person one person they can deal with, that they can call every time so it is not ``Hi, I am John'' on one phone call and[[Page S1107]]``Hi, I am Mary'' on the next phone call and ``Hi, I am Joseph'' on the third phone call and nobody ever remembers the other phone calls, nobody ever knew where they were in the process. You can't move the process forward if the person on the other end of the line can't keep track of the conversation. So we were able to get that done, and that actually was able to help Rhode Islanders come to a deal with these big banks and save their homes. But for all the ones we were able to help, there were many, many we were not.  I simply cannot forgive somebody who took a look at that banking crisis, who took a look at the pain Wall Street sent in a wave across all of America, and thought: Oh, here is a great new way to make money--foreclosing on people.  I am out. Sorry, I can't vote for somebody like that.  What I hope, though, is that he will at least show some common sense and some decency when it comes to other issues, and one of them is climate change.  If you go to the financial sector, they are taking climate change pretty seriously. Frankly, the financial sector is probably about as big as the fossil fuel industry, so when the fossil fuel industry comes around bullying and shoving and lying and going through all of its usual climate denial nonsense, the financial guys really don't care. They just do their thing. You are not going to intimidate You are not going to intimidate You are not going to intimidate Bank of It just doesn't make any sense. So when you look at what these guys are saying, they are being pretty straight up about it.  As long ago as 2013, Goldman Sachs issued a report that said: ``The window for thermal coal investment is closing.'' That is the caption of the report. ``Thermal coal's current position atop the fuel mix for global power generation will be gradually eroded,'' it said. And sure enough, it has been. There was no grief for coal in there; they were just trying to predict the market. In 2015, Goldman Sachs did another report about the low-carbon economy. It was ``Goldman Sachs equity investor's guide to a low carbon world, 2015-25.'' So unless somebody is going to say that Goldman Sachs is in on the hoax, they are taking this pretty seriously. From 2015 to 2025, they expect a low-carbon world.  And it is coming on fast and furious now. Just recently, a global task force was set up by the G20 companies--the 20 biggest economies in the world. They have a group called the Task Force on Climate-related Financial They have asked that companies begin to come clean on the climate risk they face.  The news report about this says:       Concerns among the financial community are growing that      assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate      risk is not being factored in, threatening market stability.  The story continues:       According to Barclays--  Barclays is a significant international banking institution--     the fossil fuel industry could lose $34 trillion in revenues      by 2040 as a global deal to limit temperature rise to well      below 2 degrees Celsius reduces demand for oil, coal, and      gas, returning reserves into stranded assets.  If, in fact, this is an industry that could lose $34 trillion in revenues by 2040, that explains a lot of their misbehavior around Obviously, for that kind of money, there is very little mischief these folks wouldn't get up to, and sure enough, they are getting up to all of that mischief, and more, around here. But the financial industry itself is pretty big, and it doesn't care. It is not going to be pushed around and bullied.  This Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure is described as having 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies, and accounting and consulting firms--32 members representing the 20 biggest economies in the world, and they are saying: Here it comes. Let's get ready.  So I hope colleagues will begin to listen to these folks in the financial services industry and these major market economies about what is going on and stop listening to the self-serving nonsense that the fossil fuel industry insists on trying to jam into our ears around here. It just is bogus. Bottom line: It is bogus.  Most recently, at the end of last year, September 2016, BlackRock, which is one of the most significant investment firms in the world--I think it has more than $1 trillion in assets under management--issued this new report: ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.'' So BlackRock, one of the smartest and biggest companies in the world, is now talking about how we have to adapt to climate change and helping investors plan for it. In this building, can we have a sensible conversation about climate change? No, of course not, because the fossil fuel industry won't even let some of us mention the words, but in the real world, where real money and real decisions are being made by very smart people, they are all over this. Here is BlackRock: ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.''  Sentence 1 in the report: ``Investors can no longer ignore climate change.''  Investors can no longer ignore climate change. No, it takes Congress to do that. Investors can no longer ignore climate change, but don't worry, we will, as long as we are following the lead of our fossil fuel industry friends, right over the climate cliff.  The report continues that we can expect more frequent and severe weather events over the long term--something that actually we are seeing already, not only in the United States but around the world. They say that there is a market failure in this area--a market failure--as current fossil fuel prices arguably do not reflect the true costs of their extraction and use.  That is what we are fighting about here. The fossil fuel industry has the best racket going in the world. They are able to pollute like crazy, do immense damage in the world--damage that coastal homeowners in Rhode Island, fishermen in Rhode Island, people who have breathing difficulties and are trying to breathe on a hot summer day in Rhode Island--they all have to pay the price.  Under real market theory, the harm of the product has to be in the price of the product for the market to work. That is market 101. Well, they don't want to play by those rules. They want to have everybody else cover the harm in their product, and they just get to shove it out into the marketplace with the biggest subsidy in creation.  The International Monetary Fund is not a bunch of stupid people, and the International Monetary Fund, as far as I can tell, has no conflict of interest with respect to fossil fuel, unlike the fossil fuel companies, which are one massive example of a conflict of interest. The International Monetary Fund says that the subsidy to the fossil fuel industry every year--just in the United States of America--is $700 billion--billion with a ``b.'' Like I said, how much mischief would they get up to for $700 billion? Oh, about $700 billion worth.  Is there a fix to this? Yes, continues the BlackRock report. ``The most cost-effective way for governments to meet emissions reduction targets: Policy frameworks that result in realistic carbon pricing.'' Market 101. Of course, they don't want market 101, they want fossil fuels subsidies 101, and we go along with it because of the mischievous way they behave in politics. But we should not go along with it. It is not proper economics. It is not conservative. It is nothing except traditional, old-fashioned, special interests, special pleading. It is no different from any other polluter who wants to be able to dump their waste into the river or onto their neighbor's yard or wherever it is rather than having to pay for cleaning up the mess they made.  We go on through the report: ``The world is rapidly using up its carbon budget,'' says ``The damage from climate change could shave 5 to 20 percent off global GDP annually by 2100.'' Up to a fifth of global GDP gone. That is a massive economic correction. That is massive economic pain.  ``The economic impacts,'' it goes on to say, ``are not just in the distant future. More frequent and more intense extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, and droughts, are already affecting assets and economies.''  For anybody just tuning in, this is not me making this stuff up, this is BlackRock investments.  They talk about global fossil fuel subsidies--four times as large, they say, as renewable energy support.[[Page S1108]]  Here is an interesting thing: ``Scrapping energy subsidies could save governments some $3 trillion a year, more than they collect from corporate taxes,'' according to  So here we have the fossil fuel industry over there, and they are getting the biggest subsidy in the world--by IMF calculations, $700 billion a year--and the party that says it wants a more efficient government and that ordinarily would like to reduce corporate taxes is defending that subsidy, even though that is taking money out of government more than corporate taxes. It is quite astonishing. The BlackRock report gives such a window into Congress by comparison, frankly. They conclude here by giving some pretty dire warnings about where this goes if people aren't preparing for climate change. They say:       Risk for the long-term investor . . . could lead to a      permanent loss of capital. The effects of climate change need      to be part of that equation, we believe.       Yet even short-term investors would do well to integrate      climate factors into their portfolio.  So from Goldman Sachs on to BlackRock, some of the most powerful and intelligent financial firms in the world are telling their investors: Get ready for climate change.  The last page of the BlackRock report says:       [C]urrent market prices arguably do not yet reflect the      social costs of burning fossil fuels. . . . This externality      is at the core of the climate challenge.  The externality, of course, being that you take the harm that you cause and instead of putting it in the price of your product, you make everybody else around you pay for it by being a polluter.  Then they asked the question:       What is the correct price of carbon? It is hard to say. A      2015 U.government study estimated $36 of economic damages      for each metric ton of carbon emitted. Yet estimates are      rising: A 2015 Stanford University study points to $220 per      metric ton.  I believe that our U.social cost of carbon is running at about $45 per metric ton right now. And, by the way, it has been upheld twice--at least twice--by Federal courts. In fact, one court rather insisted that the social cost of carbon had to be baked into the underlying rule; otherwise, the underlying rule couldn't pass the test of being logical and fair and not arbitrary and capricious.  So there is the case from some of our leading financial institutions about climate change. They have real money at stake. They have real clients. They can't engage in the kind of nonsense that we engage in around here about climate change not being real or not being important or being something that there is still debate about or being something that if we try to fix it, it is going to cost too much money. All of that is total bunkum processed through all sorts of advertising-type public relations firms by the fossil fuel industry and sold to a gullible public as if it were true.  A few folks who aren't so gullible--all Republicans--have just come out with a very interesting report. Three of them were Treasury Republican Presidents trusted these folks with the conduct of the U.economy: Jim Baker, Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan; Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury under President Bush; and George Shultz, Secretary of the Treasury under President These men have some pretty impressive credentials. Not only was he Secretary of the Treasury, but James Baker was also the Secretary of And not only was George Shultz Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State, he was also Secretary of  These three former Treasury Secretaries have led a group of other investors, including the former chairman of the board of Walmart, the world's largest retailer and employer; Tom Stephenson, a Republican who is a partner at Sequoia Capital, a very successful venture capital firm out in Silicon Valley; and Greg Mankiw, who was Chairman of George Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, so this is a very Republican group. They have a lot of experience. None of them holds elective office now, so they don't have to worry about the fossil fuel industry threatening to crush them in a primary or spend millions of dollars through phony-baloney front groups against them or any of the usual stuff that politicians have to put up with from the fossil fuel industry as it fights to protect that massive subsidy that we have talked about already.  Let's go through this report by these very senior Republican officials. The first sentence:       Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong      to ignore. . . . For too long, many Republicans have looked      the other way.  They go on to propose a conservative climate solution--what they call a carbon dividends plan--which aligns actually fairly well with my American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, which I have put forward in the past and am going to put forward in this Congress as well. I hope, given its alignment with this Republican leadership on climate, that we might actually begin to get some conversations going here. We may have to go hide out of State someplace so the fossil fuel folks don't find who is participating in the conversation and start punishing them for doing so, but we will see how that goes.  The recommendation basically is for a carbon tax that collects revenue to offset the cost of pollution that is not in the price of the product and then return it all to the American people through a big dividend.  The report says: ``A carbon tax would send a powerful market signal that encourages technological innovation and largescale substitution of existing energy and transportation infrastructures, thereby stimulating new investment.''  Furthermore, a well-designed carbon dividends plan, the second half, the tax, would stimulate new investment and ``a well-designed carbon dividends plan would further contribute to economic growth through its dynamic effects on consumption and investment.''  They definitely want to protect that one-to-one relationship so that all the money that comes in goes back out. That is the principle of my bill, as well, and I am more than willing to live with it. But the problems of failing to act also need attention.  Since two of these gentlemen were Secretaries of State, we should take some interest when they say: ``Our reliance on fossil fuels contributes to a less stable world, empowers rogue petro-states and makes us vulnerable to a volatile world oil market.''  We have to address this issue for a lot of reasons, and I couldn't be more satisfied that these two Republican Secretaries of State have actually made the connection that Thomas Friedman has made and that the Department of Defense has repeatedly made in its ``Quadrennial Defense Review'' between our overreliance on carbon and between the harms of climate change and a less stable world--a world in which climate change is what the Defense Department has so often called a catalyst for conflict.  They then reflect a little bit on what is going on with their party: ``The opposition of many Republicans to meaningfully address climate change reflects poor science and poor economics, and is at odds with the party's own noble tradition of stewardship.''  You would never know it nowadays, but the Republican Party was once the party of Teddy They point out that ``64% of Americans worry a great deal or a fair amount about climate change, while a clear majority of Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring.''  They go on to point out ``that 67 percent of Americans''--two thirds of Americans--``support a carbon tax with proceeds returned directly to them.''  Two thirds ``of Americans support a carbon tax with proceeds returned directly to them, including 54% of conservative Republicans.''  So let's not pretend that this is a partisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. It is an issue in which a big special interest has thrown incredible weight around to try to crush one side of the debate. But clearly, if 67 percent of Americans supported anything and 54 percent of conservative Republicans supported that, we would probably be having a sensible conversation in the Senate about whatever that thing was. We just can't do it when that thing happens to be climate change because we have the fossil fuel industry out there--powered up by Citizens United, spending all that money--trying to protect that huge, huge subsidy that they enjoy.  Finally, the report points out--and I see the pages lined up here along the[[Page S1109]]side of the podium: ``Increasingly, climate change is becoming a defining issue for this next generation of Americans, which the GOP ignores at its own peril.''  If this party wants to write off the young generation as they follow the fossil fuel industry off the climate cliff, there will be a very grave price to be paid.  The report concludes: ``With the privilege of controlling all branches of the government comes a responsibility to exercise wise leadership on the defining challenges of our era, including global climate change.''  I don't know where Mr.Mnuchin will lead on climate change at the Treasury There are a number of ways in which the Treasury Department can be influential in this area. To my knowledge, he has never said anything about it yet.  It was not too long ago--2009--that a full-page advertisement ran in the New York Times, a full page advertisement that pointed out that the science of climate change was already, by then, to use the word in the advertisement, ``irrefutable.'' The science of climate change was ``irrefutable,'' the advertisement said.  Then the advertisement went on to say that the consequences of climate change would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' That is another quote from the advertisement: The consequences of climate change were to be ``catastrophic and irreversible.''  On the one hand, you have science that is irrefutable; on the other hand, you have consequences of ignoring it that are catastrophic and irreversible. Who signed that advertisement? None other than Donald Trump--not only he, but his children, Donald Trump, Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump, also all signed it.  The year 2009 was not that long ago. It is possible that the Trump family could refer to what they knew in 2009 and perhaps take advice from a Treasury I hope they take advice from three Treasury Secretaries, but we will see how that goes.  Perhaps Mr.Mnuchin can be a voice to try to get the GOP out of the fossil fuel hole it is in, aligned with the 67 percent of American voters who want to see a revenue-neutral carbon tax, aligned with the majority of Republican conservative voters who would support that, and aligned with the irrefutable nature of the science, and addressing the catastrophic and irreversible consequences in this strange new administration in which the new normal is abnormal. It is perhaps hard to expect much good to come, but let's hope and let's hope Mr.Mnuchin makes himself a part of the solution rather than just a part of the climate-denial problem that so infects us, particularly here in  I yield the floor.

4634,topic-id,497,"Mr.President, when you serve as the Secretary of Treasury, you are charged with a variety of responsibilities, and right at the center of your duties is to address taxes. This is an area that the nominee to head the Treasury Department, Mr.Steven Mnuchin, waded into very early on after his nomination became public.  News leaked on November 29 of last year that Mr.Mnuchin was the President-elect's choice for Secretary of the The very next day, Mr.Mnuchin appeared on a CNBC program and confirmed his selection. During an extended interview with CNBC, he introduced what I have come to call the Mnuchin rule. I will quote Mr.Mnuchin directly with respect to what he said: ``Any reductions we have in upper income taxes would be offset by less deductions, so there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  I will repeat that last part of the Mnuchin rule: ``no absolute tax cut for the upper class.''  Mr.Mnuchin is the President's nominee for Treasury This is a position that has been held by American economic giants like Alexander Hamilton, Albert Gallatin, Salmon Chase, Henry Morgenthau and Lloyd When a nominee for Treasury Secretary makes a pledge like Mr.Mnuchin's, it really ought to mean something. It ought to stand for something.  Unfortunately, it already looks as though the Mnuchin rule is on the ropes. The very first act of the 115th Congress and a unified Republican government, repealing the Affordable Care Act, shatters the Mnuchin rule.  The Affordable Care Act repeal scheme that Republicans kicked off months ago, in my view, is a Trojan horse of tax breaks for the most fortunate. Nobody outside the top 4 or 5 percent of earners would get any of that break. Most of it would go to households in the top 1 percent of earners--even then, the top one-tenth of 1 percent--and it is paid for by taking insurance coverage and tax cuts for health care literally out of the hands of millions of working people.  Then it is back for another whack at the Mnuchin rule later this year. Last week, the New York Times published a story talking about Mr.Mnuchin, which said that ``his guarantee appears impossible to fulfill either under the tax overhaul that the House Republicans are pushing or similar, sketchier proposals that Mr.Trump has offered.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article titled ``Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Math Says the Opposite.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [9, 2017]   Treasury Nominee Vows No Tax Cut for Math Says the                          (By Patricia Cohen)       The newly christened ``Mnuchin rule''--the assurance given      by the Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin that ``there would      be no absolute tax cut for the upper class''--seems as if it      was made to be broken.

4635,topic-id,1594,"After breaking the Mnuchin rule once, the majority is now planning to fast-track a second tax break for the wealthy. This one will be even larger; in fact, it could be 10 times bigger or more. My guess is that a lot of Americans are wondering what has happened to all the campaign talk about fixing the Tax Code and really going out there and standing up for the working people. As the Republican nominee, the President said he was the guy to repair the country's broken tax system. The particulars of the Trump plan were buried deep in the business pages and on his Web site, but the broad strokes of the message were pitched in rallies across the Nation: Donald Trump alone knew how to do the job because he had taken advantage of the rules himself, and he was ready to crack down on those who weren't paying their fair share.  One of the few specifics Donald Trump offered on the stump was that he would close the carried interest loophole. That, of course, has been a favorite of investment fund managers. It would be great if it were actually true. In reality, the promise turned out to be pretty much just a head fake. Rather than closing the loophole and asking investment fund managers to pay their fair share, the Trump plan actually gives them a 25-percent tax cut. In fact, the Trump plan slashes tax rates for corporations and the wealthy across the board at a cost of trillions of dollars.  The President and Mr.Mnuchin might defend this plan by claiming it is a tax cut for the middle class, so I want to spend just a few minutes checking in with that part of the plan. If we read the fine print, we will notice that one of the Trump tax plan's big casualties is something called head of household status. That is a particularly important benefit for a lot of middle-income taxpayers because it reduces their bills. What would it mean for head of household status to go away? Millions of working Americans, mostly single parents, would get hit with tax increases.  Furthermore, the Trump plan eliminates key personal exemptions for millions of other middle-income families. It pushes a lot of families into higher tax brackets than they are in today. The administration touts its proposals for a larger standard deduction and a new child care tax credit as the cure-all for its tax increases on the middle class and on working people, but the math just doesn't add up. Families who are struggling to get ahead today are going to pay higher taxes tomorrow.  So let's recap the Trump tax plan: a multitrillion-dollar tax break for the wealthy and corporations and a gut punch of higher taxes for working families.  At this point, it would be generous to say that the Mnuchin rule is now on life support. If we wanted to design a tax plan to push more Americans out of the economic winners circle, the Trump plan is what you would come up with. When I look at the Trump tax plan that Mr.Mnuchin would be in charge of spearheading, it looks to me as though the administration has zero interest in cleaning out the rot that is right at the heart of America's tax system.  Here is what it is all about, in my view. The Tax Code today is a tale of two systems. If you are a wage earner--a welder in Portland or a nurse in Louisiana--your taxes come straight out of your paycheck. They are compulsory--no special deals. You can even see the numbers right on your pay stub. Once or twice a month, out it comes. There are no special tax-dodging strategies or loopholes to winnow down the tax bill for the welder in Portland or the nurse in You can't set up a John Doe, Inc., in a Cayman Islands P.box to shield your income from taxes.[[Page S1098]]  But the rules are different for the powerful and the well connected. At their disposal are huge armies of lawyers and accountants who specialize in tax games. They specialize in tax tricks. With the right advice, the most fortunate individuals and corporations in the country can decide how much tax to pay and when to pay it. If anybody wonders why people in America feel the tax system is rigged and the rules are stacked against them, this is a big part of the answer. I intend to talk more about that, but I want to come back to highlight the difference between the welder in Portland and the nurse in  When those hard-working Americans are out there working for a wage and once or twice a month have their taxes taken right out of their paycheck, they know they aren't getting anything special. It is compulsory. It is mandatory. They see it on their paychecks. Yet they get lots of news coverage and articles and the like, and they will see that for those who are fortunate, instead of paying taxes in a mandatory and compulsory way, they pretty much get to decide what they are going to pay, when they are going to pay it, and maybe nothing at all. It seems to me that as we look at the nominee for Treasury Secretary, we get a pretty good example of how it does play out in terms of taxes for those fortunate few and how his taxes stand in sharp contrast to that welder in Portland or that nurse in  Not long after ending a 17-year run at Goldman Sachs, Mr.Mnuchin opened a hedge fund called Dune Capital in 2004. He set up an outpost in Anguilla and the Cayman That is not a move you make for the infrastructure or the ease of the commute. It is about a zero-percent tax rate.  During Mr.Mnuchin's hearing, he claimed that having those overseas funds benefited American nonprofits. When he testified in front of the Finance Committee, he said: You know, the main thing we are doing with these overseas funds is we are helping churches and pension funds. But documents from the Securities and Exchange Commission show something quite different. In some cases, 100 percent of his investors were from outside of the United States, and setting up overseas allowed Mr.Mnuchin to help them avoid paying taxes. What was the end effect? Dune Capital was heavily invested in movies. So millions of dollars in profits from Hollywood exports, like the movie ``Avatar,'' were funneled to an offshore web of entities and investors, giving him the chance to skirt a U.tax bill.  At a more recent point in his career, Mr.Mnuchin's bank was up for a merger. The deal had the potential to be a personal windfall for him and a small circle of others. A foundation Mr.Mnuchin chaired reportedly used tax-exempt dollars to fund a write-in campaign pushing for the deal's approval. During the public comment period on a potential merger, this is pretty much the equivalent of stuffing the ballot box.  Now, as a nominee for a Cabinet position, Mr.Mnuchin could be in line for a special elective Federal tax deferral on money made by selling stocks and bonds. That is the very definition of getting to pay what you want, when you want. We hear a frequent and common defense when these kinds of tax tricks are brought into public view. It is true that the people who use them are following the laws on the books, but the outrage in our tax system, as I have said on this Senate floor, is what is legal. That is the real outrage with the American tax system, and it is outrageous that the Senate has allowed obvious gamesmanship to stay legal. It is outrageous that the administration and its chosen nominee for Treasury have shown no interest in changing it.  When you are the Treasury Secretary, one of your paramount obligations is overseeing taxes. The last time the United States overhauled its Tax Code--this was in 1986--the Reagan Treasury Department played a huge role in that effort, and one of the core principles of that reform was treating wages and wealth the same way. Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a tax reform bill based on fairness. It said that the wage earner--that nurse in Louisiana or welder in Portland--their income and the income of those who made their money in finance and on Wall Street and the like would be treated the same. I see no indication that this administration is prepared to repeat that formula.  The campaign promise to fix the broken, dysfunctional Tax Code--Donald Trump's campaign promise--lured in a lot of voters. When I heard that Mnuchin rule the first time, I said that sounds pretty good--no net tax break for those who are the most fortunate. That sounds pretty appealing. The tax plans that the administration and Republicans in Congress have on offer now will not undo the disgusting unfairness that is right at the heart of the American Tax In fact, it is only going to get worse.  This issue has to be at the center of the debate on Mr.Mnuchin's nomination. I am particularly troubled by the fact that the evidence shows that the Mnuchin rule is already on the ropes.  I intend to oppose this nominee. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.
