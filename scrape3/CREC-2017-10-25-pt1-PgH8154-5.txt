                URGE IMMEDIATE PASSAGE OF THE DREAM ACT

  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the immediate passage 
of the Dream Act to bring certainty to the more than 10,000 DREAMers in 
Oregon and DREAMers across the country.
  I have met with DREAMers in my State of Oregon, and tearing them away 
from their lives would be a tremendous loss for our communities. 
DREAMers like Daniel, a dedicated second grade teacher, DACA allowed 
him to come out of the shadows and give back to his community.
  But with President Trump ending DACA, Daniel is rightly anxious about 
his future. He worries about the effect on his students if he is forced 
to leave abruptly in the middle of the school year.
  When we threaten DREAMers, we put their futures at risk, but we also 
risk harming the many people who rely on them, like Daniel's students.
  Mr. Speaker, we must work together and pass the Dream Act 
immediately. We just pledged, ``with liberty and justice for all.'' 
Let's bring justice to the DREAMers and pass the Dream Act.
