                   REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter entirely, I 
appreciated the opportunity to visit with the President yesterday after 
his impressive speech before Congress. We had a positive discussion 
about the upcoming legislative agenda. One important item we discussed 
was the way forward on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.
  Just yesterday, our Members came together for a productive discussion 
on the next steps toward protecting American families from the broken 
promises of ObamaCare. Here in Congress, we remain committed to working 
with the administration to repeal and replace this failed law.
  President Trump, in his address to Congress, reaffirmed his own 
commitment as well. He provided important direction on what the path 
forward should look like as we transition away from ObamaCare toward 
truly patient-centered care.
  Now, look, we know this transition isn't going to be easy. Providing 
relief from the disaster of ObamaCare is going to be a challenge. 
However, the status quo is simply not sustainable. The American people 
need help, and they need it right now.
  That is why we started the process of repealing and replacing this 
partisan law at the beginning of the year, and it is why we will keep 
working to make

this right for American families. It is what the people who sent us 
here have called for, and it remains among our top priorities here in 
the Senate.
