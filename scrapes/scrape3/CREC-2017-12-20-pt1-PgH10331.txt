     RECOGNIZING MAYOR SANDRA MARTIN FOR 30 YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mayor 
Sandra Martin from Flemington, Georgia, for more than 30 years of 
public service. Mayor Martin is a talented public servant who has truly 
made Flemington, in Georgia's First Congressional District, a better 
place to live.
  Flemington is located near Hinesville, Georgia, which is home to the 
Fort Stewart military base, and being the mayor here comes with unique 
challenges. Under her leadership, Flemington took these challenges and 
ran with them.
  Flemington built its first-ever city hall for meetings and events. 
Before that time, citizens needed to search around town for a city 
council member to speak with.
  The city also went from being an inconspicuous town on the side of 
the highway to advertising itself and coaxing visitors to come in and 
experience its hospitality.
  I am proud to have a city official like Mayor Martin who is immensely 
dedicated to our area in the First Congressional District. Other mayors 
could learn from her example of good government.
