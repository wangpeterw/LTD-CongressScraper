                  IN MEMORY OF OFFICER DENNIS McNAMARA

  (Mr. MEEHAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Officer 
Dennis McNamara of the Upper Darby Police Department in Delaware 
County, Pennsylvania.
  Fifteen years ago yesterday, Officer McNamara was brutally gunned 
down and murdered in the line of duty while he served his community. He 
was survived by his wife, Diane, and his wonderful children, Spike and 
Melissa. I was with Diane, Spike, Melissa, and others yesterday as we 
dedicated a road in Dennis' hometown of Upper Darby as the ``Dennis 
McNamara Memorial Highway.'' It was a fitting memorial to Dennis' 
wonderful life and the legacy he has left behind, and it is one of the 
many ways Dennis' own community will never be forgotten.
  Madam Speaker, I will soon be presenting Dennis' family with two 
flags. The first flag flew over the United States Capitol yesterday, 
which marked the 15th anniversary of his death. The second is a flag of 
the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Foundation, which flew 
over the law enforcement memorial--just blocks from here in Judiciary 
Square--during National Police Week.
  No gesture will bring Dennis back to his family, but it is my hope 
that these flags will continue to help his community honor his family 
and the ultimate sacrifice he made.
