           A TERRIBLE INDICTMENT ON CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, a continuing resolution to 
extend Federal spending for 1 month may not pass because the President 
tweeted that he does not support funding for healthcare for 9 million 
American kids.
  This is a terrible indictment on a congressional leadership that is 
again cowering to a petulant, uninformed, and impulsive President, a 
President who is making a mockery of Congress as a coequal branch of 
the Federal Government; and that the congressional Republican 
leadership is complicit is a national embarrassment. I say Congress 
should roll the President and force him to veto children's healthcare.
  Mr. President, a continuing resolution is a failure to act; it is a 
failure to decide; it is a failure to lead; and it represents gross 
negligence as it relates to the basic duty of the institution of the 
United States Congress.
  This is a sad day. Once again, Congress capitulates to a petulant and 
pouting President.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward the President.
