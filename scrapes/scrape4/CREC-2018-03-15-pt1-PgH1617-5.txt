               HONORING VETERAN HOMER VAUGHN WAGNON, JR.

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of Homer Vaughn 
Wagnon, Jr., a veteran of World War II who left this world on November 
29, having ``just satisfied his life's ambitions,'' per the obituary 
provided for him.
  Mr. Wagnon served our country in the infantry, fighting his way 
across France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany as he and his fellow 
members of the Greatest Generation pushed back against tyranny.
  He continued his service to our country in private business, helping 
to build a post-World War II incredible economy as a mechanical 
engineer. His range of new products included mechanical rubber goods, 
radio and TV equipment, and items for naval ships and aircraft 
applications.
  Mr. Wagnon leaves behind the love of his life, Darlene Raitt Wright, 
and Wagnon's 6 children, 11 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren. 
His grandson Tariq Bokhari followed his grandfather's example: In 
distinction, he now serves as an outstanding member of the Charlotte 
City Council.
  Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing condolences to the Wagnon 
family.

                          ____________________
