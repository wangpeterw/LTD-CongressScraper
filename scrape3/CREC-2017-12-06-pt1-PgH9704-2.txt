 CELEBRATING THE BATAVIA BULLDOGS' ILLINOIS STATE FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Batavia 
High School Bulldogs football team on winning the Illinois Class 7A 
State Championship. Holding off the undefeated Lake Zurich Bears and 
winning the thrilling final in overtime, the team ended the season with 
an overall 13 and 1 record.
  Crucial to the victory was quarterback Riley Cooper. The senior 
completed 28 of 42 passes for 295 yards and 3 touchdowns in the 
championship game.
  The final score was a 10-yard touchdown pass to Tommy Stuttle in 
overtime, securing the 21-14 win at Huskie Stadium in DeKalb.
  Leading the team throughout a great regular season and playoff run 
was Coach Dennis Piron, who has headed the team since 2010, and who is 
a 1983 Batavia graduate.
  This is the school's first State championship since 2013. Students 
who cheered their siblings and friends on the 2013 Bulldogs team are 
now carrying the torch and celebrating their own victory as members of 
the 2017 team.
  Congratulations, Batavia Bulldogs, past and present, for your 
achievements. Your success is well deserved.
