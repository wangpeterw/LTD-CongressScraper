 FOCUS ON BIPARTISAN EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF GUN VIOLENCE 
                               IN AMERICA

  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, in light of the tragic and horrific events 
this Sunday, I believe our focus should be on bipartisan efforts to 
investigate the causes and lessen the potential for gun violence in 
America. That is why I am calling on Speaker Ryan to name a select 
committee to address these issues.
  Additionally, I believe the Republican leadership should formally 
withdraw their so-called sportsman's package, which has many 
objectionable provisions.

  Furthermore, we need to bring to the floor a vote on comprehensive 
background check legislation that includes closing the gun show 
loophole and individual internet sale loophole. There is overwhelming 
support in the public and this Congress for those actions.
  I would like to see what the investigation reveals and whether a 
suppressor would have allowed this monster to create more carnage. 
However, we do know he used something called a bump stock, which I 
never heard of before.
  Anything that converts a semiautomatic weapon into something that is 
virtually a fully automatic weapon, which is outlawed, should not be 
sold. The bump stocks and any other devices like that should be banned.
