                       WISHING SENATOR PAUL WELL

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me first say at the outset that many 
of us have extended well wishes to our colleague, Senator Paul, who was 
injured over the weekend. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope that 
he returns soon. He is an important part of the Senate and an important 
colleague to those of us on both sides of the aisle.

                          ____________________
