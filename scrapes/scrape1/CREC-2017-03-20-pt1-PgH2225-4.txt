         RECOGNIZING VIZCAYA, A SOUTH FLORIDA NATIONAL TREASURE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vizcaya, an 
accredited museum and national historic landmark, located in my 
congressional district and the legacy of visionary James Deering, who 
created this south Florida gem 100 years ago.
  With the help of Deering's nieces, public officials, and private 
citizens, Vizcaya has been serving as a public resource for more than 
60 years now. Today, it is at the origins of modern Miami's interest in 
art, international culture and innovation, and welcomes over 275,000 
guests each year.
  Vizcaya will restore several historic village buildings and the 
surrounding landscape, which will enable them to tell the full story of 
the estate, including the legacy of its workers, and to accommodate new 
programs for students and families, including those on urban farming.
  Vizcaya's future will be rooted in its history, but directed toward 
the demands of 21st century Miami.
  For 100 years, Mr. Speaker, Vizcaya has been a place for people to 
gather, to learn, to engage in social activity, and to find 
inspiration. Its continued evolution will cement its role as Miami's 
cultural hub.
