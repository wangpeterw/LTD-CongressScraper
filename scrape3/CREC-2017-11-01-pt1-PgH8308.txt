                  HONORING HERSHEL ``WOODY'' WILLIAMS

  (Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Hershel ``Woody'' Williams and commemorate a naval vessel, which was 
christened in his honor on Saturday, October 21, in San Diego, 
California. The ship will provide for accommodations for up to 250 
personnel, will offer a 52,000-square-foot flight deck, and will 
support helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft.
  Woody Williams grew up on a dairy farm in Fairmont, West Virginia, 
and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve in Charleston, 
West Virginia, on May 26, 1943.
  Woody landed in Iwo Jima on February 21, 1945. Woody fought through 
the remainder of the 5-week-long battle and was wounded on March 6, for 
which he was awarded the Purple Heart.
  As a result of Woody Williams' courageous service in the 21st 
Marines, 3rd Marine Division in the Battle of Iwo Jima, he received the 
Congressional Medal of Honor from President Truman. Today, at 93 years 
old, he is the last living Medal of Honor recipient from that battle.
  I join all West Virginians in congratulating Woody Williams for this 
incredible honor. He is an unparalleled advocate for veterans from all 
eras and a fine example of what it means not only to be a West 
Virginian but an American.
