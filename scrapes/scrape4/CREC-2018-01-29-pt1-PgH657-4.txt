                 RECOGNIZING KANGA ROOF IN BUCKS COUNTY

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a company in 
my district that is making a huge impact by giving back to our 
community. Kanga Roof, a company that has been providing roofing in the 
Bucks County area for over 30 years, celebrated its 10th Holiday Roof 
Giveaway this past December.
  Every year for the past 10 years, Kanga Roof has held a contest to 
provide a new roof to a deserving family in our community. This year, 
they selected my constituent, Bettemarie Bond, who is a tireless 
advocate for individuals with mitochondrial disease and those receiving 
IV infusions and tube feeding, whom I have had the honor of working 
with on this cause.
  Kanga Roof views their annual Holiday Roof Giveaway as a way of 
giving back to our community and making our community stronger. I would 
like to commend them on their commitment to our community and to 
encourage all of our constituents to follow Kanga Roof's lead by being 
good neighbors and giving back to our community.
