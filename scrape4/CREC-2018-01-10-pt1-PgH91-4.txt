                       IN MEMORY OF ROCKY FAWCETT

  (Ms. STEFANIK asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Lewis County 
Legislator Rocky Fawcett. Rocky was a dedicated public servant who 
never stopped believing in the potential of Lewis County. Rocky was 
involved in many local causes and organizations, such as the Cornell 
Cooperative Extension, the Lewis County Chamber of Commerce, and the 
Lewis County Development Corporation.
  To all who knew him, Rocky was intelligent, driven, and deeply 
devoted to public service. Simply put: Rocky Fawcett set the gold 
standard for what it means to be a legislator.
  Rocky was a dear friend and he always greeted me with a huge smile 
and a hug during my many constituent outreach events throughout Lewis 
County.
  I invite Members to join me in keeping his wife, Mary, and his family 
in your thoughts and prayers. May we continue to honor his memory by 
being passionate advocates for our communities in Lewis County and 
beyond.
