                        RECOGNIZING ELLIOTT ROOT

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent 
from the 22nd District of New York, Elliott Root.
  Elliott was born with a single left ventricle and has prevailed over 
tremendous odds in his short life. At the young age of 10 years old, 
Elliott will undergo his fifth open-heart surgery this week.
  Today, I wear the Red Balloon pin in honor of Elliott's courage and 
strength. Throughout the Red Balloon Campaign, Elliott and his mother, 
Amy, have worked tirelessly to raise awareness and create an atmosphere 
of connectivity for all impacted by heart defects.
  Congenital heart defects are the most prevalent birth defect, 
affecting 1 in 100 newborns, leading to the death of more children each 
year than all forms of pediatric cancer combined. Despite these 
staggering statistics, congenital heart defects continue to be 
underrecognized and underfunded.
  Our thoughts and prayers are with Elliott and his entire family as he 
undergoes his fifth open-heart surgery. Elliott's enduring spirit and 
bravery are an inspiration to all of us. Please join me in celebrating 
the life of this courageous young man.
