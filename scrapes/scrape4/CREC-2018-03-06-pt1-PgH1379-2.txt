                      DEMOCRATS HAVE A BETTER PLAN

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, the reckless, regressive, and 
reprehensible Republican budget cuts funding for Social Security, cuts 
Medicare, cuts Medicaid. The Republican budget cuts funding for Meals 
on Wheels, cuts funding for school violence prevention programs. It 
even cuts funding for the Special Olympics.
  Who does that?
  The Republican budget seeks to balance itself on the backs of working 
families, middle class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the 
afflicted, veterans, rural America, and the safety of our children. It 
is an abdication of responsibility. It is a dereliction of duty. It is 
a stunning act of legislative malpractice. The reckless Republican 
budget is a raw deal for the American people.
  Democrats have a better deal focused on better jobs, better wages, 
and a better future for the American people. Democrats have a better 
deal focused on higher pay, lower costs, and providing the American 
people with the tools to succeed in a 21st century economy. Democrats 
have a better deal focused on improving the quality of life of everyday 
Americans.
