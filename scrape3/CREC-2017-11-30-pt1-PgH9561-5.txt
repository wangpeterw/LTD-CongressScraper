             REMEMBERING FORMER CONGRESSMAN MAURICE HINCHEY

  (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a 
giant of the Hudson Valley, former Congressman Maurice Hinchey.
  Mr. Hinchey passed away last week, but 21 years ago, I had the 
opportunity to be a young volunteer on his campaign for Congress. A few 
days ago, I attended his wake with hundreds of my neighbors in the 
Hudson Valley.
  When you met Maurice Hinchey, you met, first and foremost, a real, 
live, flesh-and-blood human being who was strong, principled, and 
passionate. That person became a real hero to many of us in the Hudson 
Valley.
  We celebrate his life of service in the Navy, in the New York 
Assembly, and, of course, here in the Congress.
  I am blessed to represent a district that includes many of the same 
communities that Maurice Hinchey represented. When I took office, I 
heard the same thing again and again: if you want to succeed, just do 
what Maurice Hinchey did. That advice is easier said than done, but I 
have tried.
  He was one of a kind: a leader, a fighter, a gentleman, and a 
statesman. He was a tireless advocate for the Hudson River and for the 
larger environment.

  We are all blessed to have been served by him, and he will be sorely 
missed.
