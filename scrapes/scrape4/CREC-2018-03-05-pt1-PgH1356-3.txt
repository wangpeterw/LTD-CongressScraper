                         YUCCA MOUNTAIN PROJECT

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that my colleagues 
plan to speak in favor of Yucca Mountain tonight and once again attempt 
to revive the long-dead project that brings nuclear waste to my State 
of Nevada. They want to make Nevada's Fourth Congressional District, my 
home, my district, the dumping ground for the rest of the country's 
nuclear waste.
  The Nevada delegation has raised a number of concerns about this 
project, including its location, which sits less than 100 miles 
northwest of Las Vegas.
  Nevadans have strongly opposed the construction of this project.
  As a State with no nuclear energy facilities, it is exceedingly 
unfair that Nevada is asked to serve as the dumping ground for the rest 
of the country's waste.
  Rather than throw away millions more of taxpayer money to revive this 
shortsighted project, this funding could be better spent on 
infrastructure and job creation.
  I will continue fighting tirelessly to ensure the Yucca Mountain 
project stays dead, and I urge my colleagues to join me in finding 
better ways to deal with the nuclear waste created in their States.
