                        TRIBUTE TO CHANCE BROWN

 Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Chance Brown, an 
intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work he has 
done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.
  Chance is a graduate of Douglas High School in Box Elder, SD, and a 
recent graduate of Colorado State University in Fort Collins, CO, 
having earned degrees in sociology, political science, and business 
administration. He is a dedicated worker who has been committed to 
getting the most out of his experience.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Chance Brown for all 
of the fine work he has done and wish him continued success in the 
years to come.

                          ____________________
