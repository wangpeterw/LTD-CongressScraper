          A TRIBUTE TO ARKANSAS STATE SENATOR GREG STANDRIDGE

  (Mr. WOMACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, over the Thanksgiving holiday week, the 
State of Arkansas and our Nation lost a devoted public servant with the 
passing of State Senator Greg Standridge of Russellville, Arkansas.
  He was a 1985 graduate of Russellville High School. He was a Cyclone 
through and through.
  Greg was coowner of CSI Insurance Agency in his hometown, was a 
longtime active member of First Baptist Church, and a member of the 
Russellville Football Booster Club. He found time to serve on boards 
for Workforce Investment, Pope County 911, Teen Challenge Women's 
Ministry, and the Pope County Fair. He was active with the Pope County 
Emergency Services Rescue Unit and was a volunteer firefighter.
  Greg was elected to the Arkansas State Senate in a special election 
in 2015 and selflessly dedicated himself to improving Arkansas while 
fighting his long battle with cancer.
  Mr. Speaker, as former President George H.W. Bush said many years 
ago, any evaluation of having lived a successful life must include a 
measure of service to others. Senator Standridge may have died young at 
the age of 50, but his life was truly well lived.
  I join his wife of 26 years, Karen Standridge; their children, 
Hunter, Lakin, Cameron, and Breonna; his mother, Jewel Simcox; his late 
father, Marvin Standridge; his sister and my classmate, Jeania Evans; 
and other extended family members in celebrating Greg's life.
  Mr. Speaker, we will always remember his infectious smile that could 
fill every room.
