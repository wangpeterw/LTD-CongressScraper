                OPPOSE REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my strong 
opposition to the current efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Nearly 20 million Americans have gained access to health care because 
of the Affordable Care Act, including nearly 1.5 million Floridians. 
Because of the ACA, over 278,000 children in Florida have gained 
healthcare coverage, and 132,000 young adults in Florida have been able 
to remain on their parents' health insurance plan until they reach age 
26. Women in Florida and across this Nation can now purchase health 
insurance for the same price as men because of the ACA's ban on gender 
rating.
  Repealing the law could endanger the health and welfare of hundreds 
of thousands of Floridians and their families. Repealing the ACA would 
not only make America sick again, but it would threaten the economic 
security of every American. I will not stand by and allow my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to dismantle the ACA and threaten the 
health and economic security of millions of hardworking Americans.
