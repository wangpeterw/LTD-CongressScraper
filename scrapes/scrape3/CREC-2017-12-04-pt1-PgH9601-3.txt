                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of wisdom, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Prior to the Great Compromise, Benjamin Franklin addressed the 
Constitutional Convention: ``We indeed seem to feel our own want of 
political wisdom, since we have been running about in search of it. . . 
. In this situation of this assembly, groping as it were in the dark to 
find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented 
to us . . . have we now forgotten our powerful friend?''
  Lord, You are the powerful friend referred to by Franklin, and we 
turn again to You to ask that Your wisdom might break through the 
political discussions of these coming days.
  Bless the Members of the people's House, and all of Congress, with 
the insight and foresight to construct a future of security in our 
Nation's politics, economy, and society. May they, as You, be 
especially mindful of those who are poor and without power.
  May all that is done be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
