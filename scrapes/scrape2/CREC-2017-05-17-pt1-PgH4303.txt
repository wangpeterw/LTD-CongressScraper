                       ALLEGED RUSSIAN COLLUSION

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to join my colleagues 
in honoring our law enforcement officers across America, particularly 
in my home State, and look forward to providing that tribute in days to 
come. I thank my colleague, the sheriff, for his work.
  I have come to the floor today, however, to again comment on the 
appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russian collusion, 
alleged Russian collusion of the President's campaign operatives and 
the President as relates to the 2016 election.
  Director Mueller is a well respected law enforcement leader. I look 
forward to his quick response. But I believe it is important for this 
Congress, and I ask Speaker Ryan to ensure, that the committees of 
jurisdiction--Oversight and Government Reform, House Judiciary 
Committee, and House Intelligence Committee--do their work as well. 
That work would include hearings on the issues before us and an 
impeachment inquiry to determine the facts.
  I believe that we can do this together, Mr. Speaker, not as 
Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans. The truth must be found, 
and America will be better for it.
