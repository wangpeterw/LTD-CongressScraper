          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1697

  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. Rush) be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 1697, as his 
name was added in error.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Illinois?
  There was no objection.
