                    HEALTHCARE DEBATE IN OUR NATION

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, as President Trump and Republicans in 
Congress work toward finally delivering the American people relief from 
ObamaCare, it is important to remember how we got here and why we find 
ourselves in this position today.

[[Page H2927]]

  We are approaching the fork in the road for health care in our 
country. We have a choice of two paths, and they lead to very different 
outcomes.
  ObamaCare's regulatory behemoth is collapsing the individual market 
and is paving the way toward a disastrous result, namely, socialized 
medicine--and the crowded waiting rooms, scarce access to physicians, 
and low-quality health care that comes with it, not to mention an 
unprecedented accumulation of power in Washington, D.C.
  This is not conjecture. Barack Obama, Harry Reid, and a whole host of 
ObamaCare supporters have been completely candid about their ultimate 
goal of a single-payer healthcare system, which could then seamlessly 
devolve into socialized medicine.
  The time to right our course is now. Republicans are offering the 
American people a better way, one that fosters choice, lowers 
healthcare costs, and improves Americans' health outcomes. We have two 
clear and very distinct options. Let's make the right choice and pull 
back from the brink of socialized medicine.
