We need to move quickly and we need to move responsibly, and I just urge my colleagues to act, and act now.  I am very proud of my fellow Texans for the way they have responded. I am proud of the leadership at the local level, at the State level, and I am proud, mostly, of the overwhelming, loving response of reaching out, neighbor helping neighbor, friends and folks in their community taking this responsibility head-on, not waiting on the Federal We have a role, and the Federal Government ought to do all that we can to help those.

171,topic-id,376,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to echo what everyone has said, especially my colleagues, Mr.Green and others, from Texas who have mentioned how we have pulled together. But I want to rise in strong support of this disaster relief funding for those who have been impacted by this terrible storm.  My district is in Texas 36, and it was totally devastated. All nine counties have been declared Federal disaster areas. The entire district was underwater, a vast lake, from Houston over to the Louisiana border. The devastation is truly heartbreaking.  I have traveled to each county and assisted in the recovery efforts, and I have met with the victims. 502 provides desperately needed resources to help our fellow Americans put their lives back together again and provides a hand up, not a handout. Texans don't want a handout, but we do need the help and the hand up.  In the midst of this devastation, the entire world has seen the resiliency, compassion, and determination of the people of Texas, and I am truly inspired by the incredible stories of goodness.  We have had multiple disasters, especially in my district--multiple--even three disaster declarations for some of my counties over the past 3 years. I have met and talked to some of my constituents who had just gotten back into their homes 2, 3 months ago from a flood that impacted us last year. One has told me she still had the price tags on their furniture when she woke up during the night to see water in her house. These are the kinds of things that we are seeing.  But in the midst, as I have said, our churches, our first responders, our private citizens, businesses, people from out of State--and I want to especially commend the State of Louisiana, who came over and provided hundreds of boat teams for us--all around the district, people are helping one another.  I just want to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very, very much-needed funding and showing our fellow Americans that we stand with them in this terrible, terrible time.  I have been around a long time. I have seen storms--Hurricane Audrey in the 1950s--and this storm, Hurricane Harvey, I have never seen one like this before.

367,topic-id,1295,"Mr.President, over the last several weeks I have spent a lot of time traveling around my home State of Wyoming, and the Presiding Officer may have in his home State of Arkansas as well. We all do. We talk to a lot of people and hear from a lot of people as we travel around to the rodeos, the fairs, and the parades.  One of the things I have been hearing more and more about because I am seeing it daily in Wyoming--I know both Senator Daines and Senator Tester, both Senators from Montana have talked about it--has been the incredible forest fires that have been raging in the There are more than 1 million acres of land burning in the Smoke is spreading all around the West, certainly in Wyoming--fire as well as smoke--impacting people, impacting land, impacting the soil, air, water, and impacting life, as well as property.  The damage that is happening is dramatic, and in many ways it is similar to the kinds of comprehensive damage and destruction we are seeing with the big storms hitting, like Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which is on its way to These are incredible storms, and the people of Wyoming want to express and share their sympathy for the people who have lost family members, who have lost property, and those who are still in danger. We also know in Wyoming that people are wanting to volunteer, wanting to go to help by collecting food, supplies, clothing, taking up collections, as well, in churches, schools, and communities because that is the American spirit.  Today I come to the floor to express my admiration for the resilience of the people of the West, as well as the resilience of the people of Texas, Louisiana, and all Americans who are today dealing with the disasters they are facing in their homes.  The other things I heard a lot about--and this will not surprise us--are the concerns still out there regarding the Obama healthcare law. A lot of people in the media seem to think the discussion about that healthcare law is over. I can tell you, for the people of Wyoming, they are still very concerned about what we are seeing in terms of the collapse of the healthcare system, fewer choices, and higher prices. For them, the conversation is not over, and they want to make sure it is not over in Congress either. ObamaCare is still failing, and the American people are certainly still suffering, so we need to do something about it. We need to act.  There was an article by the Associated Press in the paper on Monday that summed up the situation. The headline was ``Millions who buy health insurance brace for sharp increases.''  The article goes on to say: ``Millions of people who buy individual health insurance policies and get no financial help from the Affordable Care Act are bracing for another year of double-digit premium increases, and their frustration is boiling over.''  The article says that these are mostly middle-class folks--hard-working people who may be self-employed or work for small businesses that can't afford to offer insurance. It goes on to say that these millions of Americans ``pay full freight and bear the brunt of market problems such as high costs and diminished competition.''  That is the exact situation people are facing in Wyoming, and I assume in the Acting President pro tempore's home State of Arkansas as well.  The ObamaCare exchange in my State has only one company selling insurance. It wasn't supposed to happen that way. Democrats in Congress who supported the healthcare law said that it was going to create more competition and would bring down the prices and costs for families. In September of 2009, President Obama said that ``without competition, the price of insurance goes up and quality goes down.''  So what is the situation now? All summer long we have heard about insurers who are giving up, pulling back, and dropping out. Millions of Americans will have fewer choices when it comes to their health insurance plans and opportunities in 2018.  On August 24, the largest hospital system in New York State announced that it was going to stop selling an ObamaCare insurance plan it had launched just 4 years ago. This is the home State of the Democratic leader in the Senate, someone who has come to the floor supporting the healthcare law.  The company is blaming the flaws in the Obamacare law and the fact that we haven't been able to do the reforms we need to do. Things I proposed and things that make sense to me--the Democratic leader will not allow us to address the many, many flaws of Meanwhile, the people of his home State of New York are losing another option to get the coverage ObamaCare requires by law for them to have.  They are not alone. People living in 47 percent of all counties will have only one option for coverage next year, so millions of Americans are stuck in an insurance monopoly under  Monday was the deadline for insurance companies to say what they will need to charge next year. People across the country continue to be very worried about how much more expensive their health insurance will be.  The lack of competition is one reason for the skyrocketing prices, but other big reasons for the increase in prices are actually the tax increases that were put in place when ObamaCare was passed. The healthcare law included $1 trillion in new taxes.  One of the biggest ones hitting hard-working families is a tax on every health insurance plan that gets sold. It is called the health insurance tax. There was a new study last month that found this tax is going to raise prices by about $500 per family next year.  The tax alone is raising the cost $500 per family next year. That is just to pay for one of the taxes. Republicans want to get rid of the tax. That was part of our repeal-and-replace plan.  Every Democrat voted no--voted no--to removing the taxes, so premiums are continuing to soar because the healthcare law is unsustainable, and the taxes are unbearable for hard-working families. We have to do something to help people and to reverse the damage caused by  I voted for the repeal legislation in July, and I am going to continue to work to replace But until[[Page S4983]]that happens, I am glad to see the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions is looking into other ways we can make changes to The committee is working on ways to stabilize the individual market for next year. They are going to hear from Governors and State insurance commissioners about giving States more flexibility in dealing with some of the healthcare law's mandates. The committee is also going to be listening to doctors and to patients.  When I talk to doctors and nurses and patients back home in Wyoming, they tell me that the healthcare system we have now under ObamaCare isn't working. I see it every day. What I hear and what I see when I visit the hospitals and when I go back to my old medical office is that we need to replace it with something that actually makes healthcare more affordable. That was a big part of the Republican reform effort: Let the States do what works for their State and for the people who live there.  The Obama healthcare law is still hurting It is not getting better on its own. It is up to us in Congress to do all we can to help Americans who have been trapped in the ObamaCare death spiral.

205,topic-id,174,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to add $5 million to expand the Visa Security Program which will fund two more high-risk visa security posts in the most volatile parts of the world.  The global threat of radical Islamic extremism is very real and requires a robust vetting system to ensure those seeking to do us harm do not enter our borders.  Despite success in our efforts to destroy ISIS, we know hot spots around the world serve as a breeding ground for radical ideology. That is why expanding our visa security program is paramount.  In 2010, I questioned then-Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano about why the Visa Security Program hadn't been accelerated and emphasized the need to take prompt action to bolster screening capabilities overseas.  It remains a priority today. The Visa Security Program is a vital part of our antiterrorism efforts, and its success is essential because if we are not safe, nothing else matters.

46,topic-id,237,"Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor of the House dealing with autonomous vehicles. I think this is one of the most important issues that nobody is really focused on. I wish it were not on the suspension calendar and we had a chance to spend several hours discussing it here.  What you have done is forge a bipartisan coalition to be able to leapfrog going forward, to be able to not just focus on safety, but how autonomous vehicles have the opportunity to reshape the American landscape dealing with recovering right-of-way and being able to have new economic opportunities.  But this must be done right. The fact that ``Driver'' is the number 1 category of employment for men without a college education, means there could be some problems here. If we don't do it right, we can actually increase congestion rather than decrease it.  But I think you have established the framework to allow us to go forward, to be able to capitalize on this innovation, to be able to accelerate American leadership and avoid the problem we had with drones where the FAA was not really capable of dealing with drones which were more like flying cell phones than dealing with jets.

69,topic-id,1167,"Mr.President, we are here to stand this afternoon for close to 800,000 young men and women--10,000 of them are living in Connecticut--who have relied on a promise, not just any old promise but a promise from the United States of  The promise to them was that they could come forward, share information about their cell phones, their addresses, their relatives, their workplaces, their tax information, and they would be permitted to live here, study here, work here, and give back to their communities.  Now America is breaking that promise and betraying its values in the decision by the President of the United States to end the DACA This decision is repugnant to the basic ideals of It is repulsive to the values that underlie the rule of law.  I heard a commentator last night saying: You know, these DACA people, when they came here, they broke the law. Think of it for a moment. A 2-year old, a 3-year old brought by their parents, maybe by a stranger, maybe by other relatives, is breaking the law because that relative then failed to go through the steps necessary for documentation. Or there may have been a variety of other circumstances, such as persecution, threatened death and injury in the country where that young man or woman was born.  But we know--because it is part of the DACA Program--that they were minors when they came here. They made no decision to break the law. They have been here for their entire lives, except for a few months or years.  We know also that, for almost all of them, this country is the only one they know, and English is usually the only language they speak. Their lives are here. Their friends are here and families as well. But most important for the United States of America that made that promise, their futures are here. They are, as the President of the United States said, terrific people. We love them, as he also said.[[Page S4992]]  The announcement that he would end their legal status here, that they would be deported, that they would be ejected from this country is the height of hypocrisy and inhumanity. It is cruel and irrational, it will deprive our economy of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years, it will mean disruption in workplaces, and that is why employers are protesting the decision. It will mean schools will be uncertain about how many students there will be, and that is why university presidents and administrators are condemning it, but, most importantly, it will betray who we are as Americans--a nation of immigrants, a nation that keeps its promise.  Now, let's be very clear. When the Attorney General of the United States says there will be an orderly wind down--I think those are the terms he used. There is no such thing as an orderly wind down of There is disruption and destruction, already chaos and confusion, terror among the young people who are living their lives now seemingly on borrowed time. It is borrowed time because the President of the United States has thrown a ticking timebomb into this body, in effect playing chicken with their lives. They are the ones whose lives will be blown up if that timebomb explodes. They are, indeed, voices and faces who have come to us in the last day or so, two of them from Connecticut I met with or saw.  The first is Mirka Dominguez-She has been in the United States for 16 years. She is pursuing her dream at Southern Connecticut State University of becoming a teacher. She was student teaching last week, but her future career in education has suddenly been jeopardized.  Jonathan Gonzales, too, is a student at He has a double major in economics and applied mathematics. He also mentors other students at public schools in New He has the freedom basically to live as anyone else in this country, to drive to work, and his freedom, too, is in jeopardy.  They have come to Washington, DC, today not only to share their stories but to raise their voices and represent those 10,000 others in Connecticut, like Vania, who was born in Mexico and brought to Willimantic at age 3. She thinks of Connecticut as her home. It is the only home she knows, where she went to school and made her friends. Would she be sent back to Mexico, where she knows no one, has no job or connection? Will she go by plane or will she be forced to walk to the border or maybe by car? We are talking about deportation--physical ejection from the country--not a vague concept of maybe in a few years. We are talking about deportation of 800,000 people, beginning in 6 months, on a scale, a magnitude, and scope that is unprecedented in the history of the United States of America--the same country that welcomed my father at the age of 17, when he fled Germany to escape persecution and knew virtually no one, had not much more than the shirt on his back and spoke almost no Just as many of them came to this country at a much younger age, and this country gave them, as it did my father, a chance to succeed.  There is no orderly way to wind down this program. There is only grief, pain and suffering for those 800,000 Dreamers but also for the rest of us, for our economy, for our sense of self and morality.  As far as the rule of law is concerned, these young people are not the lawbreakers. It is the Attorney General of the United States who is wrong about the law but, more importantly, wrong to decline to defend the law and prejudging, instead, what the result would be if this case went to court, if those 10 attorneys general went to court on DACA to prove their case, including the U.Supreme  Where does Attorney General Jeff Sessions have the power to prejudge what the Supreme Court of the United States would do?  So we have a decision ahead of us, which is to rise to the challenge, to diffuse that timebomb, to pass the Dream Act, to enable these young people who are faced with terror and anxiety to have a chance to continue productive and important lives and to avoid the economic nightmare for employers and job creators who depend on them.  We have the opportunity and obligation now to make sure these young people are protected, not punished, because their futures are at stake, our future as a nation is at stake, and I am here to say to Jonathan, to Vania, to all of the Dreamers that we will fight as long and hard as possible to make sure the American dream is alive and well for you. That dream was promised to you by a great country, and great countries keep their promises.  Thank you. I yield the floor.

68,topic-id,1116,"Mr.President, the Senator from Massachusetts has delivered a powerful message, obviously, one from the heart and a compelling message. I want to thank her for that.  We have a bunch of new pages here. They showed up for duty earlier this week, and they are generally, I think, rising juniors, probably 16 years old or so. Most of the 800,000 people who we are talking about here as Dreamers came here before they were old enough to be a page, and many of them were not even old enough to go to kindergarten or first grade. They didn't come here by their own volition.  They were, for the most part, brought here by their parents. They were brought here to flee horrific conditions in countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador, where there is violence, murder, and mayhem that is largely created because of our addiction to drugs in this country. They send us drugs trafficked through those countries from South America, and we send guns and money to places such as Honduras, Guatemala, and El  When we take into custody bad guys, people who are here illegally and who are also criminals, where do we send them? We send them back to Honduras, Guatemala, and El We send them criminals, and we send guns and money to those three countries. The conditions that this toxic mix creates are ones that I wouldn't want to submit my children or my family to, and, frankly, a lot of the people in those three countries feel the same way.  We are complicit in their misery. We are complicit in their misery, and that is why so many folks in those three countries, which are called the Northern Triangle, try to escape.  These kids didn't come here on their own. They came here with their parents. Many of them, frankly, don't have any memories of where they were born. We are not looking for them to become American citizens. What DACA attempts to do is to give them some time--to give us some time--to be able to make their stays here legal--something short of citizenship.  If your hearts aren't touched by the stories that Senator Warren just told us about these three young people, I want to take a little different approach and express why we should care. I came here to the Senate some years ago as a recovering I was privileged to be Governor of Delaware from 1993 to 2001, and people say that I am still a recovering  I have focused much of my life on public service and on creating a nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. Presidents, Governors, Senators, and mayors like to talk about the jobs they created and, in truth, we don't create jobs. People in our positions try to create a more nurturing environment for job creation, and that includes a quality workforce with the skills that are needed by employers. It includes transportation infrastructure that works. It includes public safety. It includes access to capital to finance the projects. It includes a lot of things: energy, a reasonable tax burden, and commonsense regulations. Those are some of the elements that create a nurturing environment.  One of the top items on that list is always workforce--people who have the skills that employers are looking for, people who have the willingness to come to work and to work hard, to be trained, and to be promoted, in many cases, and people who are honest.  I have not met 800 But at Delaware State University, which is a historically Black college and university in Dover, DE--they have been around for 125 years--there are about 40 Dreamers who are undergraduates there, either freshmen or sophomores, and I have met most of them. They are some of the most remarkable college students I have ever met. These are students who aren't just getting by with a 2.0 average or 3.0 average. These are students who are on the dean's list, who come to school on time, who don't cut classes, who make excellent grades, who work in many cases part-time jobs to help support their time in school, and who are anxious to be able to make real contributions to our community, to our State, and to our country.  One young man, who was from El Salvador, at a public event we had 2 days ago on Tuesday at Delaware State University, said this to us--to the president of the university, Harry Williams, and their new provost, Tony He stood up, he held his hand over his heart, and he said: Every day since I was the age of 5 in kindergarten, in the school I held my hand over my heart and pledged allegiance to that flag. He said: I don't have any other flag. I don't have any other country. This is my country.  We need young men and young women like him.  I learned early this month, from the Department of Labor jobs report for the month of August, that one of the things it shared with us was that there are millions of jobs in this country that are going unfilled. There are millions of jobs in this country that are going unfilled. We have thousands of them in Michigan probably has tens of thousands. I was told by one of the Ohio Senators that there are jobs in Ohio that are not being filled because the people who are applying for them don't have the skills, the work ethic, or the record. In some cases, they can't pass a drug test. Yet these employers in all of our States need workers. In a day and age when we need workers with the academic skills and the work skills--we need them probably more than ever--we are ready to pack up 800,000 of them and send them back to where their parents came from, where they were born.

302,topic-id,2324,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule for consideration of H.3354, the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, also known as the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act of 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Appropriations  Mr.Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the second installment of the House's effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills on the floor for the first time since 2006. The overall package will consider the remaining eight bills, covering $416.3 billion in total spending. It represents many months of work by the Appropriations  Today's rule covers four divisions of the bill: the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act; the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act; the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Together, these four divisions encompass $168.2 billion of discretionary Federal spending. This represents a decrease of $7.8 billion from fiscal year 2017, as Congress seeks to fulfill its obligation to the American people to be fiscally responsible stewards of the taxpayers' hard earned money.  Most importantly, it represents the next step in fulfilling the greatest responsibility we have as legislators: to fund the Federal Government and keep it open each year to provide our constituents the services they deserve while ensuring that we appropriately prioritize where and how to spend taxpayer dollars.  Mr.Speaker, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies division will provide approximately $20 billion in appropriations, a decrease of $870[[Page H6679]]million from fiscal year 2017. The division will fund critical programs for farmers and ranchers, which is of critical importance to my home State of  The bill also supports conservative priorities, including language rolling back regulations that harm businesses, industries, farming and ranching operations, and rural and urban communities alike. In particular, the bill includes language allowing schools to get waivers from particularly problematic Obama administration regulations governing school lunches, and prevents the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from imposing harmful de minimis levels of trading activity that would force thousands of end users to comply with onerous regulatory requirements.  The bill also includes language changing the Food and Drug Administration's predicate date rules for premium cigars, e-cigarettes, and vaping products, thereby preventing the FDA from regulating these industries out of existence.  There is much to like in the Agriculture Appropriations division, and I look forward to considering the bill on the floor.  On the security side of the ledger, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations division provides $44.3 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion over fiscal year 2017. Of importance, the bill provides $7 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an increase of $620 million. These funds will be used to enforce immigration laws and combat illegal immigration, which our constituents have repeatedly told us they oppose.  The bill provides $13.8 billion for Customs and Border Patrol, an increase of $1.6 billion, to ensure the continued security of our border. It also provides $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction on the Southern border, thus fulfilling the first step of one of President Trump's key promises. It provides $10.5 billion for the Coast Guard and supports FEMA's disaster relief fund at $7.3 billion.  As with the earlier security appropriations package the House passed at the end of July, the funds in this division will help ensure America's national security and go a long way towards funding key Member priorities.  The State and Foreign Operations Appropriations division provides $47.4 billion, a decrease of $10 billion from fiscal year 2017. Even with this decrease, the committee has funded key priorities. Security assistance is funded at $8.8 billion, and full funding is provided for battling international organized crime, antiterrorism programs, and combating cybercrime. The bill also fully funds the $3.1 billion Memorandum of Understanding with  The Appropriations Committee has prioritized programs of importance and de-prioritized programs that are not in the best interests of the United States, such as reducing funding for the U.by $939 million, eliminating all funding for UNESCO, and eliminating funding for the Global Climate Change  In producing this division, the Appropriations Committee made difficult choices about the Nation's priorities, and made them well, and ensured that taxpayer dollars are going to the most important, critical, and efficient programs.  Finally, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations division provides $56.5 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over fiscal year 2017. That number does not include $45 billion also authorized to be spent by the highway trust fund for America's highways. Of note, the bill provides $16.6 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, an increase of $153 million, to maintain and promote air travel and security. This sum includes $1 billion for so-called NextGen for more efficient air traffic control, and $162 million for the contract tower program, a crucial safety net that covers many districts across the country, including facilities like Westheimer Airport in Norman, Oklahoma, as well as towers in Lawton and Ardmore in my own home district.  It provides $38.3 billion in net discretionary funding to Housing and Urban Critically, it sustains Section 8 and Public and Native American housing programs at $27.5 billion. It also includes increases in funding for programs benefiting vulnerable citizens, including $573 million for housing for the elderly, an increase of $70.6 million over fiscal year 2017, and $47 million for housing for Persons with Disabilities, an increase of $800,000 over fiscal year 2017.  In all, T-HUD Appropriations covers important priorities and ensures that our Nation's housing and transportation infrastructure will be adequately funded to meet our needs.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of our most important responsibility as Members of Congress, and provides appropriate funding in four areas: Agriculture; State and Foreign Operations, Homeland Security, and Transportation and Urban  I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their months of work in making this bill a reality, and I cheer their efforts on moving forward to the completion of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations process.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1430  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.Cole), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I have nothing but the highest respect for my colleague from Oklahoma (Mr.Cole), and I know he wants this House to run better. But the fact of the matter is, I feel bad that he has to defend this lousy, restrictive, indefensible process.  As I said last night in the Rules Committee, regular order in this House is dead. The current Republican leadership has made it very clear that they have nothing but contempt for regular order, and today's appropriations package is only another example of that fact.  Instead of considering bills one by one, and allowing thoughtful debate and Member input, Republican leaders decided to call up eight appropriation bills all at once this week, and even set amendment deadlines while Members were back in their districts for the August work period.  Last night, in the Rules Committee, Republicans blocked 229 amendments from even coming to the floor on the four bills we are talking about today alone. Those are Democratic and Republican ideas that won't be heard and won't be debated. Who knows how many more they will block on the next set of appropriation bills?  That is not the open process that we were promised by Speaker That is not regular order, my friends.  What is even worse than this terrible process is the substance of the bills that are being brought before us. They are filled with funding cuts and poison pill riders that attack women's health, attack poor people, attack healthcare rights; repeal important financial reforms that protect our constituents and our economy; undermine the Affordable Care Act; make our land, air, and water dirtier; make our roads less safe; and undermine important civil rights protections. I could go on and on and on and on.  These bills are political documents, Mr.They are red meat for the Republican base which, I think, is at around 15 percent of the American people the last time I checked. That is right, Mr.Speaker, the majority's ideas are so unpopular that over three-quarters of the American people disapprove of what they are doing here today. That is not coming from any liberal or leftwing source. That poll was released last week by FOX News, you know, the network that you guys always watch.  We all know we will need a continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown on October 1, so why are we wasting the House's time on this partisan exercise when we should be dealing with the CR?  And oh, yes, we need to raise the debt ceiling, pass a budget, continue to fund hurricane relief, and so much more we need to do.  Mr.Speaker, I am sick and tired of playing to the extremes. I am sick and tired of this President picking a fight with a different group of people every week, constantly trying to divide[[Page H6680]]Americans, rather than unite us for the common good.  And the latest target are the The DREAMers are our coworkers, our relatives, our neighbors, and our children's classmates. They have lived nearly their entire lives in They are part of the very fabric of our country.  The decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, is a cruel betrayal of their trust in the United It needlessly and stupidly robs us of the enormous talents, hard work, and ingenuity of these 800,000 young people. Ending DACA is a lose-lose proposition for America and for us all.  President Trump vowed to show great heart in his decision and declared that DREAMers could rest easy. That is a lie, and that is a betrayal.  And shame on the Republican leadership of this House that has avoided making DACA a permanent program for nearly 7 years. Shame on the Republican Party for voting against the DREAM Act in 2010, even though it ultimately passed the  Shame on the Republicans in the Senate for blocking cloture in 2010, when it was clear that there were plenty of votes to pass the DREAM Act then. Shame on the Republican leadership of this House for not making DACA a permanent law when President Obama first initiated the program in 2012.  Shame on the House Republican leadership for failing to take up the Senate-passed comprehensive immigration bill for the past 4 years, which included DACA and a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship for the DREAMers and so many other immigrants caught in legal limbo in our country.  Shame on the Republican leadership for being such political cowards that they have failed time and time again to actually demonstrate leadership and resolve these problems.  800,000 young people, who are totally American in every way that matters, put their trust in the United States Government and in us here in this Congress, not just to protect them, but to be proud of them. They have been cruelly betrayed.  The memo issued yesterday by the Department of Homeland Security even says that they should be prepared to pack their bags and be deported to their countries of origin. But, Mr.Speaker, the simple truth is, America is their home.  It is unconscionable that the President pardoned radical racist Sheriff Arpaio, who actually is a criminal, while punishing 800,000 law-abiding, hardworking  I stand with the CEO of Microsoft and hundreds of other business leaders who said to the President: ``To deport a DREAMer, you'll have to go through us.''  I stand with the thousands of religious leaders, college and university presidents, mayors, State attorneys general, and civic leaders who demand that we reject the President's decision and have Congress pass the DREAM Act immediately. This Congress cannot and must not continue to fail these 800,000 young people.  This morning, this House passed emergency aid for Hurricane A DREAMer died in Houston attempting to rescue victims of the floodwaters. Another DREAMer, who is a Houston paramedic, and who worked night and day in rescue and relief efforts, just found out yesterday that his country, the only country he has ever known, has turned its back on him. Well, I refuse to turn my back.  Mr.Speaker, we all know that the DREAMers need a permanent legislative fix. We can do that this very day. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Roybal-Allard's bipartisan, bicameral bill, the DREAM It is time to do what is right.  You know, earlier today, Speaker Ryan said: Well, we have time to work this out. Really?  The Speaker seems totally content to have 800,000 people continue to live with uncertainty and fear. I think that that is sad and that is cruel.  He also said: We need to develop some sort of compromise.  I don't know what he is thinking about. Maybe he is thinking about trying to add more border security money or add this stupid wall that the President keeps on talking about.  Well, here's the deal. There is nothing to compromise on. You either support the DREAMers or you don't. They are not political pawns. They are people like you and me and our kids. They deserve better from us. Stop screwing around with their lives.  Defeat the previous question. We can pass the DREAM Act today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

303,topic-id,1264,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to begin by discussing process with my good friend from Massachusetts, where I think he makes some good points, but I think he fails to recognize the progress that this bill represents.  My good friend knows, because we have the privilege of working together on the Rules Committee, I have thought for many years, frankly, that we needed to get back to regular order. I remind this House the last time we actually operated under it in an appropriations process was in 2006. My friends were actually in the majority when we got rid of open rules on appropriations bills. My friends never brought all 12 appropriations bills to the floor and where they were subject to amendments by various  I would agree with my friend, this is not a perfect process that we have. If I had my way, we would go back to the way we operated in 2006, before the last Democratic majority, actually bring the bills down individually and, frankly, give every Member an open shot at amendment. I think that is the appropriate way to proceed.  Again, my friends thought differently when they were in the majority and never made a move to restore regular order--quite the opposite. We have actually fought to do that. We did have a period of open rules on appropriations bills. We didn't get every bill down here, I regret to say, but we got quite a few of them down. But my friends decided they would engage in poison pill tactics.  I regret, honestly, personally, that my conference gave into that; were more worried about casting tough votes. I think you are sent here to cast tough votes.  So I will make this commitment to my friend. I will continue to work with him and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who would like to return to that process. However, I do recognize this is significant progress toward doing that.  This is the first time, since 2006, that all 12 bills, in one form or another, will reach this floor, and, frankly, every single Member has been free to offer amendments on any portion of those 12 bills that they care to. Now, not all of them were made in order by the Rules Committee, and I would hope we get past that again some day.  But, again, before my friends decry that too much, they need to remember the role they played in actually getting us out of that process.  I also would like to talk just briefly with my friend about his thoughts about DACA, and I am sure we will have a good discussion on that in the course of the day, and, honestly, I think the discussion is helpful.  But I think the President of the United States did the right thing when, number one, he recognized that he does not have the constitutional authority, something even his predecessor wondered about, to actually engage in law and put this issue back in the hands of the The Congress now has 6 months to deal with it. The Speaker has assured us that we will do that.  I think the appropriate way to proceed is to have the committee of jurisdiction actually hold hearings and move forward, but we will see which way we go. But I think there is a better chance for a long-term solution, as even my friend agrees, if we have a legislative fix to the problem. I think that will involve some give-and-take, but my hope is we will end up at a place where all parties are satisfied. But we will see. That is what the legislative process is all about.  Final point to make, Mr.Speaker, I think we need to recognize that what we are debating on here today, in terms of these four appropriations[[Page H6681]]bills, and we will have another tranche of appropriations bills down here later, is actually a process.  What we are really doing today is defining the position of the majority party as to where it stands on funding the government. I don't expect my friends to agree with that. There will be elements of these bills that they agree with without a doubt. I don't think they will oppose a lot of things that we do in regard to T-HUD, or in regard to some of these other various programs that we will deal with.  But at the end of the day--and my side needs to recognize this--we are going to end up in a negotiation with the United States Senate and the administration some time probably after the 1st of October, and that negotiation has to be bipartisan.  As my friends know, the other body requires 60 votes, and that would mean there has to be Democratic participation. And quite frankly, the appropriations bills that have moved across the floor here in fiscal year 2015, fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, have all been bipartisan. They have all been the product of negotiations.  At the end of the day--and I remind my friends, in May, a majority of them actually voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill for FY 2017 in the House and in the Senate, as did, by the way, a majority of Republicans in the House and Senate, and President Trump signed it. So we know how this process ends, and we know how to make it work appropriately. This is simply another step in the process.  It is my hope that, at the end of the day, we arrive at a bicameral, bipartisan process that actually funds the government, and we are able to accomplish, in concert with one another, things that we think are important to the American people. I have a great deal of confidence we will get there because that is what we have done the last 3 years. We are actually doing it a little better this year.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I just want to say to my good friend from Oklahoma, who I respect a great deal, that if he wants to defend this process, he can go right ahead and do so. But I think most people watching this, the fact that two-thirds of all discretionary Federal spending is going to be decided in, like, a week's time, I don't think is a good process, and I don't think it is one that the American people have much confidence in.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect that any Member, really, has read all 1,305 pages of the eight bills that my friend is bringing to the floor, and I am not sure everybody has had time to read all the 970 amendments that were proposed--many of them that were not made in order by the Rules So this is not a process I think anybody wants to defend.  The final point I want to make with regard to the President's decision on DACA, as the gentleman knows, this Congress and the previous Congresses could have acted on this any time they wanted to. When the Democrats were in control here in the House, we did. We passed the DREAM Unfortunately, many of you wouldn't support it, but it actually passed the House, and we had Republican obstructionism in the  Now, if you want a legislative fix, we have the solution for you.

Numbers are how we keep track, and I want to mention a number of numbers that I think will help all of us understand the magnitude of what has occurred and will help us wrap our heads around what this disaster has meant for not only Texas but for the country.  The largest numbers are the toughest--not the toughest to swallow, and I will get to those in a moment, but simply to comprehend. They are the ones that make your jaw drop.  Twenty-seven trillion--that is the number of gallons of rain that Harvey pummeled on Texas and  Then there is 2.7 million--that is how many liters of water have been provided to Texas by FEMA as of last Don't forget that parts of the city of Beaumont are without drinking water or are subject to a boil notice for 7 more days.  There is another number: 1 million. That is the number of cars reportedly destroyed by the storm--1 million cars.  Forty thousand--that is the number of homes Harvey permanently wrecked. At least that many people are still, even today, in shelters, living off of cots at convention centers, inside government-funded motel rooms, or living with friends and family.  Next come the middle batch of numbers, slightly smaller and more manageable sums. Some of these actually come as a relief. Some of them remind[[Page S4976]]us why writer Walker Percy, a native of our neighbor Louisiana, used to say that hurricanes, as terrible and life-altering as they are, sometimes give us hope--because they draw people closer together as neighbor helps neighbor.  Four thousand two hundred--that is the number of pounds of flour employees went through at El Bolillo restaurant in Southeast The bakers were trapped inside their kitchen for 2 days during the storm, so what did they do? They did what bakers always do: They baked. In this case, they baked up pan dulce--traditional Mexican pastries--for flood victims. Their ovens were on all night for their neighbors. One young girl on Twitter praised the Bolillo bakers as ``angels.'' They gave people what they needed most, perhaps, during this storm, and that is a sense of normalcy.  Two thousand seven hundred thirty-one--that is the number of cattle, horses, and sheep which various ranchers and helicopter pilots, like Ryan Ashcraft, have saved in places like Brazoria County and which are now inside makeshift stables in fairgrounds and parking lots. Animal rescue has been a crucial and difficult part of the equation in communities affected by the storm. Of course, in the shelters Senator Cruz and I visited, they had to make accommodation for pets because people wouldn't leave their cat or dog in the floods. They wouldn't leave unless they could bring their animal with them. They have had to make some accommodation--and they have--which made it easier for people to leave their flooded homes.  Then there is another number: 200. That is the number of soaking-wet, stranded Houstonians Jim McIngvale and his staff rescued in their delivery trucks. Most of us from Texas, and especially from Houston, know Mr.McIngvale as ``Mattress Mack.'' He is in the furniture business, and he opened up his giant furniture showrooms as shelters. They provided portable showers and an inventory of brand-new beds and sofas for folks who had nowhere else to sleep.  Getting rest couldn't have been easy, though, not when so many displaced people were still thinking about the storm and its consequences, still feeling the dampness in their clothes and remembering the pounding rain and wondering what they were going to do to get on with their lives.  One hundred thirty-two--that number represents the speed in miles per hour of the most punishing wind gusts recorded in Port Aransas on August 25. It is hard to imagine the power of the wind attacking homes and structures--eight times faster than a charging bull.  In the days ahead, we need to remember just how strong the storm really was. I brought a few charts to help remind us of that and the aftermath.  This is a picture outside of I visited a synagogue in a place called Meyerland in the Houston area where they have literally been flooded 3 years in a row. This is one of the members of that congregation, and she invited me to come to her home so I could see all the damaged drywall, furniture, and other items on her front lawn which have now been pulled out of her house.  Finally, we come to the last set of numbers, the smallest ones but in many ways the most painful, the hardest to forget, numbers like 45, which is the angle in degrees of bent electric poles I saw in Rockport when I toured the destruction after the storm last week. Other electrical poles lay on the ground. The town smelled of gasoline and even natural gas leaks, which we smelled in the Rockport area. Of course, the ground was littered with broken glass and strewn books and things like that. Boats in the marina had been tossed about and smashed, their sails ripped to shreds, as local residents had mostly fled. Here is another picture of that damage in Rockport,  Harder still, though, is the number 25, which is the years Andrew Pasek lived before he tragically stepped on a live electrical wire in ankle-deep water on August 29. A resident of Houston, Andrew was an animal lover, and he was trying to locate and save his older sister's cat when he stepped on this electrical wire and lost his life.  We, of course, offer our condolences to all of those families who have lost loved ones, including Andrew's, in their time of grief, and we pledge to remember him and all of the flood victims in our prayers. Sadly, Andrew was joined by 59 others who lost their lives. As I said earlier, that number continues to grow each day as the waters recede and as we find people who did not leave their homes, perhaps because they were elderly and unable to get out, living alone, for example. So we expect that number to, sadly, get even higher.  Six is the number of family members Samuel Saldivar lost when a van he was driving was tossed by a strong current into the bayou. As with Andrew's family, our thoughts and prayers go out to Samuel during what I am sure has been a dark and trying week, one nearly impossible to make sense of.  But for each story of loss, each family that is hurting, there are many other reasons for hope as we embark on what is a long road to recovery.  Consider five--the number of bed-ridden, elderly patients from Cypress Glen Nursing Home who required special boats to get them out, boats with generators that could power their life support assistance.  We are grateful for Good Samaritans like Dan LeBlanc from Port Arthur, Doug Barles, Jr., and Robert Bode for managing this operation, which was no easy task. Here is a picture of those gentleman. Volunteers with no special expertise in search and rescue, these gentleman saved more than 100 patients.  Finally, the number I will end with is zero. That is the amount of complaining done by a gentleman named Jim Rath who exemplifies the Texas spirit. His house was destroyed in a flood 2 years ago, and he had just finished rebuilding it when Harvey hit and destroyed it again. Was he shaken by this course of events? Well, sure, he was. But did he complain? No, he did not. Of all his lost possessions, Mr.Rath said, ``The main thing is: This is just stuff.'' Then, like other Texans are doing now, he rolled up his sleeves. With saws and jackhammers, they are already moving forward.  Zero is also the amount of time we have to waste here in The Texans I know aren't just sitting around waiting for the government or for government aid, but that doesn't mean we should twiddle our thumbs here in Washington, We have to act. That is why I am working with Senator Cruz and the entire Texas delegation in crafting an aid request that addresses flood relief but without imposing burdensome mandates or regulations. As Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal this week, this measure needs to be tight and specific. She said:       There should be no larding up or loading it down with      extraneous measures. This is an emergency.  But that means we have to act and act with dispatch.  I applaud the House of Representatives for moving quickly today to approve an initial $8 billion downpayment on disaster relief, and I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to follow the House's lead and expedite passage for this first tranche, this downpayment on what will surely be a more expensive list of costs. We are going to continue to work with Governor Abbott and the team back in the State to make sure the Federal, State, and local actors are all on the same page. But right now, let's quickly send Texas a downpayment. Let's show that we are actually serious.  I was gratified by the outpouring of emails and texts--even the Presiding Officer reached out, and I appreciate that--from people expressing their concern about what was happening in I appreciate that very much. But now we need to demonstrate that those weren't just words and follow them up with concrete action.  As we all process the numbers from the storm, I believe the important one today is zero--the amount of time we have to lose.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

222,topic-id,310,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which seeks to allocate $100 million to procure additional ships for our Coast Guard to interdict drugs headed to the United States by sea.  Last year was a record-breaking year for the U.Coast Guard in its fight against drug trafficking. It seized 416,000 pounds of cocaine worth almost $6 billion. This was the result of more than 250 individual interdictions in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and eastern Pacific  Even with this record-breaking year, however, all of the cocaine that was seized represents less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments; and, of course, cocaine interdictions, cocaine shipments, are on the rise.  I do commend the men and women of the U.Coast Guard for the great work they do to stop drug trafficking to our country, yet the Coast Guard lacks the resources to stop the known drug shipments into our mainland.                              {time}  0030  During a Homeland Security hearing this year, the U.Coast Guard commandant admiral, and I paraphrase him, said: Last year there were almost 600 events that we just did not have enough ships or enough planes to track or stop them in the seas. The admiral said: There were almost 600 shipments in the high seas. They knew these ships were carrying drugs, yet we did not have the ships or the assets to stop them.  Vice Admiral Charles Ray went further to say: We need more cutters on the water to help us do our job.  The Coast Guard, like many other government agencies, has endured tough budget situations over the years, and they need to replace and add new ships to fulfill their drug interdiction mission. This $100 million would allow the Coast Guard to procure two additional fast-response cutters.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I thank the senior Senator from Texas for his heartfelt remarks and leadership during this time of crisis, and I thank leaders across the State of Texas and across the country who are standing with the people of  Texas is hurting. This hurricane, Hurricane Harvey, is unlike anything[[Page S4977]]we have seen. I grew up in When you live on the gulf coast, you are used to hurricanes. It is part of life. I remember as a kid sheltering in the bathroom with my parents when Hurricane Alicia hit. We had a tree come down in the front yard. Harvey was different. Harvey was unlike anything we have ever seen before. Harvey is being described accurately as a 1,000-year storm, something that occurs every 1,000 years.  In Texas, we have never seen anything like it. Harvey started out as a category 4 storm, hitting South Texas, hitting Corpus Christi, Victoria, Rockport, Port Aransas, and Aransas Pass, all of which I visited in the past 2 weeks. Those communities were devastated by category 4 winds that destroyed homes, that destroyed schools, that destroyed county courthouses, city halls, and buildings and took down wires, took down power, took down water, and took down sewage.  As I visited each of those communities, you would drive down the street, and you would simply see home after home that had been obliterated by hurricane winds. I remember talking to the mother of a high schooler at Rockport High School who doesn't know where her son is going to go now because Rockport High School has been largely destroyed by the hurricane. She was saying how much the kids wanted to graduate from their high school, but their high school is badly damaged right now.  Harvey wasn't finished after making landfall and wreaking destruction. Harvey then turned north, north and east, and moved over the city of Houston and just sat there, sat there dumping rain, day after day after day.  I was home with my wife and kids. I live in For every day of those rains, it kept coming and coming. It is actually what made Harvey different. We are used to getting hit by a hurricane. Then it leaves, and you go and repair the damage and pick up the pieces. Harvey didn't have the good graces to leave. It sat there and dumped 27 trillion gallons of rain. Over 50 inches, which is typically as much as Houston receives in an entire year, fell in 4 days.  We saw flooding in parts of the city that had never flooded. I went in an airboat, just north of the Addicks Dam in northwest Houston, riding through a neighborhood with water up to the roofs of houses. It was an ordinary suburban neighborhood. You could see all the vestiges of families playing there. You could see children's toys floating in the water in the backyard. You could see holes in the roof, where either people in the attic had taken an ax and broken through to get out to escape the rising water or where first responders had broken in to get them out.  We took a boat down Clay Road, a fairly large road in northwest I know Clay Road well. I became a Christian at Clay Road Baptist Clay Road is completely underwater. It looks like you are in the middle of a lake. You look out and see nothing but water as far as the eye can see. I rode with a local constable right down the middle of Clay Road, going over cars, but the water was high enough--8, 10 feet high--you didn't even know when you were passing over cars that were submerged beneath you. As we were going down Clay Road, we saw an alligator swimming across Clay  The scope of this disaster defies words. It is not one community or two communities or three communities. It is over 250 miles, stretching from Corpus Christi all the way to In the Houston area alone, the flooding is massive--neighborhoods where there is a real possibility that every single home will have to be knocked down and rebuilt, every single government building will have to be knocked over and rebuilt.  On the airboat, I saw the county courthouse up to the roof in water. I saw a local LDS Church up to the roof in water. I saw a gas station with six or seven cars still parked outside. The water was right at the roof of the cars. It shows you just how fast that water rose. They were parked at the gas station. They had presumably stopped for some last-minute supplies, and the water rose so high they couldn't get out. They are still in their parking spots, but yet the water is at their roof.  That same gas station, up high on the door was a red neon sign that said ``Open'' that was still lit, flickering ``Open'' as you look out over the vast expanses of water.  The damage continued going east, hitting communities like Beaumont, like Port Arthur, like Nederland, like Orange, and into Louisiana--all of those communities I visited in the past 2 weeks and have massive devastation.  Texas is hurting mightily, and yet, as I said, my remarks today are not about pain and suffering, they are not about death and loss and despair; they are, instead, about hope--hope that begins with the heroes of We saw, over the last 2 weeks, incredible illustrations of bravery over and over again, every day, every hour, every minute. There were the first responders, the firefighters, the police officers, and EMS who risked their lives, including, tragically, Sergeant Perez of the Houston Police Department who lost his life in this storm. He went to go to work, and his wife pleaded with him: Please don't go to work. It is too dangerous out there.  He said: I have to go. It is my job to save lives.  He went. He couldn't go to his regular duty station. All the roads were flooded. There was no way to get there so he went to look for another duty station to report to, and tragically he got caught in high-rising water and drowned.  There were the coastguardsmen who flew in choppers and dove into wild water to save people's lives. I have spent a lot of time in the last 2 weeks visiting with the men and women of the Coast Guard--what incredible heroes--flying in the chopper with them, surveying the damage of the Houston Ship Channel, talking with Coast Guard swimmers. You want to talk about a tough bunch of heroes, the swimmers--almost every one of them ripped as the guys that know their way around a weight room--who in hurricane winds and hurricane waters will dive off of a chopper and swim to someone in distress. Many times the person in distress is so terrified, their first reaction is to grab the swimmer and practically try to pull the swimmer under too. These swimmers have to be strong, strong enough to help someone terrified and at the verge of death get in that basket, get in that basket of life, be pulled up to a chopper. In the last 2 weeks I visited with person after person who was pulled off of the roof of their home by the Coast Guard into a chopper.  The National Guardsmen, I have spent a lot of time thanking them over the last 2 weeks. We had 14,000 National Guardsmen called up in the State of Texas, but National Guardsmen from 41 States across the country came flooding in. That was part of the story of heroes.  There were a great many Houstonians, there were a great many Texans from all over Texas, but there were people from all over the country. When I drove through Refugio--a small town on the gulf coast that had been devastated by hurricane winds--I stopped at the fire department unannounced just to come in and thank the firefighters. Actually, I met a couple of firefighters. They were not the local ones. They had expelled the local firefighters to go home and get some sleep after several days of having no sleep at all. They were a couple of California firefighters who jumped in their truck and had driven east from California to get to  At the fire station in Rockport, there was a whole line of firetrucks, one after the other. You looked at each firetruck, on the door, and it was the name of a different city. Every one of them had the same story. They saw what was happening and said: I can help. They jumped in the firetruck and they headed to  The outpouring of love we have seen has been extraordinary. It wasn't just the first responders who were so extraordinary. We cannot overstate the gratitude Texas feels for those heroes of Harvey, but I will tell you the most powerful story of Harvey, I believe, are the thousands of ordinary men and women who stepped up to save their neighbors, who went and grabbed a boat or a jet ski or anything that could float and went into harm's way to pull people out of life-endangering situations--hundreds and hundreds of rednecks in bass boats. Texas at its very finest.[[Page S4978]]  Mr.President, as an Alaskan, I can promise you, you would have been right at home with the rednecks in bass boats. All these guys in duck waders, fearlessly walking into the charging waters, pulling people out, one after the other, after the other.  The Harris County Emergency Operation Center had an entire wall covered with Post-it Notes because when the local officials put out a call, if you have a flat-bottom boat, if you have a personal watercraft and can help, we need your help, hundreds and hundreds of calls began coming in. They put them all on Post-its with the name and cell phone. Then the emergency operation center operated essentially as a dispatch, where a 911 call would come in, somebody in distress, and they would pick up the phone and call someone's cell phone and say: Hey, your neighbor 6 blocks down needs your help. Can you be there?  There were hundreds upon hundreds risking their lives to save their neighbors. Texans helping We had, among others, Louisiana sending the Cajun Navy--over 100 boats. They would go in and save people and then they cooked jambalaya. That is neighborly love.  I met people who had come from Fort Worth, from Lubbock, from East Texas, from Oklahoma, from Illinois, from Alaska, from New I was at the George Brown Convention Center, the shelter that was set up. I met an individual there. He was a New York firefighter, a big guy. He told me he was serving the New York Fire Department on September 11. He told me, when 9/11 hit New York, when that terrorist attack hit, the love New York received from across the country, the outpouring of support New York received from across the country made a profound impact on him.  He said now, when there is a major natural disaster, he gets in his truck and heads down to help. He said: You know what. That is my way of saying thank you, my way of saying thank you for what the country did on September 11. He wanted to be in Harvey and pull people out of harm's way to say thank you.  All I could do is simply give him a hug. That heroism was happening every day and every hour. We all mourn the loss of life. There are tragic stories, heartbreaking stories, whether Sergeant Perez, whether it is the young mother in Beaumont who gave her life saving her little girl. Her little girl was pulled from her dead mother's chest, floating in the water, just minutes before being lost forever. As tragic as it is, that little girl will always know the love her mother had for her. There is the story the senior Senator from Texas just told of the van in Houston that took six to their death. Two elderly grandparents dealing with Alzheimer's disease and four children all lost their lives.  We mourn those tragedies, but I will tell you that we celebrate also. This disaster easily could have seen a death toll 10 times higher or 100 times higher. There were recorded over 51,000 people saved by search-and-rescue missions. Roughly 2,000 pets were saved by search-and-rescue missions. One of the things the first responders told me over and over was this: You had better be able to take the pets because there are a whole lot of people, as the water is rising, who, if you are not willing to take Fluffy or Fido, will stay in the rushing water. So we celebrate the bravery of all those who risked their lives to save others.  In any disaster, there are three phases. Phase 1 is the active crisis, where search and rescue is the only priority--saving lives. Let me say that in the city of Houston and the State of Texas, we saw a coordination across levels of government I have never seen before. The city officials, the county officials, the State officials, and the Federal officials were all working hand-in-hand seamlessly, not engaging in the bickering. There were no party lines. There were no There were no There was no Black, White, or There were Texans and Americans saving the lives of each other. You saw government working seamlessly together, not having the turf wars that in other contexts might so easily shut down getting anything done, by simply saying: How can I help? What can I do? What else do you need?  After the search and rescue is over, after the saving of lives, there is the next phase, and that phase is relief--providing relief to the people who have lost everything right then. We have roughly 260 shelters that have been stood up across the State of Texas by wonderful private organizations. The Red Cross has done a phenomenal job. The Salvation Army has done a phenomenal job. Churches have done an incredible job. Private nonprofits have done an incredible job.  There are individual citizens, such as ``Mattress Mack,'' who owns Gallery He is a friend of mine. He is a terrific Houston entrepreneur who opened up his furniture stores as shelters. He said: Come on in. Do you need a bed? We happen to have a furniture store full of beds. It was not only that. He sent out his delivery trucks to pick people up in harm's way.  At one of the shelters last week, I visited with an older woman who was on oxygen and uses a walker. She described how her house began filling with water, and she walked out of her house in waist-deep water pushing that walker.  My mom uses a walker. I know how difficult it is to get around when you are mobility impaired. I cannot imagine how difficult it was for her pushing through the waist-deep water, fleeing for her life. She was picked up by a Gallery Furniture delivery truck. She was picked up and taken to the shelter.  I called Mack and told him that story. I told him just one story of the lives he was saving. That is just one example of the heroes who stepped forward for their community.  Anheuser-Busch shut down beer production to deliver more than 155,000 cans of water. Now, you know we are in a time of miracles when Anheuser-Busch isn't producing beer, but that is a generosity of spirit.  One of the State officials who was helping lead the disaster relief called They had a warehouse just west of Houston, out in He said: How many boats do you have in the warehouse?  The fellow from Academy told him.  He said: Fine, we want them. We want them all.  He said: Great, come take them. They are yours.  DPS sent trucks. They loaded up the boats and sent the boats out to rescue people.  J.Watt, the great Texans football player who, I hope, a year from now will be wearing a Super Bowl ring, launched a charity effort raising over $10 million on Twitter, just saying: Let's help people who are hurting.  Shelters were stood up at the George Brown Convention Center and the NRG Center, both of which I have spent significant time at during the last 2 weeks.  I remember one morning at the George Brown Convention I was helping to serve breakfast. We were serving oatmeal. There was a fellow standing to my right, and I turned to him and said: Thank you for being here.  Something I try to do a lot of is just to thank people. I don't think you can thank people enough in the midst of a crisis for what they are doing.  Thank you for being here. Thank you for helping other folks.  He just began laughing. He said: Well, you know, I have to be here; my house is under water. He said: I am staying here; this is the only place I have to sleep. Yet he was up at the food line helping to serve others.  There were two gentlemen whom I met at that same shelter, and I asked them, as I tried to ask everyone: How are you doing? How is your home doing?  Two different gentlemen told me: Well, I don't have a home. I am homeless.  One said: I sleep under the bridge.  Both of them were volunteering. Both of them were sweeping the floor. So they weren't just taking shelter. Even in the midst of distress, they were helping out to keep the facility clean and to care for the needs of others.  Earlier this week, I was in Port Port Arthur is a relatively low-income community in Texas, heavily minority. It was hit very, very badly by the storm. There were devastating floods in Port I was at an African-American church helping to give out food and supplies to people who had lost everything, and I was visiting a[[Page S4979]]line of cars as people were driving up. You would say to each person: What do you need? They would need some water. They would need some food, some diapers, or maybe some dog food or cat food.  Several things were amazing. One, almost to a person, was what I have heard at least a hundred times in the last 2 weeks when you talk to someone who has lost their car or who has lost their house. You would say: I am so sorry. We are praying for you, and we are with you. Over and over, I heard people say: You know what; there are people a lot worse off than me. I may have lost my home, but at least I have my life. At least I have my kids.  It is powerful to hear over and over, when you try to comfort someone, and they say: Look at everyone else who needs it more than I do. But at the same time, when you would hand something to someone who came in--a young mom would come in who needed diapers--and you would hand her two packets of diapers, she would say: No, no, I will just take one. Somebody else needs that other one. Give that to someone else who needs that.  I heard that at relief centers in Port Arthur, in Beaumont, in Victoria, in Rockport, in I heard that same message over and over: There is someone else who needs it. At that church in Port Arthur, there was a couple there, both of whom had lost their home. They had lost everything, and they had been from dawn to dusk at the church, volunteering and helping others. They said, actually: Helping others is how we are getting through this.  Now, there are also moments of joy. I visited with two little boys who were in their home and the water rose to waist level, and they had to be rescued, I think, by boat. I think they were about 8 and 10 years old. I asked the boys: Boys, was that scary?  They laughed and said: Are you kidding? We got to swim in our living room.  Those moments of laughter and joy are important, even in the face of fear, death, and destruction. The unity we are seeing has been remarkable.  Then, the third and final phase will be rebuilding. Rebuilding is going to be a project that is going to take days, and, then, it is going to take weeks, and, then, it is going to take months, and it will ultimately take years. The scope of this devastation is massive. There are multiple estimates that this may prove the costliest natural disaster in U.history. Having seen firsthand the scope of the disaster and the thousands of homes and businesses destroyed, I can readily believe it.  I am here to say that Texas is coming back. We are going to rebuild.  In East Texas, I visited with the mayor of a small town whose entire town was destroyed. Every home, every building was under water. Her home was under water. The mayor was just in tears. The whole town was gone. She said: If we rebuild--and I was there with several firefighters, police officers, and a county judge. We all hugged her. We said: There is no ``if.'' We will rebuild. We will come together. We will stand as one, and we will rebuild.  We are seeing incredible generosity from Texans, and we are seeing leadership. I want to commend leadership at every level of government. I want to commend President Trump for his leadership during this crisis. I have spoken to the President multiple times throughout the course of this storm. From the very first call, right when the storm was about to make landfall, his message was consistent. He said: Ted, whatever Texas needs, it has. The answer is yes. When the Governor asked for a disaster declaration, the President signed it while the Governor was still on the phone.  The President convened a week ago a Cabinet meeting via teleconference and instructed every Cabinet member to lean in. Whatever the State needs, give it to them. Give it to them fast. Be there. Every resource we have, make it available.  I began to see Cabinet member after Cabinet member picking up the phone and calling.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services said: All right, on the health side, what more can we be doing? How can we be helping the people in hospitals who are being evacuated?  On the education side, the Secretary of Education said: How can we help the kids whose schools have been flooded?  There was the Secretary of Energy, former Governor of Texas Rick  The Secretary of HUD focused on the massive housing challenges.  Of course, the Director of FEMA has been down in Texas repeatedly. The Federal Government leaned in with all the resources with a swiftness that I have never seen.  At the State level, let me say that Governor Greg Abbott has done an extraordinary job. He is a close friend and mentor. He has led the State when we had crises playing out. When the city and county officials in Houston told me they didn't have enough emergency response vehicles, enough choppers, enough boats, enough high-water trucks, within hours the Governor and the Federal Government were able to flood the region with assets, with manpower, with the National Guard, with DPS troopers, and with coastguardsmen, so that those thousands and thousands of rescues could happen.  At the local level, all across Texas there are county judges. One county judge in East Texas, whom I visited with a few days ago, just buried his mother. His mother had died right before the storm, and the storm was such that she couldn't be buried in the midst of the storm. So she was in the funeral home until just a couple of days ago, and he was able to put her to rest. Yet he was out there leading the effort.  There are mayors and county judges. In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County Judge Ed Emmett--one a Democrat and one a Republican--are working seamlessly as one. That unity has been powerful.  In the next stage of rebuilding, we will have resources available. There are going to be very, very significant State resources. My office is working very closely with Governor Greg Abbott to mobilize the State resources and make them available and then at the Federal level.  I commend the leadership in Congress and the administration for responding swiftly with the relief mandated under statute. The relief efforts are being led by the Texas delegation in the House and by Senator Cornyn and myself here in the Senate, and we will see, I believe, strong bipartisan support for the Federal relief needed to help people come out of this.  But Texas will rebuild. We will come out stronger, and it will be through that same spirit, that same fearlessness, and that same compassion and love and unity that brought us through the crisis and saved thousands of lives. That same spirit will help us rebuild even stronger.  Let me finally say to all the men and women across the State of Texas, across the United States, and across the world who have been lifting us up in prayer, thank you. Thank you for your prayers.  I was at a church in Port Arthur visiting family after family, hugging women and men and children who had lost everything. A message of comfort I tried to give to each and every one of them was this: When you go to bed tonight, you are not alone. You are being lifted up in prayer by millions of people across Texas, across the country, and across the world. You are going through this journey surrounded by prayer warriors.  The day before yesterday, my family and I went to a home in Missouri A woman had lost everything in the flood. We joined a church group in helping her clean out her house and helping her tear down the sheetrock the floodwater had destroyed. My girls Caroline and Catherine took part in it. I would say that Caroline, my 9-year-old, we discovered, can wield a mean hammer when it comes to taking out sheetrock. The experience for my girls and my family and that group was just helping, neighbor helping neighbor.  As this woman grieved the loss of priceless memories, she also held on to special and wonderful memories. One thing we found was a note she had written to Santa Claus as a 9-year-old; that was saved. Another was a lock of hair from when she was 3 years old that was in an envelope and carefully preserved; that was safe.  What I shared with her is the same thing I shared with Texans suffering across the State: You are not alone. America stands as one.  Today, there are no Democrats, there are no On other days, there may be issues that divide us. We[[Page S4980]]will continue to debate tax policy and everything else, but today we are all Americans and we are all We are standing as one. That is the spirit that built our Nation, and it is the spirit that will rebuild Texas and Louisiana after this disaster.  Let me note that it is also the spirit that has us standing in unity with the people of Puerto Rico, the people of the Caribbean, and the people of Florida who are in harm's way as Irma bears down upon them. Our prayers are that the storm will turn into the Atlantic, dissipate, and turn away from people, but whatever happens, if there is to be yet another major storm hitting America, know that we will stand united in harm's way. We will stand as one, and united we can overcome anything.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Yet, many heroes stepped up to open up their homes, their churches, and their businesses to house those evacuees. Those efforts highlight the fact that this is not a natural disaster, but it is a national disaster, and it requires a response.  I quickly want to thank the first responders and others at the local, State, and Federal levels who bravely and selflessly provided assistance, including our friends to the south, Mexico, that are sending over trucks and trucks of assistance.

62,topic-id,1322,"Mr.President, I left Montana yesterday morning to come back to Washington, DC, to do the work of the American people but, as always, my heart remains in Big Sky That is especially true right now as fires burn across our In fact, just yesterday, of the top 30 wildfires in the Nation, 28 of those 30 wildfires were in  Our crisis in Montana isn't water. It is not too much water. It is not hurricanes. It is fire. It is smoke filling the air and filling our lungs. It is communities being evacuated, Montanans standing on the side of the road looking at the fires moving toward their homes. We have seen the loss of homes and many structures. Montanans are looking at the tons of fuel just lying on the forest floor waiting for a spark to ignite. In fact, in this year alone, over 1,600 fires have burned nearly 1 million acres in That is nearly the size of the entire State of  At my invitation, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke both came to Montana, just about 2 weeks ago--in fact, 2 weeks ago tomorrow--so they could see firsthand the impact wildfires are having on our great We went out and saw the Lolo Peak The impact is devastating.  We need to be sure Montana gets the resources it needs, first of all, to stop the fires. I am very grateful to the men and women who are risking their lives to fight these fires, going on virtually very little sleep, living in tents, fighting these fires. The firefighters battling on the ground are away from their families, and they are giving everything to protect our lives, our lands, and our property. Tragically, already in Montana, two firefighters have lost their lives--Trenton Johnson, age 19, and Brent Witham, age 29.  Preventing wildfires is impossible, but we can do much more to lessen the severity and impact of these fires. Seven million federally controlled acres in Montana are at high risk for wildfire. Five million acres--five million acres--have been designated for accelerated forest management due to insect infestation. We are talking about dead trees. Yet, since 1990, our State of Montana has lost over 40 percent of its forestry workforce and two-thirds of its mills. The remaining mills that we have are not running around the clock, multiple shifts, which they could do, except for the fact they can't get enough logs. We are literally bringing in logs from out of State and even out of the country to our mills in Montana to keep them going.  Let's talk about Mineral County, Mineral County was founded in 1914. This county in Western Montana is well known for its dense forests and abundant natural resources. The first sawmill came to this area around the turn of the 20th century. Multiple others followed suit. For decades, the timber industry thrived. Montanans worked hard, and they earned good money in the timber industry. In fact, the timber industry produced tax revenues to support their schools, teachers, infrastructure, and allow our counties to prosper, but in the early 1990s things changed. Across the State of Montana, environmental lawsuits became a barrier to timber contracts that were awarded to Montana's small businesses. A community that once thrived on the abundant resources surrounding them now sits with one of the highest unemployment rates in the  Today, Mineral County has just a single lumber mill. Folks living there today are watching the very resources that supported their grandparents burn. In fact, in Mineral County alone, over 25,000 acres have been torched this fire season, and the fires continue to burn. The weather outlook for September continues with above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation. This fire season is not over. We are going to be in it for quite some time.  The mismanagement of our Federal forests and radical environmentalists have prevented hard-working Montanans from having jobs, and this just adds more fuel, literally, to these wildfires. Our inability to act and treat these acres further deteriorates the health of our forests and the communities that desperately depend on them.  I can tell my colleagues--and I can speak on behalf of all of Montana--that we are tired of being told that others know better than we do when we watch our forests burn every summer, our mills close, our neighbors lose jobs, and our counties lay off road crews because they don't have the funds anymore to support basic infrastructure, and our communities suffer from the lack of management of our Federal lands.  A safe forest, a vibrant forest is a managed forest. A healthy forest is a managed forest, and timber jobs are good jobs. A properly managed forest is also good for wildlife habitat. We have teamed with the Rocky Mountain Elk Their headquarters are in Missoula, If you want to see more elk, if you want to see more wildlife, you need to manage the forests. It is good for wildlife habitat and good for water quality. A wildfire is devastating to the watershed because what happens is the wildfires come through, they wipe out the trees and grasses, and then when the spring rains come--when the snow melt comes from the spring--we see tremendous erosion and devastation of fish habitat and the loss of good sources of water for our communities.  Let's talk about the unspeakable amount of carbon emissions that are produced by these wildfires. I can tell my colleagues that we are done listening to radical environmentalists when they tell us otherwise. Too many forest management projects have been held up in frivolous litigation at the expense of the people of One such project--the Stonewall project--was halted because of the terrible Cottonwood decision, which is the 21st[[Page S4982]]century poster child for radical environmental activism. Two fires blazed on the very lands that were set to be managed had it not been for these radical environmentalists. This is wrong.  We need litigation relief. We need to reform the process that our land managers go through to get these projects done. The National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--was established to provide guidance for land managers to analyze all project alternatives and allow for public comment. This process has become so bogged down with additional steps and litigation that projects now at times take years to get through it. Others never even make it.  When it takes this long to analyze whether to even start a project, the forests continue to get more and more overstocked, more and more littered with fuels. A forest is a renewable resource, but if we do not manage the forests, they become unhealthy. They become prone to wildfire. Something needs to be done to streamline the process while allowing more collaboration between stakeholders. We can't wait any longer.  We need our colleagues to come to the table because we need comprehensive forest management reform. How many more thousands of acres in Montana and all over the West must burn before we act? Tying the hands of the State, tying the hands of the local communities, tying the hands of the people of Montana who best know how to manage these lands has not served us well. We need to change course.  I will work with anyone of any party and at all levels of our government to ensure that forests are managed in a way that reduces the severity of wildfires because Montanans deserve it, and because, quite frankly, it makes sense. Montanans are tired of seeing and breathing the smoke. The firefighters risking their lives out there deserve it as well.  Here is the bottom line. Either we are going to manage the forests or the forests are going to manage us. It is time to put the loggers of Montana back to work. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Our legislation ensures that safety is at the forefront by requiring manufacturers to submit safety assessment certifications before one self-driving vehicle hits the road. It also requires that manufacturers, for the very first time, submit a plan for how we will address both cybersecurity and data privacy. It is moving the needle forward on safety while providing a reactive and flexible framework for the regulation of self-driving cars.  Today we are one step closer to reshaping American innovation for generations to come. We cannot let this opportunity slip by us. It is essential to ensure the future of American innovation because this is fundamentally an issue of American competitiveness.  Automated vehicles are going to be developed, whether we want it or not, and it is a question about whether we are going to remain in the driver's seat and not secede it to China or India or Western  The SELF DRIVE Act steers us in the right direction on these important issues.

74,topic-id,4196,"Mr.President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse for his kind words.  I come to the floor to join in with a dozen or more of my colleagues who were here earlier to talk about the situation we now face. Senator Whitehouse is correct--this is an issue that is very personal to me. It is one that dates back to the year 2001, 16 years ago. It was a time when we received a call in my office in the city of Chicago, and the person on the other end was with a program called the Merit music program. She said: I have a problem with one of my students, and I need your help.  The Merit music program is a special opportunity for young people in Chicago's public schools, particularly from low-income families, to be trained on a musical instrument, free of charge, and some amazing things happen. Every student who is part of the Merit music program goes to college--every single one of them. They learn self-esteem, they learn a musical instrument, and it shows. Their lives are transformed.  She told us the story of one of these students. Her name is Tereza Tereza Lee was born in Korea and brought to the United States by her mom and dad when she was 2 years old. They came through Brazil before they came to Chicago, but they settled in Her mom and dad raised her and her brother and sister. They were not well-off at all. In fact, they were poor.  Mom worked in a dry cleaner establishment, which is fairly common in Chicago; Korean Americans probably work there more than any other group. Her father was an aspiring preacher who wanted to open a church for the Korean population, but it never seemed to materialize. Mom worked extra hard, and the kids went to public schools.  At age 12, Tereza Lee heard about the Merit music program, signed up for it, went in, and fell in love with playing the piano. She turned out to be a prodigy. She was extraordinary.  By the time she was ready to graduate from high school, they said: You have to apply to a music school.  Well, she wasn't sure. Nobody she knew had gone to college. But she started to fill out the application and ran into the question about her Social Security number. She turned to her mother and said: What am I supposed to do about this?  Her mother said: I don't know. After we brought you to the United States at the age of 2, we didn't file any papers.  What could they do? They reached out to the Merit music program, and the Merit music program said: Let's call Durbin's office.  They called my office and contacted my caseworker, whose name is Clarisol She is now my chief of staff, but back then she was a caseworker. She looked up the law. She called the INS, and they said: The law is very clear. Tereza Lee from Korea is undocumented. She is in the United Although she is now 17 or 18 years old, she never filed the appropriate papers, and under the laws of the United States of America, the recourse is for her to return to the last country she was in--Brazil--to wait 10 years, and apply to come back to the United States--10 years.  I thought to myself, and so did my caseworker: Why would you do this to this young girl? She did nothing wrong. In fact, she is a pretty amazing story of success from a poor family.  I sat down and said: Let's write a law to deal with it, and we wrote the DREAM My original cosponsor of the DREAM Act was Orrin Hatch of This goes back, as I said, 16 years ago, so when I stand here today and talk about this issue, it is an issue I have come to know in a lot of different ways. Most importantly, I have come to know the young people whose lives have been affected by our laws as they currently exist.  Over the years, an interesting thing has happened. After I wrote the DREAM Act and would go around Chicago and tell the story of this new bill that I had just introduced, there would be a lot of young people, mainly Hispanic youngsters, who would listen to me and not react very much at all. Then, many times, I would go out to my car to go back home at the end of the night, and in the darkness, standing by my car, would be one or two young people. They would look in both directions to make sure no one could hear them, and they would whisper to me: Senator, I am a  These were undocumented children--teenagers, adolescents--who had been taught early in life to be extremely careful: Never, ever admit that you are undocumented; never, ever get involved with the law because you could be deported tomorrow morning, and your family might be deported with you. So they grew up in fear--fear of what might happen with a knock on the door.  So now comes this politician, this Senator, who says: I am going to change the law. I am going to make it right for you.  Well, many of their parents were skeptical. They didn't believe it. Politicians say a lot of things. But these young people did something very interesting. Their approach to this evolved from standing in the darkness and whispering ``I am a Dreamer,'' listening to their parents tell them ``Don't say out loud that you are undocumented''; they, of course, did exactly what their parents didn't want them to do. They started standing up and saying publicly: I am a I want to tell you who I am and my story.  They wore T-shirts and buttons, and they rallied, and there was no question that they were going to come and tell their stories. As they told their stories to me, I decided the best thing I could do was to tell their stories on the floor of the U.So I started telling them. With their permission and a color photograph, I would tell the stories of these young people. Each one of them, standing at this desk and other places in the Chamber, usually captured the attention of the people who would gather because each one of these stories was so compelling. They were compelling stories because here were young people who had all the odds against them.  I remember when I was a teenager, in my insecurity, wondering what I would ever do and afraid of doing the wrong thing. Then I think of these young people, who have the decks stacked against them. They have been told they are not legal in this country, and there are people who would like to see them gone tomorrow. Yet these young people started emerging and telling the stories, and I started repeating them. Then some amazing stories started emerging about what they were doing with their lives.  You see, if you are undocumented in this country, you don't qualify for a lot of things most Americans take for granted--Pell grants to go to college. Students from low-income families receive up to $5,000 or more a year to go to college. Undocumented students, Dreamers, receive nothing--nothing--from the Federal  The same thing is true about student loans. For the most part, unless there is a State program, these undocumented students can't qualify for any government student loans. They have to find some other way. They usually have to work their way through college--or whatever their aspirations might be.  Over the years, this bill was heard before committees and was voted on from time to time in the House and in the Unfortunately, we never could quite find that moment when the bill could pass the Senate and the House in the same year and the same session. It never came together. There was a time when we passed it with a majority vote in the Senate, but under our rules we needed 60 votes. So we fell just short of being able to move the bill forward.  Along the way, I had a colleague in the U.Senate named Barack Obama, my junior He was a cosponsor of my DREAM Of course, he went on to bigger and better things and became the President of the United I am very proud of him for his achievement. But I didn't waste any time after he was elected President calling him and saying: Help me. We have to do something to help these young people.  I wrote him a letter, cosigned by Republican Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, asking him to think of a way he might be able to protect the Dreamers from being deported until we passed the law. I didn't get a response.[[Page S4996]]  A year passed--a year. I sent a second letter, this time with 23 Senators signing it, urging President Obama to do something, and he did. He created the DACA program.  The DACA Program was basically an opportunity for young people to come forward, to register with the government, pay a filing fee, submit to a criminal background check, and then see if they qualified for a 2-year protection from deportation and a 2-year opportunity to legally work in the United  Well, I was just reminded: August 15, 2012, was the first day to sign up. I joined with my friend and colleague, Congressman Luis Gutierrez, of We decided we would create a sign-up, an opportunity at Navy Pier, a historic place in the city, and invite young people who qualified for DACA--Dreamers--to come in and sign up. We got volunteer immigration lawyers who wouldn't charge these young people anything, and we sent out the notices to every group we could think of: Come on in if you are eligible to sign up for  Congressman Gutierrez and I didn't know how many would show up. We were afraid it might be 200 or 300 people, and we didn't know if we could handle any more than that with the volunteer attorneys we had.  Then something happened. It was amazing. At midnight, the night before, they started queueing up outside of Navy Pier, families--mom, dad, and that young son or daughter who qualified for DACA--and they waited in the dark all night for the chance to sign up. When it was over, it wasn't hundreds, but thousands--thousands--who came to Navy We couldn't handle them. We had to set up workshops all over the city afterward to give them their chance to sign up.  It was a big risk for them. This was the first time in their lives they were going to trust the Government of the United States with information that they had carefully kept personal, confidential, and secret. They were going to trust this government by signing up for a program because the President of the United States had said: It will protect you. They had the $500 or $600 they needed for the filing fee. They were prepared for all the background checks. At the end of the day, after 5 or 6 years of DACA, 780,000 young people have signed up for this protection.  What has happened to these young people is nothing short of amazing. I could go on for a long time about the success stories of the DACA recipients once they got that protection, once they could work.  I love to tell the story about Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of That school decided they were going to open up competition for their medical school to DACA-protected young people--not a special spot for them or a set-aside of quotas or numbers. No, they had to compete with everyone else. But that medical school said: These young people now deserve a chance.  As a result of that decision, there are 28 medical students at Loyola Stritch School of Medicine in Chicago, and they are there because there was no place else that would accept them. This college of medicine said: If you are DACA protected, we will let you compete to come to our school.  The word spread around the country like lightning. Some of the best and brightest young people finally got their chance, and they were accepted to this medical school. They are impressive.  Remember what I said: They don't qualify for government loans. Medical school is expensive. My State, under Governor Patrick Quinn and now continued under Governor Bruce Rauner, a Democrat and Republican, set up a loan for them--but with a catch. Our State loans them enough money to go to medical school at Loyola, as long as they promise to give 1 year of medical practice for each year that we loan the money--1 year of medical practice in the inner cities in Chicago, in Waukegan, in East Louis, or in rural areas where they can't find doctors, and they anxiously do so. They anxiously do so because this is their chance. I tell that story because it is one that is particularly poignant.  When President Trump and Attorney General Sessions yesterday decided to put an end to DACA, they put into question whether these young people will ever finish medical school. You can't go to medical school and be an intern and work if you cannot legally work in the United They can legally work because of When DACA disappears, their right to legally work disappears. Their ability to be interns and work in the medical school disappears as well.  What is going to happen to them? Is that the end of their medical education? Loyola stuck its neck out and gave them a chance. Filling those slots will be impossible. Second- and third-year students--you just can't fill those slots. It will be a real loss--a loss of great talent and great opportunity.  When President Trump made this announcement with Attorney General Sessions yesterday, I was really troubled. I have had only one face-to-face conversation with the It was his Inauguration It is no surprise that I didn't support him, but I went up and shook hands with him, congratulated him on being elected President, and I said: I want to thank you for the kind things you have said about  He looked me in the eye and he said: Don't worry about those We are going to take care of the  I listened then and so many times afterward when he publicly said something very similar. He said at one point: We love the We are going to take care of those kids--over and over and over again. And I was convinced--I want to be convinced--it was a genuine sentiment in his heart that he was expressing.  He has said some harsh things when it comes to immigration. I think they are fundamentally unfair things--calling Mexican immigrants murderers, rapists; travel bans against people of the Muslim religion. Those things are, in my mind, inconsistent with the values of this country. But he said them, and many people found them appealing.  Yet he always had a special comment when it came to Dreamers and DACA, and I thought maybe--just maybe--he is going to give them a break.  He did until yesterday. His announcement that he is going to put an end to DACA in 6 months--that is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of innocent people. The good thing that has happened--if there is any good to come of this--is that all across America now, there is a sensitivity, an understanding, an appreciation of who these young people are. It is almost amazing to me that many folks can miss the whole debate for a decade or more, but when you start talking about removing this protection under law, people wake up, stand up, and speak up.  In my city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, John Rowe is an executive. He is of the opposite political faith. I know it. I like him. He likes me. He is retired now and a very generous man--he and his wife--and helps a lot of young people. In Chicago, he has been the leader in gathering over 120 Chicago business leaders who support DACA and the DREAM They are gathering thousands like them around the United States, business leaders. If you saw the news accounts this morning, leaders of Google and Facebook and others are coming out against President Trump's decision to end  They are not alone. In addition to that, there is an extraordinary outpouring of support for DACA and Dreamers from the faith community across the United I am proud that the Roman Catholic cardinal in Chicago, Blase Cupich, has been outspoken in supporting immigration and supporting the Dreamers and those protected by It is not the only religion where the leaders have said that. In faiths--Jewish, Protestant, Catholic, Muslim religions--you find the support coming forward. It is an indication to me of the growing support across  When 76 percent of the American people agree on anything, we ought to stand up and take notice. And 76 percent of the American people believe we ought to treat these DACA-protected people and Dreamers fairly, justly. That is what we should do.  Yesterday on the floor, I talked about Jesus Jesus Contreras was brought to the United States at the age of 6, and his family settled in Houston, He went to Lone Star College down there. Again, he is undocumented, a He finished a course in paramedics. He became a licensed, certified paramedic because of He happened to be there, of[[Page S4997]]course, when Hurricane Harvey hit, and he worked night and day saving lives, trying to help the victims of the hurricane.  There were thousands just like him, but the important part of this story is that this young man is one of those undocumented folks who really care about the people of Houston, the people of Texas, and He calls this home, and he wrote me a letter and told me that. I read it on the floor yesterday.  There are others. I want to tell you about one today. I am going to try to pronounce her name correctly. Ximena I probably missed that, but I am close. At 9 years of age, she came to the United States from Mexico She was raised in Houston and lives there today.  In high school, Ximena served in the U.Army Junior Reserve Officer Training It is better known as Junior She was the battalion commander of her high school Junior ROTC Under her leadership, Ximena's battalion was named the best in the Houston Independent School  Ximena was the captain of her high school soccer team and a regular volunteer at the Houston Food Currently, she is majoring in communications at the University of She interned with U.Representative Sheila Jackson Lee and Houston City Council Member Robert  Due to Ximena's community service, she was asked by the mayor of Houston to serve as the youngest member of the Mayor's Hispanic Advisory She is the first DACA recipient to serve on that board.  Last week, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, Ximena stepped in to help her community, just as she has always done. She volunteered at shelters, helping people with FEMA and Red Cross applications. She was joined by many other DACA recipients.  She wrote me a letter. She asked for only one thing--for President Trump to come and visit Houston and meet the DACA volunteers, to meet those heroes, to look in their eyes, to hear their stories before he made his decision about whether they had a future in the United  Ximena and so many others have so much to give to this country. Without DACA, she faces deportation. This President, who said ``We love the Dreamers,'' with his decision yesterday, has said that we are going to deport the Ending the protection of DACA will mean they will be subject to deportation any minute of any day. They would send her back to Mexico, where she hasn't lived since she was 9. If that happened, would America be a stronger country or a better country? The answer is clear.  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Lindsey Graham, who is my cosponsor and a great ally and friend in this, a Republican from South Carolina, said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.'' That moment is here. Republican leaders in Congress have to make a decision about Ximena and thousands just like her. Are we going to be a fair and just society? Are we going to give these young people a chance for a future? Are we going to tell them ``No thanks. You are not welcome. Leave''? One of the President's appointees to the voter fraud commission, the secretary of state of the State of Kansas, said that this morning. He said that after the President's decision when it comes to eliminating DACA, it is time for them to leave this country. I think he is wrong.  These people, just like this young lady, deserve a chance to be part of our future. How many times has she stood before that great American flag and pledged allegiance, sang the national anthem--the only one she really knows--and believed this was her country, her flag, her future? And now we are going to tell her ``No thanks, As good as you are, as much as you have done, America doesn't need you''? I don't think so.  As for this Senator, I am going to do everything in my power to protect those Dreamers and give them a chance to not only live legally in America but to become full-fledged citizens of this country.  To all of the Dreamers who are listening to this debate, don't despair. You had the courage to come out of the shadows and to stop whispering and to stand up and tell the world who you are. Because you did that, we are in a stronger position today to help you realize your dream, to become part of the future of  I am joined this evening by a number of visitors in my office.

I thought it was a pretty big deal when I transferred from Saint Louis University to come here to Georgetown as a sophomore so many years ago. It was kind of a bold thing. I had never been to I never visited the campus, and I came to the university. What I did was nothing compared to what they have done. They have fought against much greater odds. They have shown more determination and maturity than I ever had at their age. All they are asking for is a chance to graduate from that great university and become part of this great  Here is what we need to do. We need to make sure that we don't leave this Senate, this House of Representatives this month or in the next few weeks without passing the Dream All I am asking for--all any of us are asking for--bring it to the floor. Bring it to the floor for a vote. I have confidence that we can find 60 votes in the Senate to pass it. I think at this moment in history we can.  I open my office door and my heart to those of good faith who want to join us in this effort from the Republican side. From the bottom of my heart, I thank Senator Graham, Senator Flake, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Gardner--four Republican Senators who have made this, thank goodness, a bipartisan effort in the We need to do the same thing in the House of We need to say once and for all: Your dream of becoming part of the future of America is going to be a reality because we are going to step up today, some day soon, and make it a reality.

I believe that we are, that we will be, and that this bill boosts the effort.  Throughout committee consideration of this bill, I stressed the need for bipartisanship on this issue so that the American people would have confidence in the steps that we were taking. And so it is. It is, I think, in the spirit of the original Federal automotive safety standards that passed Congress nearly unanimously in 1966.  This bill was improved significantly in the committee, and the final bill, very importantly, preserves the role that States have played to regulate matters such as vehicle registration, licensing, insurance, and liability, while, at the Federal level, ensuring that manufacturers submit safety certifications to NHTSA, placing the agency on the path toward issuing full safety standards for autonomous vehicles.  The bill also includes my language to require a study of the environmental impacts of autonomous vehicles, as well as the intersection between autonomous and electric vehicles.

Often, the TV news goes around taking their cameras seeking the worst damage to create the most dramatic story.  In the case of Hurricane Harvey in the district I represent, you could drop a camera almost anywhere in towns like Rockport, Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Refugio, Tivoli, Port Lavaca, and Victoria, and have that dramatic heart-wrenching shot of devastation.  My friends' and neighbors' homes were completely flattened by hurricane winds. Businesses were destroyed and much of towns were under water, like in Wharton, following the unprecedented flooding left behind by this storm. It is the worst we have seen in decades.  Many people, including the town mayor of Port Aransas, suffered and lost everything.

125,topic-id,1650,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the need to protect undocumented young people, commonly referred to as Dreamers, from deportation.  The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or what is called DACA, was announced by President Obama in 2012 to solve an urgent need. Hundreds of thousands of young people brought to this country as children were at risk of being deported. They didn't take the action to come; their parents took the action to come and bring them. President Obama's Executive order temporarily protected these undocumented young people from deportation. DACA also provides the opportunity to obtain work permits and has made it possible for many young DACA beneficiaries to enroll in college.  If Congress doesn't act now and pass a law, President Trump's decision to terminate this program will have devastating consequences for nearly 800,000 families across the United States, particularly those in This decision to end DACA without first ensuring that young people have legal protection is why we are demanding a vote on the Dream Act as soon as possible. DACA recipients deserve certainty now, not 6 months from now. These young people trusted our government, and it is time we stopped playing with their lives.  The Dream Act, introduced by Senators Graham and Durbin, has been considered many times already by this It was most recently included in the comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 with 68 votes. I remember it well. I remember weeks in committee. I remember dozens of amendments. I remember the time on the floor, the hope that we would be able to pass comprehensive immigration reform. It had an agricultural workers program in it. It had this program for undocumented children. It had It had a whole panoply of reforms in it, and it went down. It got 68 votes here, although it didn't survive in the  I believe there is broad bipartisan support for the Dream I just learned, for example, that polls are saying that 70 percent of the people in this country are in favor of it. And I would be confident that it would pass if given an up-or-down vote. So I call on leadership to ensure there is a clean vote on the Dream Act this month.  As I mentioned, 800,000 young people have been admitted to the DACA Program, allowing them to come out of the shadows. They were educated here. They work here. They pay taxes. They are integrated into American society. These young people are fiercely patriotic. In every way that truly matters, they are  Listen to this: 95 percent of DACA recipients are working or in school. That is 95 percent of 800,000. The typical DACA recipient came to this country at 6 years old. They have known no home other than this one. Many of them only speak  Seventy-two percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies--companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, J.Morgan--employ DACA recipients. DACA recipients are contributing significantly to our economy. It is estimated that ending the program would mean a $460.3 billion hit to the GDP over the next decade.  But protecting DACA recipients isn't a matter of politics or economics; it is really about what is right as Americans and human beings. This is particularly important for me, representing California, because 1 in 4 Dreamers--223,000--live, work, and study in California, and I can testify that they are an essential part of the fabric of our communities. So it is important for Senators and the American public to know the very real human side to this issue.  I want to share the story of a remarkable young woman whom I met and whose family I met. Her name is Vianney She was brought to this country when she was just 1. Today she lives in East I met her and her family last month, and I last spoke to her on Monday night. Vianney is a 23-year-old graduate student from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in psychology. She is pursuing a career in public service so she can give back to this country.  Vianney's mother, Maria, whom I also met, worked as an oncology nurse at Highland Hospital, and her father, Eusebio, worked as a truckdriver. They had no criminal record. They owned their own home, which I visited, a small home in East They paid their taxes. And they were in this country for 23 years. I saw them the week before the mother and father were deported last month, sobbing in their living room. My office has worked on their case for years, and their deportation was truly heartbreaking. I will never forget having to call Maria and tell her that I had spoken to the Acting[[Page S4985]]Secretary of Homeland Security, begging her not to deport this family, and that she would be deported and separated from her children the next day. It was one of the most painful calls I have ever had to make.  These heartbreaking photos of the Sanchez family were taken by the San Francisco Chronicle and Bay Area News Group before Maria and Eusebio were forced to leave. This is Maria--20 years a nurse at Highland This is Vianney, and this is the second oldest child. The oldest child is DACA, and it has now fallen to her to support her two sisters, maintain the house, work, and hopefully start her career. Her mother, her father, and her American citizen youngest brother are in I think these heartbreaking photos tell a story. Vianney now is facing the uncertainty that she, too, could lose protection and be deported. Then what would happen to her sisters?  Every day we fail to act means one more day that Vianney, Melin, and Elizabeth are forced to live with this enormous cloud hanging over their heads. And, you know, Senator, the fear is palpable. You talk to these young people on the telephone, and you can sense what is happening. First of all, they know the government knows everything about them. The government knows where they live, what they do. They have to report regularly. This is kind of a conditional program, and so they are up front and out front. And you would think this would give them a sense of security, but it actually gives them a sense of insecurity because they don't know what the future will bring.  I would like to share the story of another talented and ambitious Californian who has taken full advantage of the opportunity she has been given. This is Denisse She arrived in the United States when she was just 10 months old, brought here from Like many of our immigrant ancestors, her parents wanted to make a better life for their children. This is a very recent photo of her; you can see she is beautiful.  Denisse's family is similar to other families in After arriving in Fremont, her father worked full time in a restaurant while pursuing his high school diploma at night. Her mother attended community college part time for 7 years to earn her nursing degree. After years of trying to gain legal status, her parents were forced to move to That left  Denisse excelled in high school, graduating with a 4.3 She attended UC Berkeley, which is one of the top public universities in the Nation, to study biology and sociology. She dreamt of going to medical school, driven in part by a family member's earlier death from cancer. The cancer was diagnosed at a late stage because the family's immigration status made it impossible to afford health insurance. Denisse worked as a waitress and commuted an hour each way to classes because she couldn't afford to live on campus. After graduation, she volunteered at San Francisco General  This is Denisse today. She is in New York at Mount Sinai Medical School, one of the country's top programs. She is on track to earn her degree in 2019. You can see her in the middle of this photo in her medical scrubs and how proud she is.  To help other students navigate the admissions process and pursue careers in health and medicine, Denisse cofounded a national nonprofit organization called Pre-Health Through Pre-Health Dreamers, Denisse has helped many other students as they work toward their goals.  After graduation, she intends to specialize in emergency medicine and work in low-income communities to provide healthcare to families like her own who too often go without needed treatment.  Parts of California, particularly our rural counties, are very short on doctors. This is a big problem. In the healthcare reform, they are lucky if they have the choice of one insurance. So we desperately need people like Denisse who want to work in communities most in need of skilled health professionals.  Without DACA or passage of the Dream Act, Denisse won't be able to come home. She won't be able to stay. All of the education that has gotten her here--a top-notch university and a top-notch hospital, I assume as an intern or a resident at this time--she wouldn't have the proper work authorization or accompanying documents, and our country would be denied a highly qualified, motivated doctor.  In closing, I really believe we have a moral obligation to do all we can to shield these young people from deportation. Remember, they did not break the law. They were brought here as children, many as babies. Some don't know the language of the land from whence they came. They all speak English very well. They want the American dream. They are motivated, and they are patriotic. I was listening to a young person the other day, and all she wanted to do was be in the military. She is ROTC and wants to be in the military. You know, these are the people who make this country great, and we can't forsake them.

157,topic-id,227,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to once again emphasize the urgent imperative of growing our Navy to 355 ships. This body is now on record in support of a 355-ship Navy, and the recent tragedies at sea only serve to reinforce the inadequate capacity of our current fleet.  While the size of our Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships at the end of the Cold War to less than 280 ships today, the demand for deployed ships has remained relatively constant between 85 and 100.  This steady demand on the fleet, coupled with tight budgets and habitually underfunded maintenance counts, has taken a serious toll on our sailors.  Growing the fleet is no easy task. It will take constant leadership and attention. In his confirmation hearing, Secretary Spencer rightly spoke about creative levers the Navy could pull to get to 355, including bringing ships out of the ready reserve, yet we need more urgency, we need that sense of urgency that Secretary Spencer talked about in his mission, vision, and priorities document. This must extend to growing the fleet as quickly as is practical. Every day, month, and budget year that goes by without significant progress towards 355 makes this urgent requirement that much less likely to materialize.  Mr.Speaker, there is not a moment to lose. We must make growing the fleet our number one priority.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgH6659-2.txt,99999999999999,SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,6.0,September

In 1863, Joel and Patsy Estes traveled from Kentucky, in search of fertile land to begin their cattle ranch in Colorado, and they found it in the area that later bore their name. By 1874, many more settlers had traveled out West and made Estes Park their home.  The original Coloradans living in Estes Park were resourceful and ingenious, building schools and homes from the ground up in this rugged, mountainous terrain. The present Coloradans living in Estes Park are also resilient--surviving floods and severe damages to the town and surrounding area in 1982 and again in 2013. Following the devastation of the flooding in 2013, U.Highway 34, one of the main roads into Estes, was in need of extreme restoration. Through bipartisan efforts in both the U.House of Representatives and the Senate, the Colorado delegation was able to ensure this highway received the funding it required to keep the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park open.  I would like to congratulate the Town of Estes Park on this exciting milestone, and I look forward to the town's many more years of prosperity and success.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgS5001-4.txt,99999999999999,HONORING THE SERVICE TO UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES PROVIDED BY MILITARY,2017.0,6.0,September

279,topic-id,1466,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about North Korea, the most urgent national security challenge for the United States and our allies in East  Secretary Mattis has said that North Korea is the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security. Admiral Gortney, previously the commander of the U.Northern Command, stated that the Korean Peninsula is at its most unstable point since 1953, when the armistice was signed. North Korea just conducted its sixth nuclear test, its most powerful to date. An early analysis from experts says:       North Korea has comfortably demonstrated an explosive yield      in the range of at least 100 kilotons with this test.       That would be a considerable improvement from the 30      kiloton yield estimated in its fifth test and ideal for      targeting U.cities--a primary objective in North Korea's      pursuit of an  Unless drastic and credible measures are taken today, we are fast heading for a nuclear showdown that could cost millions of lives on the Korean  Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. This year, Pyongyang launched 21 missiles during 14 tests, including the 2 tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are reportedly capable of reaching the U.homeland. During 6 years of rule as the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un has launched more missiles than his father and grandfather combined. Patience is not an option with the U.homeland now in the nuclear shadow of Kim Jong  Our North Korea policy of decades of bipartisan failure must turn to one of immediate bipartisan success, with pressure and global cooperation resulting in the peaceful denuclearization of the regime.  Vice President Pence stated during his visit to South Korea in April:       Since 1992, the United States and our allies have stood      together for a denuclearized Korean We hope to      achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all      options are on the table.  I believe U.policy toward North Korea should be straightforward. The United States will deploy every economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies. But time is not on our side. The international community needs to finally and fully join together to completely isolate this dangerous regime.  As a first step, North Korea should immediately be kicked out of the United Nations and many multilateral institutions from which they derive the benefits of global recognition. Next, the United Nations Security Council should enact a new resolution that imposes a full economic embargo on North Korea that bans all of Pyongyang's economic activities, including petroleum resources.  These economic tools need to be combined with robust military deterrent, including a U.S.-led international naval blockade of North Korea, in order to ensure a full enforcement of United Nations actions. We must also continue frequent show-of-force exercises by the United States and our partners in Seoul and Tokyo, enhanced missile defense activities, and assurances of extended U.nuclear deterrence to our allies. Kim Jong Un must know that any serious provocation will be met with a full range of U.military capabilities.  The road to peacefully stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through I am continuing to call on the administration to block all entities that do business with North Korea, no matter where they are based, from conducting any financial activities through the U.financial system. China is the only country that holds the diplomatic and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North Korean regime. China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade and virtually all of North Korea's exports. Despite China's rhetoric of concern, from 2000 to 2015 trade volume between the two nations climbed more than tenfold, rising from $488 million in 2000 to $5.4 billion in 2015--hardly the sign of cracking down on the rogue regime.  Beijing is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relatively few consequences. China must move beyond an articulation of concern and lay out a transparent path of focused pressure to denuclearize North A global power that borders this regime cannot simply throw up its hands and absolve itself of responsibility. The administration is right to pursue a policy of ``maximum pressure'' toward North Korea, and we have a robust toolbox already available to ramp up the sanctions track--a track that has hardly been utilized to its full extent.  Last Congress I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement[[Page S4973]]Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. This legislation was the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to impose mandatory sanctions on the proliferation activities, human rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior. The following is according to a recent analysis from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies:       North Korea sanctions have more than doubled since the      NKSPEA [North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act]      came into effect on February 18, 2016. Prior to that date,      North Korea ranked eighth, behind Ukraine/Russia, Iran, Iraq,      the Balkans, Syria, Sudan, and  Even with the 130-percent sanctions increase after the sanctions bill passed last Congress, North Korea is today still only the fifth most sanctioned country by the United  So while Congress has clearly moved away from the Obama administration's inaction to at least some action, the Trump administration has the opportunity to use these authorities to build maximum leverage with not only Pyongyang but also with I am encouraged by the actions the administration took in June to finally designate a Chinese financial institution. But this should just be the beginning.  The administration, with Congressional support, should now make clear to any entity doing business with North Korea that they will not be able to do business with the United States or have access to the U.financial system.  A report released in June by an independent organization known as C4ADS identified over 5,000 Chinese companies that are doing business with North Korea today. These Chinese companies are responsible for $7 billion in trade with North Moreover, the C4ADS report found that only 10 of these companies--10 of these 5,000 companies--controlled 30 percent of Chinese exports to North Korea in 2016. One of these 10 companies controlled nearly 10 percent of total imports from North Some of these companies were even found to have satellite offices in the United  Enough is enough.  According to recent disclosures, from 2009 to 2017, North Korea used Chinese banks to process at least $2.2 billion in transactions through the U.financial system. This should stop now. The United States should not be afraid of diplomatic confrontation with Beijing for simply enforcing existing U.law. In fact, it should be more afraid of Congress if it does not.  As for any prospect of engagement, we should continue to let Beijing know in no uncertain terms that the United States will not negotiate with Pyongyang at the expense of U.national security or that of our allies.  Instead of working with the United States and the international community to disarm the madman in Pyongyang, Beijing has called on the United States and South Korea to halt our military exercises in exchange for vague promises of North Korea suspending its missile and nuclear activities. That was a bad deal, and the Trump administration was right to reject it.  Moreover, before any talks in any format, the United States and our partners must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization commitments it had already agreed to in the past and subsequently chose to brazenly violate.  President Trump should continue to impress with President Xi that a denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nations' fundamental long-term interests. As ADM Harry Harris, commander of U.Pacific Command, rightly noted recently: ``We want to bring Kim Jong Un to his senses, not to his knees.''  To achieve this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants to work with the United States as a responsible global leader to stop Pyongyang or bear the consequences of keeping Kim Jong Un in power.  In July, I introduced, with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, legislation called the North Korean Enablers Accountability Act, 1562. This legislation takes the first steps toward imposing an economic embargo on North Korea, including a ban on any entity that does business with North Korea or its enablers from using the U.financial system and imposing U.sanctions on all those participating in North Korean labor trafficking abuses. Our legislation specifically singles out the 10 largest Chinese importers of North Korean goods that we talked about earlier and sends a very clear message: You can either do business with this outlaw regime or the world's largest economy.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to finally put real pressure--maximum pressure--on this regime and its enablers wherever they are based.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

347,topic-id,548,"Mr.Speaker, how did we get here? In December of 2010, the House passed the DREAM Act right here on this floor. Almost all of the Democrats voted for it, and a handful of Republicans, too. The goal was to legalize immigrants who had grown up in the U.S., achieved education, and had no way of getting legalization status unless Congress took action.  Way back in 2001, I had introduced the first bill to legalize immigrant youth. So it took almost 10 years until it passed in the House in 2010. And later that same week, there was a vote in the Fifty-five out of 100 Senators voted for cloture on the DREAM Act to legalize the status of undocumented immigrant youth.  We know you need 60 votes in the Senate to move something forward, so the DREAM Act was blocked, even though it had a majority of the votes of the Senators because of a filibuster led by                              {time}  1515  Not just any Republican led the filibuster, but the leader of the opposition to the DREAM Act was none other than the Attorney General of the United States, Jeff So yesterday the President, unwilling to go out to the cameras and announce he was killing the DACA program himself, sent Jeff Sessions out to tell 800,000 immigrants: We don't want you here anymore.  Included in that announcement was a halfhearted sales pitch for Congress to pass legislation. But remember, when Sessions had a chance to do exactly that, he led the fight to stop it. That is hypocrisy on steroids. So President Obama finally took the only action he could take 2 years later and crafted a narrowly defined program call DACA that has never been successfully challenged in court.

126,topic-id,1321,"Mr.President, it would have taken moral courage--something he doesn't have--for President Trump to stand in front of the American people to say why he was going back on his word to ``deal with DACA with heart'' and help these ``absolutely incredible kids'' in a way that is going to ``make people happy and proud.''  Instead, he sent out his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, long a foe of immigration reform, to break the bad news to 800,000 young people and their families that he was rescinding This was bloodless, heartless, and completely unjustifiable. In his remarks, the Attorney General composed an elaborate fiction about DACA, a program that has transformed the lives of 800,000 young people, and the Attorney General actually thought the American people would fall for his made-up remarks. He not only claimed that DACA was unconstitutional but also falsely claimed that Dreamers were taking hundreds of thousands of jobs away from Americans and that they deserved to be punished.  The fact is, a strong majority of the American people are siding with the DACA participants. The American people aren't threatened by these inspiring young people. They are not criminals. They aren't causing trouble. They are students, doctors, nurses, teachers, and entrepreneurs making real and meaningful contributions to our society. They are simply asking for the opportunity to pursue their dreams--hence, they are called Dreamers--in the only country they know, the United States of It is why so many people across the country are speaking out forcefully against the President's decision to end  While I was back home in Hawaii last month, I met with activists, community organizations, and State leaders to rally support for DACA and to call for establishing permanent protections for these Dreamers across the country. Hawaii is home to 600 DACA recipients and thousands more Dreamers who could have qualified for the program but were reluctant to expose themselves to the government. I would like to share some of their compelling stories.  Gabriella came to the United States with her family in 2001, fleeing violence in They came here out of love and hope for a better future. Every day Gabriella and her family worried about being sent back to the violent situation they escaped. Gabriella graduated from high school with a 3.8 GPA and had big plans to pursue higher education, but at that time she couldn't enroll in college because she was undocumented.  DACA changed her life. She said:       I had been living here undocumented for 10 years and had      seen a lot of opportunities pass me by. I knew I couldn't      continue to live this way.       [DACA] changed my life for the better. Since getting DACA      in 2012, I have been able to get a driver's license, to have      a career, to go to school, and leave my home every day      knowing that I could come home to my family at the end of the      day.  Another story. Mahe came to Hawaii from Tonga when he was a child. When he turned 21, he learned he might be deported. Before receiving DACA, the only job Mahe could find was building rock walls with his uncle in He didn't have a car to get to work. He woke up at 4 a.m. every day to catch a bus to Pearl City, where he switched buses for the ride to  After working in the hot Sun all day, Mahe would have to take a 2-hour bus[[Page S4986]]ride home to get to bed at 10 p.m. before starting his routine over again the next morning.       Since I got DACA, life has changed a lot. I applied for my      first job and got it. I worked really hard and made      supervisor. They gave me a company car and a company phone.      It was really, really nice just to know that with hard work      and effort you can get places.  Eliminating DACA would erase the meaningful economic and social contributions Dreamers like Gabriella and Mahe have made to Hawaii and our country. Multiply their stories thousands of times, and you get a sense of how many lives are being shattered by a President who wouldn't help the young people he claims to ``love,'' even as he was ordering their probable deportation.  According to a report from the Cato Institute, rescinding DACA would cost the State of Hawaii $577.5 million in the coming decade from unrealized economic growth and lost taxes. That is from 600 DACA participants. There are 800,000 of them throughout the country. Just the economic loss alone would be tremendous.  Of course, the contributions Dreamers make to our country cannot and should not be reduced only to a dollar figure. Standing up for them and their American dream is a moral imperative. It is why leaders from across Hawaii are speaking about DACA and protecting  In an email to students, faculty, and staff yesterday, the president of the University of Hawaii, David Lassner, reaffirmed the university's ``commitment to serve all members of our community, regardless of citizenship status,'' stating:       Well over four years ago the UH Board of Regents adopted a      policy to extend eligibility for resident tuition rates to      undocumented students, including but not limited to those who      have filed for       I remain on record, with hundreds of my fellow college and      university presidents, in public support of Over the      next months we will strengthen our urging of Congress to      extend the DACA program and protect the dreamers of our State      and our nation.  He goes on:       Our undocumented students are an integral part of our      community and will continue to be extended all the rights,      privileges, and services available to our students, from      application through graduation.       As our state's only higher public education system we have      a deep responsibility to provide high-quality affordable      education to advance all our people, our communities and our      islands. That mission requires that we support and celebrate      diversity, respect and caring.       We must overcome hate and intolerance even as we support      free speech and free expression. It is clear that UH, like      universities around the country, is entering uncharted      territory.       Our clear and firm adherence to our values in challenging      times is more essential than ever.  So stated the president of the University of  In another very recent development, Hawaii's attorney general, Doug Chin, joined 15 attorneys general from across the country filing suit against the Trump administration to prevent it from eliminating the DACA They filed the lawsuit on equal protection grounds. I strongly support efforts in the courts to prevent the President from rescinding DACA and putting 800,000 young lives at risk for deportation.  Since the President has kicked the ball to Congress to save DACA, something he could and should have done himself, Congress must step up and do just that. Congress must step up because we cannot count on the President to do the right thing by exerting consistent, comprehensive, or moral leadership. Although it was completely within the President's power to keep DACA in place, Congress can provide the certainty these Dreamers deserve by passing the Dream Act, a bill that enjoys bipartisan support.  I also want to send a clear message to the President and his hardline supporters in I will join with my colleagues to resist any effort to hold Dreamers hostage to pay for the President's vanity wall, in exchange for sharp reductions in legal immigration or for any other dog whistles to his base. I will do everything I can to fight against this administration's continued efforts to marginalize minority communities or to pit immigrant communities against one another. As an immigrant and minority myself, I certainly know what these communities are experiencing. This is precisely what the President continues to do in an effort to play to White supremacists in his base. Sadly, this is not surprising. It is up to each of us to fight back, and we will.

God loves the foreigner. Indeed, God      loves us all. It takes time to discern the balance of mercy      and justice by which a nation thrives.       It is easier to speak publically of mercy, as we, and many,      do. And, while loving mercy, who will also stand for justice      to those citizens who cannot find a job due to cheaper      foreign labor? Who will speak of the real cost of illegal      immigration to our states? And while many non-citizens are      good neighbors, who will stand for justice for Americans      victimized by people here illegally who do not uphold our      values and laws? And who will prevent more needless crime and      death?       The Church is called to serve all people, and our      Government leaders are elected to defend and uphold the      Constitution and the rule of law. Though there are tragic      stories on every side of illegal migration, for our elected      officials, responsibility to oaths must prevail. Law and      order sustain stability and peace.

While some faith groups use selective Bible words for open      borders and amnesty, we consider the whole counsel of      We find that the Bible does not teach open      borders, but wise welcome. We are to welcome the lawful      foreigner, who, like a convert, comes as a blessing (eg.s      Ruth and Rahab) We also find Nehemiah building walls to      protect citizens from harm. In Isaiah 1, we see God      condemning the destruction of borders and indigenous culture.       All lives matter. The lives of North, Central and South      Americans matter. The lives of Africans, Asians, Europeans      and people from the Middle East matter.

State of California,                               Office of the Attorney General,                                    Sacramento, CA, July 21, 2017.     Re June 29, 2017 letter from Ken Paxton re Texas, et al., v.          United States, et al., Case 1:14-cv-00254 (S.         Tex.).     Donald Trump,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,                Dear Mr.President: We write to urge you to maintain and      defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or      DACA, which represents a success story for the more than      three-quarters of a million ``Dreamers'' who are currently      registered for it. It has also been a boon to the      communities, universities, and employers with which these      Dreamers are connected, and for the American economy as a      whole.       Since 2012, nearly 800,000 young immigrants who were      brought to this country as children have been granted DACA      after completing applications, submitting to and passing a      background check, and applying for a work permit. In the case      of young adults granted DACA, they are among our newest      soldiers, college graduates, nurses and first responders.      They are our neighbors, coworkers, students and community and      church leaders. And they are boosting the economies and      communities of our states every day. In fact, receiving DACA      has increased recipients' hourly wages by an average of 42      percent and given them the purchasing power to buy homes,      cars and other goods and services, which drives economic      growth for all.       In addition to strengthening our states and country, DACA      gives these bright, driven young people the peace of mind and      stability to earn a college degree and to seek employment      that matches their education and training. The protection      afforded by DACA gives them dignity and the ability to fully      pursue the American dream. For many, the United States is the      only country they have ever known.       The consequences of rescinding DACA would be severe, not      just for the hundreds of thousands of young people who rely      on the program--and for their employers, schools,      universities, and families--but for the country's economy as      a whole. For example, in addition to lost tax revenue,      American businesses would face billions in turnover costs, as      employers would lose qualified workers whom they have trained      and in whom they have invested. And as the chief law officers      of our respective states, we strongly believe that DACA has      made our communities safer, enabling these young people to      report crimes to police without fear of deportation.       You have repeatedly expressed your support for      Today, we join together to urge you not to capitulate to the      demands Texas and nine other states set forth in their June      29, 2017, letter to Attorney General Jeff That      letter demands, under threat of litigation, that your      Administration end the DACA initiative. The arguments set      forth in that letter are wrong as a matter of law and policy.       There is broad consensus that the young people who qualify      for DACA should not be prioritized for deportation DACA is      consistent with a long pattern of presidential exercises of      prosecutorial discretion that targeted resources in a      constitutional manner. Indeed, as Justice Antonin Scalia      recognized in a 1999 opinion, the Executive has a long      history of ``engaging in a regular practice . . . of      exercising [deferred action] for humanitarian reasons or      simply for its own convenience.'' Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-     Discrimination Comm., 525 U.471, 483-84 (1999). DACA      sensibly guides immigration officials' exercise of their      enforcement discretion and reserves limited resources to      address individuals who threaten our communities, not those      who contribute greatly to them.[[Page H6686]]       Challenges have been brought against the original DACA      program, including in the Fifth Circuit, but none have      succeeded. On the other hand, in a case relating to Arizona's      efforts to deny drivers' licenses to DACA recipients, the      Ninth Circuit stated that it is ``well settled that the [DHS]      Secretary can exercise deferred action.'' Ariz Dream Act      Coalition v Brewer, 855 F.3d 957, 967-968 (9th 2017).      The court also observed that ``several prior administrations      have adopted programs, like DACA, to prioritize which      noncitizens to remove.'' at 976.       As the Fifth Circuit was careful to point out in its ruling      in the Texas case, the Deferred Action for Parents of      Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (``DAPA'')      initiative that was struck down is ``similar'' but ``not      identical'' to Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134,      174 (5th 2015). Indeed, as DHS Secretary Kelly pointed      out in a press conference the day after his June 15      memorandum explaining that DACA would continue, DACA and DAPA      are ``two separate issues,'' appropriately noting the      different populations addressed by each program. Notably,      only a fraction of the 25 states which joined with Texas in      the DAPA case before the Supreme Court chose to co-sign the      letter threatening to challenge       Among other significant differences, DACA has been      operative since 2012 while DAPA never went into effect. More      than three-quarters of a million young people, and their      employers, among others, have concretely benefitted from      DACA, for up to five years. The interests of these young      people in continuing to participate in DACA and retain the      benefits that flow from DACA raise particular concerns not      implicated in the pre-implementation challenge to      Further, the Fifth Circuit placed legal significance on the      ``economic and political magnitude'' of the large number of      immigrants who were affected by DAPA, Texas, 809 F.3d at 181;      thus, it is notable that many fewer people have received DACA      (about 800,000) than would have been eligible for DAPA (up to      4.3 million).       One additional, but related, issue concerns DHS's current      practices regarding DACA recipients. A number of troubling      incidents in recent months raise serious concerns over      whether DHS agents are adhering to DACA guidelines and your      repeated public assurances that DACA-eligible individuals are      not targets for arrest and deportation. We urge you to ensure      compliance with DACA and consistent enforcement practices      towards       Mr.President, now is the time to affirm the commitment you      made, both to the ``incredible kids'' who benefit from DACA      and to their families and our communities, to handle this      issue ``with heart.'' You said Dreamers should ``rest easy.''      We urge you to affirm America's values and tradition as a      nation of immigrants and make clear that you will not only      continue DACA, but that you will defend it.

283,topic-id,1501,"Mr.President, what I am really concerned about right now is that we are getting ready to do the National Defense Authorization This is something that we will pass. We have passed it now for 55 consecutive years, and it is going to be passed this time. It is important because one of the primary constitutional responsibilities we have is to provide for the common defense of our great Nation, and recent worldwide events highlight the urgency of this need.  I have spoken numerous times about the grave threat that is posed by North Korea and warned that it would not be long before North Korea could demonstrate the capability of firing an intercontinental ballistic missile that would be capable of reaching the United It is not just my saying it; others are saying it. We have a lot of very courageous individuals who have come forth from the military. I am not used to this. I have been here for 23 years; yet I have not seen them come forth and just be clear about the threat that is facing this country.  In April, ADM Harry Harris, the Pacific Command commander testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee that it is clearly a matter of when and not if that Korea would develop the capability to strike the United States of This has never happened before. In May, Vincent Stewart, who is the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified. Actually, he testified before the subcommittee that I chair. He said:       Let me be clear on this point. If left on its current      trajectory, the regime will ultimately succeed in fielding a      nuclear-armed missile capable of threatening the United      States homeland.  We have talked about this being the most threatened position that we have been in in the history of this country. I have often referred to the good old days of the Cold War when we had two superpowers. We knew what they had, and they knew what we had. It was predictable, but it is not predictable anymore. You have countries like Yemen, countries like Iran, countries like North Korea that are developing these capabilities that they now have. It is within reach.  Since then, unfortunately, I have been proven to be correct as the North Korea regime continues to demonstrate its dire threat facing us. On July 4, North Korea successfully launched its first It was the first time that they had done it. If fired on a standard trajectory, the missile could have ranged Some experts say that it could have gone even deeper into the continental United  In light of that test, the Defense Intelligence Agency updated its assessment of the timeline by which North Korea will be able to reliably range U.cities--we are talking about Washington, DC--with nuclear missiles as early as the end of next year or even earlier. This past Sunday, September 3, North Korea tested what is believed to be a hydrogen bomb, its most powerful nuclear weapon to date--almost seven times as powerful as the bomb that was detonated over North Korean media immediately stated that the nuclear test was to determine the ``accuracy and credibility'' of its ``hydrogen bomb to be placed at the payload of an ICBM.''  It does not get any more direct than that. Even if delivered by a relatively[[Page S4988]]inaccurate ICBM--because they are relatively inaccurate--a nuclear device as powerful as the one that was tested Sunday could devastate its target. Just think about that--7 to 10 times stronger than the one that wiped out It is important to remember that all of this power is being wielded by an erratic despot, Kim Jong  North Korea's official newspaper relayed the threat of a preemptive strike in This is a quote from their newspaper: ``[It would] completely and immediately wipe out not only U.imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.mainland and reduce them to ashes.'' This is a newspaper that is behind this leader over there, and it has made this threat to the United We have never experienced anything like this in this country before. Now that we are getting into the NDAA this year, we have to keep this grave threat foremost in our minds, and we are doing it.  I have had numerous conversations with the chairman of our committee, and we are going to make these commitments. We have serious readiness deficits that are going to have to be addressed right away. Over the last 90 days, a spike in accidents across the military services has occurred. I had the CNO of the Navy and the Secretary of the Navy in my office a few minutes ago, and we talked about how they are addressing this thing. It is hard to correlate these accidents with a readiness decline as a result of numerous continuing resolutions and sequestration. It is just another surprise that we have not had before.  Our forces are now smaller than the days of the hollow force. Some of us remember that was back after the Carter administration. It was when our own forces declared that it was a hollow force of the seventies. Yet we had a hearing just the other day, and we had some of the top people in. In fact, it was the vice chiefs of all of the services, and they agreed that our situation right now is worse than it was in the days of the hollow force.  Our Air Force is short 1,500 pilots, and 1,300 of those are fighter pilots. I believe 50 percent of our Air Force squadrons are trained and ready to conduct all of their assigned missions.  The Navy is the smallest and least ready it has been in years. Currently, it can only meet about 40 percent of the demand from regional combatant commanders. More than half of the Navy's aircraft are grounded because they are awaiting maintenance or lack the necessary spare parts.  The Marine Corps is struggling to keep their aging F/A-18 Hornets airworthy. I think the last I heard is that 62 percent of them were not able to address that readiness.  The Army has said that only about one-third of its brigade combat teams, one-fourth of their combat aviation brigades, and one-half of their division headquarters are currently ready. That is a sobering assessment, and we are again in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation.  The bill that we have presented out of the Armed Services Committee goes a long way toward closing these readiness gaps. Our bill increases end strength and boosts funding for equipment, operations, maintenance, military construction, and it includes a 2.1-percent pay increase for our troops. It also addresses many requirements for the services and combatant commander's unfunded priority lists.  I am also pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee's NDAA prohibits a Base Realignment and Closure round this year. It is called a BRAC round, which is when they go through and make an evaluation as to what our capabilities are, what changes should be made, and what bases should be closed--decisions like that. The problem with that is if you do this when we have gone through a period of disarmament, as some have called it--and we are in a position right now when we need every nickel that we can have for the military. One thing that is always a certainty is that when you go through a BRAC round, it always costs money for the first few years, and we cannot afford to do it right now.  Our NDAA also fully funds Missile Defense Agency unfunded priorities, which is important considering that, since 2006, the Missile Defense Agency's budget has fallen more than 23 percent. Every amendment that we consider in our NDAA this year should be equally focused on increasing readiness across the  I will wrap up with a quote from General Milley, the Chief of Staff of the This quote is one that we should keep in mind throughout the NDAA process. By the way, I admire our uniforms for coming forth and talking about the dilemma that we are in because it is very difficult for them to do that.  General Milley said it best when it comes to funding our military:       The only thing more expensive than deterrence is actually      fighting a war, and the only thing more expensive than      fighting a war is fighting one and losing one. . . . We're      expensive. We recognize that. But the bottom line is, it's an      investment that is worth every nickel.  It is.  I apologize to my friend.  I suggest that this is probably the most significant bill coming up this year, and I think Senator McCain said that we are going to be starting on it next week. It has been the most important bill of the year for the last 55 years, and it will continue to be this year.  I yield the floor.

99,topic-id,614,"Mr.Chairman, the United States already operates the largest immigration detention system in the world at a cost of $2 billion annually. In fiscal year 2017, ICE had the capacity to detain an unprecedented 39,324 men, women, and children. Although a large amount of funding is dedicated to detain these people, the system is plagued with inhumane conditions and inadequate oversight. Mr.Chairman, my amendment imposes a moratorium on the construction and expansion of immigration detention facilities.  This year, we are seeing the highest number of deaths in ICE custody since 2011. Private, for-profit detention facilities in particular have not abided by basic standards necessary to protect civil and constitutional rights, and all of this is occurring at the same time that the administration is increasing enforcement, including expedited removals with inadequate due process, elimination of the longstanding division between local police and Federal immigration enforcement, and this is all tearing families apart.  The overreach of these detention facilities combined with an overreach on enforcement in general, instead of focussing on more practical, humane, and, frankly, economically viable options of alternatives to detention, are issues that Congress must address.  We should not be funding these dangerous overreaches by expanding immigration detention with no accountability. This amendment ensures that we focus on fixing this broken system as opposed to funding an increased detention expansion, and this is deadly. It is a deadly powder keg, and I don't use the term ``deadly'' lightly.  I would like to take a moment to talk about Jacinta Morales, a woman from Oregon detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Jacinta found out she was pregnant while she was in detention. She said: I was thrilled to be pregnant and thrilled at the prospect of being a mother again.  When she found out she would be deported, torn from her 11-year-old U.citizen son as well as her long-time partner, Jacinta was devastated. She experienced pain and nausea, and not long after, she woke up bleeding. After an hour, she went to the doctor, where she waited another hour. One of the people who was seen before her had a toothache.  When the doctor finally saw her, they requested an ambulance to take her to the hospital, but the ambulance didn't come for a long time, and so they took her in the back of a patrol car where she was forced to sit up, making the bleeding worse. When Jacinta finally arrived at the hospital, she learned she had a miscarriage.  Jacinta is one of 292 pregnant women ICE detained between January and[[Page H7085]]April of 2017, alone, and part of the 60 percent of detained women. Formerly detained women and their attorneys and advocates have reported that pregnant women only receive the bare minimum of services and accommodations and are routinely denied extra blankets, additional food, and adequate prenatal care.  When pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians, ICE policy does not prohibit the shackling of pregnant women during transport. Moreover, the stress of detention and fear of miscarriage may lead detained women to abandon their asylum claims.  One of these women, I am going to call her Ana, accepted deportation back into the hands of her abuser because she was so afraid that being detained would harm her unborn child.  ICE's own detention standards and directive on the detention of pregnant women acknowledges the complexity and risks of detaining pregnant women, but implementation and oversight are not enough to protect these women.  It is irresponsible to expand detention while the agency struggles to conduct even basic oversight and hold facilities accountable for inhumane conditions. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgH7082.txt,99999999999999,DACA,2017.0,6.0,September

What we are asking for through this amendment is to have some oversight and accountability to make sure that we are not seeing the kind of abuse and turn backs that we have been seeing.  Let me just remind my colleagues of the grave and critical need on one level to address sexual assault and abuse in detention.  Between May 2014 and July 2016, the Office of the Inspector General received, at minimum, 1,016 reports of sexual abuse and detention. In other words, they received more than one complaint of sexual abuse each day over the course of 26 months. According to CIVIC, a detention watchdog, only 2.4 percent of those complaints were investigated.  So I could go on, Mr.Chairman, but I think what this amendment is trying to say is we desperately need to ensure that we use the funds that we are appropriating here, the funds that we are taking away, in order to make sure that we have accountability for the Department of Homeland Security, and to make sure, for example, that when we have Prison Rape Elimination Act regulations to prevent sexual assault in immigration detention, that we have adequate funding to the Department of Homeland Security's Civil Rights and Civil Liberties department so that they can carry out the audits to ensure that immigration detention facilities are in compliance with those regulations.  Mr.Chairman, I hope that my colleagues will accept that we still are going to have plenty of money for ICE to do its job, but we want to make sure we have accountability.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgH7072-2.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,",2017.0,6.0,September
352,topic-id,2752,"Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter of support for revoking President Trump's threat to deny 800,000 DREAMers legal status in this country and to support his executive order affirming DACA for so many young people across this Nation--4,400 in Ohio, for example--who are following the rules, who came here as children, who are Americans as apple pie and only want a chance to succeed in our country like Linda who was brought here from Palestine when she was 8 years old. She is studying now in our area in a very difficult STEM program and is working her way through college through Work-Study in order to make a firm contribution to our Nation in the future and to the future of whatever family she establishes.  Why should they be denied this opportunity and made to feel so put upon by the Government of the United States?                                                  August 14, 2017.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear President Trump: As immigration law teachers and      scholars, we write to express our position that the executive      branch has legal authority to implement Deferred Action for      Childhood Arrivals (DACA 2012). This letter provides legal      analysis about DACA 2012. In our view, there is no question      that DACA 2012 is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial      discretion. Our conclusions are based on years of experience      in the field and a close study of the U.Constitution,      administrative law, immigration statutes, federal regulations      and case law. As the administration determines the future of      DACA 2012, understanding its legal foundation and history is      critical.       DACA 2012 was announced by the President, and implemented      in a memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security, on      June 15, 2012. It enables qualifying individuals to request a      temporary reprieve from removal known as ``deferred action.''      Deferred action is one form of prosecutorial discretion in      immigration law and has been used for decades by the      Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (and formerly the      Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)) and over      several administrations.       Whether a requesting individual receives deferred action      under DACA 2012 is at the discretion of Qualifying      individuals may request DACA 2012 if they came to the United      States before the age of sixteen; are currently in school or      have graduated; have continuously resided in the United      States since June 15, 2007; have not been convicted of a      felony, ``significant misdemeanor,'' or three or more non-     significant misdemeanors; do not otherwise pose a threat to      public safety or national security; and otherwise warrant      protection as a matter of discretion. Individuals who are      granted DACA 2012 receive a two-year period in deferred      action and also gain eligibility to apply for employment      authorization.       The legal authority for DACA 2012 originates from the U.     Article II, Section Three (the Take Care      Clause) states in part that the President ``shall take Care      that the Laws be faithfully executed.'' Inherent in the      function of the ``Take Care Clause'' is the ability of the      President to target some immigration cases for removal and to      use prosecutorial discretion favorably in others. As      described by the U.Supreme[[Page H6688]]     Court: ``[W]e recognize that an agency's refusal to institute      proceedings shares to some extent the characteristics of the      decision of a prosecutor in the Executive Branch not to      indict--a decision which has long been regarded as the      special province of the Executive Branch, inasmuch as it is      the Executive who is charged by the Constitution to `take      Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' ''       As early as 1976, former INS General Counsel Sam Bernsen      executed a legal opinion that identified the Take Care Clause      as the primary source for prosecutorial discretion in      immigration matters. He wrote: ``The ultimate source for the      exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the Federal      Government is the power of the Under Article II,      Section 1 of the Constitution, the executive power is vested      in the Article II, Section 3, states that the      President `shall take care that the laws be faithfully      executed.' ''       The U.Supreme Court has also recognized the role of      prosecutorial discretion in the immigration system. In      Arizona v United States, the Court noted that ``[a] principal      feature of the removal system is the broad discretion      exercised by immigration officials . . . Federal officials,      as an initial matter, must decide whether it makes sense to      pursue removal at all . . .''       Congress created the Immigration and Nationality Act (the      Act or INA) in 1952 and it remains the primary statutory      authority for immigration law today. Importantly, Congress      has delegated most discretionary immigration functions to      Section 103 of the Act provides that ``[t]he Secretary      of Homeland Security shall be charged with the administration      and enforcement of this Act and all other laws relating to      the immigration and naturalization of aliens . . .''       Congress has repeatedly acknowledged that the Executive has      power to grant ``deferred action'' for certain categories of      people such as victims of crimes and human trafficking.      Additionally, previous administrations have announced      deferred action programs to protect qualifying individuals.      For example, under the George Bush administration, U.     Citizenship and Immigration Services (part of DHS) announced      a deferred action program for students affected by Hurricane      Katrina and later developed a program for the widows of U.     citizens. Moreover, Congress also recognized legal authority      for immigration prosecutorial discretion in INA 242(g),      which bars judicial review of three specific prosecutorial      discretion decisions by the agency: to commence removal      proceedings, to adjudicate cases, and to execute removal      orders.       Another important legal source for deferred action is Title      8 of the Code of Federal Section 274a.12(c)(14)      dates to 1981 and is the product of notice and comment      rulemaking. This regulation specifically identifies deferred      action by name and allows individuals granted deferred action      to apply for work authorization upon a showing of ``economic      necessity.'' Over the last two decades, thousands of      individuals have applied for and received work authorization      based on a deferred action grant.       There are also agency guidance documents related to      deferred action issued by DHS (and formerly INS) over the      last four-plus decades. The 1976 legal opinion by former INS      General Counsel Sam Bernsen cites to the Take Care Clause of      the U.Constitution, as well as statutory and case law from      as early as 1825 to affirm the exercise of prosecutorial      discretion in immigration. It was around this time when INS      published its first guidance on deferred action in the form      of an ``Operations Instruction.'' This ``Operations      Instruction'' stated ``(ii) Deferred action. In every case      where the district director determines that adverse action      would be unconscionable because of the existence of appealing      humanitarian factors, he shall recommend consideration for      deferred action category.'' Since 1975, deferred action has      been identified in several subsequent guidance documents.      Guidance documents are common in administrative law and are a      recognized form of agency action under the Administrative      Procedure       At tension with the aforementioned body of law is a letter      sent by ten state Attorneys General to the administration      requesting that DACA 2012 be rescinded. This letter refers to      DACA 2012 as ``unlawful'' and does so without citing to the      foundational legal authorities behind deferred action.      Furthermore, the letter conflates deferred action, ``lawful      presence'' and work authorization in ways that are legally      unsound and unclear. Finally, the letter itself shoehorns      arguments into Texas v. United States, a lawsuit that never      included the core of DACA 2012, and instead involved policies      that are at this point in time moot. Moreover, a previous      lawsuit challenging DACA 2012 failed on jurisdictional      grounds and would inevitably inform any future challenge.       While the scope of this letter is to describe the legal      foundation for DACA 2012, it is important to highlight the      history and inevitability of prosecutorial discretion in      immigration enforcement. Prosecutorial discretion exists      because the government has limited resources and lacks the      ability to enforce the law against the entire undocumented      population. Recognizing this resource limitation, Congress      has charged the Secretary of DHS with ``establishing national      immigration enforcement policies and priorities.''      Prosecutorial discretion and policies like DACA 2012 also      have a humanitarian dimension, and such factors have long      driven deferred action decisions. Finally, DACA 2012 has been      an unqualified policy success, allowing over three-quarters      of a million recipients to continue their education, receive      professional licensing, find employment, and pay taxes into      Social Security and other tax coffers.       This letter outlines the legal foundation for DACA 2012 and      confirms that maintaining such a policy falls squarely within      the Executive's discretion. The legal authority for the      Executive Branch to operate DACA 2012 is crystal clear. As      such, choices about its future would constitute a policy and      political decision, not a legal one. As the administration      decides how best to address DACA 2012, we hope that the legal      foundation and history for this policy is addressed wisely      and that decisions on the future of DACA 2012 are made      humanely.       * All institutional affiliations are for identification      purposes only and do not signify institutional endorsement of      this letter.

[From the LA Times, 4, 2017]          `Dreamer' Dies Trying To Rescue Harvey Flood Victims                       (By Molly Hennessy-Fiske)       Alonso Guillen drove more than 100 miles south from his      home in Lukfin, Texas, last week, determined to help those      trapped by Hurricane Harvey flooding in the Houston area.       But he and another man disappeared after their boat      capsized in a flood-swollen creek Wednesday, and relatives      began searching for their bodies.       On Friday, searchers found the body of Tomas Carreon, 25,      of On Sunday, relatives spotted Guillen's body.       ``He was floating in the water,'' his brother Jesus      Guillen, 36, a Lufkin truck driver, said in Spanish during a      phone interview.       Luis Ortega, 22, of Lufkin, who survived the boat accident,      told searchers the men had been swept away by a powerful      current. Ortega barely escaped by grabbing a floating gas      tank, then a tree.       Relatives said Guillen, a Mexican national, was a      ``Dreamer'' enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood      Arrivals program, which President Trump is said to be poised      to scrap, though he may leave it intact for six months to      give Congress time to find a legislative solution. (Ortega is      a U.citizen, as was Carreon, Guillen's brother said.)       Guillen moved to Lufkin at age 14 from just across the      border in Piedras Negras, He later graduated from      Lufkin High School, attended Patrick's Catholic Church,      worked in construction and at a local club, Rodeo Disko, and      radio station, SuperMix 101.9       He was known as ``DJ Ocho,'' who mixed country and hip-hop,      followed Texans football and the Houston Astros, played      softball and soccer, sported Cowboy hats and red, white and      blue sunglasses.       He used the station to organize fundraisers for those in      need. ``It didn't matter what situation it was,'' said friend      Linda       Guillen masterminded the rescue trip to the Houston area      just like one of his radio station fundraisers: on the fly,      with friends' help. After the storm hit, they borrowed a boat      and drove south to save strangers.       Like many in Texas, Guillen's family has mixed immigration      status and is divided by the border. His mother, a Mexican      national, still lives in Piedras Negras, Mexico, with one of      his brothers. His father is a legal resident, and his brother      Jesus is a U.citizen.       Alonso Guillen applied for DACA, an Obama-era program that      protected from deportation about 800,000 immigrants brought      to the country illegally as children. He applied because so      many of his family and friends were in the U.S., and that's      where he saw his future, his brother said.       ``His dream was to open a restaurant, something the whole      family could enjoy and where they could come together,'' his      brother said.       ``He was trying; he was always updated with the news about      the Dreamer program.[[Page H6690]]     He was ready to get it fixed and done,'' friend Manny Muniz      said of Guillen's immigration status.       Muniz, a fellow disc jockey, met Guillen a few years ago in      the midst of a more minor crisis: He had booked a gig and      didn't have any speakers. Guillen lent him some, and they      started working together.       After the storm struck, Guillen started posting weather      reports on       Early last week Guillen told Muniz he was headed to      Houston, ``to go save lives, go help people, volunteer his      time.''       Muniz said part of the reason Guillen applied for DACA and      wanted to become a legal resident was that he longed to be      able to cross the border legally to visit Mexico, especially      his hometown.       Instead, Guillen will be buried this week in He is      survived by an 8-year-old daughter, Mariana, who lives in      Guanajuato, Mexico, his brother said.       Guillen's family is planning his funeral at Patrick's      Catholic Guillen's mother may not be allowed to      attend. The U.government has not granted her permission to      cross the border for the service, relatives said.       ``We hope that she can come, that they allow her to come,''      said Jesus Guillen's 14-year-old daughter,       U.Customs and Border Protection tweeted condolences to      Guillen's family Monday, calling him ``a rescue volunteer who      died during Hurricane Harvey'' and promising to allow      Guillen's mother to cross the border to attend his funeral.       Jesus Guillen said he hopes the DACA program will not be      dismantled.       ``It gives people like my brother opportunities to be      better, to have strength and believe in themselves and become      what they want to be,'' he said.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter to Members of Congress from The United States Conference of Mayors strongly objecting to what the President did.                                                 The United States                                         Conference of Mayors,                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2017.     An Open Letter to the Congress on Dreamers from America's          Mayors       Dear Members of the U.House of Representatives and the      U.Senate: We write on behalf of the nation's mayors to      urge you to quickly pass bipartisan legislation that would      enable Dreamers--people who have lived in America since they      were children and built their lives here--to earn lawful      permanent residence and eventually American citizenship if      they meet certain criteria. We pledge to work with you in      this effort and to do whatever we can to assist you in seeing      it enacted into law.       This June at the 85th Annual Meeting of The United States      Conference of Mayors, we adopted strong policy supporting      permanent legal status for Dreamers and extension of the DACA      program We did this because it is the right thing to do--for      Dreamers, for our communities and for our country.       DACA has benefitted nearly 800,000 undocumented youth since      it began in 2012. With work authorization and without the      fear of deportation, these young people, who have done      nothing illegal, have been able to participate in and      contribute to our country, our cities and the nation's      economy:       Eighty-seven percent of DACA recipients are employed by      American businesses, and six percent have started their own      businesses, leading to higher wages and better economic      outcomes.       DACA recipients contribute 15.3 percent of their wages to      taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare, and DACA      recipients are investing in assets like houses, and starting      new businesses, bringing significant tax revenue to cities      and states.       It is expected that DACA recipients will contribute $9.9      billion in tax contributions over the next four years, and at      least $433.4 billion to our gross domestic product (GDP) over      the next decade.       There is broad public support for Dreamers:       Sixty-four percent of Americans support letting      ``Dreamers'' remain in the U.      Seventy-one percent of Americans feel undocumented      immigrants working in the U.should be offered a chance to      apply for legal status.       Seventy-five percent of Americans who voted for the      President support       Because of the Trump Administration's decision to terminate      DACA in six months, this legislation must be passed as      quickly as possible so that the benefits to Dreamers, to our      cities, and to our nation can continue. It would remove      Dreamers' fears of deportation and allow them to contribute      even more to the country they love, which for many is the      only country they have known. They would be able to reach      their full potential in many ways, including serving in the      military. The U.Conference of Mayors pledges to work with      you to make this happen.           Sincerely,     Mitchell Landrieu,       Mayor of New Orleans,     Eric Garcetti,       Mayor of Los Angeles, Chair, USCM Latino     Jorge Elorza,       Mayor of Providence, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task          Tom Tait,       Mayor of Anaheim, Co-Chair, Immigration Reform Task     John Giles,       Mayor of Mesa,     Tom Cochran,       CEO and Executive  Mr.Mr.Speaker, next, I include in the Record an article that appeared on the National Public Radio web page, entitled, ``Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport a DREAMer, You'll Have to Go Through Us.''                       [From NPR, 5, 2017] Microsoft President to Trump: To Deport A DREAMer, You'll Have To Go                                Through Us       America's business leaders are speaking out against      President Trump's move to end       The president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, took a notable      stand. He said not only will his company lobby for a      legislative solution but also that Microsoft is calling on      Congress to make immigration the top priority, before tax      reform. And he is calling on other business leaders to follow      suit.       ``There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly      for Congress to act on,'' Smith said in an interview with      ``We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax      reform bill. The entire business community cares about a tax      reform. And yet it is very clear today a tax reform bill      needs to be set aside until the DREAMers are taken care of.      They have a deadline that expires in six months. Tax reform      can wait.''       Smith also said if the government moves to deport DREAMers      who are Microsoft employees, ``it's going to have to go      through us to get that person.''       This is the second time in a week that Smith has spoken      out. Last Thursday, Smith and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella      both issued statements calling on the administration to      preserve Nadella, a first-generation immigrant from      India, struck a personal note: ``I am a product of two      uniquely American attributes: the ingenuity of American      technology reaching me where I was growing up, fueling my      dreams, and the enlightened immigration policy that allowed      me to pursue my dreams.''       Meanwhile, in a letter to employees this morning, Apple CEO      Tim Cook said more than 250 Apple workers are affected by the      DACA repeal and that he has been hearing from them all      weekend.       ``I want to assure you that Apple will work with members of      Congress from both parties to advocate for a legislative      solution that provides permanent protections for all the      Dreamers in our country,'' Cook said.       Dozens of CEOs including Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Reed      Hastings from Netflix, Randall Stephenson from AT&T and Tim      Sloan of Wells Fargo wrote a letter addressed to the      president asking him to preserve the program.       The leaders argued that all DACA recipients grew up in      America and give back to the community and pay income taxes.      They said: ``More than 97 percent are in school or in the      workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent      have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their      first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500      companies count DACA recipients among their employees.''       In a public post, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said about      Trump's announcement: ``This is a sad day for our country''      and that he and his immigration advocacy vehicle at Fwd.US      will be ``doing even more in the weeks ahead to make sure      Dreamers have the protections they deserve.''       Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google (an arm of Alphabet), did      not make quite the same commitment on But he took a      moral stand, writing, ``Dreamers are our neighbors, our      friends and our co-workers. This is their home. Congress      needs to act now to ##WithDreamers.''       When President Trump was first elected, leaders in the tech      industry were reluctant to criticize campaign pledges of his      that went against their values and interests. They took a      wait-and-see approach and grappled with how to be a      successful multinational in an increasingly nationalistic      world. Tuesday morning's outpouring illustrates a clear shift      in business leaders' willingness to speak out against      decisions by the administration.       Microsoft's Smith says in the beginning of 2017, business      leaders looked around and wondered how they would navigate      this new unpredictable environment. They feared being      attacked by the commander in chief on social media. Now,      Smith says, ``I don't think people get up in the morning      worrying about tweets. We have much bigger problems to worry      about than that.''  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over 500 business leaders in support of DACA who oppose what the President did yesterday and who are upset at Congress for its inaction.[[Page H6691]]           Open Letter From Leaders of American Industry on DACA      August 31, 2017      To: President Donald J Trump      To: Speaker Paul Ryan; Leader Nancy Pelosi; Leader Mitch          McConnell; and Leader Charles Schumer        As entrepreneurs and business leaders, we are concerned      about new developments in immigration policy that threaten      the future of young undocumented immigrants brought to      America as children.        The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,      which allows nearly 800,000 Dreamers the basic opportunity to      work and study without the threat of deportation, is in      jeopardy. All DACA recipients grew up in America, registered      with our government, submitted to extensive background      checks, and are diligently giving back to our communities and      paying income taxes. More than 97 percent are in school or in      the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65      percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have      purchased their first home. At least 72 percent of the top 25      Fortune 500 companies count DACA recipients among their      employees.        Unless we act now to preserve the DACA program, all      780,000 hardworking young people will lose their ability to      work legally in this country, and every one of them will be      at immediate risk of deportation. Our economy would lose      $460.3 billion from the national GDP and $24.6 billion in      Social Security and Medicare tax contributions. Dreamers are      vital to the future of our companies and our economy. With      them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of why we will      continue to have a global competitive advantage.       We call on President Trump to preserve the DACA program. We      call on Congress to pass the bipartisan DREAM Act or      legislation that provides these young people raised in our      country the permanent solution they deserve.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I also include in the Record a statement signed by over 1,300 Catholic educators who call on President Trump and his administration to save DACA and protect the   [From Faith in Public Life, Ignatian Solidarity Network, and the                                 Jesuits]Over 1,300 Catholic Educators Call on Trump Administration to Save DACA                           and Protect Dreamers       Dear Kelly: As educators at Catholic institutions, we      write to convey profound concern for our vulnerable immigrant      students. In your new position as Chief of Staff, you are now      one of the most prominent Catholics in the      Your direct line to President Trump and recent experience as      Secretary of Homeland Security provides an opportunity for      you to be an influential champion for the children and youth      who are the next generation of American leaders. We ask that      you protect the dignity of our nation's immigrant youth by      advocating for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals      (DACA) program until Congress passes the Dream       We stand with our students who are DACA beneficiaries.      Their perseverance, hard work and hopefulness is an example      to us as teachers. We witness the obstacles they overcome      each day as they pursue their dream of a better life for      themselves and their families. In facing adversity and      uncertainty with grace and hope, they embody the best of our      schools, our country and the Catholic tradition.       It is a moral and policy failure when our government      targets children and young adults who simply aspire to live      the American dream. Breaking up families and communities      undermines the best values of our nation.       Bishop Joe Vasquez, Chair of the Migration Committee at      the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops and Bishop of Austin,      Texas, said recently in a statement.       ``These young people entered the U.as children and know      America as their only home. The dignity of every human being,      particularly that of our children and youth, must be      protected.''       We join Bishop Vasquez in urging you to uphold the DACA      program. On several occasions, you have expressed that you      would not make changes to We strongly encourage you to      maintain DACA as an essential program for the well-being of      young people and our communities.       Please know we are praying that you use your power      prudently and that we remain committed to constructive      dialogue.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

In Barnstable County, Massachusetts, a single coordinator for the FEMA community rating system program is helping 11 of the 15 towns invest in a regional level mitigation to bring down flood insurance premiums for the people of Cape  That coordinator is working to include all 15 towns in the program and help residents achieve flood insurance discounts of up to 15 percent in year 1 alone.  My amendment in this package would fund grants to help towns in other parts of the country partner together and hire their own regional CRS coordinators. More local governments would be able to mitigate flood risk and lower the cost of premiums for residents in their areas.  Nobody loses under this scenario. We make flood insurance more affordable, we encourage investment in flood mitigation, and because of the cost-saving use of Federal dollars, the CBO reports this amendment will reduce the deficit by $5 million in 2018.

Mr.Chairman, I rise today to support my amendment, which is included in this en bloc amendment, that would add $20 million for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response grants, also better known as SAFER grants. These are critical grants that basically help keep communities safe.  Right now, in my hometown of Flint and in Saginaw, just up the road, we have 48 additional firefighters solely because of these grants. During the recess, I was able to go to these fire stations, sit down especially with the new firefighters that have been hired, and talk to them about what it means for them to serve our community and to see some of the new equipment that they are able to have. This makes our communities safer.  It is particularly special to me because my grandfather was a fire chief. He was actually the first fire chief of Flint I learned about service to community by seeing what he did to protect the community that we grew up in.  This program supports safety in those communities. Without it, our citizens are less safe.

21,topic-id,636,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, first, let me just thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, the ranking member on the subcommittee, for her hard work on the legislation. I really appreciate it.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which we advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 54-0 in This compromise legislation aims to improve consumer safety by reducing traffic-related fatalities and injuries, clarify the Federal and State roles, and stimulate job growth and economic opportunities.  Many of you have heard these roadway safety statistics, but they again bear repeating. Each year, approximately 6 million Americans are involved in car accidents resulting in nearly 2 million injuries. Ninety-four percent of the accidents are attributed to human errors or decisions. In 2016 approximately 40,000 people lost their lives on U.highways. Sadly, in my home State of Ohio, traffic deaths have been on the rise over the last few years.  We have an opportunity today to support and promote the safe testing and deploying of this life-saving technology. U.companies are investing major resources in the research and development of this technology and should not be held up by regulatory barriers that were created when self-driving cars were science fiction. We must act, and we must act now.  The SELF DRIVE Act establishes a streamlined path for the testing, development, and deployment of self-driving cars in the United While this technology is currently being tested in certain parts of the country, there are limits to who can test and what technology can be used in cars today. Federal motor vehicle safety standards need to be updated because self-driving cars may not have the traditional steering wheels and brake pedals that all cars have today.  Additionally, this legislation maximizes opportunities for research and development here in the United States to create jobs and grow economic opportunities so that the United States can remain a global leader in this industry. With this legislation, innovation can flourish without the heavy hand of government.  Finally, this legislation will enhance the ability of our senior citizens, the disability community, and individuals in underserved communities enjoy more mobility and live more independently.  This legislation is the first of its kind, focused on the car of the future that is more of a supercomputer on wheels. This issue started with our good friend and colleague, Burgess, who held the first disrupter series hearing on self-driving cars last  Again, we would also not be where we are today if it weren't for the leadership of Chairperson Walden and the great working relationship and cooperation of Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Schakowsky, and Ranking Member Dingell, as well as our many cosponsors. I appreciate their comments, suggestions, and input.  We have held multiple hearings, technology showcases, and real-life demonstrations for our committee's members to learn about the opportunities and challenges presented by self-driving cars.  I also want to acknowledge the stakeholders who have been willing to work with us. The automotive industry is a competitive and vibrant marketplace and touches every congressional district in the country.                              {time}  1130  In the process of drafting and marking up this legislation, we had over 300 meetings with automakers, tech companies, suppliers, trade associations, the disability community, senior State transportation leaders, and, last but not least, the National Highway Traffic Safety  Safety should and always will be our number one priority. We have said and will continue to say: Safety first, safety last, safety always. I truly believe this bill will make a real difference for everyday  In closing, I want to thank our great staff for their hard work late nights and weekends to get us where we are to this historic vote.

207,topic-id,229,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The amendment I am offering today highlights a critical security concern that must be addressed in order to keep the American people safe. Over the past several years, terrorists in Europe and around the world have added vehicular attacks to their deadly arsenal. From Paris to Barcelona and Jerusalem to London, terrorists have rented trucks and vans to commit horrible attacks, leaving hundreds dead and countless seriously injured.  While the United States has yet to experience an attack on the scale of those that have occurred in Europe, we must do everything in our power to make sure that the individuals who do us harm do not eventually slip through the cracks.  I believe the U.Department of Homeland Security should have the discretion to use its funds to explore partnerships with van and truck rental companies so that background checks may be conducted for individuals attempting to procure these vehicles. This amendment is a first step towards recognizing and addressing the potential vulnerability of American citizens to these terrible attacks.

133,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, on September 13, 2017, the Vermont Community Foundation will pay tribute to Sister Janice Ryan for the many contributions she has made to our State of Vermont and its residents. The foundation will present Sister Janice with its Lifetime Achievement Award for Community Service--just 1 day before she celebrates her 81st birthday, having been born September 14, 1936, on the family dairy farm in Fairfield, VT.[[Page S5001]]  In the case of Sister Janice, ``community service'' extends well beyond the borders of our small Through her lens, the community is global.  Perhaps it was the work ethic and the duties of stewardship that she learned growing up on the farm or the responsibility that comes with being raised the eldest of six children, but since joining the Sisters of Mercy as a teenager, Sister Janice rose to whatever challenge she was presented and brought her trademark energy, compassion, and influence to every task.  Before most of us even heard the phrase ``mainstreaming,'' Sister Janice worked tirelessly to ensure that children with special needs received the education they deserved, first at the State level, and later in her work as a staff member in the U.Later, serving as project director of the Catholic Campaign to Ban Landmines, she was a great ally with me in the work we did in the 1990s and since then to rid the world of landmines. Her passion and commitment to that issue inspired me and many others.  Sister Janice's titles have been many and varied: professor and college president, deputy corrections commissioner, criminal justice reformer, human rights advocate, and, of course, Catholic nun. What is common to all of her work is her heartfelt belief that we cannot and we must not lose sight of the poor and vulnerable among us.  Representing the Sisters of Mercy, Sister Janice has always done this work in a quiet but most effective manner. Her no-nonsense personality cuts straight to the core of the issue and to the pressing need. She is masterful at bringing opposing sides together and finding the common language needed to move us forward. In these times we live in, we need many more people like Sister Janice in the world.  Upon receiving an honorary degree from the University of Vermont in 2008, Sister Janice spoke about the role that faith has played in her life. She told an interviewer that she was first drawn to the Sisters of Mercy because of its emphasis on education and its work with immigrants.  ``I truly believe we have purpose and that it is related to some greater force,'' she said at the time. ``It is almost impossible to imagine my life without a belief in a higher power, to put it in secular terms. There is so much in the universe that calls out for it.''  Marcelle and I have seen Sister Janice answer that calling many times over. For that, our State, our Nation, and our world are better.

55,topic-id,682,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3388, the SELF DRIVE Connected and automated vehicles are a rapidly evolving technology that are novel today, but will be a reality tomorrow. This legislation will provide the auto industry, consumers, and policymakers with the certainty they need to advance automated vehicle technology. Automated vehicles have the potential to increase safety, improve mobility, and decrease congestion while improving the efficiency of our transportation network.  As the co-chairman of the Congressional Unmanned Systems Caucus and an engineer, I have for the past three years been convening automated vehicle stakeholders to discuss the policy issues related to the development and deployment of these new technologies. In addition, I authored the Future TRIP Act during the 114th Key provisions of that bill, including the establishment of a regional transportation center to study automated vehicles were passed into law in the FAST It is imperative that we maintain the United States' manufacturing.  I commend my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their bipartisan work on this important legislation. The SELF DRIVE Act includes language will promote industry growth by preventing a potentially stifling patchwork of differing local regulations. By asserting the authority of the federal government to regulate these vehicles and corresponding safety standards, the Committee has struck the right balance by allowing states to retain their traditional roles in driver licensing, insurance, and vehicle registration in a way that does not impede innovation. In addition, I am pleased that the bill enables the Department of Transportation to review the vehicle systems through the Safety Assessment Letter process.[[Page H6677]]  Automated vehicles are highly complex, and present a number of equally complex policy considerations. While this bill is a significant step forward in defining the federal government's role in this emerging technology, I believe there is more work to be done with respect to ensuring that NHTSA has appropriate resources to carry out the federal role in oversight and regulation, and to ensuring the privacy of consumers' data. Data sharing between government and industry holds the possibility of improving safety operations and performance, but must be a collaborative partnership, and must protect consumers' personally identifiable data.  For that reason, I have an amendment that has been made in order to the Fiscal Year 2018 Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development appropriations bill, that we will consider later today. The amendment will provide the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with an additional $9 million for the Salaries and Expenses account. These funds will enable the agency to expand its workforce, define new testing protocols as the technology emerges, and better partner with industry and state and local governments to conduct adequate oversight.  In addition, I continue to have concerns about the collection, use, and privacy of consumers' data. A recent report issued at the direction of myself and my colleague, Congresswoman Comstock, the Government Accountability Office found while nearly all of the major auto manufacturers now offer vehicles with connected technologies, NHTSA has not clearly defined its roles and responsibilities as they relate to the privacy of vehicle data, making it difficult for NHTSA to coordinate with other federal agencies to effectively oversee these emerging technologies.  We still have important issues to consider, including insurance, cyber-security, and data sharing.

I represent areas, Mr.Speaker, affected by Superstorm Sandy and understand, firsthand, the need for Federal intervention when storms overwhelm State and local capacity. Following Sandy, the last administration requested and Congress approved funding for resiliency to ensure that future generations can mitigate the damage from storms that have grown in intensity.  We can argue about the effects of climate change on storms, but we must all agree that our communities must receive much-needed mitigation funding to protect lives and livelihoods in future storms and to prevent more costly damage.  Despite the fact that some of the Representatives for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey heavily criticized and voted against the assistance provided in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, I wholeheartedly support the funding in this resolution and expect a much larger request from the administration, including funding to mitigate damage from future storms.

151,topic-id,543,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor Thomas Cerra, a noble veteran, an inspiration to his community, and a beloved member of my home State of West  Growing up in the northern panhandle of our beloved State, it is ingrained in each West Virginian that you have to work hard for what you want in life. Tom is indeed one of the hardest working men I know. Early on, he worked odd jobs during summers and after school and learned the value of a customer service mentality.  Prior to joining the military, Tom worked on the B&O Railroad, drove a truck for a meat-packing plant and worked for the State road, while also attending night school for industrial drafting.  In 1959, Tom joined the U.Army to serve his country and was honorably discharged in 1962. This experience only added to Tom's outstanding character, as he continued to develop his leadership skills and discipline. His service will never be forgotten.  One of my favorite stories about Tom is that, once he was discharged from the Army, he returned to the YMCA where he had trained and instructed for many years. It was the year of West Virginia's centennial celebration, and the community hosted the Mister West Virginia Centennial Weightlifting Tom won the top award in the 181-pound lifting class and the physique contest and was crowned ``Mister West Virginia Centennial.'' Throughout all of his training, Tom never missed a day of work and still had time to get his weightlifting trophy engraved 2 weeks ahead of time. His sharp wit and sense of humor only add to his unforgettable character.  Tom worked all over the country, but found an opportunity to come home to Wheeling when he applied for a job with then-Ohio Valley Builders After a few short years with the company, he convinced the board of directors to change the name of the company to more accurately define what they did, and so it became the Ohio Valley Construction Employers Council, Tom then led the charge to form a labor management organization in order to promote the contractors and building tradesmen to their customers. The group adjusted the name to Project BEST: Building Efficiency by Striving Together and was incorporated in 1982.  Project BEST is now comprised of hundreds of contractors and thousands of building trades craftsmen and apprentices in the Upper Ohio Valley region. This group is known for providing annual scholarships to area universities and colleges, promoting workplace safety and productivity, and provides a forum for the discussion of industry matters with all those involved with economic development endeavors.  What remained the same throughout the years was Tom's dedication to his parents, Christine and Thomas, and his brother, Jimmy, who always provided him with unwavering support throughout his career. It is my hope that he enjoys his well-deserved retirement with his loved ones--including his son, Bryan, his niece, Tina Marie, his grandchildren, Makayla, Angelina, and Wyatt, and his entire family.  Tom is the epitome of the American He worked hard his entire life and always stroved to give back to his community after he served his country. It is my great privilege to recognize his accomplishments and to extend thanks, on behalf of all West Virginians, for his unwavering service.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgS5002.txt,1983,STRENGTHENING MOSQUITO ABATEMENT FOR SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT,2017.0,6.0,September
75,topic-id,1440,"Mr.President, I join with the Senator from Illinois, and I thank him for his great leadership on this issue. He has been doing this for a long time. His partnership with Senator Lindsey Graham is inspiring.  I want to begin by thanking Senator Durbin and Senator Graham for leading this effort and making it bipartisan and making it possible for us to talk about an issue as Americans and not as Democrats and Republicans and having a discussion about who falls into the category of being an American who is entitled to the benefits of being in this country.  For the last 5 years, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--or DACA--Program has created security and opportunity for young immigrants across this country. Now, the futures of some 800,000 young people--7,900 of them in Massachusetts--have been needlessly put in jeopardy because President Donald Trump feels the need to keep an ill-considered campaign promise made to his base and to break another one made to the best and brightest of our young people by repealing And because the House of Representatives has refused to debate and hold a vote on comprehensive immigration reform legislation, our immigration system remains tragically broken.[[Page S4998]]  Yesterday, I met one of these Dreamers, Diana Her mother brought her to the United States nearly 20 years ago. Diana studied history at Pomona College in California, and she recently received a master's degree of divinity from the Harvard Divinity She hopes to become a U.citizen. Diana literally wants to do God's work here on  DACA has provided Diana and more than a million other young immigrants safety, security, dignity, respect, and opportunity. These are young people who play, study, work, and live next door to us each and every day.  What will the repeal of DACA mean for the Dreamers and for our country? It will mean bad news for our economy. Many of these Dreamers have started their own businesses and are beginning their careers. Over the course of the past 5 years of the program, 91 percent of the Dreamers have found gainful employment. Removing DACA recipients from the workforce would reduce our gross domestic product by more than $460 billion over a decade and would cut contributions to Medicare and Social Security by more than $24 billion over that same 10-year period.  It will mean misplaced criminal justice priorities, with law enforcement focusing not on targeting drug dealers, human traffickers, and the real criminals in our society, but on the Dreamers instead. These young people are not the so-called ``bad hombres'' that President Trump said would be the focus of his administration.  Most tragically, it will mean unnecessary pain and suffering for countless young people and families across Massachusetts and across the United States whose futures will be uncertain. Instead of going to sleep tonight knowing they will be able to live their lives in peace and plan for the future, they are again left with uncertainty, vulnerable to deportation and unable to work legally.  This is heartbreaking. It is unjust, and it is just plain evil. We should not punish these young people who have no other home than the United States of We should not go back on the word we gave when we told these young people to come out of the shadows.  These Dreamers are engineers. They are police officers, teachers, and students, many in our great Massachusetts universities. They serve bravely in our military right now--in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and They are our best and our brightest, and they are making the most of the opportunities that the United States has always provided immigrant communities.  I stand here this evening as a testament to the future that any family can achieve in this country. When I announced for the Senate 4 years ago, I decided--really, for the first time in my life--to go up and ring the doorbell of the house that my father grew up in. You pretty much grow up where your mother tells your father he is going to live. So my mother was from Malden, and my father was from Lawrence, and we grew up in  My father always said: Well, Lawrence is just this great city. So I went up to ring the doorbell at 88 Phillips Street in Lawrence, in the shadow of the old south mill. It is a triple decker; that is, a three-family home, stacked one on top of the other. My father grew up on the first floor of 88 Phillips, with five brothers and sisters and a mother and father in this very tiny space.  I rang the doorbell to see who lived there now, and the door opened. It was a Dominican family with their children. The accents were different, but the aspirations are just the same for that family as it existed for the  Now, my father graduated from Lawrence High School, from the vocational program, and his son is a U.Senator from the State of That was a dream that my father had or his father and mother had to be here in America and to give opportunities, not so much for themselves but for the next generation.  Well, that is what we are talking about. We are talking about these young people whose parents brought them here to give them a better chance, but the children didn't have a choice in whether or not they would come here. They saw the promise that hard work, education, and opportunity--helped a little bit by the government--worked for the people.  So that is really what we are talking about, and that is why I believe it is a new level of inhumanity for President Trump to betray the foundational values of this Nation by repealing He is no better than Pontius Pilate by having Attorney General Jeff Sessions make the announcement yesterday. President Trump is providing absolutely no leadership for his party or the American people on an issue that even he says is an important one, and I can only hope that he recognizes and understands the cruelty that repealing DACA will inflict on innocent young families, innocent young people all across this country.  So if President Trump wants to take away these protections, then, Congress must act. The ball is in the court of the Republican leadership in the House and in the Speaker Paul Ryan and Leader Mitch McConnell can either listen to a growing chorus of their own colleagues and to the business leaders and CEOs--including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, General Motors--and to academic leaders and countless college and university presidents who all support DACA, or they can side with the forces of intolerance and injustice.  Congress should pass the Dream Act so that individuals who were brought here at a young age can earn citizenship by serving in the military or pursing higher education.  Ultimately, the House of Representatives must also debate and vote on comprehensive immigration reform. I have long supported a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million immigrants who are living here in the shadows.  We are the United States of We are a nation of immigrants. We are called on not simply to tolerate but to celebrate our immigrant communities, to understand not only the need but the value of our immigrant communities, to embrace not just the differences but the diversity of our immigrant communities.  President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said: ``Remember, remember always that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.'' No one knows that better than the Commonwealth of We have always believed that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can achieve the American dream. We recognize that our economy and our security are stronger because of the immigrant families who have enriched our Nation since its founding.  That is why this decision from the Trump administration cannot stand. We will not let it. With Congress now back in session, Republicans should prepare to have a historic debate--a debate about the fairness that we should extend to all of these young people. There are going to be voices, calls, marches, and protests all demanding protections for these innocent  I pledge my support to the 800,000 Dreamers all across our country, and I will not stop fighting for them. We will not stop fighting for them. Millions of people are going to stand up. I believe that the American dream for all of these young people is achievable, and it must be here in the Senate that the realization of that dream begins.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

Many seniors and people with disabilities are not able to use a car to do errands, go to doctor appointments, and visit loved ones. For millions of people who travel our roads, this technology has the potential to prevent accidents and save lives.

So you pick out four or five of your favorite toys and you put them into a backpack. You put in a bottle of water and some rosary beads as well.  You walk out through the door of your home into the night with your mom. You don't know what is going on. You are just doing what you were told. You hold your mother's hand, and you walk in silence.  Soon you are walking with 20 others through the Mexican desert. You are tired and hungry and carrying everything that matters to you on your back. The sweat is pouring off. The prickly bushes scrape your body. You are overcome by dehydration, and you faint.  Someone comes to your aid. They give you some water from their canteen. You come to and you keep going. Eventually, on this journey, you make[[Page S4999]]it into the United States of America, into  Then, out of the blue, the years pass and you grow up. Fourteen years pass and now you are 25 years old. You have spent more than half your life in the United States of You are studying and going to college to get your degree in economics or working full time at the local bank to save money.  You have made friends and built a life for yourself, and things are going well. Then, all of a sudden, your future--everything you had planned for in life--is thrown into doubt. The President of the United States has just said that he views you as a criminal because of the decision your mother made well more than a decade before. Just remember what you did. You followed what your mom said: Put some things into a backpack, and we are going out into the night.  It doesn't matter to President Trump that you had no choice in that decision. It doesn't matter to him all you have had to overcome. It doesn't matter how you have invested so seriously in being a productive part of your community. In the eyes of the President of the United States, you are a criminal.  It really shouldn't be too hard to imagine that story because the story close to that is the story of some 800,000 people living in the United States--young men and women who came here as children, having nothing to do with the decision themselves.  This particular story that I have read to you is the true story of an It is a story that belongs to Hugo, one of 11,000 Dreamers living in Oregon today. Like the hundreds of thousands of others brought to this country as children through no fault of their own, Hugo's future was thrown into complete chaos by the President--thrown into chaos when Attorney General Sessions, acting on orders from President Trump, announced the cruel and heartless decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or the DACA We know this program best as a program for Dreamers, those young men and women who are seeking to do everything they can to have productive lives, to contribute to their community, to establish a financial foundation, and to contribute back to America--those young men and women who know no other nation, who speak no other language, who contribute to society, and who are American in every way that matters. But that is not the viewpoint President Trump has, and so we in the Senate have to act.  The United States is and always has been a nation of immigrants. Unless one is a Native American, each of us--every one of us--is either an immigrant or descended from immigrants who were fleeing famine, immigrants who were fleeing political persecution, immigrants who were fleeing religious persecution, immigrants who were simply seeking a better life, greater opportunity, greater freedom for their family. That is the foundation on which America has been based.  Our Founding Fathers recognized just how vital immigration was to the growth and strength of our budding After all, it was James Madison, the author of our Constitution and our fourth President, who declared during the Constitutional Convention that ``America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity.'' He continued: ``That part of America which had encouraged immigration most has advanced most rapidly. . . .''  Now, we have always had debates and discussions about immigration. At times, we have been shortsighted in banning or limiting one group or another in a generation only to turn around and welcome them with open arms in the next generation. Time and again, we have overcome our prejudices. We have remained true to the loving and compassionate Nation we are, a Nation that has welcomed others to our shores.  If we want to know the true nature of our country, we only need to look to the Statute of Liberty, where there, below the feet of Lady Liberty, are inscribed those words: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' I think that line from the poet Emma Lazarus resonates so powerfully because we know that so many of our lives are connected through our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents to that experience of coming to America's shores poor and tired and yearning to breathe free.  Generation after generation of immigrants saw Lady Liberty, this welcoming symbol of freedom and opportunity, as their first glimpse of It has inspired hope and given people across the world permission to dream.  But if we end DACA, if we crush the dreams of these young men and women, we might as well take away those words off of the pedestal of Lady Liberty because we will no longer be that compassionate We will no longer be that welcoming Nation that has played such an instrumental role in each of our histories.  I can't think of anything more damaging to the well-being or the future of our great Nation because we know that when people come here and add their distinctive cultures, beliefs, and backgrounds to the melting pot of America, we become a stronger country and a stronger people.  This is especially true of our Dreamers, the 800,000 men and women for whom America is the only home they know, the 800,000 who came here as young children, the 800,000 who went to school here and made their friends here and grew up here and invested in creating a future here, the young men and women whom we promised, if they came out of the shadows, if they did everything else right, if they obeyed the laws and met the rigorous requirements asked of them, that we would protect and look after them in this Dreamer Program--people such as Hugo Nicolas, whose story I just shared, and Zaira Flores, another Dreamer who came to America as a child who grew up in this country and is now giving back to our country.  Zaira came when she was just 6 years old. Her younger brother was in need of medical attention, and he couldn't get that medical attention back home in Mexico, but he got it here in He underwent years of treatment and surgery, and thereupon Zaira's family decided that this was their home. Two decades have passed. Two decades have passed, and now 26-year-old Zaira Flores works for the State of She is a bilingual counselor and volunteer coordinator who assesses social services and disability programs for older adults. Zaira didn't make the decision to come here or to stay here. She didn't have a say in the matter. She doesn't remember her life back in  Attorney General Sessions and President Trump may say she is a criminal, but I say she is a contributing member of Oregon who has done everything right to build a solid life, a contributing member to our country, and we need to pass the Dream Act to make sure she can continue to make these substantial contributions. It is the only right thing to do for her, but it is also the right thing to do for our community, for Zaira and Hugo and the hundreds of thousands of talented, driven young men and women just like them who embody the American dream. They have risen up from humble beginnings. They have overcome adversity to thrive. Aren't these exactly the kinds of individuals we want in our Nation? We ought to be celebrating these Dreamers for all they are doing, not punishing them for choices made by their parents.  The eviction of 800,000 Dreamers just doesn't hurt them, it doesn't just punish them, it doesn't just damage their families, it hurts all of us because as punishing as it would be to send Dreamers back to countries they have never known, all of us will pay a price if this is allowed to happen. We will pay the price economically in the estimated $460 billion the economy would lose over the next 10 years, and we would pay the price morally as our Nation's standing as a beacon of hope and opportunity is tarnished in the eyes of the world.  If President Trump will not do the right thing, if he is willing to turn his back on these 800,000 young men and women, then it is up to all of us in Congress to stand up for them. It is what many of my Republican colleagues, both here in the Senate and over in the House, have said they want to accomplish, including Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader It is what President Trump's friends in the business sector have said they want. Just this past weekend, more than 400 industry leaders signed a letter pledging[[Page S5000]]their support for DACA and urging the President to continue it. It is what nearly three-quarters of the American people say they want to see happen in the most recent polls.  So let's listen to our business leaders, let's listen to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's listen to the American people, let's listen to our hearts and our minds on this issue before us, and let's act expeditiously--not in 6 months, with days to spare before President Trump's clock runs out. Let's act within 6 days. Let's act quickly because for every single day that passes now, these individuals and their extended families are in a whirl of pain and uncertainty. That simply isn't right. Let's protect these Dreamers who are here through no fault of their own, who have contributed an enormous amount to our country, and who are American in every single way that matters.  To paraphrase President Madison, we are a nation that is indebted to immigration for our incredible success. We cannot--we must not renege on that debt by turning our backs on the It would undermine our Nation's moral standing. It would hurt our economy. It is cruel. It is mean.

Industry is driving the development of self-driving vehicles, but in certain situations, companies building and testing the car of the future may need some flexibility or certainty.  With this legislation, I hope the research, development, and testing that is unleashed will stimulate additional knowledge and innovation for passenger motor safety.  We, as the government, need to make sure that safety is first and foremost in our consideration.

Young men and women in this country are now unsure if they will be able to finish their college degree in the United They are unsure if they can keep their job at the hospital or as a firefighter or serve in our military to fight for our freedom. They are unsure if they can keep their homes or remain with loved ones, and they are scared that this country might break its promise and use against them the very information that they submitted to enroll in DACA in order to find them and deport them. That is appalling, and it marks a very sad time for this United States of  President Trump has caused a lot of divisive and disheartening moments since the start of the year, but rescinding DACA is an unusually cruel and heartless move even for this administration, and it flies in the face of so much of what and who made this country what it is.

I am too.  There are more than 17,000 young men and women in my home State of Washington who are deeply connected to their communities. They were brought to this country as children. Some of them were so young when they arrived that they did not even know they were not born here until years or, maybe, even a decade later when they went to apply for college or to get a job.  Just yesterday, I heard about a young man in my home State who is very distraught. He was brought to the United States as a toddler. He did not know that he was not a citizen until he turned 16 and went to get his driver's license. As a result, he signed up for He got his license and he got a job, and he is now in his second year in a science program at a community college, getting straight A's and hoping to transfer to the University of Now he is frightened that he is going to lose all of that and be forced to go to a country that he has never known.

Self-driving cars have the potential in the future to reduce deaths and injuries from car crashes, particularly those that result from driver distraction. This bill allows for testing and deployment of self-driving cars to help the United States reach that potential sooner.  This legislation also includes important provisions that ensure safety is the top priority as self-driving cars are developed. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will be required to issue rules and new safety standards for highly automated vehicles.  The auto industry will be required to submit safety assessment certifications that detail how their vehicles[[Page H6673]]are tested and function on the road. We also insist that any manufacturer entering this market must have cybersecurity and privacy practices in place before their cars are sold.  Self-driving cars will not come all at once. Human drivers will be on the roads for the foreseeable future. So this bill also contains legislative initiatives geared toward protecting drivers and passengers, including requirements to ensure kids are not forgotten in hot cars and that all new cars have the latest technology in their headlamps.  It also ensures NHTSA is able to consider whether a car functions as intended, not just whether it meets a specific standard. We also encourage NHTSA to come up with a plan on how it can alter testing using ranges so that cars cannot be built just to meet a particular test.  This bill is not perfect. It is a bipartisan compromise and a product of what we can accomplish when we work together. As this bill moves to the Senate, I remain committed to continuing bipartisan efforts to address any issues and to ensure that safety is not compromised.  I want to thank, again, all of the key leaders on both the Democratic and Republican side for making this happen today.

78,topic-id,1029,"Mr.President, I think I will shock nobody by telling the Chair that I disagree with almost every policy President Trump has brought forth.  No, I do not believe that we should throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance and give hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. I happen to believe that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, it is high time for the wealthiest people in this country and for large, profitable corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes.  No, I do not believe, as President Trump does, that we should cut Pell grants and food stamps and afterschool programs and Medicaid and nutrition programs for pregnant women and heating assistance programs. I believe that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, we must protect those who are the most vulnerable.  No, I do not believe, as President Trump does, that climate change is a hoax. I believe it is the greatest environmental crisis facing our planet and that it is already causing devastating harm throughout our Nation and throughout the world and on and on it goes.  There is very little in public policy on which I agree with the President, but there is one area in which my disagreement with President Trump goes much deeper than public policy. The truth is, every President in recent history, including conservative Presidents like George Bush and liberals like Barack Obama, has understood that one of the prime functions of being President of the United States is to bring the people of our country together, whether you are Black or whether you are White or whether you are Latino or whether you are Asian American or whether you are Native Every President has instinctively understood that one of the prime responsibilities of a President is to bring our people together as proud  Unfortunately and tragically, this is something Donald Trump does not understand. At a time when this country faces so many serious crises, whether it is the high cost of healthcare, whether it is climate change, whether it is the proliferation of low-wage jobs and a starvation minimum wage, whether it is the huge national debt we face, whether it is inadequate educational opportunities, whether it is a broken criminal justice system, instead of bringing our people together to address those important issues and trying to solve them, what this President is doing, uniquely in modern history, is trying to divide us up by the color of our skin, by our sexual orientation, by the country we were born in, by our religion.  Instead of bringing us together to solve the many problems we face as a people, he is trying to divide us up in order to gain political support from a segment of our population. He is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, which is what his attacks on affirmative action are all about. He is trying to divide us up based on religion, which is what his Muslim ban is all about. We are not supposed to like He is trying to divide us up based on sexual orientation, which is what his attacks on transgender individuals serving in the military is about. We are supposed to hate transgender people and discriminate against them, and he is trying to divide us up based on our country of origin and our immigration status.  In my view, Trump's decision to end the DACA Program for some 800,000 young people is the cruelest and most ugly Presidential act in the modern history of this country. I cannot think of one single act which is uglier and more cruel.  These are 800,000 young people--often exemplary young people--the kind of kids we are proud of. These are kids who know this country--the United States of America--as their only home. In fact, many of these young people know English as their only language. These are young people who today are in college, they are in law school, they are in medical school, and they are proudly serving in the U.military.  What this President has done is to take away the legal status by which these young people can work and find jobs, go to school, and live without fear. If they don't have that legal status, it means that anytime they walk down the street, they are frightened they could be arrested and deported from this country and separated from their families.  This act, on the part of Donald Trump, is an abomination, and Congress must reject Trump's action and pass DACA into law.  This is exactly what the American people want us to do. A recent poll--I think it came out yesterday--done by Morning Consult and Politico reports that 76 percent of those who were polled said the government should allow immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children to remain here--76 percent. Eighty-four percent of Democrats support the Dreamers having legal status, while 69 percent of Republicans surveyed also favor such a policy.  In another poll in April of 2017, 73 percent of Trump supporters said Dreamers should be allowed to stay in the United States and become legal residents. In other words--and I say this to the young people who are in DACA--please do not think for one moment that you are being deserted by the people of this country. You are not. You are being attacked by a President of the United States who chooses to divide us up, and you are today's victims. Tomorrow it may well be another minority group.  So this is a pivotal moment in American history, and we need to tell those young people that we will not see their legal status removed. We will not see them thrown out of the only country they have ever known. We need strong, bipartisan support to pass the Dream Act, and I hope we will do that as soon as possible.

20,topic-id,611,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan approach to autonomous vehicles reflected in the SELF DRIVE As ranking member of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I have been so pleased to be able to work with Chairman Latta to reach agreements on the legislation before the House today. It is not the bill I think that either one of us would have written on our own, but it does reflect a bipartisan agreement that we reached after months of negotiation, and I appreciate that very much.  Autonomous vehicles have great potential to improve safety on our roads by reducing accidents caused by human error, which most accidents are. My goal throughout this process has been to make sure that this technology is deployed safely and that we also advance existing safety technologies.  The SELF DRIVE Act lays out a framework for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA,[[Page H6672]]to promote safe adoption of Mandatory safety assessment certifications will ensure that NHTSA receives the data that it needs to evaluate safety as autonomous vehicles appear on our roads. Within a year of enactment, NHTSA will lay out a priority plan for what new safety standards need to be written and which existing standards must be updated. In addition, the bill requires manufacturers to write cybersecurity and consumer privacy plans as they develop AV technology.  The legislation allows for exemptions to existing vehicle safety standards. For example, there may be some vehicles that really don't need a steering wheel. It is hard to imagine now. But we ensure that NHTSA explains its process for granting any safety exemptions. The maximum number of exemptions per automobile will scale up incrementally.  To receive an exemption, a manufacturer must show equivalent safety, a manufacturer must report crashes involving exempted vehicles, and exempted vehicles must be listed in a public database.  This bill also has safety improvements that go beyond autonomous vehicles. NHTSA will work to improve the performance of headlamps. In 2 years, NHTSA will issue a rule requiring an alert system to warn drivers if a child or pet is left in the backseat. Already this year, 37 children have died from heatstroke after being left in hot cars. This hot cars provision, which Congressman Tim Ryan, Congressman Peter King, and I introduced as a standalone bill, will save lives.  A broad range of stakeholders have been involved and will be involved in the future of self-driving workers. That is why we set up an advisory council which will include industry, academics, labor, State and local government, consumer advocates, and environmental experts.  As self-driving cars are developed, we must examine critical issues. Will seniors and people with disabilities share in the benefits of autonomous vehicles? Ensuring accessibility may require further policy changes. We also need to grapple with the disruption self-driving cars may cause in employment. Even though this legislation generally excludes commercial vehicles--and additional clarity may be needed--self-driving cars may displace workers who make their livelihoods behind the wheel.  Once the House passes this bill, I look forward to working with stakeholders and our Senate colleagues to send consensus legislation to the President's desk. I believe we could go further to improve consumer safety and strengthen protections to put consumers in control of their data. We must also keep working to refine the Federal, State, and local roles in ensuring safe roads and protecting access to courts when necessary.  Mr.Speaker, today's vote is the next step in that process. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the SELF DRIVE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.

127,topic-id,729,"Mr.President, first, I want to thank my colleague from Hawaii for her outstanding words. She comes from a State like mine that thrives on diversity, welcoming people from all over the globe and making us stronger, and she has been a symbol of that herself as well as all the millions of wonderful people she represents in  I rise this afternoon alongside my colleague from Hawaii, my colleague from Washington State, and others to make a case for the swift passage of the Dream There are 800,000 Dreamers living in our country today, hard-working folks who came to this country through no fault of their own. To many, America is the only country they have ever known. More than that, they contribute so much to our country. They work in our companies, go to our schools, even serve in our military. All they want is to live and work and contribute to our great country. Why wouldn't we want them to?  The President's decision yesterday to end DACA threw their futures in doubt, threatening to rip apart families and telling people who have worked so hard to become Americans that they have to leave the country. The President's DACA decision is also bad economics. It would deprive thousands of employers that rely on these hard workers.  The Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute estimates that ending DACA would cost employers over $2 billion in 2 years alone. The Center for American Progress found it would drain $433 billion from our GDP over 10 years. That is why more than 500 business leaders--some of the leading business people in our country--have signed on to a letter in defense of That is why Microsoft recently said that protecting the Dreamers was their 1 legislative goal, greater than a cut to the corporate tax rate. That is how much Dreamers mean to them personally and to their bottom lines.  The economic consequence of ending DACA would be far-reaching and likely devastating. There would also be a devastating moral cost if we didn't pass the Dream Act to protect these kids.  I am reminded of a young woman, Kirssy Martinez, who was brought to this country from the Dominican Republic as a very young child and grew up in my city, in the borough of the After graduating high school in New York City, Kirssy was stuck in the shadows. She worked small jobs as a waitress and as a babysitter. Though she was a good student coming out of high school and even had a few scholarship offers, she couldn't attend college because she didn't have a green card.  The DACA Program granted her temporary legal status. She worked hard to scrape together enough for loans and enrolled in Bronx Community A few years ago, I spoke at her graduation, where she was the covaledictorian of her class. I watched her. What a wonderful young lady. She had a perfect GPA, 4.0.  Kirssy represents what we think of as the best of our country. She is part of what makes America great. Like generations before her, she wants to study hard, work hard, and give back to her community. What kind of country would we be--what kind of country have we become if we say that Kirssy and 800,000 hard-working folks just like her are not welcome.  Congress has a responsibility to act. I know the Presiding Officer sees it that way as well, and I very much appreciate it. We should do, as soon as we can, whatever we can.  I repeat what I said to the majority leader and the Speaker of the House this morning at the White House: Put a clean Dream Act on the floor in both It will receive bipartisan support. I believe it would pass by significant margins in each We could remove the fear of deportation and give peace of mind to 800,000 Dreamers if only our leadership would put the bill on the floor.

Many know no other country but this one. They work every single day in our businesses. They go to our schools. They serve in our military. They are a boon to our economy. All they want is to live, work, and contribute to this country like generations have done before. They want to be Americans, as so many people do, because we are such a great country.  Congress has the ability and, I believe, the responsibility to act and to protect those Dreamers before the program is completely terminated in 6 months. Why not do it right now? President Trump has called on Congress to act; so why don't we?  I would ask my friend the majority leader and Speaker Ryan to put a clean Dream Act on the floor in both Chambers in Every Democrat is ready to vote for that legislation.

70,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, first, I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for his thoughtful words and thank all of my other colleagues who come to the floor to speak up for young people who need our voices right now.  ``Through no fault of their own'' has been repeated over and over again. These young people, oftentimes babies, were brought to this country without documentation, but they were brought here. They didn't know what was happening to them, a 1-year-old, 2-year-old, 5-year-old, 7- or 8-year-old. It wasn't their choice and yet they are paying the price for what happened.  There is no question, we need immigration reform--no question at all. I was very proud and pleased to support a major effort a few years ago, a bipartisan effort in the Senate to do comprehensive immigration reform. It is something we need because our system is broken. There is no question. It hurts families, workers, businesses, and farmers in Michigan every single day, but targeting these almost 800,000 young people does nothing to solve that problem.  I am anxious to work with colleagues across the aisle to address comprehensive reform so we have a legal system that works, but we have, again, about 800,000 young people right now who stepped forward and are covered by something called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA, who were told, if they would step forward, provide the government all of their personal information, information about their families, that they--as long as they were following the rules, they were going to school, they were going to college, they were serving in the military, they were doing the right thing--would be allowed to stay and be successful in our country.  In Michigan alone, 10,000 young people have been approved for Those are some of the numbers, but we are not talking about numbers, as we know. We are talking about people's lives.  We are talking about 10,000 young people in Michigan who are attending college, who are working as nurses or doctors and buying homes and building their own businesses. Maybe they are reaching out in some other way to be successful in the economy. They are serving in our military right now. Somebody serving in our military right this minute could lose their life for our country, the country they love, at the same time the President--and his administration--has turned his back on them. These are people raising American children of their own, with American family members around them. These children aren't numbers. Frankly, they are our neighbors.  In Michigan, we care about our neighbors. One of our neighbors is named He is a Dreamer who was brought to the United States when he was only 9 years old. Wilfredo works hard. He is a restaurant supply salesman. He owns a home. He is crazy about soccer, and he says he is crazy about his girlfriend. He told Michigan Bridge Magazine that they hope to get married one day, but a future that seemed so bright just a few days ago now has a dark cloud hanging over it. Wilfredo is scared. His girlfriend is scared. His family is scared. Will he be sent back to a country he barely remembers? What will happen to his sister who is an American citizen? Will he ever see her again?  Another one of our neighbors in Michigan, Juan, shares that fear. He was only 1 year old, just a baby, when his parents brought him to the United For many years, Juan lived in the shadows, but that changed in 2012 when our country made a promise to Juan and to others to suddenly step forward and change their future. He was able to get a job, go back to school, drive, even buy a house. Juan told the Detroit Free Press: ``I know of[[Page S4993]]no other place.'' He was brought here when he was 1 year old. It is not about sending him back somewhere. There is no going back. He doesn't know any other country. He said: ``We love this country and want to make this country a better place.''  Wilfredo, Juan, and so many other young people are great examples of why we need comprehensive immigration reform to happen in the House and Senate, with the White House--not using them in a way that certainly does not show the best about  Right now, though, until we can get comprehensive immigration reform, we need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act to protect the young people who have been hurt by this administration's actions.

294,topic-id,1442,"Madam President, today I rise to talk about a different natural disaster. It is happening in the great State of Montana, and every corner of our State of Montana has felt the impacts of wildfires.  In Montana, we are experiencing a historic drought. As you can see from the map, the red indicates it is very severe, and it gets less from there. But the fact is, there is a large portion of land along our northern tier that is experiencing incredible drought, and Montana is in the middle of it all. Nearly all of our great State is under historic drought conditions.  With dry grass, high winds, and dry lightning storms, it is no wonder that currently in our State we have nearly 30 high-priority fires raging as I speak today. Just last week, we had over 40 new fires spark in That isn't counting the ones that are currently in existence; there are over 40 new ones.  Over the last month, I went across my State and saw with my own eyes the fires across All Montanans are dealing with smoke-filled air, often in highly hazardous conditions. You can see here the chart of the smoke. It has been incredibly debilitating, quite frankly.  I have heard stories of ranchers in eastern Montana--in fact, I am talking about the eastern two-thirds of Montana--who took the shoes off their horses for fear that the metal clicking on rocks might spark and light up dry grass.  Hikers in Glacier National Park frantically parked their cars and fled due to evacuation notices.  Families in Whitehall, MT, left their homes with keepsakes and the sprinklers on the roof, just in case the fires crept closer to the only homes they have ever known.  Children in Seeley Lake, a little town in western Montana, saw their first day of school canceled due to fire danger. I might add that the smoke was incredible in Seeley Lake and has been for about the last month.  More than 900,000 acres across Montana have already burned. To put that in context, the State of Rhode Island is about 777,000 square miles. More than 900,000 acres in Montana have already burned. One fire alone--the Lodgepole Complex--burned 270,000 acres. That is larger than the city of New As I stand here today, more than 600,000 acres continue to burn. There are active fires on 600,000 acres. Firefighters have spent $220 million to try to get a handle in Montana alone.  Nationwide, we have seen a 70-percent increase in acres burned this year than last year, when the Federal Government spent $1.9 billion fighting fires. Let me put that in perspective. We have 70 percent more fires burning this year than last year, and last year we spent $1.9 billion fighting fires. The bill is going to be huge this year.  In Montana, we have tragically lost two brave firefighters--Trenton Johnson and Brent These two young men selflessly and courageously put their lives on the line protecting our great  We have seen pastures burn, fences turn to ashes, and structures crumble before our eyes. In fact, the Glacier National Park's Sperry Chalet, a hotel that was built way back in 1913, was engulfed in flames and destroyed. It hopefully will be rebuilt, but the truth is, you do not rebuild a chalet that was built in 1913. It is gone. The historic Lake McDonald Lodge, a cornerstone of Glacier National Park, stands in the path of the flames.  Montana's forests, our national parks, our agriculture industry--these are all backbones of our economy in As these fires rage, Montana feels that economic impact. Tourists stay home, ranchers lose grazing land, cattle that survive the fire go hungry, river guides stay off the smoky water, and Montana's economy suffers.  Montana has been fortunate to have many brave men and women working together to fight these fires. Folks have collaborated at all levels of government to try to fight Mother Nature, but we all know that Mother Nature bats last.  Whether it is the floods in Houston or Hurricane Irma, which is threatening Florida, the wildfires across the West, or extreme drought in the Plains, we cannot deny that our climate is changing. Over the past 10 years, we have seen hundred-year storms every few years. We have seen hurricanes repeatedly besiege the gulf and east coast. Historic droughts are becoming common, and water shortages are routine. Unprecedented disasters are becoming the new normal, and it is putting a strain on our government, on our economy, and on our citizens.  Climate change is real, and we can't continue to sit in silence. We have to take proactive steps to keep it at bay. It is costing taxpayers, it is altering our way of life, and our economy is suffering in the process.  Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, we have spent more than $100 billion in supplemental disaster relief. Let me say that again. Since Hurricane Sandy back in 2012--not that long ago--we have spent more than $100 billion in supplemental disaster relief. That is $100 billion in addition to what Congress has budgeted for disaster relief. That is $100 billion we could be spending serving our veterans or improving our schools or building bridges and roads or paying down this Nation's debt.  But as our climate changes before our eyes, Congress continues to bury its head in the sand. We are left mortgaging our children's future to pay for disaster relief today. Look at the money we are going to spend on wildfires this year. Look at the funding we are going to be sending to Texas and I will state that I am all for sending help to those folks. I will be making sure the folks in this body understand that we also have to give resources to folks along the northern tier, especially Montana, because fighting fire is expensive and dangerous, and drought has dramatic impacts on our agricultural economy.  I am very thankful that we have folks like this gentleman pictured on the frontlines fighting fires, trying to direct Mother Nature in those fires in a way that they will do the least amount of damage.  We have heard a lot about the good folks and heroic folks down in We have seen the generosity, the heroism, the fighting spirit of Well, as I have traveled around Montana, I saw that same kind of heroism. I saw young men and women from across the country spending their summers fighting fires in our forests and across our I saw communities coming together and opening up their doors and sending aid from across the I saw seamless collaboration between Federal, State, Tribal, and county agencies to mitigate the damages across our  We are seeing natural disasters across this country. This isn't a contest or comparison of devastation and misery; it is a testament to the American spirit. No matter what Mother Nature throws our way, we are going to need to work together to overcome it. Saving lives and property when disaster strikes is a fundamental pillar of government. It is not a Democratic or Republican issue, it is an American responsibility.  The country's faith in Washington, DC, is at an alltime low, but I am confident that we can work together to ensure the victims of Harvey get the relief they need and that the States that[[Page S4981]]are burning and impacted by drought, such as Montana, have the resources they need to protect our citizens, our economy, and our way of life.  As Congress works to get resources to the folks devastated by Harvey, I hope we can all take a page out of the American people's book and work together to get resources not only to the folks devastated by Harvey but the folks in Montana and the folks across the West who have been impacted so greatly by drought and wildfires.  I am asking for each and every one of the folks who serve in this body to look at the photos and stand with the people of Montana as they fight for blue skies and fresh air once again. We need the resources. We do not need a delay. We need to send them quickly because lives and property and a thriving outdoor economy are at risk.  In the meantime, I ask for your prayers for all of the folks who have been impacted by disasters, including the folks from the Treasure State, as we endure the drought and these terrible fires.

364,topic-id,1620,"Mr.President, it is no surprise that Americans consistently rate jobs and the economy as top issues of concern.  A recent survey found that 50 percent of voters consider themselves to be living paycheck to paycheck, and about one-third of voters say they are just about $400 away from a financial crisis. That means a single, unexpected car repair or healthcare bill could easily put them in the middle of a financial emergency.  Too many Americans have seen their American dream dim in recent years. Hopes for a secure future have turned into worries about where the next rent or mortgage payment is coming from or whether it will be possible to save anything at all for retirement.  We don't have to resign ourselves to the status quo. We don't have to accept the long-term economic stagnation of the Obama administration as our economic future. We can get our economy going again, and we can set it up for strong growth for the long term. But that is going to require some work. It is going to require repealing burdensome and unnecessary government regulations that have slowed economic growth, and it is going to require reforming our complex, outdated Tax Code, which is increasingly strangling our economy.  The Tax Code might not be the first thing people think of when they think of economic growth, but it actually plays a huge role in every aspect of our economy. It helps determine how much money Americans have left over from their paychecks to save or invest or whether they can afford a car or a house. When it comes to businesses, it can be the key to determining whether a young business gets off the ground or an existing business has the money to grow and hire new employees.  Unfortunately, our current Tax Code is not helping our economy. It is doing the opposite. It limits Americans' opportunities. It punishes their success. It discourages investment and growth. It cripples small businesses. It encourages large businesses to send jobs overseas. It keeps our economy from reaching its full potential.  Reforming our Tax Code is an indispensable part of getting our economy back on the path to long-term health. Without comprehensive tax reform, the economic stagnation of the Obama years is likely to become the status quo going forward.  This fall, Republicans in the House and Senate are going to make comprehensive tax reform a priority, and any legislation we pass will be governed by five principles: First, any bill has to result in increased wages, jobs, and economic growth. Second, it must provide tax relief for the middle class. Third, it has to keep jobs here at home. Fourth, it has to increase American competitiveness in the global economy. Finally, it has to simplify the Tax  Republicans will be talking a lot about these principles over the coming weeks, but today I would like to take just a few minutes to talk about the first of these principles: making sure that tax reform legislation increases wages, jobs, and economic growth.  Flattening wage growth has been a problem in the United States for decades. During the 8 years of the Obama administration, wage growth was almost nonexistent.  Economic growth was also weak throughout the Obama administration. During the last year of the Obama administration--years, I might add, after the recession ended--economic growth was averaging a dismal 1.5 percent. That is barely half of the growth needed for a healthy economy or for what we have seen historically in this country, going back to the end of World War  While things have been looking up a little bit lately, we still have a long way to go to get back on the right track. Things need to get better, and they need to get better faster. We want things to get better for the long term. During the Obama administration, there were periods of reasonable economic growth, but they were quickly followed by weak periods.  That is not good enough. We need to put our economy on a strong, healthy footing for the long term. What does the Tax Code have to do with all of this? How is it discouraging wage growth, job growth, and economic growth?  I want to talk about three big ways it is discouraging growth. To start with, tax rates on businesses, large and small, are too high. Our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world--at least 10 percentage points higher than the majority of our international competitors. Small businesses face tax rates that can range even higher--up to 44.6 percent for small businesses.  It doesn't take an economist to realize that high tax rates leave businesses with less money to invest, less money to spend on wages, less money to create new jobs, and less money to put back into new property or equipment for their businesses.  This situation is compounded when you are an American business with international competitors that are paying a lot less in taxes than you are. It is no surprise that U.businesses struggling to stay competitive in the global economy don't have a lot of resources to devote to creating new jobs and increasing wages.  On top of our high business tax rates, there is another major problem with our Tax Code that puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage globally--our outdated worldwide tax system.  What does it mean to have a worldwide tax system? It means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home, as well as on any profit they make abroad once they bring that money home to the United  The problem with this is twofold. First, these companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they end up having to pay taxes again on at least part of those profits and at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. This discourages them from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations. Instead, our Tax Code gives them a strong incentive to leave that money abroad and to invest in foreign workers and foreign economies.  The other problem is that most other major world economies have shifted from a worldwide tax system to what is known as a territorial tax system. In a territorial tax system, you pay taxes on the money that you earn where you make it and only there. You aren't taxed again when you bring money back to your home country.  Most of American companies' foreign competitors have been operating under a territorial tax system for years. So they are paying a lot less in taxes on the money they make abroad than American companies are. That leaves American companies at a disadvantage. These foreign companies can underbid American companies for new business simply because they don't have to add as much in taxes into the price of their products or services.  In addition to discouraging growth with high tax rates and with our outdated worldwide tax system, there is[[Page S4984]]another major way our Tax Code discourages growth, and that is by leaving small businesses with very little cash on hand.  I have mentioned the high tax rates that small businesses face, which already restrict their cash flow. The accounting rules in the Tax Code just compound that problem. Under current law, small and medium-sized corporations are often required to pay tax on income before they receive the cash, and they cannot deduct all of their expenses when they pay the invoices. It can take years or even decades for them to recover the cost of their investments in equipment and facilities.  For instance, right now the cost of a computer is recovered over 5 years and tractors, over 7 years, if you are in the ag sector of the economy, and commercial buildings, over 39 years.  The consequences of deducting investments over so many years is that businesses can be left extremely cash-poor in the meantime, and cash-poor businesses don't expand. They don't hire new workers, and they don't increase wages.  Any bill Republicans consider has to fix these elements in our Tax Code that are discouraging growth. It has to lower rates for businesses, both large and small. It has to shift our outdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system so that American businesses are not at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy and so that American businesses have an incentive to invest their profits at home in American jobs and American workers, instead of abroad. Any bill we consider has to address the cost-recovery rules that are keeping small businesses cash-poor, often for years at a time.  I have already introduced legislation to help startups and small to medium-sized businesses recover the cost of their investments faster. It is legislation that I hope will become part of the final bill that we consider in the I am looking forward to working with Chairman Hatch and my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee as we work to draft the final bill.  The American people have had a rough few years, but economic worry doesn't have to become the status quo for the long term. American workers and job creators are as dynamic and creative as ever. We just need to clear the obstacles from their path, and comprehensive tax reform will allow us to do just that. I look forward to helping to bring the American people real relief this year.

Lucky served the State of New Mexico for over five decades--first as a financial expert for the State finance department and then as a respected legislator in the New Mexico House of We will remember Lucky as a champion for all of New Mexico, for his expertise and legislative skills, and also for his kindness, civility, and great heart.  Lucky was born to Celestino and Catalina Varela in Pecos, NM, on February 17, 1935. Growing up during and right after the Great Depression, his early jobs including hauling firewood to miners working near He developed a strong work ethic and a love of the outdoors. Those early experiences informed his work in the State legislature, including his effort to keep New Mexico rivers and streams open to sportsmen and recreationists.  Lucky graduated from Pecos High School and joined the U.Army in 1957. He served 2 years in the Army and 6 years in the Army He graduated from the College of Santa Fe with a degree in accounting. He then earned a law degree from LaSalle  Lucky worked as a comptroller for the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s. There he got to know the State's finances inside and out--knowledge that would be key to his success in the legislature.  After retiring from State government, Lucky couldn't sit still. He ran for a seat in the New Mexico House of Representatives and represented District 48 in Santa Fe for 30 years, from 1987 to 2016.  Lucky's knowledge of State finances was legion. It is said that he knew State agency finances better than the agency heads. He served as chair of the legislative finance committee and deputy chair of the house appropriations and finance committee. Lucky understood the numbers, but just as importantly, he understood the people behind those numbers--their struggles, hopes, and dreams. He championed public education, seniors, State employees, and technology, fighting for increases funding for public schools, higher salaries for teachers, raises for State employees, and modernizing State government technology.  During the fiscal crisis of 2009, Lucky is credited with singlehandedly developing the budget that balanced the budget and saved State finances. This ensured schools stayed open, State employees were not laid off, and State police got paid.  One of his final accomplishments was a 2013 bill he cosponsored to overhaul the Public Employees Retirement Association pension fund--helping make sure State retirees are secure in their retirement.  Lucky gave selflessly to the people of Santa Fe, the entire State of New Mexico, and our Nation, but he was even more devoted to family. Lucky is survived by his three children--Jeff, James, and Bernadette--and nine grandchildren. New Mexico is a better place thanks to Lucky's over 50 years of service.

265,topic-id,2855,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to speak on the issue that has consumed more of my time and energy during my time in the Senate than any other, and that is the state of our Nation's finances. As a member of the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee, I wanted an opportunity to speak about the looming convergence of several important fiscal deadlines.  The government's ability to continue borrowing money, the so-called debt ceiling--which is an oxymoron since the debt ceiling is simply going ahead and authorizing payment for bills that have already been incurred, but more on that later--obviously must be raised this fall, and the budget year runs out on September 30, the end of this month.  Meanwhile, the White House continues to talk about working on comprehensive tax reform this fall, even though, at least to date, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Senate Republicans, are making it pretty clear they are not going to actually do a major tax reform because they are going to have to rely on a more modest approach, an approach that will require only 51 votes. That sounds as though what may end up coming from the majority will be more of a tax cut than tax reform.  In mid-July, President Trump told an interviewer: ``After healthcare, taxes are going to be so easy.''  Well, we will see. Making the numbers work, getting the incentives right, making the appropriate tradeoffs--rather than being as easy as the President says, comprehensive tax reform, last done in 1986, actually is more like solving a Rubik's How this body chooses to act in the face of these deadlines--the debt ceiling, the end of the budget year, and tax reform--will tell us a lot about the fiscal priorities of the House and Senate leadership and the priorities of the current administration in responsibly addressing America's longstanding fiscal challenges.  Even though we are just back from recess, let me share with you what I believe are some very hard truths.  First, nondefense discretionary spending made up only 16 percent of[[Page S4974]]our 2016 budget. By contrast, mandatory programs--Social Security and Medicare, in particular--made up 39 percent, and the total is 63 percent because there are other mandatory programs included. On a going-forward basis, Social Security and Medicare will make up 51 percent of spending growth over the next 10 years. Over half of all future spending growth will be on automatic pilot.  The first hard truth is, we cannot dramatically boost military spending, cut taxes, invest in infrastructure, and leave our two largest spending programs--Medicare and Social Security--untouched in any type of fiscally responsible way. That means we will have to make dramatic cuts.  The truth is, there will have to be dramatic cuts. Where will those come from? The nondefense discretionary spending. That means programs for people who work for lower wages or otherwise struggle by--all of those programs will be on the chopping block.  For example, in his fiscal year 2018 budget blueprint, the President proposed eliminating funding for the Appalachian Regional In my mind, this is the height of hypocrisy. The President did extraordinarily well in the parts of my State that are a part of He promised a renewal for folks who used to work in the coal mines. Yet in his first budget, instead of offering renewal and hope, he slashed one of the most successful, long-term, bipartisan-supported programs, the Appalachian Regional Commission, which has invested millions in communities throughout Appalachia over the years.  The President's same fiscal year 2018 budget completely eliminated a program that helps struggling families heat their homes during the coldest months of winter. Again, all of those cuts come out of nondefense discretionary spending, which, in English, means education, support programs, roads, R&All of those programs will be subject to cuts within the current budget fiscal outline.  Here are additional facts. Our national debt is approaching $20 trillion, and debt held by the public as a percentage of the GDP is the highest it has been since we emerged from World War The Federal Government spends more money than it collects in revenue. I work in the only place in America where, occasionally, people high-five each other because the deficit on an annual basis got down to $400 or $500 billion. No place in the world would operate with those kinds of economics.  By 2029, every dollar of tax revenue will go to programs, in effect, on automatic spending. Those mandatory programs I mentioned earlier, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, are all good programs. But the truth is, if we don't look at those programs, as well, for reform and if we don't understand that we also need to invest in roads, infrastructure, and other support programs, that means by 2029 every dollar we spend on those programs, roads, education, research, and also defense will be borrowed money.  The truth is, we have a very inefficient and outdated tax structure. Let me be the first to acknowledge that and also acknowledge that the goals of tax reform are better efficiency, more transparency. Those are goals I can embrace. It hasn't been updated in more than three decades.  The truth is, on both sides of the aisle there is bipartisan agreement that we need tax reform. I think we can all agree that we have a backward tax system. As a matter of fact, in many ways we have the world's combination of the worst. We have an incredibly complicated tax system with, nominally, on the business side the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Yet if you look at the revenues we collect--and I am not talking about business taxes but individual taxes as well. If you look at the revenues we collect as a percentage of our overall economy, where do you think America lands? If you listen to many, you would think America must be the highest taxed State in the whole world. If you look at the 34 industrial nations that make up the OECD, the United States of America's State, local, and Federal taxes combined are 31st out of 34.  I hear many times from colleagues on the other side of the aisle, complimenting, for example, Germany and other countries around the world on their training and infrastructure. I am not suggesting that we move to their tax systems, but they raise the percentage of their GDP some 5, 6, 7, 8 percent--or more--in taxes than we do. I am not saying that we should duplicate Europe, but if we are going to compare apples to apples, we actually have the world's combination of the worst--the most complicated tax system, yet we raise at the bottom of the barrel in terms of revenue.  Let me be clear. The fact is, there is blame on both sides of the aisle. This $20 trillion of debt did not emerge overnight. This has been growing for 50 years. Both political parties bear plenty of responsibility. The challenge right now is not only our annual deficit, which was the subject of a lot of discussion when our deficit was over $1 billion, but in a sense, even though the deficit is down, what we have to grapple with now is the accumulated debt. So even though there are those of us who may not have been here for decades, we have to bear the responsibility of those who came before us. The accumulated debt in our country is $20 trillion.  Now, we have not felt the full effect of that debt because, since 2009, we have had the advantage of there being record low interest rates, but as we have seen from the Fed and as we have seen from many people on both sides of the aisle who are encouraging the Fed to go ahead and raise interest rates, the days of the luxury of not having to deal with the debt service of our accumulated debt will soon be behind us.  So what does that mean? It means that not ``if'' but ``when'' interest rates go up 1 percent--in financial terms, what is called 100 basis points and, in English, what is called 1 percent--the Federal Government will be charged an additional $160 billion a year in annual interest payments just on that accumulated debt--$160 billion in additional debt service for every 1 point rise in interest rates. If you were to see a spike in interest rates of 3 or 4 or 5 percent, which we saw in earlier times in our country--I do not think that will happen--it would basically bankrupt the Federal  The truth is, even that relatively minor 1-percent increase in the interest rate and the additional $160 billion in debt service comes right off the top. That payment comes before we pay Social Security, before we pay our military, before we pay for roads. That $160 billion is more than we currently spend on the Departments of Education and Homeland Security combined, and that is not an obligation we can avoid paying.  As I mentioned, here is the truth. Fiscal discipline should not depend on who sits in the White House, and fiscal discipline should not depend on who controls There were many of us who were involved in the so-called Gang of 6, who advocated for the Simpson-Bowles plan a number of years back. It was not perfect, but it would have gotten us out of this challenge.  The truth is, every day, every month, every year we wait to address this structural imbalance, the problem only gets worse. With the tools we have, in plain old balance sheet terms--I have been a business guy longer than I have been in politics--you have to either raise revenue or cut spending, which means the cuts that will have to take place or the reforms that will be required to take place in our entitlement programs or the amount of revenues that will have to be raised will only make it more difficult. As I have said, as to the issue of the deficit and the debt, neither party has clean hands. Frankly, memories in this town are conveniently short.  In the coming weeks, as we head toward the possible convergence of the debt ceiling, government funding, tax reform, and a government shutdown, here is what I have urged my colleagues to pay close attention to.  First, the White House and my Senate colleagues should avoid using rosy scenarios just to make their proposals look fiscally responsible when they are not. Over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office has said--Congress's official scorekeeper, and let me acknowledge again that, no matter who is in charge, everybody likes to blame the CBO, but it is our referee--it expects our GDP growth to average a little above 1.8 percent per year. I hope we can do better, but that is what the referee says. The Trump administration's budget is based on 7 straight[[Page S4975]]years of 3 percent growth. Now, that is a great aspiration, but any responsible business would not base its assumptions of its budget on a going-forward basis of rejecting our official referee, the CBO, and in effect plucking a number out of the air.  Why do they do it?  Those rosy and unrealistic economic assumptions allow the administration to claim a fictional $3 trillion in additional tax revenue over the next 10 years. That is the differential in 1.2 percent of additional growth in 7 years straight. The administration, in its proposal, then uses this fake revenue to cloak additional tax cuts and spending cuts under the banner of fiscal responsibility. That is wrong and irresponsible, and no responsible organization or business would take those actions.  Second, the administration cannot shift costs to others and then claim it as a savings. Look no further than what the Trump budget does with Federal programs for the poor. Over the next decade, it calls for slashing more than $600 billion from Medicaid, and that does not include the additional cuts to Medicaid that were proposed in its ill-fated healthcare reform. The truth is, Medicaid is a partnership between the Federal Government and the States, and as a former Governor, I am aware of this in real time. So a $600 billion cut at the Federal level has a direct impact on State Medicaid responsibilities. It simply squeezes the balloon, forcing the States to either dramatically up their shares of the cost to Medicaid or dramatically cut back services.  Third, the administration claims that its tax reform plan will pay for itself and stimulate so much economic growth that it will not add to the deficit. This is maybe the most spurious claim of all made by the administration. Here is the basic problem. The truth is, at least what the Trump proposal has put out so far has really very little to do with comprehensive tax reform. Instead, it is a two-page wish list of tax cuts--a wannabe of every interest group that would like to get its special deal in the Tax Code to its advantage. Every time we promised tax cuts would pay for themselves, it has not worked out.  Let's remember that Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut provided a short-term stimulus, but then deficits ballooned, and President Reagan had to raise taxes in 1982 and 1984. Likewise, President George Bush's tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 provided that quick sugar high, but ultimately they had little impact on economic growth. Instead, the Bush tax cuts produced large deficits into the trillions and trillions of dollars that moved us from a budget surplus on an annual basis, which he inherited, to the point at which, when President Obama came in, the deficits were approaching $1 trillion a year.  Fourth, paying for tax cuts through deficit spending is a really bad idea. It will make reaching any responsible fiscal goal that much more difficult. Also, studies show, tax cuts that add to the deficits are worse for growth over the long term than those that are paid for and actually can reduce growth over time. So any lawmaker who says he supports not paying for tax cuts should also have to explain why he thinks adding to our national debt is a good idea--a national debt that already stands at a record high, a national debt that is already at $20 trillion, a national debt that when interest rates will go up, which they will, will end up sucking out $160 billion a year in additional payments on an annual basis just for a 1-percent increase in interest rates.  Fifth, it would be foolish to try to balance the budget by shortchanging investments that actually strengthen our economy and our competitiveness over the long term. The budget proposals we have seen from the administration and the House Republican leadership takes a meat cleaver to a couple of the key areas that actually government should be invested more in--research and development, education and workforce training, and infrastructure. As a former business guy, as somebody who has invested in more businesses, created public companies, was a venture capitalist for almost two decades, I have looked at businesses, and I have based my willingness to invest on whether they had good plans in terms of investing in their workforces, investing in their plants and equipment, and investing and staying ahead of the competition. For a government, that means, with regard to the workforce, investing in education. When investing in plants and equipment, that means infrastructure. Staying ahead of the competition means investing in research and development.  Let's put it like this. I would never have invested in a business that spends less than 10 percent of its revenues on those critical investments. That is not the way for our country to make responsible investments either. The truth is, the Trump proposals would take our current investments in education, infrastructure, and research and development to way less than 10 percent of our total revenues.  Finally, we can achieve fiscally responsible and bipartisan tax reform, and I actively look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on these reforms. There is no area I have spent more time on, and I think I bring something to the table as both a former Governor and, more importantly, perhaps as somebody who has built businesses for more than two decades.  I also strongly suggest that nothing could help our economy more than a bipartisan agreement on a responsible path to making sure we do not simply salute when our deficit is only $400 billion or $500 billion a year but when we actually start to bring that deficit down.  Those are the challenges that are before us. In many ways, we will start to see the outlines of those challenges this month. I look forward to actually trying to move the ball forward on these very important issues.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

67,topic-id,1808,"Mr.President, our country is in trouble. America--and this government right here in Washington--works great for people at the top, works great for corporations that can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, but for everyone else, America isn't working so well. For decades, expenses have gone up while wages have been flat. Economic opportunity is slipping away from too many  We know how to fix what is happening--by kicking the lobbyists and the lawyers and the rich donors and the giant companies out of the room and putting working families first. The President of the United States isn't interested in doing that. His first major legislative initiative was to try to boot tens of millions of people off their health insurance. His second major legislative initiative is to try to give giant tax breaks to rich folks and enormous corporations while working people pay for them.  I suppose it is not surprising that the President has no intention of helping working families. After all, he is a rich donor, and he personally profits every single day from a giant company he named after himself.  Here is Donald Trump, a man who promised over and over during the Presidential campaign that he would be on the side of working people. Here is Donald Trump doing the exact opposite of what he told the American people he would do. It is the exact opposite of what the American people need him to do. Sooner or later, it is going to catch up with him. President Trump wants to delay that reckoning for as long as possible. From the day he first announced his Presidential campaign, it has been obvious how he plans to do it--by turning us against each other, by telling everyone that the real problem in America is the neighbor who doesn't look like you, the coworker who doesn't worship like you, the guy in the grocery store who doesn't sound like you.  Nowhere has this been more obvious than on the politics of race. In November, President Trump named Jeff Sessions--a man considered too racist to[[Page S4990]]be a Federal judge--as our Nation's Attorney In January, President Trump rolled out an unconstitutional Muslim ban. In August, after White supremacists marched in the streets, President Trump defended hate. Also in August, he used his first Presidential pardon to shield a racist former sheriff who broke the law.  Yesterday morning, the President continued his campaign to turn us against each other when he decided to end the DACA DACA gives 800,000 young people who were brought to the United States as children the chance to live, work, get an education, and become valuable members of our society. The President said he would end the program. That means over 800,000 young people who have been here their entire lives, who came out of the shadows to contribute to our economy, could be deported to countries they barely know.  Divide and conquer is an old story in It is a cold, political calculation. Those with money and power have used it time and time again to keep us fighting with each other--fighting over religion, fighting over race, fighting over anything that keeps us from coming together to fight back against a rigged system.  President Trump wants us to turn our backs on 800,000 Dreamers, including nearly 8,000 Dreamers in He doesn't want us to look at these young people and see them for who they are; he just wants us to see them as threats. After all, he launched his campaign by calling immigrants rapists and criminals, and that is exactly what he wants everyone else to see. I would like to introduce three Dreamers from Massachusetts and let the American people decide if that is true.  Reina Guevara fled from El Salvador when she was only 11 years old. She is a model student. She won a scholarship, and right now she is working on her bachelor's degree at UMass  Before the DACA Program allowed her to come out of the shadows, Reina worked up to 70 hours a week in a restaurant for a boss who sexually harassed her. On multiple occasions, he propositioned her to have a sexual relationship with him, threatening to call immigration on her if she refused his advances. The harassment became so frequent and so bad that Reina decided to quit her job, forgoing critical income. Knowing there was no one for her to tell, her boss refused to pay her for her last 2 weeks of work.  Reina was an easy target. A woman without official immigration status was a woman who couldn't complain to HR when she was assaulted, underpaid, or made to work in dangerous conditions. A woman without immigration status was a woman who knew that speaking up could mean immediate deportation.  When Reina entered the DACA Program, her life changed. It meant she could stand up for herself without being afraid that she would be kicked out of  I asked Reina what DACA means to her. This is what she told me: ``DACA to me means the opportunity to be the first one in my family to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree, to work without the fear of being humiliated and exploited due to my status.'' Donald Trump wants Reina banished from our country.  Bruno Villegas McCubbin was 6 years old when he left his home. Like most parents, Bruno's mother and father wanted to keep their children safe. That wasn't easy when Peru's economy collapsed. Bruno's father, who was a traveling salesman, was forced to travel to more remote and more dangerous places. It got so dangerous that on one trip, Bruno said he was attacked by armed robbers and injured by flying glass from gunshots.  After that, Bruno's parents decided they should escape to Bruno's family settled in Garden Grove, CA, where Bruno and his sister and his parents shared one room in his uncle's two-bedroom apartment. Bruno's parents, who had white-collar jobs in Peru, worked 12-hour days in low-wage jobs just to keep food on the table. While his parents were hard at work, Bruno was building dreams. He threw himself into his studies. When he graduated from high school, he was second in his class. Bruno did a lot more than just study; he founded an organization to help struggling students. He served as a tutor. He played the saxophone.  Bruno was in high school when the DACA Program began. Today, he is a junior at Harvard, where he serves as a student coordinator for the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which provides financial aid information to promising high school students from low-income families.  I asked Bruno what DACA means to him. He said: ``It means the opportunity for many of us to work here legally and achieve the American Dream that this country still boasts, so we can then give back to our families that have sacrificed so much for us, and to the country that helped form us into what we are today.'' Donald Trump wants Bruno banished from our country.  I could do this all night, but others want a chance to tell their stories as well. So I am just going to do one more: Elias Like Bruno, Elias was 6 years old when his parents brought him and his sister to the United He remembers hearing stories every day of violence in A gun was pulled on his mother while her car was at a stoplight, and his grandfather was robbed after making a bank withdrawal. To keep her kids safe, Elias' mother transferred to a company in Miami on a visa that allows executives and managers from other countries to work in the United States and then to apply for permanent resident status. But she never got the chance to apply for permanent resident status because when Elias was 11, his mother died of cancer. When he lost his mother, Elias lost his protected status without even knowing it.  In high school, Elias took tough classes, including 13 advanced placement courses. He worked hard, and he earned nearly straight A's. He served in student government and on the speech and debate teams. He volunteered with the Children's Trust and also with the Homeless The activities director at Elias' high school called Elias his hero. He said: ``I've been teaching here for 20 years and I've never seen a student like this young man.''  Elias' commitment to academic excellence earned him a Myra Kraft Transitional Year Program scholarship to attend Brandeis Earlier this year, Elias worked as an intern in my office. I asked Elias what DACA meant to him. He said it has been a ``source of optimism and a light of protection.'' He wrote:       For years, before DACA arrived I would sleep in bed at      night with a constant fear of deportation, imagining in my      head the visual of ICE breaking through my door to deport      myself or my sister. When DACA came, this fear stopped. . . .  But Donald Trump wants Elias banished from our country.  America asked people like Elias, Bruno, Reina, and nearly a million young people all across this country to come out of the shadows. We made them a promise: Work hard, play by the rules, contribute to America, get an education, defend our country, help us build an economy that works, and in exchange we won't knock on your door in the middle of the night and rip you from your home and ship you off to a foreign country you barely remember.  President Trump decided to break that promise. He is hiding behind Jeff Sessions and some flimsy lawyer nonsense, but he is breaking that promise, pure and simple. That means he is failing in his basic, moral duty to protect these people, these children of  That is not who America is. America is not a place that punishes children for the sins of their fathers. America is not a place that boots out smart, hard-working, decent young people who have spent nearly all their lives here and who are a core part of our Nation's future.  Donald Trump wants to turn us against each other. He wants to banish Reina, Bruno, Elias, and hundreds of thousands of other young people from our country. He says that is how we will build a better  Well, Donald Trump is wrong. He wants to build a hateful and frightened But we have the chance to turn away from the hate and fear. We have the chance right here in Congress to take an important step toward building a stronger, more vibrant We have the chance to make DACA the law so that Donald Trump cannot take away the dreams of 800,000[[Page S4991]]young people like Reina, Bruno, and We can and we must pass the Dream Act now.

73,topic-id,1627,"Mr.President, I am here to speak about President Trump's decision to shut down the DACA Program, the so-called Dream program that allows children who were brought here by their parents, often at a very young age, and who grew up here and are now, as far as they know, full Americans--this is their home--to not be thrown out of their adopted country and sent home to a place that they do not know, all because of what[[Page S4994]]their parents did when they were still children. We don't even hold children accountable for contracts they enter into. You have to be an adult to be held accountable for a contract you enter into. Yet, apparently, this President is willing to take these children, break up their families, and send them to a country they do not know, all because of a decision that was made by their parents, in some cases when these kids were infants.  I have spoken to these kids, who are generally called Dreamers, who have no memory of living anyplace other than this country. I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but it is hard for me to scroll back and come up with any concrete memories of when I was 1 or 2 or 3 years old. These are kids who grew up in American schools. They grew up in American families. They grew up playing American sports. They grew up as a part of our culture. But now, for reasons that really defy humane explanation, the President wants to cast a cloud over about 800,000 children--now turned into young adults in many cases and many more who are right behind them in the program--who were looking forward to this as something they could do when they came of age to get their full-on DACA permit.  We have over 1,000 people who are approved under the DACA Program in Rhode We are pretty proud of them. They have served in the military. They have had jobs around the country.  Ninety-one percent of DACA recipients are employed, pay taxes, and contribute to Social When we had the immigration debate, that is what we said we wanted people to do: Pay your taxes, get a job, pay into Social Security, support yourself, and support the system around you. Well, they have done that. But because of a decision they did not even make--a decision that under American law they would be incapable of making because they were not adults--this shadow of punishment and family disruption has been put over them by perhaps the least humane person ever to hold the office of President of the United And if this doesn't prove that proposition, there are plenty more that do.  I understand that our leader has urged Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell to get Senator Durbin's and Senator Graham's Dream Act up for a vote. I think it will pass. I think it will pass with more than 60 votes. I think we, at least--the decent Members of the Senate--can lift that cloud of fear, threat, and anxiety. I think we should. I think we should do it soon. And if Majority Leader McConnell is not interested in bringing this to the floor, I understand that Senator Schumer has made it pretty clear that he is going to insist on attaching this bill to some other measure as we move forward this year. I completely support him.  This President said that he loves these kids and wants to approach this issue with a big heart. The White House, which, the last I heard, the President of the United States runs, put out talking points telling these kids to get ready to depart. Get ready for departure from this country. Really? That is the big heart--to threaten 800,000 kids who have played by the rules, who have done what the Government of the United States asked them to do, to get ready to depart? Because of what--some crime they committed? They committed no crime, but because their parents brought them here as kids.  Jean came here from He was brought to the United States by his parents when he was a few months old. He is 23 now. If he were to go back to Peru, he would have to move to a village where he has never lived, that is not in a safe area, that he does not know because he has been here for over 20 years--22 and change if he is 23 now.  Rodrigo Pimental came here from Portugal at 10 months old. Rhode Island has a very vibrant Portuguese community, of which we are really proud. His parents came to join that community, pursue a better life, start a small business, and succeed. Rodrigo doesn't even remember He has a computer science degree--a college computer science degree. He says the United States is his home. What is the gain for our country in telling Rodrigo Pimental, with his computer science degree from college, that he needs to go back to Portugal because at 10 months old his parents brought him here in search of a better life? Where the heck is the justice or the decency in that?  These are all Rhode Island kids whom I am talking about. There are hundreds of thousands of stories around the country.  Lesdin Salazar from Guatemala was brought to the United States by her parents at age 7. We are going to break up that family and send her back to Guatemala because why? Because at age 7 she didn't successfully talk her parents out of bringing her here? Or maybe she should have left her parents then: Oh, parents, boy, it would be illegal to go to the United States without the proper paperwork. I can't be a part of that. I am staying in You go.  Is that the expectation we have for a 7-year-old, that we would now punish her with deportation and with breaking up her family? That is the big heart of this President?  I will tell my colleagues about one of her memories. She doesn't remember much of Guatemala, but she does remember sitting in her living room with her parents watching President Obama announce the DACA She says that her family cried tears of joy when that happened--at last, a path forward from the problem that was not of her own making. She does not understand why the United States is giving so many children an education here and then sending them back to other countries, breaking up their families, and I don't, either. It makes no sense.  Krissia Rivera came to Rhode Island from El She came when she was 8. Oh, so maybe that is old enough that she could have broken up with her parents back then or talked them out of coming here. She lived first in Interestingly, she went to the same school the President's son now attends. She came to Rhode Island and graduated from college. She is currently in medical school at Brown University--obviously somebody we want to get out of our country. She is scared. She feels exposed.  I would like to have one person come to the Senate floor and tell me what Krissia Rivera did at age 8 that was so wrong that we are willing to take somebody who will have a Brown University medical school degree and throw them out of our country for no reason. Explain that to me.  I will tell my colleagues, there is a lot that is embarrassing about the way our President behaves. This is pretty bad, particularly in the wake of the way he behaved after Nazi flags were paraded through Charlottesville, VA--the city of Thomas Jefferson's great university. He spent the next couple of days winking at White supremacist Nazi types, equating their behavior with the behavior of the protesters who came out. I would hope that if neo-Nazis were walking through Providence, I would go out and protest. Am I as wrong as the Nazis? I don't think so. But President Trump appears to think so--it was just two sides having an evenhanded dispute. I don't think so.  When the President reacted to Charlottesville the way he did, he was winking at the worst impulses in our society: bigotry, hatred, discrimination of people based on color and religion--things that we have fought back against for generations. Fighting back against those evils is part of what makes us But does President Trump fight back against those evils? Just a little wink, a little pat on the head along the way: Keep it up, boys; I don't mind that much. No difference between you and the people who come out because they are outraged to see Nazi flags flying in Charlottesville,  And now this. And now this. Who the hell is President Trump talking to when he does this? Who gets the wink this time? If this isn't another wink to bigotry and hatred and discrimination, I don't know what is. No one can explain to me why an 8-year-old, who is such a good person that she will come to a new country and come all the way to Brown University's medical school, is to be punished for not having broken up with her parents at age 8 when they brought her to this country. It makes no sense.  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois here on the floor. The battle for the DACA Program and for the Dream Act has been a cause of his political life. There is no person in this[[Page S4995]]Chamber to whom more credit is due for this program than Senator So with great respect, as well as affection, I will yield the floor to him.

And he pulled the rug right from underneath them all. It is a cruel, awful, and nasty thing to do.  Listening to the rationale of this White House, this kind of schizophrenic tirade that we have seen unfold where 1 minute he is against the DREAMers, then he loves the DREAMers, then he is against the DREAMers, then he loves them, all of this kind of rambling that we have seen out of the White House hasn't changed the fact that he has thrown 800,000 lives in turmoil. People now have to live in fear and in uncertainty, and it is just a rotten thing to do. What we are saying is let's fix it.

First of all, with regard to the underlying bill that is being brought before the House today, a whole bunch of appropriations bills bunched together in an unprecedented way and, I would say, in an undemocratic way as well--nobody has had a chance to read these bills, over 1,300 pages--I don't think anybody in this Chamber has read them all.  Close to 1,000 amendments were submitted. They were all asked to be submitted before we came back into session while people were still on work recess. I don't think Members have had a chance to review all of the amendments. As I said, hundreds of good amendments have already been rejected.  Last night in the Rules Committee, I invoked Senator John McCain's name. He recently wrote a piece in which he called upon Congress to go back to regular order. I agree with him. We ought to go back to regular order. That is what the Speaker of the House promised when he took the gavel, we would have regular order. This is not regular order. This is not the way we should decide spending matters.  I will tell you right now that there will be lots of mistakes in this legislation that is being rushed through--if it even goes anywhere--because we are now being told we are going to have to do a continuing resolution, and chances are we are going to end up having to do a long-term spending bill. But process matters, and when you bunch things together and when you rush things like this, mistakes are made.  As I said in my opening, we are going to ask for people to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If you vote ``no'' on the previous question, I will offer an amendment to bring up Representative Roybal-Allard's bill, which is the DREAM Act, which would actually solve the dilemma that we face. It would solve the dilemma that 800,000 good people in this country are now facing as a result of President Trump's cruel decision yesterday to repeal DACA, to end  These are people who, as you have heard from all my colleagues as they have told their stories, are working in this country. They are leading efforts to rescue people in hurricane-ravaged They are paramedics and they serve in our military.                              {time}  1530  These are good people. This is their country. They were brought here as infants. This is the only country they know. The fact that we are treating these good people in such a terrible way, every one of us should be ashamed. That is not who we are. We keep on saying that every time the White House does something else that we find offensive. We keep on saying: That is not who we are; that is not who we are.  Well, at some point, we have to prove it. We have to show it.  If we believe DREAMers are a valuable part of our community, then we need to protect them. This is a way to do it today. There is no need for compromise and more discussion. It is very simple: you either support the DREAMers or you don't. That is it. That is the only question at hand. If you want to load it up with all kinds of other extraneous materials, that is not a fair thing to do. That is not what these people deserve.  Mr.Speaker, I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are hearing from their constituents. I know they are hearing from their churches, synagogues, and mosques that we need to protect these people. Well, let's do it. The DREAMers don't need your words. They don't need your sympathies. They don't need your empathy. They need your vote.  We have an opportunity today, by voting ``no'' on the previous question, to have a vote today on whether to protect the It is that simple. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side have spoken very eloquently about the If you mean it, then give us your vote. If you mean it, do less talking and give us the vote. That is what we are asking for today.  Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let us help these great people. Let us help these people who have been such a valuable part of our community. Let us treat them with the dignity and respect that they deserve. Let us recognize that they view this country as their home. We should view this country as their home as well.  Vote ``no'' on the previous question. If that doesn't work, then vote ``no'' on this lousy rule.[[Page H6692]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

355,topic-id,2524,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I fear you are going to have to use that admonition a great deal in the coming days, and I regret that.  I regret that folks have begun to confuse civility with weakness. My experience is, when you are strong, you don't have to insult the people around you. When you are strong, you don't have to call folks around you names. Civility and weakness are confused. In fact, more often than not, there is a loss of civility when folks feel at their weakest.  My friends on the other side of the aisle right now, Mr.Speaker, with good reason, feel very restricted. Being in the minority in the House of Representatives is a hard place to be. For my friend from Massachusetts, Mr.Speaker, being in the minority on the Rules Committee is among one of the hardest places to be. So I don't fault him for his frustration one little bit. If I was in his shoes, I would be frustrated as well.  Let me be clear: we are in this position with DACA today for one reason and one reason only, and that is because instead of leading the Congress and leading the Nation, President Obama chose to act alone in a way that he knew would not be permanent.  The instability that you see today is the result of folks acting in a way that was not stable. The confusion that you see today is the result of an administration that committed itself to that confusion instead of committing itself to consensus.  I have been in this Congress for 7 years, Mr.That is 7 years. For 4 of those 7 years, the United States Senate was led by the Democratic Not once in those 7 years has an immigration bill come to my desk from the United Not once. I know, as we sit here right now, the House Judiciary Committee has acted on immigration bill after immigration bill after immigration bill.  Let's be clear, Mr.Speaker: the situation that the DREAMers find themselves in today is the symptom of a Nation that does not have the security of its borders. Had America had security for its borders, we would not have allowed these families to put their children in these positions.  Today, we have an amazing opportunity to have this debate. I tell you that our President is in a unique position to lead us.  It frustrates me so much, Mr.Speaker, that folks want to assume the worst about one another and that the media is all too anxious to report the worst about one another. The President could have just canceled the DACA program. He could have instructed DHS to start proceedings today. He didn't. It wouldn't have been the right thing. It wouldn't have been the prudent thing to do. He didn't do it.  What did he do?  He said: I have read this thing called the United States It turns out that only one group in the land has the opportunity to write the laws. It is me and my friend from It is the majority leader from Kentucky and the minority leader from New York across the way.  He said: Congress, there is only one way this should have even been done. It should have been done in the Halls of That is not the way President Obama chose to do it. He should have done better. He didn't. We can do better. Let's do.  Now, to the sky-is-falling reports that came out one right after the other almost with glee from the fourth estate, the President spoke again to say: Listen, you know what? If Congress doesn't get it right, I may have to act myself.  I hope he doesn't. I think that folks have too little confidence in what we can do together when we set our minds to it, but we do have to ask ourselves, watching the display here on the floor today, watching the displays we have had here on the floor in the past: Do we have a serious group of men and women here who want to work together on solutions? Or do we have a group of men and women here who want to just get the next headline, who want to just send out that next tweet, who just want to just make that next front page story of hysteria?  I believe the former is true. I know the men and women on this floor, Mr.Speaker, not the caricature of the men and women that you read in the newspaper, but the real men and women on this floor, who each come here every single day to diligently serve the almost 700,000 men and women that they report to back home. And I am proud to do it.  I plea, Mr.Speaker, for you to use your leadership to not allow us to devolve into the name calling and the acrimony that the fourth estate would like to suggest characterizes this Chamber, but to lead us to the sincere debate of caring about people, caring about the rule of law, caring about families.  Let me just say, the best part of this job is the casework that each one of us does back home. You all know it. People think the job happens in Washington, D.It doesn't. It happens one family at a time back home.  You have heard the comments on the floor of the House today, Mr.I have families in my district separated from one another. You want to talk about uniting families? I have families separated from one another standing in line to come to this country legally.  I ask you, Mr.Speaker: How many folks have you heard standing up for my constituents whose families have been separated because they have been standing in line to get here for more than a year? How many folks have stood up for them? Not one.  What about those families standing in line 2 years, Mr.Speaker? I have got them in my district, too.  What about those families who have been separated for 3 years and standing in line trying to get to America the right way? Who is standing up for them? I don't hear those calls on the floor of the I have got them in my district, too.  What about 4 years, Mr.Speaker; 5 years, Mr.Speaker; 6 years, Mr.Speaker? If you wanted to bring your adult child in from Mexico, you had to file in the 1990s for their number to be coming up today. That is crazy. It is crazy.  Where is the conversation about reforming the system that got us here to begin with? I applaud my friend for trying to solve the symptom. I beg my friend to work with me to cure the disease.  We have a President who can lead us in that direction, Mr.He has the credibility of being tough on borders and he has the heart of someone who wants to keep families united. We have an opportunity, Mr.We can take it or we can reject it. I believe we are going to take it.  But that is not for the business today. The business today is an appropriations process. My friend from Massachusetts called it unprecedented. He is right. I take no small amount of pleasure in talking about how right he is. I have been in this body for 7 years and we don't generally get the appropriations bills done before the end of the year, Mr.Deadlines don't tend to mean anything to us. We are about to make that happen.  Mr.Speaker, 1997 was the last time Congress funded the government ahead of schedule, before the deadline. It has taken a continuing resolution every other year since 1997. We have an opportunity this year to do it. I don't know if we will take it or not. I hope that we will.  We can't solve everything every day, but we can solve something every day. We can make something better for someone every day.  If you support this rule, we will bring to the floor four appropriations bills and 119 amendments, give or take. We are up in the Rules Committee right now making even more amendments in order, Mr.Speaker, to have even more voices be heard, to have even more opportunity to make a difference for the families that we all represent back home.  Support this rule. Be proud of this rule. Be proud of the work the Appropriations Committee did. Mr.Speaker, you don't hear it on the floor of the House, but it so frustrates me. If you had been in the Rules Committee last night, you would have seen Democrats and Republicans sitting side by side talking about the amazing work they did together on the appropriations[[Page H6693]]process in the Appropriations Committee, talking about the great admiration and respect that they had for one another because of the work they do together on the Appropriations  We don't hear that here on the floor of the House, and we should. We should hear more of that. We should hear more about the good work we are doing together. If we support this rule, Mr.Speaker, we will get a chance not to hear about it, but to experience it, to do it.  I know my colleague from Massachusetts and I have another 6, 7, 8 hours of Rules Committee work to do together tonight. I know my colleague is going to challenge us to do even better than what we are doing. I am prepared to accept that challenge.  But for today, Mr.Speaker, for this moment, I urge my colleagues to come to this floor; support this rule; move the appropriations process forward; finish the appropriations process before the September 30 deadline; and serve your constituents back home, like I know every man and woman in this Chamber does.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support for the rule and support for the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 500 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       Sec 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (     3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment      of status of certain individuals who are long-term United      States residents and who entered the United States as      children and for other purposes. The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on the After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.3440.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

104,topic-id,402,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment to H.3354 will provide needed regulatory relief to fishermen from the East End of Long Island and the entire region who are struggling under confusing and arbitrary Federal restrictions on striped bass fishing in Block Island  The unique maritime geography of our region means that making the 15-mile journey by boat from Montauk Point, New York, to Block Island, Rhode Island, requires passing through a segment of waters considered to be part of the EEZ known as the Block Island Transit  For recreational anglers, charter boat captains, and commercial fishermen, this shift in jurisdiction can mean the difference between a nice day on the water and committing a Federal offense.  My amendment would bar the U.Coast Guard from enforcing this ban on striped bass fishing in these waters so that Coast Guard resources can be focused on their important national security and safety mission.  No other species of fish besides striped bass are subject to this confusing ban which was meant to impact the high seas of the EEZ, not a small segment of local waters situated between two State boundaries.  Fishermen should be able to legally fish for striped bass in this limited area just as they currently can in adjacent State waters. A recreational angler or boat captain on the water off of Montauk Point, New York, can easily go from fishing legally and responsibly in State waters to violating Federal law once they pass over the 3-mile limit where New York State waters end and the Transit Zone begins.  Many of these individuals lack the expensive GPS technology to know if and when they have crossed the boundary, and there are no buoys to warn them. These are responsible men and women who have the greatest vested interest in preserving the striped bass fishery, but they also desperately need relief from confusing government regulations that are hurting their livelihoods and access to local fisheries.                              {time}  0120  Last Congress, my stand-alone bill to address this issue, H.3070, the EEZ Clarification Act, passed the House with a unanimous voice vote.  This amendment is supported by the Recreational Fishing Alliance, the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, and the Montauk Boatman & Captains  On behalf of the hardworking men and women of Long Island who rely on fishing as a way of life, I ask for your support on this commonsense amendment.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgH7082.txt,2261,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3354, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,",2017.0,6.0,September
105,topic-id,164,"Mr.Chairman, this bill removes a burden from the Coast It doesn't micromanage any local council. It actually empowers the local council. It doesn't make any changes to stock assessments. You still are subject to the management of the local fisheries. You cannot fish for any more fish than you were previously. So actually, all the logic that was used by my colleague, you could actually very much more easily argue the opposite side.  It should be further noted that my colleague from California, as she speaks about what is the right policy here on the east end of Long Island for our hardworking fishermen, voted in favor of H.3070, which was unanimously passed by the last  So it wouldn't make any sense to be arguing that this bill places a burden on the Coast Guard when it is lifting it, or that it is micromanaging a local council when it empowers it to control the fishery.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-06-pt1-PgH7082.txt,2261,0050,2017.0,6.0,September
106,topic-id,288,"Mr.Chairman, I think it is a great idea to empower the Atlantic Fishery Council by passing this amendment because if we don't pass this amendment, if we don't change the Federal law, they are not empowered. Federal law says you can't fish in the EEZ between Montauk Point and Block Island, Rhode So if we do not pass this legislation, if H.3070 became law in the last Congress, we wouldn't be here right now and the Council would be managing the local fishery. But Federal law prevents the regional management of the fishery. It actually just says, outright, you can't fish for striped bass at all.  So all the arguments that are now being used for the first time against this particular argument, a proposal that was passed unanimously last Congress, which is now being opposed by a colleague from California, to be telling us what the right policy is on the east end of Long Island, saying that we should be managing this fishery is an argument I absolutely agree with, and that is exactly why it is so important to pass this legislation.  My colleague, in opposing this proposal, is actually making the argument of exactly why it needs to pass. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for it.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr.Zeldin).  The amendment was agreed to.
