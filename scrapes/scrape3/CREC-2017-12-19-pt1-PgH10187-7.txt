                ENSURING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR FAMILIES

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, as I travel the Seventh District of 
Michigan, I have met with many hardworking families who are living 
paycheck to paycheck; moms and dads struggling to pay the mortgage, 
make ends meet; many businesses weighed down by a burdensome and 
outdated Tax Code. We developed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with them in 
mind.
  For families across my district, our plan means more jobs, more take-
home pay, and more money in their pockets. At every income level, 
people will see meaningful tax relief.
  On top of that, our plan will help small businesses thrive, boost job 
creation here at home, and make our

economy stronger and more competitive.
  Mr. Speaker, the choice before us today is clear. We can prop up a 
broken Tax Code and maintain the status quo, or we can pass the most 
sweeping tax overhaul in three decades and deliver historic tax relief 
to those who need it most.
  Let's pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and ensure a brighter future for 
the families we represent.
