            By Mr. WILSON of South Carolina:
        H.R. 1030.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, section 8 and requirements outlined in the 
     National Security Act of 1947. Article I, section 8 gives 
     Congress the power ``to . . . provide for the common defense 
     and general welfare of the United States.'' The Necessary and 
     Proper Clause of that section also grants Congress the power 
     ``[t]o make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for 
     carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other 
     Powers vested in this Constitution in the Government of the 
     United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.'' 
     Title I, Sec. 101 of the National Security Act of 1947, 
     requires the National Security Council to ``assess and 
     appraise the objectives, commitments, and risks of the United 
     States in relation to our actual and potential military 
     power, in the interest of national security; for the purpose 
     of making recommendations . . .''
