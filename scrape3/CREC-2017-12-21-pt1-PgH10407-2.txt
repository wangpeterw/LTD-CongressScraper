                        HONORING MR. SAM POLLAK

  (Mr. FASO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FASO. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to 
recognize the distinguished career of Mr. Sam Pollak on the occasion of 
his retirement. Mr. Pollak is retiring after 20 years of dedicated 
service to the Oneonta and Otsego County community as editor of the 
Oneonta Daily Star.
  Having worked for decades in newsrooms throughout the Nation, Mr. 
Pollak brought many years of experience and a proactive leadership to 
The Daily Star.
  I thank Mr. Pollak for his commitment to the people of the State of 
New York, and I wish him and his wife, Julie, every happiness as they 
embark upon this new chapter in life.
