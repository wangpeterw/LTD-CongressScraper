                  PRAY FOR VICTIMS OF STORM IN GEORGIA

  (Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege 
of representing a beautiful part of this country. Many of you have seen 
it on the news lately. Cook County is ground zero for the storms that 
hit this past weekend. We have seven deaths in Cook County, two in 
Berrien, two in Brooks, four in Dougherty--outside of my district--and 
we have four lives lost in Mississippi as well.
  As I speak to you, the Georgia Forestry Commission is searching for 
five who are unaccounted for with cadaver dogs. I would ask that you 
pray for the families who have lost so much, and I would ask that we 
also pray that they find those who are unaccounted for.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to say one thank you as well to the first 
responders, the volunteers, those from other counties who have provided 
mutual aid, and the churches who have opened their doors to take care 
of those who have lost their homes. Thank you.
  And I also want to thank Governor Deal and President Trump, both of 
whom were available yesterday to offer their support and pledge to help 
our communities rebuild.
