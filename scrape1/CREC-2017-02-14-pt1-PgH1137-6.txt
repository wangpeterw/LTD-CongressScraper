                    VOTE AGAINST EXECUTIVE OVERREACH

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, at the 11th hour, the Obama 
administration's Labor Department issued a rule that stonewalled 
bipartisan changes to the unemployment insurance program. These changes 
were made so that tax dollars would be used in a more efficient and 
more effective manner.
  It has been 5 years since Congress passed legislation giving the 
States the discretion on drug-testing policy for unemployment 
applicants. Using delay tactics, the previous administration prevented 
that law from ever being implemented as designed.
  This kind of executive overreach impedes the ability of States to 
ensure that the unemployment insurance program accomplishes its 
intended purpose, and that is to promote reemployment.
  In Texas, we take the job of fiscal responsibility very seriously. 
This week, Congress is responding to that overreach by the previous 
administration. We hope that Congress will take that responsibility 
very seriously. I urge my colleagues to vote against the executive 
overreach and to vote for H.J. Res. 42.
