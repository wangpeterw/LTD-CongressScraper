                         TRIBUTE TO KEITH BOWAR

  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Keith Bowar of 
Gillette, WY, on finishing his fourth term as president of the Wyoming 
Conference of Building Officials Chapter of the International Code 
Council. This is a great milestone, an instant replay memory Mr. Bowar 
will cherish and remember for a long time to come.
  I commend Mr. Bowar for all that he has been able to accomplish over 
the years both in the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials and as a 
building code professional. For 23 years, he has dedicated himself to 
furthering public safety, beginning in 1994 as a building inspector for 
the city of Gillette and advancing to the position of chief building 
official for Campbell County in 2011.
  Mr. Bowar's elevation to president of the Wyoming Conference of 
Building Officials was a recognition by his peers of his dedication and 
effectiveness, and he used the position to improve building and fire 
safety throughout Wyoming. The challenges Mr. Bowar faced and the 
changes that he helped to bring to the world around him reflect the way 
he uses his skills and knowledge to make a difference in so many ways.
  I send my best wishes to Mr. Bower on completing his tenure as 
president of the Wyoming Conference of Building Officials and for his 
service to Wyoming.
  Thank you.
