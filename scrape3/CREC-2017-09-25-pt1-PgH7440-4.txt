    COMMENDING THE MOSER GROUP AND WINGATE UNIVERSITY ON HURRICANE 
                           ASSISTANCE EFFORTS

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of The Moser 
Group and Wingate University for their extraordinary organizational and 
grassroots efforts to help victims of Hurricanes Irma in Florida and 
Harvey in Texas. This week, these two organizations will load two 18-
wheeler trucks to deliver supplies directly to the affected areas.
  Commitment to charity and compassion for victims of national 
disasters is truly what makes America great.
  In North Carolina, we know all too well about the consequences of 
hurricanes: 98,000 homes and 19,000 businesses were destroyed by 
Hurricane Matthew, from which we are still recovering.
  Organizations like The Moser Group and Wingate University are key to 
recovery efforts across the country. They are to be commended. Madam 
Speaker, God bless them as they continue to help people in need.
