                OPPOSE THE EFFORT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE

  (Mr. SWALWELL of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of the 
effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
  Simply, my constituents will be stuck paying more. And if they are 
not losing their coverage, they will know somebody who is going to lose 
their coverage. And if they are over the age of 50 and not on Medicare 
yet, they are going to suffer a very cruel age tax.
  I think not of politics when the President said some are going to pay 
a political price if they don't support this, I think about what they 
are going to pay at the doctor's office.
  John Cameron of Dublin, California, told me that, before the 
Affordable Care Act, he could not get the double hip surgery that he 
needed. Because of it, he was able to get it last week. We need 
hardworking small-business owners like John to keep working and have 
affordable insurance.

  Mr. Speaker, when this President put his name on a casino, he left 
its workers in the dust. When he put his name on a university, he left 
its students out in the cold. And when he puts his name on this 
healthcare plan, TrumpCare, he is going to leave all of us sicker and 
poorer.
