    YUCCA MOUNTAIN NUCLEAR WASTE REPOSITORY IS AN UNWORKABLE PROJECT

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I am here to once again remind my colleagues 
why the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository is an unworkable 
project. There are design flaws that the NRC's own analysis show lead 
to radioactive waste leaking into the water table, and transportation 
plans would ship more than 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste by train 
and truck through 329 congressional districts for years to come past 
your homes, your businesses, your schools, and your churches.
  Now some of my colleagues want to make this bad situation even worse 
by busting the caps on the amount of allowable waste to be stored, 
increasing the danger and invalidating any existing studies.
  If the proponents of Yucca Mountain and their industry donors are 
really serious about solving the problems of nuclear waste storage, 
they would follow the Blue Ribbon Commission's recommendations and pass 
my consent-based bill rather than dumping nuclear waste into a State 
that does not produce it and does not want it.
  Nevada is not a wasteland.
