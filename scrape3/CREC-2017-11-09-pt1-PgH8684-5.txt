                   FOREVER GRATEFUL FOR OUR VETERANS

  (Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we find ourselves in seemingly 
uncertain times: instability in North Korea, terrorism throughout the 
world, and divisiveness on so many fronts. Yet across our Nation, young 
men and women continue to step up to serve when their country needs 
them most. They serve our great Nation willingly, honorably, and 
without bias.
  In the 1940s, when an unprecedented attack on American soil led us 
into the Second World War, our brave men and women in uniform stood up 
to defend our Nation.
  In the 1950s, when our country faced the spread of communism to 
Korea, it was our veterans who were there.
  In the 1960s and 1970s, when the United States was brought into the 
war in Vietnam, knowing there would be no hero's welcome when they came 
home, our men and women were steadfast.

  In the first Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi 
Freedom, and the many missions they have faced in the past two decades, 
our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen have 
defended our great Nation from those who wish to do us harm.
  On this Veterans Day, I submit to our men and women: Your service is 
not over and your mission is not complete. Now, more than ever, your 
country needs you. Stand up. Tell your story. The next generation needs 
to hear from you. We are forever grateful for your service.
