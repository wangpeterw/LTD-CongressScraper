                       TAX CUTS FOR MILLIONAIRES

  (Mr. HASTINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I say good morning to America.
  This is not a health bill that we are readying ourselves to vote on. 
It is a tax bill for wealthy people.
  I just left the Committee on Rules. We started our session there at 7 
this morning. I have in hand a closed rule that will allow for 4 hours 
of debate. Later on this afternoon, the Republicans will accomplish 
what they set out to do.
  The bill provides $274.9 billion in tax cuts for the highest income 
Americans. Over half of the tax cuts in the bill go to millionaires. In 
the year 2020, 61 percent of the cuts go to those earning more than a 
million dollars.
  At the same time, Republicans cut Medicaid by more than $880 billion. 
That is money for poor people that will not have those benefits. 
Republicans cut Medicaid by that amount for working families.
  Donald Trump's people and his Cabinet will do very well.
