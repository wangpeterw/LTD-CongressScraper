                           PUERTO RICO RELIEF

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I received a heartfelt letter 
from a constituent expressing her frustration with the dire crisis in 
Puerto Rico. She described the panic of not being able to reach her 
family on the island. She said: ``It is becoming an island of chaos and 
sadness. I am helpless here in Chula Vista. I cannot contact my family. 
We need Congress to send more relief. We Puerto Ricans are American 
citizens, whether people remember it or not.''

  As we speak, Puerto Rico remains without power, communication lines 
are down, and a major dam could burst. We are proud of how Americans 
came together for Texas and Florida. Let's not abandon Puerto Rico. We 
must act now. We are seeing a major humanitarian crisis unfold on U.S. 
soil.
  Mr. Speaker, is there any reason why U.S. citizens are being ignored 
in these times of desperate need?
  We must help Puerto Rico now.
