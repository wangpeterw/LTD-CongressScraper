                     WELCOMING CHAPLAIN SCOTT FOUST

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
Wittman) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chaplain Scott Foust 
for his opening prayer and message this morning.
  Scott resides in Virginia's First District and serves as an Air Force 
chaplain at Arlington National Cemetery. He has answered the call to 
serve by helping Air Force families lay loved ones to rest at Arlington 
National Cemetery, both through coordinating funeral arrangements and 
providing grief counseling. He served as a pastor for 12 years before 
receiving a direct commission in 2007.
  God calls on us to serve Him in many ways, and I commend Chaplain 
Foust on his service to our Nation, our airmen, and their families. I 
pray for Christ's guidance as the House convenes and we try to do His 
will in serving the American people.
  May God always bless Chaplain Foust and his family as they continue 
to spread Christ's Word and remain a light within the community.
