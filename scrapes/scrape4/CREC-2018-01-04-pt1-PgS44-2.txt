                         TRIBUTE TO KELLY FLYNN

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor 
of recognizing Montana Representative Kelly Flynn of Broadwater County 
for his service to the State of Montana. Kelly is currently serving his 
fourth term in the Montana State Legislature. He continues to serve 
with an unyielding commitment to his constituents and the well-being of 
the State, while also fighting cancer. This past November, Kelly made 
the motion to adjourn the legislative special session, concluding, 
``Cancer may take my body but it will never take my heart and soul.''
  Kelly's heart and soul are Montana through and through. Kelly is a 
rancher and outfitter who serves as chairman of the Montana House of 
Representatives Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Committee. He has also served 
on the Governor's Council for Private Lands and Public Wildlife and the 
Montana Board of Outfitters and is currently serving as a member of the 
Broadwater County Farm Bureau. Montana has benefited greatly from his 
decades of service.
  Kelly has been a friend of mine for years. His work ethic is 
exceptional, and he is the best master of ceremonies in Broadwater 
County. His commitment to others represents the heart and soul of 
Montana.
