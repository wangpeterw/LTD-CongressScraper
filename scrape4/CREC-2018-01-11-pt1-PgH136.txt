            HONORING THE 2018 NORTH CAROLINA MARCH FOR LIFE

  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and encourage the 
thousands of great, noble North Carolinians participating in the 2018 
March for Life this weekend.
  We know from God's Word, the Holy Scriptures, that life begins at 
conception. Unfortunately, since the Supreme Court decision of Roe v. 
Wade, more than 59 million innocent lives have been terminated through 
abortion. That is almost six times the population of North Carolina.
  Without question, it is our moral obligation to fight for and protect 
the lives of those who cannot speak for themselves, the talented and 
able lives of those who are no different than our own.
  Today and every day, I am honored to stand with those who so bravely 
fight to protect the most vulnerable among us. With each passing day, 
we shall continue to advance this very noble cause.

                          ____________________
