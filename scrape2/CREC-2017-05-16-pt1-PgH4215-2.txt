              CONGRATULATIONS TO LADY EAGLES SOFTBALL TEAM

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, it all started 11 years ago: The Lady Eagles 
from Fort Bend Baptist Academy won their first Texas State softball 
title. Years later, the name was changed to Fort Bend Christian 
Academy, but the dynasty had been born. The Lady Eagles won their sixth 
Texas title last week by defeating Dallas Christian School with a score 
of 6-2.
  One word can describe the Lady Eagles' playoff run: domination. In 
the last four games, they scored 37 runs, their opponents only 2. Our 
four seniors--Claire, Lauren, Danielle, and Kendall--have set us up to 
make history: our third straight Texas title in 2018.
  We will honor them as we honor the Lord.
  Congratulations, Eagles.
