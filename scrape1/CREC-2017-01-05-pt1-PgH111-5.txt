                     LET'S GET TO WORK ON OBAMACARE

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the American people gave my party control of 
the entire Congress and the White House because of the promise-
breaking, job-killing bill known as ObamaCare, the craziest thing in 
the whole world, according to President Bill Clinton. On November 8, we 
were ordered to repeal ObamaCare, and that is just what we are going to 
do.
  Fearmongers on the other side are telling Americans they will lose 
their health insurance like that. That will only happen if we follow 
their example and pass a bill that becomes law before we have the time 
to read it. House Republicans will take time to listen to doctors, 
nurses, hospitals, patients, the American people to give them the 
health care they deserve at a lower cost, higher quality with the 
doctor of their choice. We have our orders. It is time to go to work.
