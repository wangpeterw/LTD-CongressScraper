                   RESUSCITATE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to support resuscitating our healthcare system.
  ObamaCare is being crushed under its own weight and the American 
Health Care Act will deliver a better way for health care. One of the 
greatest failures of ObamaCare is that it forces Americans into 
coverage that they do not want and that they cannot afford.
  Our plan, instead, is designed to empower patients to access quality, 
affordable, and patient-centered health care. The American Health Care 
Act will put the free market back into health care, giving Americans 
the freedom of choice. Instead of Washington controlling the decisions 
of patients, we will empower them to make their own choices.
  Americans deserve to have access to quality, affordable, and patient-
centered health care, and this is how we intend to make this a reality. 
Remember, this is the first phase of this mission to rescue our 
country's health care, and I am committed to making sure that it is not 
the last.
  Phase two is underway with administrative actions from our friend, 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. Leader McCarthy 
has begun to lay out additional legislation that we could not include 
in reconciliation. We will waste no time on this and we will begin 
consideration next week.
  The battle does not end with the American Health Care Act, but it is 
a crucial first step to a better tomorrow.
