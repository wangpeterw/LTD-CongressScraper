                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Holy God, who causes wars to cease, bring peace to our Nation and 
world. Let that peace first begin in our hearts.
  Use our lawmakers to bring a spirit of concord instead of chaos to 
our world. May they set aside time each day to be still in Your 
presence. Lord, help them to know that time spent with You is never 
wasted. Permit this daily contact with You to motivate them to exalt 
You in their lives, as You use them to provide examples of how people 
can live if they put their trust completely in You.
  Lord God of Hosts, continue to abide with us in sunshine and shadows. 
And Lord, be especially with the people of Puerto Rico.
  We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.
