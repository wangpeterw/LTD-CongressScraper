                          MADE IN AMERICA WEEK

  (Mr. MITCHELL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the spirit of Made in 
America Week.
  Since taking office in January, I have had the privilege and honor of 
meeting with American workers and small-business owners in my district, 
from manufacturers to the farmers who feed our community and our world.
  Unfortunately, we have seen far too many of our jobs leave this 
country. I am focused on addressing the problems in our economy that 
are destroying jobs and stalling growth.
  We have already made significant progress in reducing the regulatory 
burdens that make it hard for businesses large and small to survive. 
Congress has passed and the President has signed 14 Congressional 
Review Acts overturning excessive and ridiculous regulations. I look 
forward to passing comprehensive tax reform that is simpler and fairer 
for all Americans so individuals can keep more of their paycheck and 
for jobs to stay in America. I will continue to advance solutions to 
help Americans gain skills needed to compete in our changing workforce.
  Mr. Speaker, let's remain focused on keeping jobs in America and 
products made in America.
