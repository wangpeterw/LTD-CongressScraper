                          WAUSAU-AREA TRAGEDY

  (Mr. DUFFY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
recognize the loss of four members of our greater-Wausau community. It 
was last week that four lives were taken from us all too early.
  Karen Barclay was warm and caring to everyone around her. At Marathon 
Savings Bank, she made sure that no child left the bank without a 
lollipop.
  Dianne Look, known as Dee-Dee, celebrated her 25th wedding 
anniversary last month. Dianne loved to make jewelry, raising money for 
the American Cancer Society.
  Sara Quirt-Sann had an infectious laugh. She ran her own law 
practice, and she proudly served as a guardian ad litem for kids in our 
community.
  We also lost Detective Jason Weiland of the Everest Metro Police 
Department, who was killed in the line of duty. Serving 18 years in 
what was described as his dream job, Detective Weiland wore the Everest 
Metro PD uniform because he wanted to protect people and keep his 
community safe.
  On behalf of this institution, I rise to extend my deepest regrets to 
their families, their mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, and 
children, who no longer have a special member in their homes.
