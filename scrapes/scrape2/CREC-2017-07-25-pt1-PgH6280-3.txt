    INVEST BORDER WALL FUNDS IN OTHER PROVEN METHODS TO KEEP US SAFE

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, on Friday we are voting on a crucial funding 
program for armed services. Yet somehow it also includes $1.6 billion 
to begin funding the construction of an unnecessary border wall. 
Without discussion, the funding for the border wall was added.
  This wall won't make us safer, and it won't stop drug smugglers, and 
it will not keep out the bad hombres.
  If we are serious about protecting our borders, then let's invest the 
$1.6 billion in programs that have a proven record of success. Let's 
invest in drug detection canine teams. Let's rebuild our Coast Guard. 
And let's strengthen our partnership with Canadian and Mexican law 
enforcement.
  These are the proven methods that will keep America safe.
