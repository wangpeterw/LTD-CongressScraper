    HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF GENERAL AMEDEO ``ARMIE'' MEROLLA

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory 
of General Amedeo ``Armie'' Merolla--a dedicated patriot, a passionate 
legal mind, a community leader in Rhode Island, and someone whom I was 
proud to call a dear friend.
  Armie's distinguished military career spanned 36 years, during which 
time he served in the United States Marine Corps and the Rhode Island 
National Guard. He served as assistant adjutant general for the State 
and retired as the first brigadier general of Italian heritage in the 
history of the Rhode Island National Guard.
  As an accomplished attorney for more than 60 years, he provided legal 
counsel and advice to several public officials--myself included--and 
maintained a very successful private practice.
  As a tireless community leader, he served as chairman of the Warwick 
School Committee and held leadership positions in local branches of 
charities and children's organizations. Above all, he prioritized his 
family, whom he loved dearly and to whom he devoted his life's work.
  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to remember Armie on the floor today, 
just as it was to consider him a trusted friend and adviser. Mr. 
Speaker, he made a difference, and he will be greatly missed.
