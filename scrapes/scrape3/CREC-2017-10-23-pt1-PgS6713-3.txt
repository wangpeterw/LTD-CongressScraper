                 REMEMBERIG DR. OSCAR PERRY BUTLER, JR.

 Mr. SCOTT. Madam President, today I would like to take a 
moment to recognize and honor the life of a great South Carolinian, Dr. 
Oscar P. Butler, Jr., who departed this life on October 2, 2017. Dr. 
Butler was a graduate of South Carolina State University and later went 
on to earn a doctor of philosophy in administration and higher 
education from Michigan State University. He then spent over 27 years 
in student personnel development, including as a dean at SCSU. He also 
served as executive director of 1890 Research and Extension for over 10 
years. He has been recognized for Outstanding Service by the 
N.A.A.C.P., Meritorious Service and Commendations by the U.S. Navy, and 
given the Distinguished Alumnus Award by SCSU. Dr. Butler was a 
faithful member of Williams Chapel A.M.E. Church for over 57 years, 
where he was the recipient of the Unsung Hero Award 2015. Dr. Butler 
will surely be missed and remembered as a great South Carolinian, and I 
would like to add his name to our October 23, 2017, Congressional 
Record.
