PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL DENY TRANSGENDER PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO SERVE IN THE 
                                MILITARY

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today, Donald Trump announced via 
Twitter, how else, that he is going to reverse the Obama-era decision 
and deny transgender people the right to openly serve in our military.
  I think it is shameful to divide Americans, in the face of their 
service and sacrifice, for his political gain.
  This is not about national security, it is not about saving money, 
and it is not about fabricated claims of disruption. What is disruptive 
is discrimination against an entire class of Americans who are or who 
want to protect and defend America. That is the same argument that was 
used against women in the service, against gays and lesbians.
  We ought to welcome any American who is qualified and willing to 
serve to protect our great country, to protect America and our values, 
even as the President undermines both.
