                CELEBRATING NATIONAL HOMEOWNERSHIP MONTH

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, June is National 
Homeownership Month, and it is a time when we celebrate and recognize 
the many benefits of owning a home.
  For generations of Americans, owning a home has been an essential 
element in achieving the American Dream. But since the Great Recession, 
we have seen homeownership rates drop to historic lows.
  Young families often find themselves unable to save for a downpayment 
or to gain access to adequate credit. This is especially true for those 
in rural areas.
  The United States Department of Agriculture places emphasis on 
helping rural Americans buy homes. USDA provides mortgage loan 
guarantees through partnerships with private sector lenders to help 
low- to moderate-income rural home buyers.
  In 2016 alone, USDA worked with nearly 1,500 lenders to help 116,000 
rural individuals and families buy homes. USDA has helped more than 4.1 
million rural residents buy a home since the National Housing Act was 
passed 68 years ago.
  Mr. Speaker, the benefits of homeownership have widespread benefits. 
Homeownership fortifies communities, creates jobs, and strengthens the 
local businesses that support our towns.
  Thank you to USDA for your commitment to providing affordable housing 
for rural Americans. Happy National Homeownership Month.
