                RECOGNIZING HEALTH AND WELLNESS COACHES

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor America's health and 
wellness coaches. Health and wellness coaches help people change their 
unhealthy lifestyles and manage chronic illnesses.
  Mr. Speaker, I am a diabetic. I also suffer from macular degeneration 
and heart disease. I know firsthand how difficult it is for people to 
change their behaviors and make healthier life choices, but I also know 
that changing behavior can improve overall health and reduce the amount 
of costly medical care people need.
  The American Medical Association recently found that having a health 
and wellness coach involved in a person's wellness journey not only 
increases patient satisfaction and engagement, but also reduces 
physician stress and burnout by freeing up their time.
  Last week, I introduced H. Res. 733 to express support for health and 
wellness coaches and to designate this week as National Health and 
Wellness Coach Recognition Weak.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating our 
Nation's health and wellness coaches.
