                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Skyline Wesleyan Church, San Diego, 
California, offered the following prayer:
  Lord, lift us up, and let us stand, once more by faith on Heaven's 
tableland, to a higher plane than we have ever, ever been before. Lord, 
plant America's feet on higher ground.
  Let not one heart desire to stay where hate arises and terror 
displays. Though some may dwell where this evil abounds, let our 
prayer, our aim, be holy ground.
  O, may we live above that world where Satan's darts forever hurl and 
in one voice make a joyful sound, the song of saints on higher, holy 
ground.
  Let Congress scale the utmost height and catch a gleam of Your glory 
bright. Through trials and tests, we will be found, our feet at last on 
solid ground.
  We are pressing on that upward way, new heights by faith every day. 
And on our way, let it not be lost, the upward way is through Your 
cross.
  Lord Jesus, plant our feet, plant my feet on holy ground.
  In Your name we pray.
  Amen.
