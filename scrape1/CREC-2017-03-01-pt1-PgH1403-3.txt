                          KEEPING OUR PROMISES

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, we have a new era that has dawned on 
American politics. Our citizens are demanding that we don't conduct our 
business as usual.
  These are times that call for bold leadership and bold action. Over 
the last couple of years, my observation is that we don't need new 
solutions. We have reforms for immigration, reforms for regulations, 
reforms for our Tax Code. What we need is courage: courage to act, 
courage to keep our promises, as our President said last night, and 
finish what we started.
  ObamaCare is a disaster, to repeat what the President said. The facts 
are undisputable. This isn't a situation where we have a leaky roof in 
need of repair. We are on faulty foundation, and it is shifting under 
our feet. If we don't act swiftly and decisively, the house will 
collapse.
  Leadership is about courage. Leadership is about keeping our 
promises. We all owe it to the American people to act accordingly.
