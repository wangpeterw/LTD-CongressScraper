                            TAX REFORM BILL

  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, it is a historic day for our country, for 
the Senate, and for the Congress.
  As we speak, the President of the United States is about to sign the 
bill that we passed on the floor of the Senate last night, which was 
the agreement on the conference report--the largest tax reform in the 
history of our country or, certainly, the largest since 1986. It is 
historic in many other ways because we are fighting wars overseas, we 
are dealing with terrorism, and we are looking at the economic climate 
for the future and trying to inspire our country to be better and be 
everything that it can be. We are talking about all of those types of 
things, and we are getting ready for Christmas.
