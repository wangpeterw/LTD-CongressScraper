                  WISHING THE SENATOR FROM HAWAII WELL

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just want to salute, on behalf of all 
of us in the Senate, our great, great Senator from Hawaii. Her courage, 
her strength, her conviction to help people who need help is just 
inspiring--that is the only word I could think of, ``inspiring''--to 
every one of us.
  We love you, Mazie. We wish you well, and we can't wait for you to 
come back and rejoin the fight doubly invigorated.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I extend to my colleague from Hawaii 
every blessing for her successful health treatment. I know the thoughts 
and prayers of every Member of the Senate are with her tomorrow and 
beyond as she undertakes that healing path.
