                             INFRASTRUCTURE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, on one other matter, later today 
President Trump will visit Cincinnati to discuss the importance of our 
Nation's inland waterways. Kentucky is home to over 1,900 miles of 
navigable inland waterways, which, in addition to adding majestic 
beauty to my State, are also vital to thousands of jobs in the 
Commonwealth.
  In recent years, over 95 million tons of cargo and agricultural 
products have been transported across these water trade routes. Our 
many levees, docks, and dams represent crucial infrastructure that play 
an important role in our regional and national economy.
  I am proud of the work Congress has done in the past to protect our 
Nation's waterways, like passing the Water Resources Development Act by 
a bipartisan majority last year in order to support infrastructure, 
enhance commerce, and maintain American ecosystems.
  As President Trump continues to release his plans for our Nation's 
infrastructure, I look forward to working with the administration and 
colleagues in the Senate to protect and improve the many roads, 
bridges, airports, and waterways that serve people and jobs all across 
our country.
