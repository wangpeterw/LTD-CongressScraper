                    THE STATUS QUO IS UNSUSTAINABLE

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, we have seen more troubling signs this week 
that things continue to get worse under the healthcare law.
  Humana announced they are dropping out of the ObamaCare marketplace 
next year. The CEO of Aetna said that ObamaCare is in a ``death 
spiral.''
  Families in Michigan and across the country are left with fewer 
choices and soaring costs. Mari, from Jackson, in my district, is one 
of them. Her premiums nearly quadrupled last year under ObamaCare; and 
this year, her premiums went up so high, she could not afford to pay 
them. So she and her husband, who is self-employed, dropped the plan 
and now are going without any health insurance at all.
  The status quo is simply unsustainable, and we are working to provide 
relief to families who are struggling. This will be an orderly, step-
by-step process as we transition to patient-centered solutions that 
lower costs, increase choices, maintain preexisting conditions 
coverage, and meet the needs of all Americans. That is what Mari and 
every single American deserves.
