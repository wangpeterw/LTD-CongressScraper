                      THE MEDIA BIAS BEAT GOES ON

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the media bias beat goes on.
  Last week on PBS, columnist Mark Shields criticized Senate sponsors 
of the new healthcare bill. He said that no Republican Senators have 
credentials for working on healthcare, and added that Senator Cassidy 
got to the Senate a year ago and is not exactly a long-term legislator.
  In two clicks online, Mark Shields could have learned that Bill 
Cassidy and his wife are both doctors who have provided healthcare for 
people around the world. Those are called credentials. Senator Cassidy 
also served in the State senate, three terms in the U.S. House, and is 
now in his third year in the United States Senate. He is obviously an 
experienced legislator.
  Where is the balance? Where is the truth? And the liberal national 
media wonder why their credibility with the American people is at a 
record low.
