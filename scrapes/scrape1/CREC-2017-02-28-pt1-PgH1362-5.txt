                   RARE DISEASE WEEK ON CAPITOL HILL

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week marks Rare 
Disease Week on the Hill. Many Members of this House will meet with 
patients, caregivers, physicians, family members, and advocates from 
across the country about how their lives are impacted by disease.
  The National Institutes of Health considers a disease rare if it 
affects fewer than 200,000 people across the United States. Many times 
the disease is accompanied by uncommon or mismatched symptoms that make 
diagnosing the illness difficult, and many times such illnesses are 
without a cure.
  Mr. Speaker, before I came to Congress, I was a healthcare 
professional, and I have seen firsthand how devastating a disease or 
injury can be to an individual and to families.
  I welcome the rare disease community to Washington this week, and I 
look forward to meeting with Representatives from the Fifth District of 
Pennsylvania, including Tom Weiser, James and Jean Rickard from 
Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.
  Education can help shape healthcare policy, Mr. Speaker, to better 
meet the needs of the rare disease community, and I am pleased to be a 
part of that conversation.
