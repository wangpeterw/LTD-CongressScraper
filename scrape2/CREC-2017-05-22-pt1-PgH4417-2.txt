                         NATIONAL MARITIME DAY

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National 
Maritime Day.
  Since America's founding, our men and women who serve as mariners 
have dedicated themselves to protecting our economy and our interests 
at home and abroad. Whether it be through ensuring the delivery of 
goods, supporting us during times of peace, or standing up during times 
of war, the maritime industry has held strong.
  The Port of Los Angeles, which I am proud to represent, has made 
countless contributions not only to California but to every other 
congressional district.
  As a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I work to ensure 
the safety and security of the Port of Los Angeles so that it can 
continue to serve as America's port. Along with the Port of Long Beach, 
the ports employ twice as many men and women as the Hollywood 
entertainment industry.
  Today, I am proud to honor those men and women who serve and have 
served as U.S. merchant mariners. I ask that we continue to support the 
maritime industry today, and every day.
