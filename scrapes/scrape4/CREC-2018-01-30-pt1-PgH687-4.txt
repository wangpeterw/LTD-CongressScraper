                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  We give You thanks, O God, for giving us another day.
  As You make available to Your people the grace and knowledge to meet 
the needs of the day, we pray that Your spirit will be upon the Members 
of this people's House, giving them the richness of Your wisdom.
  Bless the Members of the majority party as they prepare and gather 
these next days. May they, with those who accompany them, travel safely 
and meet in peace.
  Bless also the minority party as they prepare for their own 
gathering. May these days be filled with hopeful anticipation.
  Bless also the President as he visits the people's House to address 
the Nation this evening.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
