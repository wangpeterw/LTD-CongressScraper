                            KOREAN PENINSULA

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise to speak on the 
vital goal of seeing the Korean Peninsula and its people peacefully 
reunited under a commitment to the values of human rights, freedom, and 
democracy.
  For nearly three-quarters of a century, the Korean people have been 
divided by armed conflict and political boundaries. Yet, despite this 
adversity, the fundamental unity and shared heritage of the Korean 
people continue to endure.
  I am, therefore, heartened by the potential of May's talks between 
the United States, the Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of 
Korea. While the road to peaceful reunification is a long one, next 
month's talks are an essential first step toward the reunification and 
the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I commend

both the American and South Korean Governments for embarking on this 
first step.
  I also want to recognize all those who have dedicated themselves to 
the cause of reunification, including the wonderful Korean-American 
people of my district and the Chicago area, as well as the National 
Unification Advisory Council and its Chicago chapter. The work of these 
dedicated advocates and others has brought new hope to all who would 
see Korea peacefully reunited.
