                         WOMEN'S HEALTH ATTACKS

  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the age of coat hanger medicine 
has returned.
  It may be a new year, a new Congress, a new administration, but 
Republicans are taking us back to a dangerous past, one where women 
were maimed and killed by back-alley abortions.
  Today, our new President signed an executive order restricting safe 
abortions for women around the world. And tomorrow, Republicans will 
vote to block American women from access to full reproductive care.
  Our government is about to enter our bedrooms and take the lives and 
liberty of our women and our families.
  With every breath, we must fight back.
