                          WAYZATA GIRLS CHAMPS

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Wayzata 
High School girls synchronized swimming team, who recently won the 
Minnesota High School State Championship.
  The Trojans triumphed at the State meet last month, where the 
undefeated team earned the championship title for the 11th consecutive 
year. They faced tough competition, but Wayzata's excellent figure 
scores put them over the edge to secure the win.
  This talented team of dedicated girls, led by Head Coach Hensel, 
worked hard all season, winning each of their meets by at least 11 
points. That commitment didn't stop at the pool. It is also in the 
classroom, where each of these students excelled as well.
  Mr. Speaker, congratulations to all the members, athletes, students, 
teachers, coaches, families, and fans of the Wayzata High School girls 
synchronized swimming team on their outstanding performance this 
season.
