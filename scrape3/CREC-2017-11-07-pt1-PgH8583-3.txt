                                VETERANS

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week we honor 
America's veterans, a group of men and women with unparalleled courage 
and love of country.
  We owe our veterans an eternal debt of gratitude. We made a promise 
to look out for them in exchange for their promise to defend our 
freedom, but gratitude is not enough. That is why I am fighting to 
maximize the care homeless veterans receive with my bill to improve 
reporting from our VA hospitals, to make sure no veteran, at any stage 
in life, falls through the cracks.
  I also helped introduce the Patriot Employer Act, which would give 
tax incentives to American businessowners who employ veterans.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, 
I would like to thank all of our Nation's veterans for their service on 
this Veterans Day and every day.
