                          SMALL BUSINESS WEEK

  (Mr. PERRY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the first week in May as 
Small Business Week in the United States and to applaud the 
contributions of the 1 million small-business owners from across the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
  The entrepreneurs at the helm of these businesses take on great risk. 
As a former small-business owner myself, I fully understand that risk 
as well as the colossal responsibility associated with signing the 
front side of a paycheck.
  Small business is the backbone of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
employing millions of people, roughly half of the private sector 
workforce in our Commonwealth. Their success is our success. We thank 
them for all they do to drive innovation forward and create and sustain 
careers of tomorrow.
