                        PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BUDGET

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, a budget reflects one's values. President 
Trump's budget shows he values polluters and profits over people.
  With the ink barely dry on the Republican tax scam, Trump's budget 
proposes we pay for their corporate giveaway by gutting public health 
and environmental programs.
  One of the budget's largest targets is the EPA, which will suffer a 
25 percent cut. This means cuts to grants that help States like 
California implement the Clean Air and Clean Water Act. That means cuts 
to Superfund programs that clean up sites where toxic chemicals from 
factories and landfills were dumped for decades, polluting the 
surrounding soil, water, and air.
  We simply cannot afford a dirty budget that prioritizes polluters and 
profits over people.
