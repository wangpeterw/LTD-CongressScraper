                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, we sing of Your steadfast love and proclaim 
Your faithfulness to all generations.
  Today, strengthen our Senators to walk in the light of Your 
countenance. Abide with them so that Your wisdom will influence each 
decision they make. Lead them around the pitfalls that bring ruin, as 
You empower them to glorify You in all they think, say, and do. May the 
words of their mouths and the meditations of their hearts be acceptable 
to You. Lord, purge our lawmakers of self and fill them with Your peace 
and poise.
  We pray in Your wonderful Name. Amen.
