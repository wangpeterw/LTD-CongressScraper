                 MAIN STREET CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2017

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 217, S. 770.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 770) to require the Director of the National 
     Institute of Standards and Technology to disseminate 
     resources to help reduce small business cybersecurity risks, 
     and for other purposes.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, 
which had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the following:

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Making Available Information 
     Now to Strengthen Trust and Resilience and Enhance Enterprise 
     Technology Cybersecurity Act of 2017'' or the ``MAIN STREET 
     Cybersecurity Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) Small businesses play a vital role in the economy of 
     the United States, accounting for 54 percent of all United 
     States sales and 55 percent of jobs in the United States.
       (2) Attacks targeting small and medium businesses account 
     for a high percentage of cyberattacks in the United States. 
     Sixty percent of small businesses that suffer a cyberattack 
     are out of business within 6 months, according to the 
     National Cyber Security Alliance.
       (3) The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (15 U.S.C. 
     7421 et seq.) calls on the National Institute of Standards 
     and Technology to facilitate and support a voluntary public-
     private partnership to reduce cybersecurity risks to critical 
     infrastructure. Such a partnership continues to play a key 
     role in improving the cyber resilience of the United States 
     and making cyberspace safer.
       (4) There is a need to develop simplified resources that 
     are consistent with the partnership described in paragraph 
     (3) that improves its use by small businesses.
