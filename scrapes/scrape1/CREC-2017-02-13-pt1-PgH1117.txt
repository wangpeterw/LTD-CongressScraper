       CELEBRATING THE 60TH BIRTHDAY OF OVERSEER ELVIS L. BOWMAN

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 60th birthday 
of my good friend, overseer Elvis L. Bowman, the senior pastor of the 
Greater Mt. Tabor Christian Center in my hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.
  Pastor Bowman was born February 23, 1957, and became a lifelong 
member of Greater Mt. Tabor Christian Center and their congregation; 
and the church was founded by his father, E.L. Bowman.
  Pastor Bowman graduated from the University of Texas in Arlington 
with a bachelor's degree in business and a minor in music. He has since 
used his education to serve the congregation in so many wonderful ways.
  An accomplished musician, Pastor Bowman served as a staff musician 
under his father before being appointed minister of music in 1974. He 
then served as the Church business manager before he was appointed 
pastor in 2002. He was later elevated to full gospel district overseer 
of Tarrant County in 2008.
  Pastor Bowman, I wish you happy birthday, my friend, on your 60th 
birthday. I wish you nothing but health and happiness. Please enjoy 
your special day.
