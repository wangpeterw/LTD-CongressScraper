        BIDDING FAREWELL TO GOVERNOR BRENDAN BYRNE OF NEW JERSEY

  (Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, last week, New Jersey said its 
final good-bye to a tireless advocate, dedicated leader, and wonderful 
man who just happened to also have been our Governor. Brendan Byrne, 
our two-term Governor, never let the weight of his office bog him down. 
He will be remembered for his wit, his passion, and the force of his 
will.
  Governor Byrne helped inspire and instill honorable characteristics 
of public service into generations of New Jerseyans. I consider myself 
blessed to be among them.
  It is a bittersweet moment to bid farewell to Governor Byrne. I will 
long keep Ruthie and Tom and the entire Byrne family in my thoughts and 
in my prayers as their loved ones and, indeed, New Jersey has suffered 
a tremendous loss.
