                                 ______
                                 

                          TRIBUTE TO BILL GALT

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the honor of 
recognizing a hard-working Montana rancher for his contributions to the 
community in Meagher County. Bill Galt is a third-generation Montana 
rancher; he has been ranching all his life. His dedication to White 
Sulphur and the surrounding community, however, extends far beyond his 
work in agriculture.
  Bill has rescued numerous folks from plane crashes and accidents on 
the Smith River as part of his volunteer search and rescue work. He has 
served on the White Sulphur Springs Airport Board, the Meagher County 
DUI Task Force, the Conservation District Board, and the Mountainview 
Medical Center Foundation, just to name a few.
  Bill has been a volunteer firefighter and has volunteered with 
organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club and 4H. I would be remiss 
to not include his service in the U.S. Army Military Police Corps 
during Vietnam as well.
  Bill is humble and civic-minded in all he does, and his service to 
Meagher has not gone unnoticed.
  Thank you, Bill, for exemplifying what it means to be an active 
member of a Montana community.
