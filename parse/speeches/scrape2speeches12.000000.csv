3822,topic-id,1469,"Madam President, President Trump has been in office for just a little over 6 months. We had an election. The American people said they preferred the Republican vision for the direction this country should go, but it just seems today the Democrats in the Senate think the inauguration never happened.  For more than 6 months, Democrats have engaged in a historic effort to obstruct the work of the Trump administration and the U.Normally, on inauguration day, the President gets a substantial number of people confirmed to his The idea is to let the President get his team in place so then they can go about hitting the ground running.  President Obama had six of his Cabinet Secretaries confirmed on Inauguration Day in 2009. All of them were confirmed by voice vote. They didn't even have to do a rollcall. People agreed, in a bipartisan way, to let the President have his nominees. Republicans in the Senate did nothing to try to block any of those Cabinet Secretaries for President We understood it is best to give the new President a chance and for all of us to work together when we can. President George Bush had seven people nominated and confirmed on his first day in office. That is the way it usually worked but not anymore.  Now, Democrats aren't interested in giving a Republican President a chance. They weren't interested in working together. Last January, President Trump only had two people confirmed to his Cabinet on inauguration[[Page S4639]]day. There were two people ready to get to work on the day he took office, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland These were the only two jobs the Democrats let the President fill. By the end of January in 2009, President Obama had 10 of his Cabinet Secretaries in place. His Cabinet was almost entirely set by the end of the month that he took office, January 2009, but because of ongoing obstruction by Democrats in the Senate, President Trump still only had three Cabinet Secretaries in their jobs by the end of That is an incredible level of obstruction when you compare it to what has happened historically.  It didn't stop with members of the Cabinet, and it didn't just end in Democrats have continued to make the Senate jump through procedural hoops. In President Obama's first 6 months of office, 206 people were confirmed to serve in his administration. In President Trump's first 6 months, Democrats continued to block the way, allowing us to approve only 55 nominees for those first 6 months. So President Obama had nearly four confirmations for every one of President Trump's over the same period of time. The difference is stark and the reason is simple: Democrats have been putting up roadblocks, one after another, on even the most noncontroversial of nominees. It is not how things worked in the past in previous administrations. Many of these nominees for important jobs would get approved by what we call in the Senate unanimous consent or by a voice vote.  Republicans have been willing to let a lot of Democrats take their jobs without wasting time on rollcall votes and running out the clock. In President Obama's first 6 months in office, Republicans allowed 182 of his nominees to be confirmed by unanimous consent or voice vote. That is almost 90 percent of the jobs filled in those first 6 months by unanimous consent--general agreement--but in the same time, the Democrats only allowed five of President Trump's nominees to get through without a rollcall vote. That is the level of Democratic obstructionism.  They have been blocking judges, Cabinet Secretaries, and other high-ranking officials. Many of these nominees even had Democratic support. It is interesting. Democrats have supported many of these so they weren't controversial at all. Democrats in the Senate forced us to file cloture 34 times on people nominated to fill important jobs in the U.We had to force the Democrats to act.  In President Obama's first 6 months, there were only eight cloture votes. There is no way Democrats can argue that they had principled objections to these 34 nominees where we had to file cloture on their nominations. The only explanation is that they did not want the President to have his team in place. When you take a look at these 34 people whom we had to go ahead and file cloture on, half of them ended up getting 60 or more votes for their confirmation so they had support by Democrats as well as the There was no reason--no need to slow them down other than obstruction of the One nominee whom we had to file cloture on and go all the way through the process even received a unanimous confirmation vote--a rollcall vote in the U.Senate--100 to 0. Yet the Democratic leader made us file a motion to proceed and get a cloture vote on this individual whom then they approved 100 to 0.  Why the need to go through this? Democrats blocked him as long as they could. Yet not a single Democrat then stood to vote against him when his name was called for a rollcall vote. So why are Democrats blocking votes on people whom they then intend to support and do support with their votes? They are just trying to slow things down. The Democratic leader actually admitted that was his plan during the debate over confirming the 2 person at the It is someone whom the Senate actually confirmed with 92 votes in his favor. Yet they slowed him down. Then he received 92 votes.  Republicans wanted to speed up the process a little. Senator Schumer objected. Did he have a problem with the nominee's qualifications? The Democratic leader said on the floor: ``We would be happy to consider the nominee in regular order, and maybe once things change a little bit in healthcare, we can.''  It had nothing to do with the person who was nominated, nothing to do with anything, according to Senator Schumer, other than the fact that we were discussing healthcare in this country. It had nothing to do with the importance of the position that was going to be filled in the It was all because Democrats were trying to stall the debate over healthcare reform. There are the numbers: nominees confirmed in the first 6 months for Obama, 206; President Trump, 25.  Republicans are trying to keep the Federal Government functioning by filling these jobs that had been empty. Healthcare is a very separate thing. Both of these are important. The only thing they have in common is the Democrats have been playing politics with both of them. It is not normal. It is not acceptable. The Democrats' blockade against President Trump's nominees has caused what I believe has been a dangerous backlog. We still have 84 people who have been nominated by the President for positions in the government who have cleared the committees and are now just waiting for a vote on the Senate floor--slowed down by Democratic obstruction.  Democrats are trying their best to drag this out, it seems to me, as long as they possibly can. The Senate rules say that means up to 30 hours of debate once we vote to move forward on a nomination. Maybe that is too long. Senator Ron Johnson wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post over the weekend with the headline: ``Let's break this Senate logjam.'' He suggests we cut the time back from 30 hours of debate to 2 hours of debate. That would certainly speed things up, and maybe that is the step we are going to have to take if this level of obstruction continues.  Whatever we do, we cannot allow this logjam to continue. These are important jobs--important positions. The American people deserve to have someone doing their work.  Last Friday, after the healthcare vote, Senator Schumer called for us to work together. He said: ``There are things we can do rather quickly, including moving a whole lot of nominations.'' I am going to hold the Democratic leader to his word on this. Let him show that he meant what he said. We should be able to clear the decks of these 84 nominees who have come through the Senate committee, who have been approved by the committee and are waiting here to be confirmed. We should do it by unanimous consent. If Democrats object to one or two of them, let's have a rollcall vote so we can get it on the record. It is time to stop this mindless obstruction that serves no purpose except to delay.  Thank you, Madam  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  (",CREC-2017-08-01-pt1-PgS4635-2.txt,1881,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,1.0,July

3454,topic-id,2076,"Mr.President, I thank my colleagues from New Mexico, my neighbors, for being here.  I thank the Presiding Officer for his statement. As usual, he is pointing the Senate in a direction that we should be headed.  Whether people in my State support the Affordable Care Act or whether they don't, they are dissatisfied with the way our healthcare system works. The Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare or whatever you want to call it--is just part of our healthcare system. We have We have We have hospitals. We have doctors. We have nurses. It all adds up, in America in the 21st century, to a system that is really hard on people and makes it very hard for them to predict their future. It creates situations where they have to make choices that no other people in the industrialized world have to make, about raising their family, about staying in a job--as the Presiding Officer was talking about--that they might not want to stay in for fear they would lose their health insurance.  I thought the Presiding Officer made an excellent point when he said that you don't lose your car insurance when you leave your place of business for another job. Why should you lose your health insurance? Why should you? Why should you have to put up with things in this country that nobody else in the industrialized world has to put up with?  It may be that the debate we are going to have is as binary as the Presiding Officer was saying. Maybe it is a debate about single payer versus what he described as more consumer based. Maybe there is something in between. America has a way of trying to figure those kinds of things out--or at least we have historically.  My colleague from Oregon earlier quoted the famous line, which somebody yelled out to Ben Franklin: What kind of government are you creating, a monarchy or republic? That was the question.  His answer was, as the Senator of Oregon said: ``A republic, if you can keep it''--if you can keep it.  The Founders had extraordinary vision, and they were creating something that had never existed before in the history of humankind--never existed. You could make an argument about a couple of small principalities or places in Switzerland, and there would be some argument about ancient Rome, but, really, this exercise in self-government had sprung from their imagination and their desire as human beings to govern themselves, to slough off the monarchy that ruled them and ruled others in  What Ben Franklin said was so important and so wise because he didn't say: ``A republic.'' He said: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''  When they wrote the Constitution, they were creating a mechanism for the American people to resolve their disputes. They were not creating a republic where they believed that everyone would agree with each other. They had vast disagreements. They had disagreements far greater than the ones we have. They had geographic disagreements. They had disagreements about big States and little They had disagreements about slavery.  They were able to come together and create a mechanism to resolve our differences. They didn't believe, as some people seem to on talk radio every day, that if you don't agree with the other person that you must be a Communist or you must be some rightwinger. That is not what they believed.  They believed there was a public purpose, that there was public virtue that underlay the work they were trying to do and that we would be able to persist in this Republic only if we kept it--if we kept it.  That is how self-government works. It is not a king telling you what to do. It is not the generation of the Founders telling you what to do. It is doing what you need to do, as the Presiding Officer said, for the sake of people who did their jobs before us but, more importantly, as he said, for the people who are coming after us. Seeing from this perspective, this process is a disgrace. This is why we have a 9-percent approval rating in the U.Senate--what has been referred to in past generations as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Those words are spoken mockingly today.  The people I represent, and the people the Presiding Officer represents, are paying a price for this. It has been a long time since I have been in the majority--I am sad to say, but it is true--but there was a time when I would preside, as the Presiding Officer is doing today. A reporter asked me once: What do you think about when you are up there? As John McCain said the other day: We aren't doing anything here. He is right. We are not.  So the reporter said: What are you thinking about?  Do you know what I told him? I said: What I think about is, What is China doing right now, while Democrats and Republicans here had their fight that has nothing to do with the people whom we represent?  We know what China is doing right now. While we don't even have the decency to maintain the assets and infrastructure, the roads and bridges that our parents and grandparents had the decency to build for us--starting on this floor--they are building trains, not just in China but all over Asia, to bind them together in an economic union to come after the United What is China doing?  What I deeply regret about this debate is that the end product, whether we pass this bill or if we don't, is not going to improve healthcare for the people I represent. Again, my starting point is that there are people who like the Affordable Care Act and there are people who don't like the Affordable Care Act, but everybody is deeply dissatisfied, as they should be, with the way our healthcare system works. What we should do is abandon this process and, instead, go to committee. Chairman Alexander--he is a Republican--is perfectly capable of running a bipartisan process that could lead us to a place where we actually are making things better for people who live on the Eastern Plains of Colorado, on the Front Range of Colorado, or on the Western Slope of Colorado, who may be Republicans and Democrats, but for whom healthcare is not political. It is about their family and about their future. That is what we should be keeping in mind, instead of just the next election around here. Everybody has lamented that.  I am running out of time, but I remember when the majority leader was not the majority leader. He is a smart person. He came here and said: ``Major legislation is now routinely drafted, not in committee, but in the Majority Leader's conference room and then dropped on the floor with little or no opportunity for members to participate in the amendment process, virtually guaranteeing a fight.''[[Page S4367]]  That is what he said. I am telling those of you with whom I was in townhall meetings 7 years ago, when people were saying: Read the bill, read the bill. The tea party was at the height, bringing pocket Constitutions to my meetings, telling me to be faithful to that process. I say that we should be saying that right now: Be faithful to that constitutional process.  He knew the process wasn't working as it should. What he said was this:       When Democrats couldn't convince any of us--  That is, Republicans--       that [the Affordable Care Act] was worth supporting as      written, they decided to do it on their own and pass it on a      party line vote.  He continued:       It may very well have been the case that on ObamaCare, the      will of the country was not to pass the bill at all. That's      what I would have concluded if Republicans couldn't get a      single Democrat vote for legislation of this magnitude, I'd      have thought, maybe this isn't a great idea.  So I say to the Republicans and Democrats who are here today, maybe it isn't a great idea because they can't even get the Republican votes. They haven't gotten one Democratic vote. They haven't gotten the Republican votes to repeal and replace, even though they have run on this for 8 years. They had to bring the Vice President here to cast the deciding vote because we were tied. What a shame for the Senate not to do its work and to rely on the executive branch to come here and supply that vote.  Every single person in this body knows the President of the United States has no idea or interest in what is in this legislation. Every single person here knows that. So why are we doing it? We are doing it, I guess, to fulfill a campaign promise to repeal I can understand why there is pressure for people to do that, because they said that over and over, even though I disagree with their characterization of the bill.  I disagree with the facts they presented. I understand that impulse, but I don't understand the impulse of writing a bill in secret--listen to this folks--not having a single committee hearing--not one committee hearing in the Talk about ``read the bill.'' How about having a bill that is written down on paper so we can read it? Where are my brethren in the tea party who wanted to read the other bill? There was a bill then. There had been a bill for a year and a half.  There is no bill. There is no bill because what they are trying to do is to figure out what they can eke out across the line here. They are calling it a skinny repeal. I don't even know how that satisfies the laugh test, when it comes to the campaign promises that were made around here, but that is not my issue. But we should just stop. We are at 9 percent. This bill, I think, the last time I checked, had a 15-percent approval rating or a 20-percent approval rating. Don't pass that. We have wasted 6 months--not of our time but of the American people's time. I have people all over the State of Colorado who would love to come here and testify at a committee hearing about how healthcare is intersecting with their lives and making their lives difficult or how they are benefiting from certain things. I would love for them to have a chance to come here and testify, but we haven't set up that process. We should. We should stop this.  The American people would be relieved if we would stop this partisanship to get together and work on the committee as we should do and pass something on the floor. What we have forgotten about the Affordable Care Act--even though it didn't have Republican votes, and it should have--is that it had almost 200 Republican amendments adopted as part of the process. I agree with what the majority leader said then. If the process is lousy, the outcome of the bill is likely to be lousy. An important point he made is that it is unlikely to reflect the will of the American people, and when it doesn't, what it is going to mean is that we are just going to continue to seesaw from one election to the next election and we are not going to get a result.  I am willing to settle for 80 percent of what I want, or 70 percent of what I want--I am. I don't think that is an unvirtuous position to have. All these people here are talking all the time about the principle they are standing on. When you scratch at that and look for the content of the idea underneath that principle, there is very seldom anything there. They are often repeating something they heard last night on FOX or MSNBC, but it wouldn't be recognizable to the Founders as a principle. For them, a fundamental principle was that you had to unleash the imagination of people with different sets of experiences and different sets of opinions and from different geographic places in order to do the right thing for this country. That is what we should do today.  I realize the indulgence of the Presiding I thank him for his kindness.  With that, I yield the floor.

3547,topic-id,286,"Thank you, Mr.I appreciate so much my colleagues being out here on the floor.

I wish there were folks on the other side of the aisle who were out here tonight having this debate. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the point she made.  I want to state that I am really discouraged about where we are in our political system right now, and part of that is because politicians seem to think they can say one thing when they are running for office and do another thing when they get here and that somehow there is not a consequence.  I guess one of the reasons people think there is no consequence is that we have begun to treat edited content--journalism--as though somehow it is inferior to somebody just shooting their mouth off on the internet. We hear the President verbally assaulting journalists who have covered terrorism and who have tried to bring the story in Syria to the United Some have lost their lives. The President says they are not covering terrorism; then he attacks them as fake news. He goes to places like Youngstown and gets people to attack CNN or the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal--anything that is actually edited content.  I think it is because he thinks, A, he will not withstand the scrutiny of real journalists, but I think, B, he thinks it will help with this anything-goes style of politics, which says you can say one thing in the election and do something else.

3550,topic-id,826,"Mr.President, I just don't think this Republic will work very well if we don't have a free press that is respected and if we don't hold people accountable for their campaign promises.  Here is one of the things Donald Trump said during the campaign about what he was going to produce for the American people with respect to healthcare. He said that it was going to be beautiful, terrific--a beautiful and terrific plan to provide such great healthcare at a tiny fraction of the cost, and it is going to be so easy.  That is what he said, in rally after rally across the United States of America, and a lot of people believed it. He talked about how much he hated the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, whatever you want to call it, and all the reasons why; many of the reasons he talked about were manufactured.  But that doesn't really matter anymore. He is the The Republicans are in the majority of the Senate, and the Republicans have a majority of the Their characterization--or mischaracterization--of the Affordable Care Act is not the issue anymore; the issue is what are they going to do for people living in the State of Colorado who are dealing with a healthcare system that is not supporting them terribly well. My colleagues heard that right. People who support the Affordable Care Act or oppose it, in my State, are deeply discouraged about the way our healthcare system works. And I think that if the President were keeping his promise, we would see 100 people support the bill because it is actually consistent with what people at home want. They want more transparency when it comes to healthcare. They want more affordability. They want more predictability. That is what they want.  If I set out to write a bill less responsive to that aspiration of the people I represent, who are critics of the Affordable Care Act--Republicans in my State--I couldn't write a bill less responsive than the one the House of Representatives has passed and the one that was introduced by the majority leader after he wrote it in secret.  It is 8:20 on the night we are going to have this vote, and we haven't seen the bill. After a year and a half of almost countless committee hearings, after adopting almost 200 Republican amendments on the Affordable Care Act, and then going to townhall after townhall, being accused of being a Bolshevik who hadn't read the bill, my question is, Why aren't people being held to that standard tonight? Maybe they are not asking us to read the bill because there is no bill at 8:20 on the night that we are supposed to take away 16 million Americans' healthcare, or 20 million Americans' healthcare--on the night we are supposed to vote for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office says will jack up insurance rates by 20 percent.  They wrote the bill in secret. They didn't have a single hearing in the Senate--not one hearing in the Now it is 8:20 at night, and there are people in my State who think they are going to lose their health insurance because they might be one of those 16 million people or they might have a kid or a parent who has a preexisting condition, like the thousands of people who have contacted my office. They are terrified, and they are not even on the floor, and they can't read the bill. Read the bill.  Now we are told there is going to be a procedural trick that is going to allow the House of Representatives to just pass this through over the weekend.  That is a shameful way to run the It is exactly the opposite of what the majority leader promised he would do when he was the minority leader in the He is the one who said: If you can't get a vote from the other side--if you can't get one vote from the other side--you maybe should acknowledge that the American people aren't behind your bill.  They can't even get all of the Republicans to vote for this. They had to have Mike Pence, who is the Vice President, come here to break a tie. What a disgrace to ask the executive branch to come here and save your bacon because you can't get the votes. And there is not a Democratic vote for this bill tonight because it doesn't meet the test that the minority leader himself had.  I see my colleague from Michigan is here. I will yield the floor by just saying that we should stop this catastrophe. The only thing we know about this catastrophe is if it passes, there will be 16 million people who lose their health insurance and a bunch of rates go up. If we don't do it, that will not happen.

3543,topic-id,491,"Mr.President, we are here at a historic moment, and we listened to a historic speech just within the last 48 hours from our colleague, Senator John All of us welcomed him back and were inspired and overjoyed by his return and then by his speech asking that we go back to the regular order, that we have committee consideration of a bill, with hearings and markup and the democratic process really working.  What threatens us tonight is the democratic process being brought to new lows.  If this bill is passed with the assurance that it won't go to conference--and there are conservatives, and I could quote them.  Senator Lindsey Graham said earlier today:       There's increasing concern on my part and others that what      the House will do is take whatever we pass--the so called      ``skinny bill''--not take it to conference, go directly to      the House floor, vote on it, and that goes to the President's      desk with the argument, ``This is better than doing      nothing.'' Here's my response. The ``skinny bill'' as policy      is a disaster. The ``skinny bill'' as a replacement for      Obamacare is a fraud. The ``skinny bill'' is a vehicle to get      in conference to find a replacement. It is not a replacement      in and of itself. The policy is terrible because you      eliminate the individual and employer mandate which we all      want eliminated but we actually want to have an overall      solution to the problem of Obamacare, so you're going to have      increased premiums and most of Obamacare stays in place if      the ``skinny bill'' becomes law. Not only do we not replace      Obamacare, we politically own the collapse of healthcare. I'd      rather get out of the way and let it collapse than have a      half-assed approach where it is now our problem.  Senator John McCain said earlier today:       I'm not supportive of the legislation as it stands today. I      am in close consultation with Arizona governor over the so-     called ``skinny repeal.''  Senator Ron Johnson said earlier today:       Virtually nothing we're doing in these bills and the      proposal are addressing the problems and challenges and the      damage done to people.  We will see, in effect, a betrayal of our trust, and I say that very seriously.  I hope this body will keep faith with our democracy and make sure that a bill that is regarded as a bad bill--and rightly so because it will eliminate insurance for 16 million people, it will raise premiums by 20 percent in less than a year, it will drive up costs, and it will bring down the number of people who are insured by catastrophic numbers. We owe it to the American people to vote against this so-called skinny bill, which is really a sham repeal. It is a skeletal version of TrumpCare 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0. We can do that.

3531,topic-id,1368,"Mr.President, we are talking today, obviously, as we move into the final hours of this debate, about the two mandates in the original Affordable Care Act, the individual mandate and the employee mandate--certainly, the individual mandate but both of these mandates.  First, I want to talk about the individual mandate. It was unprecedented in Federal law. The idea that the Federal Government could tell somebody they had to buy a product, tell them what that product had to look like, and have very little input on the price or competition is just something the Federal Government had never done before. They didn't just set guidelines, they didn't even just set subsidies but actually a requirement to buy a product or pay a penalty.  Now, when this case got to the Supreme Court, the government was still arguing it was a penalty and there was nothing wrong with that penalty, until apparently they figured out the Court wanted to look at this as a tax because a penalty wouldn't have been constitutional.  Now, we all know this is a penalty. The Supreme Court can call it a tax, the Obama lawyers could at that moment decide, well, even though we set up the law as a penalty, we really think it must be a tax, and that 5-to-4 decision decided that because it was a tax, not a penalty, that part of the law was upheld.  Nobody ever thought this was a tax before that day, nobody has ever seriously thought it was a tax after that day. It was a penalty you pay if you decide you don't want to do something the Federal Government tells you that you have to do.  There is no constitutional basis that gives the government the authority to make that kind of decision, and families and individuals have been hurt by that decision.  There is only one place to go on the individual market, the exchange. Remember that? We have almost forgotten the total disaster of the exchange. States tried to operate exchanges, almost none of them worked. States spent millions and tens of millions, and I think a time or two maybe even more than that to put an exchange together. It didn't work. That part of the law didn't work so you wind up mostly with one big exchange. Even with one big exchange, you have to think about whether the policies available in the county you live in--most of the debate over the past several years, a lot of the debate has been we ought to expand the marketplace, we ought to buy across State lines, we should have more choices and more places to go. Somehow we managed to define in this law, the law that is currently the law of the land, a marketplace that is about as small as it could possibly be.  In our State, in Missouri, we have counties that have a million people. We have a county that has a million people. We have a county that has 4,000 people. The county that has 4,000 people has its own buying unit when it comes to looking at how the marketplace is set up. It just doesn't make sense. The deductibles are so high, the choice is so low. Some defenders of the law will say that costs will go up if the amendment passes. That is possible, but we know the costs will go up if the amendment fails. We know the costs will go up if we stay where we are.  Costs, since 2013, have increased an average of over 100 percent in the country--105 percent. This was the law that was going to reduce family costs by $2,500 a year. Families are generally relieved if their insurance didn't increase by $2,500 a year, let alone fail to reduce by $2,100 a year. So a 105-percent increase in 4 years--in Missouri, where I live, 145 percent is the increase.  I think at least three States have had an increase of more than 200 percent, and even with an increase of more than 200 percent, nobody wants to sell insurance there. Not only is there no competition, I think about one-third of the counties in America this year don't have more than one company that will even offer a product. Some have had no companies that would offer a product, and 40 percent is the estimate for next year. There are places where no more than one company will offer a product. What kind of competitive marketplace is that?  The government, with the mandate, says you have to buy a product and you have to buy it in that marketplace and you have to buy it from that one company at whatever rate some other level of government has finally approved to keep the company there that probably didn't want to be there, but if you don't buy it, you pay a penalty.  This is not working. Millions of people have chosen to pay the current penalty, which was $695, rather than to participate in a system that didn't work for them. Families can't continue to pay more and get less.  Remember former President Clinton's observation on this: What a crazy system. The costs keep going up and the coverage keeps going down. We have forced people to be in a system that according to President Clinton, the costs keep going up, the coverage keeps going down, and if you don't participate in that, you pay a penalty.  We have to move in a different direction. Eliminating these mandates helps to do that. There are some Congressional Budget Office numbers out there that estimate what is about to happen. They certainly totally misestimated the current law. I believe, under the current law, there would be 25 million people, roughly, or some big number like that on the exchange today. There are 10 million instead of 25 million, 22 million, whatever the projection was for this date in 2017. There are about 10 million.  CBO is notoriously wild with their projections. They projected, for instance, that 15 million people would drop out of the individual market if one of the many burdens of this bill or these amendments passed. There are only 10 million people in the market. How do 15 million people drop out if there are only 10 million people there?  They said that 7 million people who get Medicaid and pay nothing for it wouldn't take that if the government didn't force them to. There must be something wrong with the insurance product and Medicaid both if people don't take it even if it is available to them. The current system isn't working.  The other mandate, the employer mandate, is telling employers what they have to do. One of the great benefits of health insurance in this country since World War II has been insurance at work. It was pretty much an accident in 1946. The war was over, and no one wanted to heat up the economy too quickly so it was decided to have wage and price controls. Somebody asked the price control person: If we add insurance at work, does that count toward wages? They wanted to compete for more and better employees they could get coming back into that economy from the war. So they asked, if we add insurance to work, does that count as wages? The wage and price control person said, no, it wouldn't count. So they went to the IRS person and said: If it doesn't count toward the wage, is it taxable if they get it at work? That person said, no, it wouldn't be taxable either. So we have this unique system that developed. We need to figure out how more people can get insurance at work, more people can get insurance as a part of bigger groups. There are things that work and things that don't. The government requiring you to do something and thinking there is a constitutional right to do that just simply doesn't work.  In fact, with the employer mandate, there are all kinds of unintended consequences. People with 50 employees didn't want to get more than 50 employees. The 30-hour workweek became a problem.

3572,topic-id,1548,"Mr.President, I stand today sort of feeling like a great New Jerseyan named Yogi Berra, who has a saying that ``this is deja vu all over again.'' The reason why it feels like deja vu all over again to me is because I have been watching this process move along. When the House first tried to push through a healthcare bill, I was so proud that the American public--Republicans and Democrats--were outraged and stopped that version 1 in the But then version 2 was rushed through without a CBO score, and they got it done. We heard Republicans in the House literally saying on the record: I so hope that they will fix this in the Senate; maybe something will happen in the Senate that this will get fixed.  Well, now I have deja vu all over again, and it is because we see a whole bunch of folks--and now we have heard Republican Senators say this on the record: Gosh, we know what we are doing is flawed; we know what we are doing is wrong; we know the process has been outrageous, but our hope is, if we can get it into the conference committee, then they will fix it in the conference committee.  Well, I am proud to be a U.But, dear God, this is not what this body is about--to push their responsibilities off, to derelict their duties, and to not make legislation happen here that puts people first. We all know this process is broken. We all know that what we are doing here is not just imperfect. Many of us see this, like the CBO, as a serious threat to millions of  We are about to do something that is unconscionable to me to be in the Senate, where I have seen this place work, I have seen regular order, I have seen hearings, I have seen witnesses brought in, and I have seen people work hard on crafting actual legislation. So now this is just going to be shoved over with the hope in this body that, even though the House didn't do their job and the President of the United States even criticized what the House did and called it ``mean,'' it gets kicked over to the Senate, and the Senate is refusing to do their job. They are just passing the buck to something called a conference committee, where they are going to hope again.  So I stand here, and I just have to confess that this has been 2 days for me where I haven't just been frustrated and angry like so many I have actually been struggling with being a little sick. I started feeling it about 2 days ago. By yesterday my throat was so sore, I went to bed. I had a horrible night, got up, and could barely even swallow. I had the worry in my head that maybe I had strep throat.  But guess what. Unlike the thousands of New Jerseyans who have reached out to me, for me to worry about an illness, maybe that I have strep throat--I went to a doctor today. I had myself tested for strep. You see, we, in this body, enjoy health coverage, which right now millions of Americans are worried about losing, and many other ones worry, as we heard said tonight, about copays and prescription drug costs. I wonder where the justice is in that.  What are the American values that hold us all together? I know we pledge allegiance to that flag. We put our hands on our hearts, and we swear this oath to liberty and justice for all. Where is the justice in this country, where some people who are favored and privileged enough and wealthy enough to afford good health coverage can have it, but for other folks, a night with a bad sore throat or, worse, with a disability or disease--where is their justice in the wealthiest country on the planet Earth? We can't even, in this body, come together and do what the President said in his campaign that he would do--everyone would be covered and have healthcare that--I think the quote was this--was terrific.  Well, it brings me back to what our values are as a country, and I wonder: For we who believe in life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, how can we have life when we see millions of people about to be thrown off their health coverage? We in this Nation hold these values so dear. We believe that all are created equal and, in my belief, should have equal rights and equal opportunities for the basics that are necessary to succeed and to compete, and that is health insurance.  I wonder how we have gotten to a point as a body on an issue like this that is not just one-sixth of our economy, that will not just affect millions and millions of lives, but that really goes to the core of who we are as a country.  This great man, Patrick Henry, said: ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' Those words have been coming back to me a lot in the last months of this debate and this discussion: ``Give me liberty or give me death.''  Well, what is the quality of the liberty in this country, where there are people who are shackled with preventible disease and conditions that could be treated because they don't have access to healthcare? What is the quality of liberty in this country, where people are chained to poverty, have to sell their cars, have to sell their homes, and go into bankruptcy because they can't afford their healthcare coverage?  ``Give me liberty or give me death.'' What is the quality of the liberty when people are imprisoned by fear and worry and stress because they have a sick child or they have a parent who is elderly and needs care? These are the values of this country, and I don't understand how we could be at this moment right now with the ideas that I have heard on both sides of the aisle to make healthcare better, to improve upon the Affordable Care Act, to extend health coverage to even more people, to make this Nation live up to its most powerful and profound values that made us a light unto nations, and how we could have gotten to this point now after gaining ground, after having more people experience the freedom and the liberty that comes from not having to worry about your health coverage, from having access to quality healthcare? How can we have moved forward and now be about, in a matter of hours, to push this Nation back? I don't understand how we could be here where no one can justify the process and no one can justify this body having gone through such a contorted process that bends our traditions and breaks our values. I do not understand how we could have gotten here.  Who will be hurt? Who will be hurt? I have read lots of studies recently about how, when health insurance rates goes down, mortality rates go up, and when health insurance rates go down, mortality rates go up. It makes me wonder about the duty that we each have to each other as As a man of faith, it makes me wonder about all of us who profess our faith and how we could be allowing a process[[Page S4406]]to go forward where the most vulnerable among us will face fear and deprivation and will see things that will cost life and have them surrender liberty. We are better than this. This Nation is greater than this.  This moment casts a shame and a shadow over the soul and the heart of America, and I will fight even in these last hours with every breath that I have, like the patriots before us, not to allow this to happen to my fellow This is unjust, this is wrong, and we can and must in these hours do better.

What we are about to vote on has only seen the light of day for a matter of minutes now--a matter of minutes.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan legislation, H.2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, as amended. The legislation is a product of hard work between the Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans service organizations, committee staff, and committee members.  This bill gives veterans more options when pursuing the appeals claim by creating three pathways or lanes: Lane one allows for the veteran to request that a new individual review their case without a hearing, which will allow a faster response time from the VA on their appeal; lane two allows a veteran to request a hearing; and lane three sends the appeal directly to the Board of Veterans These three lanes, working together, will speed up the process for our Nation's veterans and ensure that the appeals system works for them.  An important compromise in this legislation also allows for veterans to keep the original effective date of their claim as long as they filed the necessary paperwork within 1 year of a VA's decision. This is another way to ensure that the appeals system is working for the veterans. It is important that we do not leave any veteran behind.  My colleagues and I have worked to ensure that some of the more than 470,000 veterans with a current appeal in the system will have the opportunity at certain points to opt into the new system.

3793,topic-id,630,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the leadership and Chairman Upton for bringing this bill up under suspension today, and I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for yielding me the time.  I thank the entire Energy and Commerce Committee, which, once again, voted unanimously in committee in favor of this bill--a bill that has passed the House twice under suspension in each of the past two Both times it passed during the final days of the Congress, and the Senate did not have a chance to take the bill up. I am glad the House is considering it now in plenty of time for the Senate to consider it and act.  I would also thank Congressman Peter Welch from Vermont for his leadership on the bill. It is no secret that he is one of the great champions in the House on the issue of energy efficiency, and it has been my pleasure to work with him.  Mr.Speaker, so many schools across the country are in need of upgrades and improvements to their facilities. In its most recent 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the condition of our Nation's schools a grade of D-plus.  As school administrators undertake badly needed improvements, they have an opportunity to substantially improve their facilities' energy efficiency, producing benefits for both the environment and the economy. In reducing their energy bills, schools can put the savings to use on other educational priorities.  According to the EPA and the Department of Energy, K-12 school districts nationwide spend approximately $8 billion on their energy bills every year--second only to personnel costs--exceeding the costs of textbooks and supplies. An estimated $2 billion of that cost could be saved by improving energy efficiency, an amount that could pay for, for example, 40 million textbooks.  Energy expenses are one of the few costs that can be reduced while at the same time improving classroom instruction. In fact, high-performance schools can lower a school district's operating costs by up to 30 percent.  There are numerous Federal initiatives already available to schools to help them become more energy efficient, but these programs are spread across the Federal Government, making it challenging, time consuming, and costly for schools to identify and take full advantage of these programs.  In addition, schools can use several different general purpose programs for energy efficiency projects if they know how to locate and apply for them.  Introduced in the Senate as 383 by Senator Susan Collins, this bipartisan Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act aims to provide a coordinating structure for busy school administrators to help them better navigate available Federal programs and financing options.  This legislation does not spend an additional dime and keeps its decisionmaking authority with the States, the school boards, and local officials.  This bill establishes a clearinghouse through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which will disseminate information on Federal programs and financing mechanisms that may be used to develop energy efficiency, distributed generation, and energy retrofitting projects for schools.  The bill also directs the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to coordinate with Federal agencies and develop an outreach effort to streamline communications and promote available Federal programs. Such outreach may include a single website where school officials can learn more about the relevant programs.  Overburdened school administrators should not have to spend hours and hours wading through the Federal bureaucracy as they look for ways to improve energy efficiency. This commonsense legislation will ensure that schools can more easily take advantage of existing energy efficiency programs.  It is a strategic and cost-saving investment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by school districts across the country, supported by overburdened homeowners, while bringing us closer to energy security in  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.

3577,topic-id,1462,"Mr.President, few issues are as important or personal to the American people as healthcare, which is why this debate has been so fervent and ignites such passion.  On the one hand, the Affordable Care Act, ACA, has allowed millions of individuals and families to obtain health insurance for the first time. It has also brought important patient protections like those for people with preexisting conditions and prohibitions on annual and lifetime limits on insurance payments for needed care.  On the other hand, too many Americans face skyrocketing premiums and unaffordable deductibles coupled with mandates that give them few, if any, choices. Some insurance plans have become so restrictive that families find they can no longer go to the doctor or hospital of their choice. In addition, the ACA's employer mandate discourages businesses from creating jobs or giving their workers more hours, while its tax credits and subsidies are designed so poorly as to cause ``wage lock''--``where working harder to get ahead can instead make some Americans fall further behind.''  Despite President Obama's campaign promise that his health plan ``would save the average family $2,500 on their premiums'' per year, the opposite has happened as premiums are increasing in nearly every State, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally last year. Today, despite the implementation of the ACA, 28 million Americans remain uninsured.  These problems require a bipartisan solution. The Democrats made a big mistake when they passed the ACA without a single Republican vote. I don't want to see Republicans make the same mistake.  Earlier this week, I voted against proceeding to healthcare reform legislation--the American Health Care Act of 2017--that passed the House of Representatives last May without a single Democratic vote. For many Americans, this bill could actually make the situation worse. Among other things, the bill would make sweeping changes to the Medicaid Program--an important safety net that for more than 50 years has helped poor and disabled individuals, including children and low-income seniors, receive health care. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, projects that the number of uninsured Americans would climb by 23 million under this bill.  Senate leaders, recognizing that the House bill did not have sufficient support, advanced their own substitute proposal that would make similar structural changes to the Medicaid program, as well as many other changes. CBO estimates that this plan would reduce the number of people with insurance by 22 million, cause premiums and other out-of-pocket costs to soar for Americans nearing retirement, and shift billions of dollars of costs to State governments. It also would undermine the financial stability of rural hospitals and long-term care facilities and likely lead to the loss of important consumer protections for many Americans, while doing virtually nothing to address the underlying problem of escalating healthcare costs. Earlier this week, this body struck down that proposal by a vote of 43 to 57.  A separate proposal that would simply repeal the ACA without a replacement also failed, by a vote of 45 to 55. That legislation, according to CBO, would result in 32 million people losing their insurance, bringing the total number of uninsured Americans to 60 million a decade from now. Clearly, that is going in the wrong direction.  In a final effort to reach consensus, Republican leaders have pieced together a plan that would repeal key portions of the ACA while punting on many of the more difficult questions. While I support many of the components of this plan, this approach will not provide the market stability and premium relief that is needed. In fact, a bipartisan group of Governors wrote Senate leaders this week, urging rejection of this so-called skinny plan, which they say ``is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.''  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Also included in all of these plans is a misguided proposal that would block Federal funds, including Medicaid reimbursements, from going to Planned Millions of women across the country rely on Planned Parenthood for family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive healthcare services. Denying women access to Planned Parenthood not only runs contrary to our goal of letting patients choose the healthcare provider who best fits their needs, but it also could impede timely access to care.  If Planned Parenthood were defunded, other family planning clinics in Maine, including community health centers, would see a 63 percent increase in their patient load. Some patients would need to drive greater distances to receive care, while others would have to wait longer for an appointment,  Let me be clear that this is not about abortion. Federal law already prohibits the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.  This is about interfering with the ability of a woman to choose the healthcare provider who is right for her. This harmful provision should have no place in legislation that purports to be about restoring patient choices and freedom.  We need to reconsider our approach. The ACA is flawed and in portions of the country is near collapse. Rather[[Page S4408]]than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should work together to address these very serious problems. In their letter to Senate leaders, the bipartisan group of Governors correctly notes that, ``True, lasting reforms can only be achieved in an open, bipartisan fashion.''  Healthcare is extraordinarily complex, and we must work together systematically in order to ``do no harm'' and improve our healthcare system. In developing legislation, our focus should be on the impact on people, premiums, and providers.  We are dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans and one sixth of our economy, and we need to approach reforms in a very careful way. That means going through the regular process of committee hearings; receiving input from expert witnesses such as actuaries, Governors, advocacy groups, and healthcare providers; and vetting proposals with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It needs to be a much more deliberative process, and I am pleased that Chairman Alexander has expressed a willingness to begin hearings in the Senate Health  Neither party has a monopoly on good ideas, and we must work together to put together a bipartisan bill that fixes the flaws in the ACA and works for all  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 26, 2017.

We agree with Senator John McCain that the Senate should      ``return to regular order,'' working across the aisle to      ``provide workable solutions to problems Americans are      struggling with today.''       Congress should be working to make health insurance more      affordable while stabilizing the health insurance market, but      this bill and similar proposals won't accomplish these goals.      The bill still threatens coverage for millions of      hardworking, middle class The bill's Medicaid      provisions shift costs to states and fail to provide the      necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out,      including the working poor or those suffering from mental      illness or addiction. The Senate should also reject efforts      to amend the bill into a ``skinny repeal,'' which is expected      to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market,      increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having      access to coverage.       Instead, we ask senators to work with governors on      solutions to problems we can all agree on: fixing our      unstable insurance markets. Improvements should be based on a      set of guiding principles, which include controlling costs      and stabilizing the market, that will positively impact the      coverage and care of millions of Americans, including many      who are dealing with mental illness, chronic health problems,      and drug addiction.

What is happening in the U.Senate? They can't keep track of what it is we have moved to.  We don't know either.  We are here probably all night waiting for the majority to finally produce the bill that they will use to attempt to repeal and maybe replace--or not--the Affordable Care  All we know is, every single proposal that has been brought forward in recent days has two features: It reduces coverage, and it raises costs.  It may be that 16 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage. It might be 20 million, might be 32 million. Those are different scores for different proposed bills.  It may raise costs by 15 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent. Sometime later tonight, we will see the final bill presented on this floor, and hopefully we will get some score so we know what we are voting on before we finally get there, but what is so scary to families I am hearing from, is that after 7 months of majority rule, where the Republican Party controls the Senate, House, and White House, we don't have a finished bill for us to debate tonight in detail, and we don't know yet exactly what we will vote on later tonight. We just know a simple theme--every proposal that has been brought forward when scored by the CBO, the independent scorekeeper, offers less coverage and higher costs.  Folks, I want to remind you about something because I just ran into a family out on the steps of the Capitol, outside the building, not inside the building--a family who is raising two typical children and one child with Down syndrome, a family where the father of the family is Active-Duty U.military. They asked me: ``Why can't we be heard?''  The process that brought us here tonight did not include committee hearings, where doctors, nurses, patient advocates, folks who run hospitals, or folks who are specialists on insurance were heard.  In a press conference earlier this evening, four of our colleagues said they are going to vote for this bill later tonight so it can go to conference and get fixed. They said the current expected skinny repeal bill is a fraudulent disaster, to paraphrase a colleague.  Well, what I really think we should do is heed the advice that Senator McCain laid out on the floor a few days ago and go back to regular order.  Just earlier today, there was an inspiring moment when we took up and passed by a vote of 97 to 2 the Russia[[Page S4396]]sanctions bill. We heard the chair and ranking Republican and Democrat of the Foreign Relations Committee speak positively of each other and positively of the process and they said the outcome is in the best interest of our country.  As we have seen, we don't always follow regular order. Both parties have responsibility for moving things over the years without fully consulting each other and without going through the committee process. I think this is the moment where we should look at what happened earlier today on this very floor and follow that process, where the committees are included and consulted, and where we find a bipartisan resolution to what ails I am afraid that is not what is going to happen, and later tonight we will be forced to vote for or against a bill that raises healthcare costs for Americans and lowers the number of Americans who get healthcare coverage.

3475,topic-id,1846,"Mr.President, this week we are about the business of keeping our promises. For 7 years, we have promised to help the millions of Americans who have been let down, not to mention deceived, by the promises of It is absolutely critical that we fulfill our commitments.  This is not just about moving past the failures of ObamaCare but laying the groundwork for providing Americans access to better care. We said all along that we have four principles:  One is to help stabilize the insurance markets so people living in Iowa, for example, would make sure they have a place where they can actually buy health insurance.  It is about getting premiums lower by eliminating the mandates and making it possible for people to choose alternatives that happen to suit their needs at a price they can afford.  Third, we said we are going to continue to do everything in our power to protect people with preexisting conditions so they are not afraid about changing jobs and being excluded from their new employer's insurance coverage because of something we have done here. We protect people against the preexisting conditions exclusion.  Fourth, what we said we want to do is to take Medicaid, an essential safety net healthcare program, and make sure we put it on a sustainable path. I know there are some in Washington, DC, who think we can just continue to spend borrowed money endlessly. Well, we can't. It really jeopardizes the very viability of some of our most essential safety net programs like Social Security, Medicare, and, yes, Medicaid in this instance.  What we have done, and what we intend to do, working with our colleagues in the House, is to put Medicaid on a sustainable path while we grow the expenditures to Medicaid each year, over a 10-year period, by $71 billion.  So those who say we are somehow gutting Medicaid or we are cutting Medicaid, I think, they simply have to deal with those facts. I haven't heard a satisfactory explanation for how you can conclude that somehow we are gutting Medicaid or cutting it when we are actually making it sustainable in the long run.  Throughout this process, what I have learned is, Senators have a lot of different ideas. Everybody has come to the table to try to help make this better. I would say, unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues have chosen not to participate in the process. This would be a lot easier--and the product we come up with would be a lot more durable over the long haul--if, in fact, Democrats would work with us.  The fact is, in this amendment process we are engaged in, and will be engaged in this evening, any Senator, Democrat or Republican, majority, minority party Member, can offer an amendment and get a vote on it. So I don't really understand why our Democratic colleagues are sitting on their hands and will not participate in the process.  I fear what they want is to change nothing about the structure of ObamaCare, notwithstanding the failed experiment of the last 7 years. Then what they want to do is come back and throw money at the insurance companies under these cost-sharing risk pools. We are willing to do what we need to do to stabilize the insurance market, but I am not going to vote for an insurance company bailout without reform.  Leader McConnell reiterated yesterday that our constituents are counting on us. I can tell you, the 28 million Texans I have the great privilege of representing are counting on me and Senator Cruz to do our part to come up with a solution. The Texan whose premiums have tripled and lost his doctor is counting on us. The ER employee who witnessed the emergency room busting at the seams with Medicaid patients--people who ostensibly have coverage under Medicaid but who can't find a doctor who will accept a new Medicaid patient so they end up going to the emergency room--is counting on us. The small business owner who was forced to fire employees to avoid a $100,000 fine, that person is counting on us too. The young woman coming out of nursing school who was forced to change her plan three times, only to end up with a plan with coverage options she didn't want, at a price she could barely afford, she is counting on us too.  My constituents in Texas and Americans across the country are counting on us. They are sick and tired of the bickering and the lack of productivity here in Washington, DC, and I don't blame them one bit. They are counting on us to free them from some of ObamaCare's mandates that force them to make very tough economic decisions, like the 28 million people under ObamaCare who either pay a fine--about 6.5 million of them--or, the rest,[[Page S4371]]who claim hardship exemptions so they don't have to buy insurance. But in Texas alone, there are more than 400,000 Texans who earn less than $25,000 a year who can't afford to buy the insurance. So they pay the fine to the government. So their government fines them for not buying a product they can't afford.  So now is the time to deliver some relief to our constituents. They are counting on us to keep the deeply personal choice of healthcare plans and doctors in their hands and not the Federal Government's. So it is time to deliver, and my goal is to make sure we find a solution and get it to the President's desk.  One of the most offensive parts of the Affordable Care Act--or we should have called it the un-Affordable Care Act, since premiums have gone up 105 percent since 2013 alone--is that people who were told a family of four would see a reduction of $2,500 a year in their premiums have seen their premiums go up by more than $3,000. There are a lot of stories--I am sure even here in this room, in this Chamber--where people simply have seen their premiums go up, up, and up along with their deductibles, basically denying them the benefit of their insurance. But the individual mandate is a prime example of government getting in the way of individual freedom and the right to choose.  The so-called individual mandate--we really should call this the penalty that government imposes on its citizens for failing to purchase a product they don't want and, in some cases, don't even need--forces them to do so at a cost that was crippling and continues to be crippling for many individuals and families.  Here is a shocking statistic. An estimated 8 million Americans pay the fine associated with this mandate each year. Eight million Americans are penalized by their own government, forced to pay a fine that could be used on coverage that might actually suit their needs. If ObamaCare would make it possible that the market could prosper and insurance companies offered a variety of products at different prices that people could choose from, maybe some of these folks could take the money they are paying their own government as a penalty and actually buy insurance coverage.  Then there is the employer mandate. This is one of the most pernicious of the mandates. I remember sitting with a friend of mine, who happens to own a small architectural firm in San Antonio, back when ObamaCare passed, and I explained to him: If you have more than 50 employees, then you are going to have to buy or provide ObamaCare-compliant healthcare for your employees.  He said: Well, I may have to lay off some people because we have 54 employees. So I am going to have to fire at least four of them to get below that 50-person threshold so I can avoid the fine and the insurance that I can't afford to provide for my employees.  So this has literally been a job-killing employer mandate. This is not some benign or innocuous requirement. This has been one of the reasons why the economy has been so anemic even since the great recession of 2008, and this is the reason why so many people feel like the economy has not really recovered, because it hasn't provided them job opportunities and larger wages. So this mandate has stifled business growth, to be sure, especially among small businesses, which are the primary job engine of our economy. Oftentimes jobs were cut in order to avoid bankrupting the business through ObamaCare fines.  So Americans have been forced by their own government, no less--government is supposed to serve the people, not the other way around--to live under mandates, taxes, broken promises, and collapsing markets for too long. So this week is about keeping our promises, demonstrating that we can govern, even, unfortunately, without the assistance of our Democratic colleagues, and paving the way to tackle other important issues, like tax reform, infrastructure construction--things we need to do to keep the economy growing and moving forward.  So we will be hearing more about a possible solution and a way forward, something I call ``the freedom to choose'' plan, where we free the American people from the destructive impact of this so-called individual mandate, where we free small employers from the employer mandate, letting them hire the employees they need and not having to choose between that and bankruptcy.  And, yes, we are going to push more power out of Washington, DC, and back to the I know, based on the public opinion polling I have seen, that people sure trust their States a lot more than they trust Washington, DC, when it comes to healthcare. So we are going to provide the flexibility and tools that the States, the Governors, and the legislators need, as well as the insurance commissioners, to come up with a viable market using resources we are going to provide to them.  It would be better if we could all come together to find a solution to engage in debate--Republicans and Democrats alike--and pass a final product and get it to the President's desk. That is, actually, how the legislature is supposed to function. But unfortunately we are in unusual times, when almost half of the Senate refuses to participate. Actually, they will be actively trying to undermine our efforts to come to the rescue of the people that are hurting as a result of the deception and the failures of I don't know how you explain that. You certainly can't explain it to constituents like I have. I bet you a dollar that every single one of the Senators here who is trying to blow up this process and undermine the progress we are making has constituents back home who are suffering the same way my constituents are, but they are turning a deaf ear to them and saying: You know what, politics and party and ideology are more important to me than actually addressing the needs of my constituents. That is what their actions are effectively saying, and it is a shame.  I yield the floor.

3661,topic-id,1479,"Mr.President, with the media and others looking at the first 100 days or so of this new administration, and looking at this new Congress and the Republican majority, I think it bears reflecting on the last couple of months in the Congress under the new Trump administration and looking at some of the accomplishments that have been made on behalf of the American economy and the American people.  We are committed to helping job creators do what they do best; that is, innovate, create more jobs, and employ[[Page S2540]]more people, and not force those same job creators to waste time dealing with onerous rules and regulations that bear no relationship to public safety. With a like-minded President, we have been able to deliver some real relief to the American people.  One of the ways we have been able to do that is through a mechanism known as the Congressional Review The Congressional Review Act was created to give Congress an opportunity to do away with regulations with which it disagrees. It allows Congress to act as a real check.  The problem with regulations is, it is really a substitute for lawmaking. Of course, when Congress acts and passes laws, the President signs them, and then we are held accountable by the voters for the laws we pass. That is not so when it comes to the bureaucracy that writes regulations. Bureaucrats don't stand for election. Bureaucrats are not accountable to the people. So that is why it is really important for us to have a mechanism like the Congressional Review Act to act as a check on runaway regulation.  By using this mechanism, the Congressional Review Act, with an ally in the White House, we have started undoing some of the thousands of burdensome rules and regulations created by the Obama administration--rules and regulations that add up to a hefty pricetag for our country. By one estimate, the costs of these Obama-era regulations add up to more than $1 trillion. That is a tremendous wet blanket on the American economy. If the job creators have to pay somebody to help them comply with these onerous rules and regulations, they obviously are not paying somebody to grow their business and to be productive. By one estimate, the cost of these Obama regulations adds up to more than $1 trillion and more than 700 million hours of paperwork, but fortunately we have been able to chip away at them by working with the White House and focusing on bringing regulatory relief to the American people.  Here is the tally so far. So far, we have been able to save the American economy $636 billion worth of regulatory relief. That adds up to 52 million hours of compliance time. Again, when somebody is busy complying with busy work mandated by a micromanaging Federal bureaucracy, they are not doing productive work.  Now, some of these rules and regulations are things that we may not read or hear about in the headlines or the evening news--things like the stream buffer rule, the Bureau of Land Management planning rule, and the Securities and Exchange Commission resource extraction rule. These are not well-known rules and regulations, but they have a real cost on the American economy. There is a real reason why, after the great recession of 2008, our economy has been bouncing along at about 2 percent real growth. That is not enough growth to keep hiring people as they come of age and become eligible to work in the workforce. We need the economy to grow faster, and one of the ways to do that is to relieve businesses and the economy of those overly onerous regulations.  As I was thinking about it, I think what has happened to our economy is, it has died a death of 1,000 cuts. Each of these regulations, while they seem rather innocuous, in and of themselves, or people don't know about them, have actually accumulated to cause real damage to the American economy. So we have been able to help those small businesses that would like to hire more people to do productive work, to grow the economy, and to help pay their employees better wages. We have helped them by repealing these regulations to help our job creators and not hurt them.  This has always been, to me, the mystery of Washington, Back home in Texas, we look at the job creator as a positive influence on our economy, as somebody who is going to be creating a real opportunity for someone to find productive work and to pursue their dreams, but here in Washington so often the opposite seems to be true. It almost seemed like the attitude, particularly of the previous administration, was, What other obstacles can we put in the way of businesses? What other burdens can we impose upon the economy in the name of trying to micromanage the economy from Washington, DC? Well, I think what we have seen--the evidence is pretty clear--is anemic growth, and that is something we need to roll back, along with these rules and regulations.  I am hopeful the President will be signing more of these Congressional Review Act initiatives soon. So far, he has signed 13 of them, and we have more in the queue.  As we look ahead to big-ticket items we all want to make progress on, I am committed to continuing to work with all of our colleagues and the administration in doing all we can to help small businesses, family farmers, and entrepreneurs spend more time doing productive work and less time doing busy work mandated by the bureaucrats here in Washington,  One of those big-ticket items is tax reform. We have seen some big ideas floated out there by the House of Representatives and last night and today by the President and his Cabinet as well. I look forward to reviewing the proposal the President has made.  There is no question there is a lot of room for reforming our Tax Our Tax Code is literally a self-inflicted wound which damages our economy. We have trillions of dollars earned by American-based businesses earned overseas that they will not bring back because they don't want to be taxed twice on that money. We know our Tax Code is way too complicated. It is riddled with loopholes, inconsistencies, and provisions that impede job creation. Pro-growth tax reform should be our goal. It is something that has united Republicans and Democrats in the past, and there is no reason we shouldn't be united again in accomplishing that tax reform.  So I look forward to hearing more about the President's proposal, and I applaud him for making a bold statement about the direction we ought to pursue. Now is finally the time to address it.  All of these efforts--tax reform, rolling back unnecessary regulations and rules, and providing a better environment for businesses to thrive--are vital to getting our economy back on track and away from years of stagnant growth we saw under President  I should note it is hard to argue with how business-friendly policies--and the promise of more--affect the economy and create an atmosphere conducive to building businesses and helping families get by.  I think what we have seen is a resurgence of public confidence in the American economy. One index by Gallup suggests that business owners are now more optimistic than they have been since the summer of 2007. That is the kind of confidence and optimism that helps them grow their business and create opportunity for the working man and woman in our country, and it is a testament to the sea change we have seen over the last few months since the new administration came into office and the American people chose to retain Republican majorities in the House and the More family-run businesses are expecting us to keep putting forward policies that empower job creators, not to get in their way.  I know we have only seen the first few months of the new Congress and we have only seen the first few months of a new Presidential administration, but I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish so far; frankly, without much help from our friends across the aisle who have done everything they can to slow-walk nominations and otherwise impede progress. I hope they realize that is bad politics, and it is not serving the interests of the American people very well. Sooner or later, enough Democrats are going to say: We came here not to just say no to every constructive proposal made but actually participate in the legislative process and work for the benefit of the American people.  I look forward to doing even more to help those who want to bring more jobs and more economic growth to our communities across this great land.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2539-8.txt,1692,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,26.0,June
3820,topic-id,2081,"Madam President, it is no secret that last week's vote on repealing and replacing the provisions of ObamaCare proved a disappointment to many of us. I have found, though, in my time here in the Senate that so often we agree on the goal we want to achieve, but we disagree on the means to achieve that goal.  Some people see the private sector and competition and markets as the best place to regulate economic activity. Other people look at the government as the source of actions that do things like provide access to healthcare. The truth is, in our complicated healthcare delivery system, everybody plays a role one way or the other.  We know that government plays an outsized role already, because we have Medicare, Medicaid, veterans health programs, and the like--the Children's Health Insurance Program, which we will have to take up and reauthorize before the end of But there does exist a very important private marketplace for health insurance, and, frankly, many times I think the government makes it harder, not easier, for the private marketplace to offer people a variety of products that they actually like, want to buy, and can afford.  But it is evident that there is a lot of passion about this issue, and that is not going to go away. Certainly, what is not going to go away is the need that consumers across this country of ours have for lower premiums, increased access, and a marketplace that actually functions, where people can buy an insurance product they want to buy, and, of course, there is always the issue of quality of care.  Some people think that maybe Medicaid is the ultimate answer. The fact of the matter is that Medicaid plays a very important role as a safety net for low-income Americans, but most of the medical studies that have been done indicate that medical outcomes under Medicaid are no better than those for those people who don't have insurance at all, and the number of people who go to the emergency room includes many people who have Medicaid but have a hard time finding a doctor who will treat them because Medicaid pays doctors at such a low rate that only about one-third of the doctors, especially in my State of Texas, will see a new Medicaid patient. As one of our colleagues has suggested, it is kind of like telling people: Here is a bus ticket. But there is no bus. There is no way to get there. That is hardly what I would call access to quality care.  I know our work is not done. Now I and others turn to our colleagues across the aisle who fought us every step of the way in trying to achieve progress on healthcare reform and ask them what their suggestions are. Democrats need to be constructive rather than continuing to bury their heads in the sand about the fundamental problems with the Affordable Care  My firm belief is that these problems are structural in nature. They are not something that can be solved simply by throwing more money at the problem, particularly when insurance companies would love to have us do exactly that. That is the way they do business. They are profit-oriented companies. I don't begrudge them that.  It is simply not in our best interest, I believe, to just throw billions of dollars at insurance companies in a bailout without reforming the fundamental structure by which healthcare is delivered. I don't think we can turn to the taxpayers and say that it is their obligation to bail out insurance companies, particularly when they have seen their premiums already triple under  We can't afford to do what the Senator from Vermont wants to do, which is enact a costly single-payer system, which would literally bankrupt our country.  With every day that passes, ObamaCare keeps getting worse, but we have no choice but to keep working to find new ways forward. That will include discussions and efforts to keep our promise and fix the mess that has been left to us to face.  There is a lot the American people expect of us. With fragile majorities in the Senate, we have seen that we are forced to work together to try to solve these problems. I think, frankly, bipartisan solutions tend to be more durable.  As we move forward to that work and turn to legislative priorities such as breaking the blockade on nominations, tax reform, getting our economy growing again, getting people back to work--because the economy is growing and they get good, well-paying jobs--and doing things such as rebuilding our infrastructure, something we know is important to our economic future, we will continue this week focusing on something that, frankly, we should have done months ago, which is seeing that more of President Trump's nominees are confirmed.  Of course, we know the approach of the Democratic leader from New York has been to obstruct, block, and slow down as many of these nominations as he can. For example, our Senate colleagues on the Democratic side have allowed only 10 percent of President Trump's confirmations to go by a voice vote, which is a customary courtesy when there is no controversy associated with the nomination. President Obama's confirmations went through with 90 percent of them by voice vote because they weren't truly controversial. What we have seen happen this year is to burn the clock and delay and obstruct and foot-drag as much as possible in order to deny the President his own team.  I realize many people were disappointed on that side of the aisle when President Trump was elected. He was elected President of the United States, and he deserves to have his team in place--particularly when they are not controversial nominees--rather[[Page S4638]]than to deny him the opportunities to staff up and do the job the American people elected him to do.  This obstruction is felt particularly acutely at the Department of You would think that if there is one thing that is bipartisan or nonpartisan, it would be our national security. In fact, only seven of President Trump's nominations for the Pentagon have been confirmed. Two of the remaining nominees waiting for confirmation have been waiting for 2 months after they have been unanimously approved by the Armed Services Committee--2 months of delay for no purpose whatsoever with noncontroversial nominees.  The minority leader is blocking these nominees, but his ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, along with all other Democrats on the Armed Services Committee, unanimously voted to approve the nominees and vote them out of committee.  It should not take 2 months to fill these critical national security roles, especially for nominees who aren't controversial. Each day that our Democratic colleagues delay the process, they are hindering our readiness and putting American lives at risk.  This comes at a time when we are engaged in fights around the globe, at a time the vast array of threats around the globe are more diverse and, frankly, more dangerous than they have been in a long, long time. All we need to do is to look at what is happening in North  It is especially disgraceful for those men and women who put their lives in harm's way, who wake up every day and risk their lives to defend the country, and who proudly wear the uniform of the U.military. This is an offense against them. It is insulting. They deserve better than this from our Senate Democratic colleagues.  I hope the Senator from New York, the Democratic leader, will stick to what he said last week and drop the needless blockade against the President's nominees. The President won the election and is expected to appoint a Cabinet of qualified individuals to guide our country and carry out his policies. Whether you voted for President Trump or against President Trump, he did win the election, and we should move forward with a fully staffed executive branch.  Americans also deserve to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks in their pockets. We know that businesses, particularly small businesses that are the primary engine of job creation in the country, have been subjected to a tax code that is enormously complicated, confusing, and that discourages economic growth.  Why in the world would we want to do that to ourselves? Why would we want to tolerate a tax code that is so complicated, that is anti-growth, and that discourages job creation? We shouldn't.  With this new administration, we are committed to overhauling our outdated Tax Code to make it simpler and fairer, one that will encourage businesses to create jobs and bring profits back to our shore. Members of both Chambers--the House and Senate--have been hard at work on a solution that will provide that sort of relief and protect jobs and put Americans first, not government.  I look forward to the debate and the fight for historic tax reform in the coming months. I want to particularly commend my friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, a fellow Texan, Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for his great work in that body, together with our chairman in the Senate, Senator Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance That is the committee of jurisdiction where we are going to have hearings and a markup this fall.  Finally, I wish to address another area where Congress ought to be able to work together on a bipartisan basis, and that is strengthening our Nation's infrastructure. It is absolutely imperative we build on the success of the FAST Act, the first multiyear surface transportation bill signed into law in more than a decade.  While this piece of legislation was critical to providing States and communities with the certainty they need, we must continue to invest in our Nation's bridges, roadways, ports, and other critical infrastructure.  I look forward to working with the administration and our colleagues in the Senate and in the House on legislation that will strengthen our Nation's infrastructure and do so in a fiscally responsible manner.  Finally, I hope to pass the bipartisan legislation that I have introduced to combat domestic human trafficking with my Democratic colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, this week. This has long been a priority of mine. The Abolish Human Trafficking Act is focused on getting victims of this heinous crime the help they need to rebuild their lives. In fact, as you talk to faith-based organizations and other people who are trying to help the victims of human trafficking, many times they will tell you the single thing these victims need the most is simply a safe place to live and heal and recover. That is what the Abolish Human Trafficking Act is focused on.  This bill reauthorizes the Justice Department's Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which was established in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bill that I authored and that was signed into law last  The Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund provides critical resources to connect victims with the services they need so they can recover and begin to heal. Part of that fund is financed through fines collected on the convicted traffickers themselves. It is a clear way we can use these fines for good. Last year, the fund provided about $5 million in victim services. By reauthorizing it, we can continue to serve even more people, more victims.  This bill also empowers victims by permanently reauthorizing the Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, survivors who annually advise the government on ways to combat this crime and lend a hand to victims. While this bill certainly focuses on human trafficking victims, we recognize that these victims may not have survived this form of modern-day slavery without the dedication of law enforcement officials fighting for these survivors every day. That is why our legislation also supports local and State law enforcement agencies, so they are able to carry out not only the ability to track down the perpetrators and convict them but also to receive additional training to help equip them on how best to serve the victims.  Ending this terrible crime is a cause every Member in this Chamber should be able to get behind. I look forward to passing the Abolish Human Trafficking Act with bipartisan support, hopefully, later this week.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Speaker, H.2131, or the DHS FIRM Act, seeks to ensure greater consistency and transparency in how discipline is administered across the Department of Homeland Discipline administered in a fair and equitable manner has a huge implication on job satisfaction.  Since 2003, DHS, a diverse, multimission Federal Department, has struggled with low morale. At the end of the prior administration, there was evidence that the DHS workforce was starting to feel a more fair and cooperative and supportive In 2016, the Office of Personnel Management reported a 3 percent increase in the annual Employee Viewpoint Survey, which indicated that DHS supported fairness and protection of employees from arbitrary action.  While the OPM survey results are positive indicators, more must be done by the current DHS leadership. This bill seeks to give the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer a more prominent role in ensuring that discipline is handled in an equitable and fair manner. Specifically, this bill charges the Chief Human Capital Officer with oversight of how employee misconduct is managed across all components.  To ensure fairness and transparency, the bill requires each component to accomplish a matrix of offenses and penalties that is tailored to the needs of that organization, and upon approval by the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer, such information to be shared with the workforce.  While it is essential that senior-level human capital personnel at DHS have a structure to address discipline, it is equally important that such discipline be administered in a fair and equitable manner. This is what this bill actually does.  Mr.Speaker, the implementation of a Departmentwide discipline and adverse action policy should improve employer and employee relations and communication.

3456,topic-id,386,"Mr.President, I have listened to some of my colleagues from across the aisle decry our desire to repeal and replace Yes, I do want to repeal and replace  Why? Why are we doing this?  Repealing and replacing ObamaCare is a means to an end. This is what I have heard from so many Here is the end, and I will sum it up into three items: 1, to lower costs; 2, to ensure that we save Medicaid--protect Medicaid--for the most vulnerable in our society; and, 3, to ensure that we protect those with preexisting conditions.  Some of my friends across the aisle want to see more government control of families' healthcare decisions--in fact, a complete government takeover. I believe that we need less government control, not more government control. Their gold standard for healthcare reform is really socialized medicine. It is called various things. Some call it government-run healthcare. Some call it single-payer healthcare. Some call it Medicare for all. But, in essence, it is socialized medicine.  The amendment that I am putting forward today is cut-and-pasted text. It is the exact, precise language. It is a carbon copy--down to every last comma and period--of Representative John Conyers' bill, who is the Representative from Michigan, which has 115 Democratic cosponsors as I speak. It is an impressive 60 percent of the Democratic caucus in the U.House that supports and, in fact, has cosponsored this very bill--this very amendment--that I am putting on the floor here today.  In addition to the 115 House Members, who on the Senate side supports this bill? Well, moveon.org has circulated a petition in support of the Conyers' bill, and the bill has been endorsed by hundreds and hundreds of labor groups, medical groups, political groups, and civic organizations.  Let me be clear. I believe that socialized medicine would be a disaster for the American people.

3777,topic-id,1195,"Madam President, over the last several months, there has been an important debate about healthcare--a debate between those who believe we can strengthen the American healthcare system by improving the Affordable Care Act and those who believe the law must be repealed and replaced. If you listen closely, however, the question at the heart of both sides of this debate sound oddly the same--how do we make sure Americans have access to quality healthcare they can afford? It is this shared concern about the affordability of quality healthcare and the recent actions of the Trump administration that I would like to discuss today.  For a moment, let's set aside the healthcare reform debate because whether we agree to work together in a bipartisan way to improve our healthcare system, as I strongly believe we should, or whether Republicans push through a partisan proposal to significantly change the way in which Americans receive healthcare, we should all be able to agree that we want to protect the stability of the insurance markets and access to quality, affordable healthcare. Yet, despite this shared objective, protecting the stability of our healthcare system has not been the approach of this administration. Instead, it has done the opposite. It has tried to drive change by creating instability and chaos.  On his first day in office, the President did not ask how he could fix the Affordable Care Act or improve the healthcare system. Instead, he began a deliberate, strategic effort to undermine the healthcare system, to drive up costs, and to create a scenario so painful for regular folks that we would have no choice but to rebuild the healthcare system from scratch.  On the day he was sworn in, President Trump signed an Executive order to exempt, to delay, and to defer the implementation and enforcement of the law, creating instability in the marketplaces where millions of Americans obtained the coverage they needed. The administration canceled enrollment efforts to attract younger and healthier Americans into the insurance markets. This resulted in an estimated 500,000 fewer Americans purchasing coverage. Most notably, the administration has refused to commit to continuing critical payments that lower deductibles and copays for our families. This drives up the costs for our friends and neighbors, and in some States, it drives insurance companies out of the market completely.  To be fair, though, the President has been straightforward about his strategy to undermine the Affordable Care Act, noting that the best thing we can do ``is to let ObamaCare explode. Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Democrats.''  For the President and many in Washington, healthcare seems to be a political exercise. I can assure you that for the citizens of my State back home in Terre Haute, in Richmond, in Fort Wayne, in Indianapolis, in Lawrenceburg, and in Evansville--particularly for those with preexisting conditions, including children, older Hoosiers, and people with disabilities--this is about a lot more. It is about the health and the well-being of our loved ones. It is about the financial security of our families. For many, it is a life-and-death issue.  This week, Indiana's insurance companies will submit their proposed healthcare rates for 2018 to the Indiana Department of It is the first step in a routine process that determines how much Hoosiers will be paid for critical healthcare coverage in the coming year. The 2018 filings, however, are likely to be anything but routine. Growing evidence across the country shows that the actions taken by the President and the administration, along with legislative uncertainty in Congress, have created instability and have created chaos in the insurance markets, resulting in significant cost increases for consumers.  Let me share just a few examples of what I am hearing from the insurance companies in my home State of The president and CEO of CareSource, an insurer that offers plans to Hoosiers through the insurance marketplace, told me that at the beginning of this year, the company was seeing rates stabilize, and if there was certainty regarding cost-sharing payments--those payments I previously discussed--rates would increase by about 2 percent--2 percent--in 2018 compared to 2017.  Now, though, the company is saying that, if the administration stops cost-sharing payments--and they have refused to commit to making those payments--rates for silver plans would increase by a minimum of 15 percent.  This is real money, real families, real healthcare, and real life-and-death decisions.  The president and CEO said: ``In addition, we believe that ceasing CSR payments may adversely impact the risk pools, potentially leading to further increases in future years.''  The chairman and CEO of Indianapolis-based Anthem said, in part, in a letter:       As I have stated publicly over the previous few months,      without certainty of CSR funding . . . Anthem will have no      choice but to reevaluate our approach to filing 2018 rates.       Such adjustments could include reducing service area      participation, requesting additional rate increases,      eliminating certain product offerings, and/or exiting certain      individual ACA-compliant markets altogether.  Let me be clear. These cost increases, limits on product offerings, and market exits are not the result of the current law or even the healthcare system. This is a deliberate choice. They are the result of a deliberate choice by the President to undermine the healthcare law at the expense of real people--moms, dads, sisters, brothers, sons, and daughters.  This makes no sense. If your house needs repairs, you don't set the house on fire. You work to fix the issues.  If we are serious about improving healthcare in this country, we can do it, and we can do it by working together. In my home State of Indiana, I was proud to work with then-Indiana Governor and now Vice President Mike[[Page S3570]]Pence when he used ObamaCare to establish a program we call the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP, 2.0. The innovative plan expanded healthcare coverage to over 200,000 Hoosiers, and it helped to reduce the uninsured rate in Indiana by 30 percent--30 percent.  Our Vice President called this program a ``national model'' to provide affordable healthcare to our most vulnerable citizens and treatment to those struggling with opioid abuse and heroin use, which is an absolute scourge on our country.  We can improve our healthcare system by working together, but the first step is to do no harm--to stop doing damage to the current system and to the people who rely on it.  Healthcare is not a game. It is life and death. This is about people's health. It is about economic security. It is about real lives.  I hope my Republican colleagues and the administration will immediately stop these efforts to damage our healthcare system and will work with all of us on our shared goal to make quality healthcare more affordable. There is way too much at stake for Hoosiers and for all the people in our beloved country.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

If this is something that will affect every American, family, business, and individual and if they are proud of what they have done, why did they wait so long?

It has a great name. I am sure somebody invested time thinking about this one: The Health Care Freedom It appears that for 16 million Americans, they will be free of health insurance protection; 16 million Americans will lose their health insurance protection because of this Republican plan. Every other American buying health insurance will be free to pay 20 percent more each year for the premiums on their health insurance. You don't have to be a math major to figure out compound interest at 20 percent a year. By the fourth year, you are knocking on a 100-percent increase in your premiums. Your health insurance premiums will double in about 4 years under the Republican plan.  Is that why they started this debate, so they could take health insurance away from millions of Americans and raise the cost of health insurance for others? Four Senators had a press conference this evening at 5 p.m. I watched it carefully. I listened as my colleagues came to the floor and those four Senators described this plan. They had seen it, this so-called skinny repeal plan. One of the Senators said that this plan was a ``fraud,'' it was a ``disaster,'' it would have a disastrous impact on the premiums charged to people he represented in his State, and it didn't achieve the goal of reforming and repairing the Affordable Care I will quickly add--because you will think, well, we expect the Democrats to say that--this was a press conference of four Republican Senators about 6 hours ago. They had read the Republican plan and called it a ``fraud,'' a ``disaster,'' raising premiums, and not really bringing reform to healthcare in  It will take only one of those four Senators to stand up and speak up and vote no for the right thing to happen--for this proposal to go to committee where it should have started and to be considered by the experts first, so we know its real impact, and then to have an amendment process where better ideas might be offered and debated and added to this proposal--benefits voted out of committee. Then bring it to the floor of the U.Senate for the same thing to happen.  Do you know who came up with the radical idea that we should go through the committee process and both parties participate in writing this reform? None other than Senator John He came to this floor a couple of days ago. It was a historic moment. Everyone--both political parties--was cheering this man whom we have served with and love and respect. And he warned us. He warned us that if we didn't do this together--Democrats and Republicans--the results would be terrible.  Can you afford terrible results when it comes to healthcare for your family, for you, for your baby? Of course, you can't. We have to do our level best not to win the political debate but to win the confidence of the American people that we understand how to make healthcare better and more responsive in  I have been through a lot of measures, and I have voted on a lot of things over the years. My proudest vote was for the Affordable Care Act, because I knew we would extend the reach, protection, and peace of mind of health insurance to millions of Americans.[[Page S4405]]  I had an experience early in my life. I was newly married and had a brand new baby girl with a serious health issue, and I had no health insurance--none. I went to the local hospital here, waiting in the charity ward, in the hopes that the doctor who walked through that door would be the one who would save my baby's life. I thought to myself: I will never let that happen again. I will have health insurance, no matter what it takes, the rest of my life. I know the feeling, and some others do too.  I don't want American families and individuals to go through this. I want them to have the peace of mind and protection of good health insurance. That is why this Republican proposal taking health insurance away from 16 million Americans is such a travesty. That is why the notion of raising health insurance costs beyond the reach of working families is so wrong and so disgraceful, and that is why, with the help of one more Republican Senator, we can send this measure back to a committee where it can be seriously considered, worked on, improved, and passed so that we can say to the American people: We did our job as We did what John McCain challenged us to do--to come together on a bipartisan basis and to make this a better bill.  I am glad my colleagues are here this evening. I am glad to see my friend from the State of Wyoming who is here. We have worked on many issues together. We disagree on this one, but I hope that he will realize and the others will, too, that this secret that they have kept from the American people is plain wrong. It is a secret that now it has been outed. It has to be put to rest. Let's do this the right way. Let's do it for the well-being and health of America families across this  I yield the floor.

3515,topic-id,913,"Mr.President, I yield myself such time as I need, up to the limit that we have. This week, we have been debating why it is so urgent for Congress to act on rescuing Americans from the collapsing ObamaCare healthcare law.  We have heard from our colleagues across the aisle, questioning our motives and our actions. Congress literally has millions upon millions of reasons to replace and repeal this law. Hard-working American families are begging us to provide them with some relief. These are families who are forced to purchase high-deductible coverage insurance and are facing thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket costs before their coverage even begins. For them, the status quo--doing nothing--is not an option.  For Senate Republicans, rescuing the American people from this law is our only option. But the defenders of this law don't seem to grasp--or are unwilling to admit--that ObamaCare is not affordable insurance and has been a crisis-inducing failure. This is why Republicans are working to fix the damage. Insurance markets are collapsing, premiums are soaring, and healthcare choices are disappearing.  Americans expect the Congress and the President to address the problem. With ObamaCare getting worse by the day, the time to act is now. Just look at my home State of Wyoming, which is down to one insurer in the individual market, both on and off the exchange. This should be treated as the national scandal it is.  Some on the other side of the aisle like to focus on how many people are insured under the law, but let's look at how many are not insured. Almost 28 million Americans remain without insurance under ObamaCare because they cannot afford insurance or no longer have access to it due to ObamaCare's collapsing markets in their State or county. But coverage numbers can be misleading because, even with insurance, many hard-working families still cannot afford the care due to surging deductibles. Insurance with sky-high deductibles is coverage in name only.  When it comes to Medicaid coverage, what most news stories will not tell you is that the newly insured gained coverage only through a flawed Medicaid Program that is providing inferior quality and threatening to bankrupt States across the  The Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, famously said that Congress would have to pass the bill to find out what's in it. Well, Americans soon discovered that President Obama and congressional Democrats focused almost exclusively on coverage numbers boosted by government mandates handed down from Washington, instead of true healthcare reforms that might have actually provided better care, provided affordable care. Obama's alleged coverage numbers are only on paper. Coverage was their sacred cow, worshipped[[Page S4386]]above all others, because for President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, coverage equaled healthcare.  Large coverage numbers touted by the Obama administration and congressional Democrats have proved to have the healthcare utility of a pet rock. Do you remember the pet rock? Millions of people purchased a rock. It was very nicely packaged in a box. They would bring it home and open it up and find a rock. Pet or not, it served no purpose other than its name: a pet rock.  This is essentially how ObamaCare has worked, except people were forced to purchase this marketing gimmick. Americans have purchased insurance through ObamaCare exchanges with the promise of accessible coverage. What they actually received, however, is coverage in name only. It serves no healthcare purpose, and it doesn't work--merely packaging a pet rock, if you will--and millions of Americans soon found out. The high cost of insurance plans they forced people to buy made it nearly impossible for them to pay for the coverage they signed up for, or if they could afford coverage, they realized the care they were paying for came with sky-high deductibles.  Congressional Democrats and President Obama focused almost exclusively on the numbers of people now enrolled in ObamaCare and relentlessly highlighted this information, which showed this law was used mainly for public relations purposes at a large cost, as opposed to an actual policy accomplishment. Instead, the reality is that Americans who were able to get insurance were often plagued with inadequate coverage, joined with enormous out-of-pocket costs. Senators from across the country this week have been sharing stories about families in their States who have had to forgo medical care, not because they don't have insurance but because it was simply too expensive to go to the doctor under the ObamaCare health plan.  For years, Republicans have pledged to repeal this disastrous law, and this week we are working to address the broken promises of ObamaCare to help ensure better care for each and every We are doing this by working to stabilize collapsing insurance markets that have left millions of Americans with no options, which will help improve the affordability of health insurance and therefore healthcare. Our goal is to preserve access to care for Americans with preexisting conditions and to safeguard Medicaid for those who need it most by giving States more flexibility, while ensuring that those who rely on this program won't have the rug pulled out from under them. Most importantly, Republicans hope to free the American people from onerous ObamaCare mandates that require them to purchase insurance they don't want or can't afford.  The President and Republicans in Congress last fall promised to rescue the millions of American families suffering under ObamaCare, which is what this bill will do.

3554,topic-id,628,"Mr.President, I heard somebody say that nobody was listening. Well, I was listening. I have read a little bit from this book before on the floor about healthcare. It is called ``Demystifying ObamaCare'' by David Brown, who is a doctor. He does a marvelous job of going through the history of how we got to where we are.  He says, maybe we need to answer the question: ``What does ObamaCare do? What does ObamaCare purport to do? What does ObamaCare not do?''  He says that those answers are relatively simple.       ObamaCare is not a system of healthcare, nor is it a      healthcare reform. It is a system of healthcare control.       ObamaCare was supposed to significantly reduce healthcare      costs, but instead it has dramatically increased costs for      even those who are not directly within the ObamaCare program.       ObamaCare was supposed to increase access to care, but      instead it can actually reduce access (availability) of care.       ObamaCare reduces the effectiveness of the safety net      program, which is so very important to economically poor            The quality of healthcare in America was derided when      ObamaCare was passed, but ObamaCare instead reduces the      quality of U.healthcare by reducing innovation.  And then he says:       ObamaCare removes a person's ability to make his own      decisions about his healthcare and that of his family. It      does so by removing the freedom to make those decisions.  He continues that what we are trying to do is correct those problems and get back to a system of healthcare where the patient and the doctor get to make some of the decisions, where we encourage more people to be in the system, where we expand the use of HSAs, refundable tax credits, where we also allow people to buy insurance across State lines.  We could put money back into State high-level risk pools. In fact, I really like the invisible risk pools that allow people to continue to pay what they were paying before, but to get the unique care.  We could ``pass Medicaid to the States in terms of `block grants' or `per capita allotments,' '' and we could ``partially privatize Medicare starting in 2024 with the premium support system.''  That is not in the bill; I am reading suggestions that he gives, including ``cap the amount for tax exclusions in higher cost employer-based plans.''  Now, you need to know that in the proposals that we have been putting out, in spite of what I have been hearing on this side, kids under 26 still get to be on their parents' insurance. We are not taking that off. I keep hearing we are eliminating the preexisting conditions. We are not. There hasn't been a proposal to eliminate the preexisting conditions. So quit saying that. That is just fearmongering. As to eliminating the lifetime caps on insurance, I haven't heard a proposal for that. Also, allowing people to continue to be insured even if they change jobs--that is what this guy wrote in the book, and I would like for everybody to read it.  He said there are five factors that drive up healthcare costs. One is taxes, another is mandates. Another is regulations. Another is lack of competition and flexibility within the marketplace. As to the fifth one, I don't know of anybody addressing yet, but it is the medical liability system that encourages defensive medicine and drives the costs up.  Seniors need to be protected. There needs to be an effective and viable safety net system. Nobody is trying to work against that, regardless of what you are hearing here.  I understand my time has expired.

3581,topic-id,991,"No, I will not yield for a question.  When I feel like there is something constructive that is going to be done around here--I remember that one of the Senators on the other side of the aisle said: If you just take Medicaid out, I will be for it. Well, Medicaid is not in this version so that ought to be some kind of a commitment on it.  I keep referring to this book, which goes back to a lot of the history that we have experienced around here. Here is what has happened, and all of this is footnoted. I was reading at first the footnotes. I didn't check out all the footnotes, but I did look to see if they were footnoted.  Under the bill that we are trying to make some changes to, there have been costs from new taxes. There are 21 taxes that have been included in ObamaCare, but the most enormous one is the increased taxes on healthcare companies that are then passed on to the public as higher costs for insurance and pharmaceuticals.  I have heard that word ``pharmaceuticals'' thrown out a lot, and I agree there are things that need to be changed there. I do remember the pharmaceuticals joining in on the process of getting ObamaCare passed because they did this little thing with the pharmaceutical Part D, where there was this doughnut hole, and through the doughnut hole we were hoping that people would switch to generic, but the pharmaceutical companies said: No, no, no. If you will stick with the brand name, we will cover you through the doughnut hole. Do you know why? Because people, as they go through the doughnut hole, go beyond the doughnut hole, and beyond the doughnut hole the Federal Government picks up the cost of the name brands--the name brand pharmaceuticals. My insurance commissioner was by to visit with me, and he mentioned that I have twins in Wyoming, and they have a rare disease. There is a prescription for it, and the prescription is costing $30,000 a year each. Well, that is quite a bit of money, and the insurance company is picking that up. Then the name brand pharmaceutical company bought out the generic one. This was generics they were getting.  So now they have to have name brand because the generic isn't on the market now. The cost? It is $1.6 million for each kid, each year.  That is why the companies, why the insurance companies are dropping out[[Page S4409]]of the market. I mean, Wyoming is the least populated State in the Nation, and an insurance company that is limited to Wyoming is going to have to bear that $3.2 million worth of cost. So they are going to be saying: We are the only ones covering Wyoming; maybe we shouldn't provide insurance in Wyoming either. We lost the other two companies already, and we are down to just one, but we have one, and they cover all of the counties, unlike--it kind of surprised me that the rules allow companies to just do some counties in some  Also, under ObamaCare, the insurance plans have to cover more.       This includes plans for the patient who may not want a      particular coverage but has to have this. [It comes under      the] essential health benefits, which are required through      This led to 5 million Americans losing their insurance      in the individual market.       Reduction of lower cost plans. High deductible [health      savings accounts] are very important in reducing costs for      individuals, families, and businesses. A RAND study in 2011      found that an HSA/high deductible plan (with a deductible of      at least $1,000) would reduce healthcare spending an average      of 14%. That savings incurred not only for patients but also      for employers and for total healthcare expenditures. These      more effective plans have been reduced under  Most of the young people on my staff were getting HSAs, and the reason they did is because they did a little bit of a calculation. They did a little bit of financial literacy. They looked to see what the plan was for the full coverage, and then they looked to see what an HSA would cost, and they said: Well, gee, if I take the difference in the cost between the regular insurance and the HSAs and I put that in one of these savings accounts that can grow tax-free, in a maximum of 3 years, I will cover any deductible that I might have.  So they considered that to be good insurance and they got to make a lot of their decisions.  But I don't think we want individuals making their decisions; that appears to be how ObamaCare is constructed.  Then there is an increase in mandates, which is item 4.       Mandates existed before ObamaCare but have dramatically      increased with It added mandates ``guaranteed      issue and community ratings.'' Both have been previously      tried in the states. Such mandates distort the marketplace      and drive up the cost of care. Policies within states that      had more mandates could actually have doubled the cost of      [their] premiums.       5. Increased costs by constricting hospitals and physician      systems. There has been consolidation with increased hospital      mergers by 50% compared with 2009. There has also been      movement of doctor's practices to connect with hospital      systems and both the contractures within the hospital system      and then physician's systems increased costs to the patients.      For example, group practice charges increased costs 18% to      20% and specialty care charges increased costs even more, 34%      after connecting the care with hospital systems. These      changes in care i.e. changing from private practice systems      into hospital-based systems have significantly driven up the      cost of care for the patients.       6. Medical legal liability reform has not been a part of      ObamaCare but is a significant driver of healthcare costs.  That is not considered in it, and it is considered to be about a 10 to 25 percent increase in total costs.

Co-ops are an interesting thing. I was suggesting during the time that ObamaCare was being considered that small business health plans might make a real difference in costs for small businesses. Now, the only thing I can see on small businesses in here is that if you are a small business and you have over 50 employees, you have a problem.  I have people in Wyoming who come to me and say: I have this business. It is working really well, and in the next town over--and most of the towns aren't big enough to hold two of the same kind of store--so in the next town over, I would like to put in the same kind of shop.  My question to them is: How many employees do you have?  Most of them have said: Well, I have about 48 employees.  I said: How many will you need in the other store?  They said: Well, I hope to need the same amount of people.

As I have been through this process for a long time now--I have been on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for the whole time that I have been here, which is 20 years. Of course, it wasn't Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions when I first got here, but we thought that that was a clever acronym: We are from the Federal Government, and we are here to help you. There are a lot of people back home who don't think we really help out much.  But, at any rate, the small business health plans, after three of us who were in the Gang of 6 got thrown under the train or under the bus or whatever it was, small business health plans were changed to co-ops, and they were given a significant amount of money to work with, and they haven't fared very well.  I will find the information about the co-ops here. Again, this isn't stuff that I wrote; this is stuff somebody else wrote and footnoted and sent to all of us.

So there are things that need to be done. They could be done. We have tried to do it in this bill, again, without constructive suggestions from the other side. For any recognition that there was any problem that ought to be solved, we have gone ahead. It is not my choice for the mechanism that would be used; it is the mechanism that was chosen by leadership and it falls to them. One of the things that makes this difficult is it is a budget reconciliation, so there are things that have to be written in a budget form in order to comply. That limits some of the things that I would have liked to have done that I think would have made quite a difference. And I think there would have been some things the other side might have joined on and been excited about too. But, again, we are limited by the mechanism that we have here, and there is no indication that----  ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.txt,1542,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,27.0,July

I have listened for the last hour, and I didn't get any satisfaction out of that either. I did sit through all of it. I did listen to it. Again, it is complaints about the process, but not constructive suggestions on what could be done.  There are taxes, mandates, regulations, lack of competition in the marketplace, increasing costs. When I travel across Wyoming, I have people who have come up to me and they say: My insurance premium is bigger than my house payment, and it is growing.  And they said: If something happens to us, my deductible is bigger than my year's premium. That shouldn't happen in America, but that is where we are. Those aren't isolated cases; those are a lot of cases. That is the situation we find ourselves in. We are not trying to hurt anybody; we are trying to fix some of these things.  As I said, for 8 years, every time there has been a waiver--that is part of that thing that I mentioned about the 70 changes to ObamaCare so far--a lot of those were in the way of waivers.  Every time there was a waiver, I said: Why are we waiving this? Why don't we just fix it?  I was told: It is not broke; it just needs more time.  Well, it has had more time. Last year--this was before the election, so you can't blame us. We had no idea who was going to be the We had no idea who was going to be in the majority.

3599,topic-id,896,"Mr.President, I think what we have is a motion to commit and the right for the other side to do other amendments. I would hope that some of them would be constructive, but I am not expecting that. As I said, I have been listening for 3 days and actually listening a lot longer before that time.  I could talk about some of the things we can learn from ObamaCare, because we should. We can learn that decisions have to be made by the patients and not by the bureaucrats for the government. There are some key examples of when the government starts making those decisions. I don't have to pick on ObamaCare for it necessarily; the VA has had a few problems, and I am sure all of you have been working casework on what the VA has been doing. That is where the government and the bureaucrats are making decisions. We have been through some enormous times on that. That is why we did the Choice And the Choice Act had a lot of problems. That is government healthcare.  People say: Well, Choice got to go outside of the government.  That is not quite true. I think the folks with the VA picked the companies you have to go through for healthcare, and when they did, they didn't want it to be efficient. They wanted as much of it as possible to come back to the I am sure all of us, as we travel across our States, are running into people who are having problems with providers not getting paid or not being able to get their appointments. If you check with the providers, you find out what kind of a terrible process they have to go through to get paid. That is government healthcare.  In my State, I provide the VA with a list every week of the new cases I have of people who are not getting care. That shouldn't happen. But they told me when I first inquired: Well, there are only two doctors who haven't been paid.  I said: That is impossible. There are more than two doctors in my own town who haven't been paid, and there are a lot of towns in Wyoming--when I go to them, I hear that they are not paid.  They said: One was not paid for 30 days, and one wasn't paid for 45 days.  I said: Well, I don't know why either one wasn't paid before those kinds of deadlines.  But I can tell you there are a lot more problems than that.  So if we are thinking about going to a Federal healthcare--and I guess we are not because we had that vote a little bit earlier on whether we would have a single-payer system. I was amazed at the number of people who chose not to vote on that. At any rate, I don't think that is where America wants to go. I have had some people ask me about that. I have given them some suggestions on where to check to see what kind of care they would get under that, and they have come back[[Page S4411]]to me and said: I don't think that is where we want to go.  I know the other side of the aisle has wanted to go that way for a long time. When I first got here, Phil Gramm was one of my mentors, and I really appreciated all of his advice in so many areas. One of the things he said to me was, you have to watch out for healthcare because where the Democrats want to go is to single-payer healthcare. In other words, they don't care who drives the train as long as it wrecks.  So I look back on ObamaCare and I say: Man, this was 18, 19, 20 years ago that he told me this. Is that where ObamaCare is supposed to go, to wreck the train so we can go to single-payer? I don't think so, but I think we are on the way to a train wreck, and I am not hearing a lot of disagreement about the train wreck. I am hearing some disagreement about the amount of calamity in the train wreck but not on whether there is going to be a train wreck.  There are a number of things we could do to take care of the costs that have gone up under this. That can be confronted within a free market as opposed to the government-run, government-controlled market we are under now. One of them is to reduce the tax burden. I did notice that I have a lot of people in Wyoming--again, we are one of the smallest or least populated in the We are big in land mass, but we are small in population--In Wyoming, $5.6 million was collected from people for fines for not having the adequate healthcare.  Those were people who said: Wait a minute, I have to spend so much on my healthcare and then a high deductible that I am never going to get anything out of it. So when I calculate the annual cost, the $1,700 that I have to pay as the fine--or $1,500, somewhere in that range--is cheaper than paying for all those premiums and then a deductible if anything ever happens to me.  These are real people I am talking about.  ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.txt,1542,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,27.0,July
3601,topic-id,244,"I allowed the other side to have their hour. I expect to have this hour, even if some of it is in silence.  I mentioned reducing the tax burden.  We could also eliminate some regulations. We really need to take a look at some of those regulations within the essential health benefits and see if everybody needs all of them or if there are some they would opt out of, given the opportunity, because they know they will never need them. There are a lot of examples of that.  We could eliminate the mandates from the Federal and We have the elimination of the Federal mandates in this bill, both the individual mandate and the employer mandate.  We could also increase competition within the marketplace by increasing flexibility. Some of these things we can't do, particularly to the level we would like to do them, but we could have more competition if we could increase the number of insurance companies. Competition makes a difference.  I have had a number of people, though, who have suggested to me that the biggest thing we could do would be to pass the medical liability reform because doctors are practicing defensive medicine, which drives up the cost, so that if they are ever in a lawsuit, they can prove they did every possible thing that they could ever imagine or that anybody could raise as an issue. There is a cost to doing that. One of the suggestions----  ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.txt,1542,1815,2017.0,27.0,July

3605,topic-id,220,"It has been suggested that the government could have an appropriate role in healthcare by maybe using advanceable, refundable credits to prevent any lapse in coverage. One of the problems we have right now is that people can wait until they have something terrible happen to them, and they can sign up for insurance on the way to the hospital--you can't pay when you are in the ambulance, and you can't pay when you are getting treatment, and you can't pay when you are getting rehab--and when they are done, they drop out of it. It is hard for an insurance company to figure in the cost of something they are not going to get paid for at all.  There have been a number of suggestions. I don't know whether they are any good. I could throw them out. One of them is that if you don't keep continuous coverage, you should have to pick up your own expenses for the first 6 months. That would encourage people to have continuous coverage. It is just one possible suggestion.  There is a role for government within this setting, and that is requiring some transparency within the system, encouraging the development of new healthcare competition, prevention of collusion between healthcare companies, and having prices posted.

3608,topic-id,500,"When I was chairman or when Senator Kennedy was chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we switched from doing hearings to doing roundtables. That was an interesting experience too. Instead of having all of the witnesses except one picked by the majority and the other one picked by the minority and then everybody coming up to beat up on the person who was in the opposite field, we went to roundtables.  What you do with a roundtable is you pick 2 or 6 or 8 or 10 people who are actually knowledgeable in that field, who have actually done something, who have had their hands on what we were talking about.  I remember the first one. One of the questions at the end was by Senator Kennedy, and he asked the witnesses that he and I had selected. This wasn't me selecting; this was a joint effort selecting them. He said: What do you think about single-payer insurance? As they went around, there was only one out of 10 people who said: Well, it might be a good idea, but we probably ought to take a look at it. The rest of them said: It won't work in We are already used to something different.  When the hearing was over, Senator Kennedy said to me: You know, I think these roundtables are a good idea. I think it is a good thing to kind of hear about what the people are actually experiencing out there before we write the bill.  Well, we did a lot of healthcare roundtables. One of the witnesses was from Safeway had been able to hold their costs level and started to bring them down. Of course, we were interested in anybody who could hold healthcare costs level or bring them down. The way they had done that was to find out what the costs of different procedures were in the area where they had stores. After they knew what the cost of the procedure was, they could take the median price for whatever it was, and if the people in their store would take the median price, it didn't cost them anything. If they went above the median price, they had to pay the difference. If they went below the median price, they got the difference. So they were actually paying attention, using some financial literacy in any of the treatments they needed to get, and they appreciated that their company had done this research for them in advance so they could have some kind of an idea of what the market held. He estimated that if they were able to increase the flexibility they had with this, they could bring down their costs by about 5 to 7 percent a year.  I worked on a 10-step plan--in conjunction with Senator Kennedy on a lot of it--and talked about it across the country and particularly across It would have been 10 steps to get healthcare for everyone without mandates but with incentives.

CO-OPS were included in       These plans were meant to provide competition with existing      health insurance companies.  It was an opportunity to set up insurance companies that actually were funded.       The CO-OPS were given $2.4 billion in ``federal loans.''       The CO-OPS were prohibited from having former healthcare      executives with managerial or accrual experience.       The CO-OPS were conceived to drive down the premiums by      providing competition and underselling the cost for policies.

3613,topic-id,2124,"Continuing:       The [Health and Human Services] and administration      officials knew that the CO-OPS were at risk even before they      received their first ``loan'' in 2014. Senator Rob Portman,      Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on      Investigations, said that the HHS knew of serious problems      concerning the failed CO-OPS enrollment strategies, pricing      and financial management before the department ever approved      their initial loans.       Mandy Cohen, the director of the CMS, testified before      a House subcommittee that 8 of the 11 remaining CO-OP      companies were in serious financial difficulty and receiving      ``enhanced oversight'' and ``corrective action.'' Cohen      did not explain what that ``corrective action'' or ``enhanced      oversight'' consisted of nor could she indicate the      enrollment figures and the possibility of financial survival      for the CO-OPS that were being monitored.       Also, 4 more CO-OPS have failed over the first half of      2016, leaving only 7 remaining.  I am not sure what today's number is.       The HHS continued to make these federal loans though they      knew the CO-OPS were failing.  Under the small business health plans, there is no requirement to have the Federal Government fund it unless we want to fund more oversight. I am not opposed to that either.       So What are the American People Think of This?       There has been greater than $1 billion dollar loss of      taxpayer money to CO-OPS that have gone bankrupt.       Only 7 of the initial 23 CO-OPS remain in business.       The CO-OPS were constructed as a way of providing      competition against existing companies, however in order to      do that they underpriced their products. No company can      survive if they take in less than what they put out in      services and understandably, the majority of CO-OPS have gone      out of business.  That could be something to do with their being prohibited from having former healthcare executives with managerial and accrual experience.       This was known by the HHS before the first ``federal      loans'' had ever been approved.       Over 800,000 people have lost their insurance because the      CO-OPS have gone out of business and there are more to come.       It speaks to the fact that the HHS and ObamaCare      Administration had very little regard for the American      taxpayer and the American people.       The disturbing question is whether any of the taxpayer's      money will be returned.  I did say those were loans, and there aren't many left that can pay back the loans, which is a little bit of a difficulty.  Of course we did hear that ObamaCare was supposed to bend the cost curve down. I ought to point out some facts on that as well.       From 2009 to 2012 healthcare, spending grew less than 4      percent, as spending started increasing dramatically in the      first quarter of 2014. This was the start of the      implementation of the legislation. Subsequent healthcare      spending from 2015 showed a 6.8% rise. In 2016, it is      estimated to increase to 6.5% spending growth.  We know from last year, which isn't included in this, that it started doubling at that point.       Deductibles both inside and outside ObamaCare exchanges      have increased enormously and will continue to increase.      Healthcare costs are now increasing more than inflation.       Why has spending increased? There has been increased      utilization services. The increased healthcare spending thus      led to higher insurance costs. A particular cause of      increased spending related to ObamaCare is a marked increase      in deductibles and health insurance premiums in the ObamaCare      exchanges. Additionally, because of the increased number of      patients with Medicaid expansion there have been increased      costs. Healthcare costs [will] continue to rise.       The total healthcare spending for 2016 is to increase to      over $3 trillion dollars.  I will get some updated numbers on that.       Total healthcare spending . . . rate of spending increase.       Medicaid increased: 11%       Medicare increased: 5.5%       Private insurance spending increased: 4.4%.  If I would have known that Medicare was going to be mentioned, even though it is not in the bill, I would have shown the little chart that I have, which shows how much revenue we get for different mandatory spending that we have.       All of those mandatory spendings are in a little bit of      trouble because the revenue streams to take care of them are      not sufficient. At one point, they were sufficient in some of      them, and the federal government doesn't have any place to      park cash. The federal government puts bonds in a drawer and      spends the cash. That is kind of double dipping because there      is nothing there for later. There is a Social Security trust      fund.  I have learned from trust funds that you have to find money to put in before you can take money out. I never saw a trust fund that operated that way until I got here. We have some crises that are coming up. We are going to compound healthcare because for Federal pensions, we really don't put any money away for them. We require businesses to put it away, and we have had some other suggestions. I have some small pension plans I would like people to look at, some pooling for that, which I think would encourage more people to have pension plans in small business.       But the cost of administration is extremely high unless      they can share in that. All of them would require that there      be money put away to be able to cover with reasonable growth      in the interest of the fund so that what was promised could      be taken care of.  In 2006, Senator Kennedy and I worked on saving some pension plans, trying to make sure that promises that were made could be met. We did a pension bill that needs to be redone again, particularly for some sectors of the pension.       The private sector is required to put away money. When the      market goes down, it increases dramatically the amount of      money that they need to put in and creates some problems for      business.  The point I am making is that the Federal Government doesn't do that with any excess funds we get. I don't care if it is in healthcare or Social Security or where it is, those excess funds are allowed to be spent with bonds put in a drawer, with the promise that the full faith and credit of the Federal Government will cover them. I don't know how many people at home believe that, but that is what it is.  How has the battle for the quality of healthcare fared? This gets covered in this book too.  Here is a little bit on the quality of healthcare and outcomes.       The infant mortality rate . . . has been used by      politicians and others in political debate to describe the      inferiority of the U.healthcare [system]. U.ranked only      30th in the world (and the neonatal mortality below that).      When you look at this data, however, you find a very      different picture. The United States followed the World      Health Organization definition that a live birth is any      infant[[Page S4413]]     that shows any sign of life, i.e. a baby that takes a single      breath or has a heartbeat. . . . Other countries however      including both developed and underdeveloped countries use      different standards. The definition of ``live births'' varies      between different countries. For example, in Switzerland a      newborn has to be 30 cm. long to be considered a live birth.      In Belgium and France, infants have to be at least 26 weeks      to be considered as live births. Infants less than 24 weeks      gestational age are excluded from registries of live birth in      multiple other countries including Japan and Hong In      Canada, Germany, and Austria, the newborns weighing less than      500 grams are not considered viable and are excluded from the      infant mortality rates.  What I am saying is, there are games that can be done with that, with the performance ratings, with the life expectancy data, with the Commonwealth All of these things are issues that we are embarrassed about and things we ought to be working on, things we ought to improve, things we ought to help with our country.  We need to be looking at all of those outcomes--the cancer outcomes, the cardiac disease outcomes, the stroke outcomes, the chronic illness outcomes, the hypertension outcomes, the diabetes and cholesterol outcomes.       We know that the earlier and more effective there is      treatment of the disease, the better treatment of the disease      for chronic disease, the better the results are. The more      accessible and better technology there is, the more access to      specialty care for early diagnosis and treatment, better      preventive screening, and the inventiveness of the American      people.  I think it was today--my days blend together these days with this healthcare that we are working on. I was visited by a couple of young people from Wyoming who have diabetes. We have put some additional money into research. We, as a Senate, don't say exactly where that money has to go because we shouldn't be kicking the tires on the different diseases and figuring that out. I worry about where we might put the money, if that were the case, because we are affected differently than what our constituents are.  Both of these young people were on a pump, and I have gotten to meet Dean Kamen who invented the pump. It is kind of an interesting story. Of course, that wasn't his first medical invention. His first medical invention was actually when he was a junior in high school and his brother was doing a residency in a hospital that handled transplants for infants. They were mentioning some devices similar to a needle in which medicine can evidently go through. This was needed for transplant of a kidney. He was lamenting they didn't have that capability. He went down to the basement and figured out how to make one of those. That was his first patent. You probably know him more for the patents of the  After he made some money, he got to experiment with some different things. One of them is that mobile thing that police use and shopping centers use and tourists use where you ride around on a He built that for a specific medical purpose, which was to figure out a way to have a wheelchair that could climb stairs. Instead of building a ramp and being limited where there wasn't a ramp, he figured out a wheelchair that could climb stairs. It could do a number of other things too. For instance, if the person in a wheelchair went to a cocktail party, they could rotate the wheels up so they were at standing level to everybody else.  He had a lot of problems getting it through He finally got it through FDA, then was told there are other wheelchairs that are less expensive so we are not going to pay for that. I think another company is coming back in to do that. It is an outstanding experience to sit in a wheelchair and go downstairs with it.  He worked on this diabetic pump. It is interesting how he got into the diabetic pump. He was told pregnant women who are on insulin, if they take the insulin doses, they wind up often with babies that have a bigger head, which makes the delivery a bit more difficult. Everything changes so the head becomes normal after a period of time, but it is a problem at childbirth. He thought, what if we gave them a dose of insulin over a longer period of time; would that have an effect on the infant? So he invented a machine which started out being a fairly good-sized machine, but it worked. If they got their insulin over a slow period of time, but sufficient insulin, the baby didn't have the larger head.  Well, this man is a businessman. He said: That is good. That will provide part of a market, but there ought to be a bigger market for it. He said: I wonder if men would have any benefit from having a diabetic pump? So he was able to have a trial and found out that also worked. He worked it down to be smaller and smaller and is working on other kinds of inventions that will do better things.  We need to keep putting things into innovation. I said a lot of times: If there is a problem in America and we put on a small incentive, there will be somebody who will figure out how to turn that into something very useful.

Today I am celebrating the life and legacy of my father-in-law, Mr.Elwyn Mr.Bass was more commonly known as Sam to his friends, and he passed away on April 26, 2017.  Sam was born in Vealmoor, Texas, on January 26, 1934. At the young age of 16, he graduated from Ackerly High Upon graduation from Ackerly, Sam married a beautiful young woman, Johnette Carr, and went on to attend Baylor University in While at Baylor, he joined the United States  After finishing his service in the Army and following his graduation from Baylor, Sam devoted his career to public education. He began that career by serving as a teacher and principal at Dawson High He later served as superintendent for Grady ISD in west Texas, followed by service as superintendent for Follett ISD, a small town in the Texas His next position was superintendent of schools at Stratford Independent School District in my hometown of Stratford, a Texas community in the northwest part of the panhandle.  In 1990, Sam retired after 35 years of service to the Texas public school system. At that time, he was so beloved by the Stratford community that our local sports stadium was named ``Sam'' Bass Stadium in his honor.  At the beginning of his retirement, he moved to east Texas and lived in a home that he constructed with his own hands and with a little help from friends and family.  Sam suffered a loss in 1992 when Johnette, his beloved wife of 42 years, passed away.  In 1994, he married Jo Anna Soon thereafter, he returned to education, teaching and coaching basketball for 10 years at Faith Lutheran School in Sugar Land,  Sam was known as a generous and caring man who was active in the community. He remained active throughout his life in the churches he attended, serving as a deacon at the First Baptist Church in Stratford and on the board at Parkway United Methodist Church in Sugar Sam was known for his strong Christian faith and for his love of old hymns, a few of which he sang off key. His friends and family will always remember how he saw the good in people and his positive outlook on life.  Mr.Bass' life reminds me of a passage from a book, entitled, ``The Applause of Heaven,'' written by Max In that book, he has a moving passage which describes all of our lives. The passage reads as follows: ``You'll be home soon. You may not have noticed it, but you are closer to home than ever before. Each moment is a step taken. Each breath is a page turned. Each day is a mile marked, a mountain climbed. You are closer to home than you've ever been. Before you know it, your appointed arrival time will come; you'll descend the ramp and enter the You'll see the faces that are waiting for you. You'll hear your name spoken by those who love you. And maybe, just maybe--in the back, behind the crowd--the One who would rather die than live without you will remove his nail-pierced hands from His heavenly robe . . . and applaud.''  Mr.Speaker, Sam Bass worked tirelessly for the youth of Texas and to better the communities around him. He is loved by his family and friends, of which there are many.  Sam left an enduring impression on the lives he touched. He will be forever remembered as a great educator, community member, husband, father, great-grandfather, and friend. I am certain that when he took his last breath on Earth, Jesus welcomed him with the words of Matthew 25:23: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.'' His friends and I will continue to pray for his family over the coming days and weeks ahead.  I recently requested that an American flag be flown over the Capitol to honor the life and legacy of my father-in-law, Sam  Mr.Speaker, as I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our country during these difficult times, for our military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who protect us at home.

3819,topic-id,1231,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak about North Korea, the most urgent national security challenge for the United States and our allies in East  Secretary Mattis has said North Korea is ``the most urgent and dangerous threat to peace and security.'' Admiral Gortney, the previous commander of U.Northern Command, stated that the Korean Peninsula is at its most unstable point since 1953, when the armistice was signed.  Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. This year, Pyongyang already launched 18 missiles, including the two recent tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are reportedly capable of reaching the U.homeland.  President Trump has said that the United States will not allow this to happen, and I am encouraged by the President's resolve. Patience is not an option with the U.homeland in the nuclear shadow of Kim Jong Our North Korea policy of decades of bipartisan failure must turn to one of immediate bipartisan success, with pressure and global cooperation resulting in the peaceful denuclearization of the regime.  As Vice President Pence stated during his recent visit to South Korea:       Since 1992, the United States and our allies have stood      together for a denuclearized Korean We hope to      achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all      options are on the table.  But time is not on our side. I believe U.policy toward North Korea should be straightforward. The United States should deploy every economic, diplomatic, and, if necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to protect our allies.  However, the road to peacefully stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through China is the only country that holds the diplomatic and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North Korean regime.  According to the South Korean state trade agency, China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade, including virtually all of North Korea's exports. From 2000 to 2015, trade volume between China and North Korea has climbed more than tenfold, rising from $488 million in 2000 to $5.4 billion in 2015. Beijing is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relatively few consequences.  China must now move beyond a mere articulation of concern and lay out a transparent path of focused pressure to denuclearize North A global power that borders this regime cannot simply throw up its hands and absolve itself of responsibility.  The administration is right to pursue a policy of ``maximum pressure'' toward North Korea, and we have a robust toolbox already available to ramp up the sanctions track--a track that has hardly been utilized to its fullest extent and a track made even more complete last week with additional sanctions on North  Last Congress, I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. This legislation was the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to impose mandatory sanctions on the regime's proliferation activities, human rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior.  A recent analysis from the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies says:       North Korea sanctions have more than doubled since the      North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act came into      effect on February 18, 2016. Prior to that date, North Korea      ranked eighth, behind Ukraine/Russia, Iran, Iraq, the      Balkans, Syria, Sudan, and  Even with the 130-percent sanctions increase after the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, North Korea is today still only the fifth most sanctioned country by the United North Korea is far from being sanctioned out.  So while Congress has clearly moved from the Obama administration inaction to some action, the Trump administration has the opportunity to use these authorities to build maximum leverage with not only Pyongyang but also with I am encouraged by the actions the administration took last month to finally designate a Chinese financial institution, but this should be just the beginning. The administration, with congressional support, should now make clear to any entity doing business with North Korea that they will not be able to do business with the United States or have access to the U.financial system.  A report released last month by an independent organization known as C4ADS identified over 5,000 Chinese companies that are doing business with North These Chinese companies are responsible for $7 billion in trade with North Moreover, the C4ADS report found that only 10 of the 5,000-plus companies control 30 percent of Chinese exports to North So of 30 percent of Chinese exports, 10 companies are responsible for that number in 2016 alone. One of those ten companies alone controlled nearly 10 percent of all imports from North Some of these companies were even found to have satellite offices in the United  According to recent disclosures, from 2009 to 2017, North Korea used Chinese banks to process at least $2.2 billion in transactions through the U.financial[[Page S4637]]system. This must stop now. The United States should not be afraid of a diplomatic confrontation with Beijing for simply enforcing existing U.and international law. In fact, it should be more afraid of Congress if it does not. As for any prospect of engagement, we should continue to let Beijing know in no uncertain terms that the United States will not negotiate with Pyongyang at the expense of U.national security and that of our allies.  Instead of working with the United States and the international community to disarm the madman in Pyongyang, Beijing has called on the United States and South Korea to halt our military exercises in exchange for vague promises of North Korea suspending its missile and nuclear activities. That is a bad deal, and the Trump administration was right to reject it.  Moreover, before any talks in any format, the United States and our partners must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization commitments it had already agreed to in the past and subsequently chose to brazenly violate.  President Trump should continue to impress to President Xi that a denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nations' fundamental long-term interests. As Admiral Harry Harris rightfully noted, ``we want to bring Kim Jung Un to his senses, not to his knees.'' But to achieve this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants to work with the United States as a responsible global leader to stop Pyongyang or bear the consequences of keeping him in power.  Two weeks ago I introduced legislation with a bipartisan group of cosponsors called the North Korean Enablers Accountability This legislation takes the first steps toward imposing a total economic embargo on North Korea, including a ban on any entity that does business with North Korea or its enablers from using the U.financial system and imposing U.sanctions on all those participating in North Korean labor trafficking abuses.  My legislation specifically singles out those 10 largest Chinese importers of North Korean goods and sends a very clear message: You can either do business with this outlaw regime or do business with the world's largest economy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and our continued efforts to stop Pyongyang's further development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles to bring peace to the peninsula and to denuclearize peacefully the North Korean regime.  In order to put real pressure, this administration must act, and it must act on the regime and its enablers wherever they are based.  I yield the floor.

In fact, as we address the Affordable Care Act, which the Democratic Governor of Minnesota referred to as unsustainable and former President Clinton referred to as the craziest thing, we understand that the words ``Affordable Care Act'' do not, in fact, apply.  The paradigm, Mr.Speaker, needs to be this. It need not be whether or not Americans have coverage. In a time when Americans, two-thirds of whom cannot afford $1,000 in a time of financial crisis, as we see premiums and deductibles soar--$4,000, $6,000, $10,000--the paradigm should be: Do they have access to care? Because, in a world where you can't pay your deductible, a premium or catastrophe creates an unaffordable outcome, and then coverage is a piece of paper that does not grant you access to what is truly important, and that is care. That should be the paradigm in this debate going forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-28-pt1-PgH2961-2.txt,1737,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,28.0,July
3646,topic-id,3579,"Mr.Speaker, it is indeed an honor to come before and stand before the Speaker and stand on this floor where so much great debate has occurred over the decades, even back to 150 years ago.  Now, I have been heard to say over the last few days a number of times that I thought the Comey testimony was ultimately the most overhyped event since Y2K, much ado about nothing, but one thing came through very, very, very clearly. I didn't watch the testimony. I was busy presiding over a hearing involving the Justice Department and grants to local communities and how that money is being spent, but I have gone back and been reviewing the testimony. The thing that strikes me most clearly is that our President, Donald Trump, is one of the most perceptive, intuitive leaders this country has ever had. He wasn't sure, apparently, if he could trust  Now, we have heard from a lot of other people in the administration, some still there, some not. This issue about the President's concern for loyalty with Comey indicates our President's gut instinct was right on. He was dealing with an FBI Director who was such a political animal that he would listen to the Attorney General of the United States and instruct him to change his testimony to--I would submit, when you know it is an investigation that you are engaged in, looking at the emails and the potential criminality of Hillary Clinton, and your boss, the Attorney General, said: No, no, no--obviously it is an investigation--call it a matter.  Nobody calls the FBI investigations matters. So he has no problem changing his statement from the truth to political manipulation to cover for Hillary Clinton and to immediately do[[Page H4813]]what his boss tells him to do: Lie about it. You know it is an investigation and I know it is an investigation, but we need you to lie about it. Just call it a matter.  I have dealt with some of the finest people I have known in my life that happened to work for the FBI at the time we were working together. I worked with them, and I have never, ever in any Federal court setting or Federal investigation setting heard any FBI agent in charge--field agent, leader in the FBI, the Justice Department--call an investigation a matter. But Mr.Comey is such a political animal that he was willing to salute not the flag, but Hillary Clinton and Loretta Lynch and change what he knew to be the truth so that his answer was more misleading.  So it is really interesting. Comey used the word, or said that Trump used the word, hoped that he would let it go.  Let's visit the Constitution briefly here. The Constitution does not mention an Attorney The Constitution does not mention the Federal Bureau of Investigation and does not mention a Federal Bureau of Investigation It mentions Congress, it mentions the courts, and it mentions the executive branch, the It doesn't mention FBI Director, Attorney It is the President, under our Constitution, who is charged with seeing to the prosecution or the failure to prosecute as he believes is appropriate.  So, of course, somebody had to have been committing crimes in the Fast and Furious project, whatever you want to call it. I am not sure what it was. It sure appeared to be a criminal enterprise with people involved from DOJ conspiring to make sure that weapons got into the hands of criminals, which, in and of itself, was a crime.  We also know that by the Department of Justice's representatives getting involved during the Obama administration as part of this Fast and Furious effort, they called it, guns got into the hands of criminals, and Brian Terry was killed, a Federal agent doing his job. There is no indication that if the Department of Justice had not forced those guns to be sold and to get into the hands of criminals that Brian Terry would not be dead.  If the Department of Justice had not forced this issue, forced guns into criminals' hands, we may very well have been hearing Brian Terry testify a number of times instead of pointing back toward his murder at the hands of criminals who our Department of Justice representatives under Eric Holder got guns to.  It might have been good to have a special counsel in the Fast and Furious investigation--or, as Loretta Lynch and Mr.Comey liked to use to deceive people, matter, Fast and Furious matter--because the truth is they didn't do much of an investigation.  We saw emails indicating that there was an effort to try to use getting those guns into the hands of criminals, drug cartels, as an excuse to take away law-abiding Americans' Second Amendment rights and continue to pursue that effort.  We also know that the IRS had people who were working to prevent conservatives from having an effect in the 2012 election the way they did in 2010. As the movement was growing, the Obama administration used the IRS as a political weapon to disarm those who would bring together funds and try to defeat President Obama in a second term. That certainly deserved a special counsel since all we seemed to get in our investigations from Congress' angle was a coverup.  It harkens us back to the Clinton administration when this tactic was discovered by people within the Clinton administration: Just cover things up. Just deny, obfuscate, and refuse to allow people to see the documentation. Destroy it after somebody dies. Get the records out of their office before anyone else has a chance to properly investigate what happened.  Somebody is alleged to have killed themselves at Fort Marcy Then as I heard from my friend Dan Burton, they were questioning the person that supposedly found the body out there: Well, that is not where it was. That is not where the gun was. Everything appears to be changed.  Well, the Clinton administration discovered this wonderful tactic of obfuscating: just keep denying and denying the ability to get information and records, and if you do it long enough, you run out the clock and people don't get prosecuted.  We have seen that occur for 8 years. There were very, very serious matters in which somebody committed crimes. We didn't get a special investigator. We didn't get a proper investigation. We got a stonewall protecting those who must have done wrong. I am hoping the current Attorney General will dig and people that are responsible for crimes will be held to account.  But the fact is it is the President's obligation under the Constitution to either pursue people or not pursue people. That is why, even though many of us were extremely upset that President Obama kept pardoning people who were convicted felons, and as much as it upset us that he, in a literal sense, not only obstructed justice, he destroyed it, unfortunately, the President has authority to demand people not be prosecuted.  So we heard new priorities around the country when President Obama took office. He didn't want his Justice Department spending a lot of time on enforcing drug laws. It turns out they hardly ever prosecuted. Compared to other administrations, they hardly ever prosecuted criminal gun violations--far fewer than past administrations--because what they wanted to do was allow the gun crimes to continue to ratchet out of control and then use that to demand more gun control when they weren't even using the laws that were in effect. Instead of enforcing the laws in effect, they continued to demand more gun control.  Just enforce what we had. Most all the crimes that were brought up during that period were crimes already without any other gun control laws needing to be passed and signed into law. Just enforce what we have.  But that wasn't happening. Nobody stood up and said President Obama should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice, because as distasteful as it was to me and so many others, the President has a right to set priorities as to what his prosecutors will pursue and what will be left alone.  So it is interesting on the Flynn matter. President Trump had every right to say: Look, I am giving a pardon, a pass, to this person and to that person. Let's move on. I hope you will find something else to do.  Trump didn't even do that. President Trump said he hoped, an aspiration, but there was no obstruction of justice.  How do we know that? Because we have found, through the testimony of former Director Comey, an incredibly innate ability to see everything through a political lens instead of a law-and-order lens. That is why he could have one Attorney General telling him, ``Change what you are going to say so it deceives the public,'' and that is not a problem, we don't do a memo about that, but another President indicates: He is concerned about my loyalty and he brings it up, so I better do memos so that I can take him down later because he doesn't trust me.                              {time}  1830  Well, for good reason. The loyalty was to Loretta Lynch, the loyalty was to Hillary Clinton, the loyalty was to Barack  And Trump, what an incredible innate ability. He knew Comey was not a loyal, law-and-order man. He would twist the truth, as he was directed by someone else, but he would also twist an untruth through, hurting the current  It appears President Donald Trump was exactly right in firing We didn't need to continue to have a politically astute diplomat wannabe running our We needed somebody that was law and order, no matter what.  Alan Dershowitz is a staunch Democrat, but through the years and with the things I disagreed with him on, I know he is a smart man. Here are some of the things he tweeted out:  ``Comey says he understood word `hope' to be a direction. If so, why didn't he tell the President that such a direction would be violation of DOJ rules?''  Well, here, again, the fact is, if Director-at-the-time Comey believed there was any effort to obstruct justice, then he was committing a crime, a felony, by not reporting it.  I was surprised that he went as far as he did today--because he did--by pushing as hard as he did on this idea that[[Page H4814]]saying ``hope'' might have been a direction. The more he pushed that, the more he exposed himself to prosecution for a felony because he didn't report it.  But the truth is, even though he wrongly believed that there was something--a violation of law or obstruction--it wasn't. If he honestly believed that, he had to report it, and he didn't.  Oh, yeah, he did a memo. I wonder if we would have ever seen that memo if he had not been fired. I can guarantee if he had not been fired, from what we have now learned today, you can count on the fact that he, as Director of the FBI, would make memos any time it might help him harm President Donald Trump, but he would continue not to do memos when somebody, a Democrat, told him to mislead the public.  Alan Dershowitz said: If President commits independent crimes, for example, Nixon telling the staff to lie to the FBI, that is a crime.  You can't tell somebody to commit a crime, even if you are  Alan Dershowitz said: Paying dollars to silence witnesses is a crime.  You can't commit a crime or tell somebody to commit a crime even though you are That is obstruction. You should be prosecuted.  Mr.Dershowitz said: ``Comey confirmed my view that, under the Constitution, the President would have the authority to order FBI Director to stop investigating Flynn.''  He would. Just as Barack Obama says: I pardon you, I am taking away the justice that has been done in your case. I am obstructing justice.  In pardon after pardon, he obstructed justice. But when a President does it, as Obama did being President Obama, it was not a crime when he pardoned people.  Now, if you have a President that has somebody rich, whether that is their name or just their monetary status, and they give you a bunch of their richness and you pardon them, then you may have sold part of your office, which could very well be a crime, and probably is.  But in the case of President Obama, there is no indication anybody paid him to pardon people. If nobody paid him, he just did it because he thought it was a good idea to have people involved with drugs out on the street again, or people at Guantanamo Bay back killing If he thinks that is a good idea, then he can legally obstruct justice, which President Obama legally did time and time again.  Alan Dershowitz also says, talking about Comey: ``He confirmed that the President can order anyone to be investigated or not be investigated.''  Dershowitz also said: ``Comey stated the constitutional principle: President has authority to direct FBI to end a criminal investigation. Can also pardon anyone, ending investigation.''  There is somebody on the internet that goes by the pseudonym ``Ace of Spades.'' This guy has a wicked wit.  Ace of Spades sent out this tweet as if he is quoting These are Ace of Spades' words--an interpretation of the testimony today--he says, Comey: Loretta Lynch told me to lie and I didn't write that down, but I wrote down Trump's stuff because I was afraid he would lie.  It has got the networks all stirred up that former FBI Director Comey came in today and actually exposed the disloyalty to the President of the United States, to the Constitution, to the things he swore to uphold and protect.  Let's look at one other thing I hadn't heard anybody else mention. When you have an attorney as the FBI Director and he is talking to the President of the United States, there is a privilege involved there. Even the least modicum of loyalty and honor and integrity would cause someone who is taking an oath as an attorney, someone who has taken an oath as Director of the FBI, someone that knows their boss is the President and that all power is in the President for the executive branch and the FBI Director entirely gets his power from the President, it would be some smidgeon of honor to want to protect those private conversations.  As far as we know, they weren't classified, but it is something called privilege, it is something called loyalty, and it is something called honor.  The testimony we heard today was the former FBI Director saying: When it came to President Trump, I wasn't going to honor our privileged conversations. I wasn't going to honor the executive privilege. I wasn't going to honor the fact that my power as FBI Director and the authority to investigate someone or not investigate someone is derived entirely from the President of the United I will honor a person that tells me to misrepresent the truth, but I am not going to honor someone who is concerned about fairness.  Even though the FBI Director knows better than most anyone else there is no evidence of collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump, there is no evidence of collusion with anybody in the Trump administration at this time, yet there was no sense of loyalty there.  Think of Shakespeare's words and the sarcasm of Marc Brutus says he is an honorable man. They are all honorable men. These are honorable people who told me to misrepresent the truth to the American people and to the press. These are people that love me because I leak things.  I was hoping for one question that I should have contacted one of my Senator friends and told them to ask, because I would like to know the truth. I know that my Democratic friends were so furious, just livid at Comey when, just days before the election, he announces he is reopening the investigation.  The rumor around here was that there were FBI agents who had been investigating and they knew that Hillary Clinton had violated the law all kinds of ways. Intent was not an issue. She had taken classified material into an unclassified computer and sent it to unclassified computers.  Comey said: Clean bill of health. Everything is good.  And they knew it wasn't good. So when they saw this was the rumor floating around, I would like to know the truth.  You know some FBI agents had to have found Anthony Weiner's computer and found tens of thousands of emails that we were told had been destroyed. Oh, we can't get those tens of thousands of emails. They are gone. And then they found them. Not only were they not in a classified area, not in a SCIF, not in a classified connection, laptop, not even in a government employee's laptop. They were on the laptop of someone who had shown the worst judgment in the world.  You want to talk about the potential for blackmailing--although, probably by this time, I don't know what you would have to come up with to blackmail him, because it is pretty well all out there. Nonetheless, all of these emails were found that were supposed to be gone. There is absolutely no question that some of them came to Hillary Clinton, were sent to an unclassified setting, and now, not only that, they are in the hands of Anthony Weiner, who has had his own criminal justice issues.  The rumor continued that we had such honorable FBI agents that they said, in essence: Mr.Director, clearly, this is criminal material and evidence. If you don't announce you are reopening the investigation, we are going to resign, have a press conference, and show the world that you have been covering for Hillary Clinton the whole time.  Now, that was the rumor. If that were true, and, under those type circumstances, Director Comey then rushes out just days before the election and said, I am reopening the investigation because we found these emails, then that would make sense. He certainly would want FBI agents to completely destroy any election chances just days before the election of Hillary  If Director Comey went out and said: I am reopening the investigation, even though Republicans were rejoicing and Democrats were livid, as I pointed out to someone back at the time in the media, I guess it could hurt Hillary  But if Director Comey comes out a day or two before the election and says there is nothing here, clean bill of health, Hillary Clinton is great, no problems, when we knew he didn't have time, nobody had time to adequately review the tens of thousands of emails, you could run a few algorithms. Real law enforcement means looking at the evidence line by line--I have known people who did it; I have done it in a civil setting--until you find the smoking gun. But you have got to go[[Page H4815]]through the monotony of reviewing each of those.                              {time}  1845  They had no time to do that, and yet former Director Comey came out, clean bill of health. It could not have been discerned in that amount of time like that. So it appeared pretty clearly the reason he said we are reopening the case was so he could say we closed it, to eliminate any chance of even a non-FBI person who comes forward and says, you know, there are classified emails that ended up on Anthony Weiner's computer that came from Hillary Clinton, to Huma, and to There were crimes here, and the FBI Director is covering for him. That would likely have brought down Hillary Clinton much worse than the defeat she suffered.  So it is just interesting, but, Mr.Speaker, the irony with which former Director Comey's testimony drips this evening is that our President, Donald Trump, he has got good gut instincts. He had concerns that former Director Comey was disloyal, was manipulative, that he may be someone that the United States Government should not trust, and it turns out President Trump's gut instincts were exactly right.  He committed no crime. That has become clear. And so now we expect we will see the media and my friends on the other side of the aisle quit talking about Russia--there is nothing there, there has been nothing there--unless we start looking at potential prosecution for taking millions and millions of dollars from owners of Uranium One, who gave those to the Clinton Foundation, which then again ended up benefiting the Clinton family, and Hillary Clinton then approves Russia getting around 25 percent of our uranium production, to the potential detriment and, possibly in future altercations, death of Americans at the hands of the uranium that Hillary Clinton profited from potentially mightily, even if it wasn't directly, and yet America suffered.  Look, it is time to talk about real crimes, investigate real crimes, investigate racketeer influence of corrupt organizations that would pay for people to commit violence at Trump events. Now we are talking.  America deserves better, and thank God we are going to have a new FBI Former Director Comey did some good things while at the FBI, but, unfortunately, we saw the extent that politics tainted the Director today.

3513,topic-id,1765,"It is my understanding that if the managers need time to break into my speech, I will be glad to accommodate that.  I rise today to inject a dose of badly needed reality into this very important debate. Healthcare is a profoundly personal issue that matters to every single In fact, every single Senator in this body ought to agree on this point. Healthcare hits home for each and every constituent we represent from our home From standard wellness checks to lifesaving cancer treatments, each of us wants the best, most effective and affordable medical care for the people we love and for ourselves.  As policymakers, it is our job to solve problems. It goes without saying that we are facing a big problem right now. Access to affordable healthcare is out of touch for millions of That is despite the promises made over and over. Remember that ObamaCare was rammed through on a last-ditch Christmas Eve party-line vote.  Look at what that got us. Health insurance markets are collapsing around the country. Since 2013, the average premium increase on the individual market has jumped 105 percent.  Remember when President Obama promised affordable healthcare for all? He promised we could keep our doctor. He promised that Americans could keep their healthcare plan, and he promised all Americans that their premiums would go down by $2,500.  We all know ObamaCare did not uphold these promises. Instead, we got higher taxes, costly penalties, double-digit premium increases, unaffordable copays, job-crushing and wage-crushing employer mandates, and thickets of Federal regulations.  Now ObamaCare is collapsing. No one on the other side of the aisle has made an attempt to legislate remedies to the law despite its grave condition.  At this very moment, 72,000 Iowans in my home State are gripped with uncertainty. Two insurance carriers have dropped out of the exchanges, leaving only one to offer individual plans starting in The policies offered by that insurance company will go up over 40 percent next year, on top of huge increases this year, making it still unaffordable.  ObamaCare is unsustainable, unaffordable, and unacceptable. This brings me to the reality check that I mentioned when I started. As I listen to some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am, frankly, astounded that they can deliver their talking points with a straight face.  They would like the American people to believe that Republicans are dead set on ripping healthcare away from children, the elderly, and the disabled. Despite their red hot rhetoric, we have neither horns nor tails, but we are dead set on working out the devilish details to get to yes.  Democrats' hyperbole and fearmongering are standing in the way of getting the job done for the American people. Fear is easy to achieve. Legislating in good faith is hard work. ObamaCare defenders would rather disparage than engage. They would rather obstruct a path forward than to construct a path forward. They are standing in the way of solving problems.  In the process, they are scaring the living daylights out of hard-working Americans who aren't able to stretch their paychecks to afford health insurance for their families. If there is one job the defenders of the big government have mastered, it is the role of Chicken They squawk, cluck, and crow at every opportunity to grow the size, scope, and reach of government into our daily lives. To their way of thinking, ObamaCare was a step toward single payer.  They will say and do whatever it takes to secure sweeping, universal government control of the healthcare system, no matter how much it costs the taxpaying public, the toll it takes on the U.economy, or the loss of personal freedom.  Their message is dead wrong. Our reform efforts are not making the sky fall. The Democrats' rhetoric reminds me of a similar situation. The debate 20-some years ago was to reform welfare by reining in runaway Federal spending and increasing the independence of individuals. Just like now, that debate was full of dire predictions.  Some of my colleagues will remember the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, then-chairman of the Senate Finance He strongly opposed efforts to reform the welfare system. He predicted that the bipartisan proposals would result in an apocalypse and said:       If, in 10 years' time, we find children sleeping on grates,      picked up in the morning frozen, and ask, why are they here,      scavenging, awful to themselves, awful to one another, will      anyone remember how it began? It will have begun on the House      floor this spring and the Senate chamber this autumn.  That is the end of the quote from Senator Moynihan 20 years ago. The facts will show that welfare reform was, in fact, not ``legislative child abuse,'' as the former Senator of Massachusetts Ted Kennedy predicted. Quite the contrary.  In the two decades since historic, bipartisan welfare reform was enacted, reality shatters this doomsday prophesy of 20 years ago. The reality is that the number of African-American children living in poverty has fallen to the lowest level in history. The problem still exists and deserves our attention, of course, but 1.5 million fewer children are in poverty today, and 3.4 million more families are independent from assistance.  At the time of welfare reform, the Chicken Littles forecasted homelessness, poverty, and despair. Senator Moynihan also said that requiring welfare recipients to work and limiting the length of time that they could collect benefits added up to ``the most brutal act of social policy since Those involved will take this disgrace to their graves.''  With all due respect to the memories of my former colleagues, their rhetoric simply does not square with reality. The 1996 welfare reform law lifted millions out of generational poverty, replacing lifelong impoverishment and lifestyles of dependency with livelihoods restored with hope and opportunity. These facts separate Democratic rhetoric from reality.[[Page S4385]]  In the absence of a credible reason to continue with ObamaCare's failure, the only defense tactic left to the Democrats is fear. In a vein similar to that of her predecessor from New York, former Senator and Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said: ``If Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party.''  In another vein similar to her predecessor, another Senator from Massachusetts said that ``I've read the Republican `health care' bill. This is blood money. They're paying for tax cuts with American lives.''  They are not alone in their obstructionism. The minority leader has said that Republican-led efforts to reform ObamaCare are ``heartless. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It brings shame on the body of the Senate.''  Another Democrat chimed in that the Senate bill is ``downright diabolical'' and would be ``one of the blackest marks on our national history.''  Still another Democrat said his constituents are ``scared for their children, they are scared for their spouses, they are scared for their aging parents. . . . And . . . scared . . . for their own health and well-being.''  Another one chimed in that ``our emergency rooms would be overwhelmed. They would be unable to deal with the scope of that kind of humanitarian need.''  Not surprisingly, the law's champion-in-chief, President Obama, has fueled the fear factor, saying that the Republican efforts to reform the healthcare law would put pregnant mothers, addicts, children with disabilities, and poor adults in harm's way.  Such overheated rhetoric shows Democrats have abandoned rhyme, reason, and reality. Too often, the arguments from the other side are based on what Medicare was supposed to do, not what it actually did, which fell far short of projections from the experts. Defenders of ObamaCare are relying on a phantom rather than the reality of the law.  Democrats are refusing to work with us toward a better solution that truly works. After years of neglecting consequential problems with a partisan-passed law now on the books, they say that they have a better deal. Let me tell you, thousands of Iowa families and small business owners have contacted me with their personal stories of hardships. To them, ObamaCare has been nothing but a raw deal, rather than a better deal. What good is having insurance, they say, if it is too expensive to use?  After more than 7 years of ObamaCare, the chickens have come home to roost. And in less than 10 years, look what happens when government gets in the way of the free market and consumer choice. Well, it is obvious: higher premiums, bigger copays, fewer choices, less freedom. Health insurance that costs too much to use is just not working for hard-working American families.  I will end my speech today with an appeal from an Iowan from Avoca, She has contacted me many times about the hardships her family has experienced since ObamaCare was enacted. She pays more than $25,000 a year to insure her family on the individual market. If that sounds like chicken feed to some of ObamaCare's defenders, I urge you with all sincerity to get your heads out of the clouds and join us to fix this flawed law. Republicans and Democrats can work together for the greater good of the country.  It is said that when there is a will, there is a way. Many of us recognize that ObamaCare isn't working as promised. Half of us voted this week to move ahead to fix this problem. The other half is blocking any effort put forward to reform the broken law. They are digging in their heels and pulling out all stops of any solution and stopping it dead in its tracks. Again, it reminds me of those who fought tooth and nail to stop welfare reform 20 years ago. I quoted those people from 20 years ago. At the time, they predicted the most dire consequences would befall our most vulnerable citizens. Thank goodness, the pessimists back then did not prevail in their obstruction against welfare reform. While welfare reform has not been perfect, it has restored hope and opportunity to millions of  We can't afford to let the pessimists and obstructionists prevail today against healthcare reform, and they seem to be acting like the very same people that opposed welfare reform 20 years ago. The American people deserve high-quality, affordable healthcare. ObamaCare has not lived up to its promises, so it is time for elected leaders to live up to the promise we made to the American people. Let's worry less about who wins and worry more about who will lose when Congress fails to restore the collapsing Federal law.  I yield the floor.

On this day, we pause to remember those children who have gone missing and honor those who are dedicated to their rescue.  According to the FBI, hundreds of thousands of children are reported missing each year. Most of these cases are closed within hours, thanks to the quick actions of families, communities, and law enforcement personnel, but there also are children, like Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, who never make it home safely.  Ten-year-old Lyric and 8-year-old Elizabeth disappeared in 2012 while taking a bike ride near their grandmother's house in Evansdale, Their bodies were found in the woods nearby later that year. Almost 5 years have passed since their lives were cut short, but the perpetrator has yet to be identified.  My heart goes out to their grieving families and the families of all the other children who have lost their lives in similar tragedies. These child abduction and murder cases are a reminder of the need to promptly pass legislation to extend the key programs authorized by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety The Senate passed such a bill by a vote of 89 to 0 in the 114th Another measure that would make a difference in the lives of missing children is Kevin and Avonte's Last year, the Senate unanimously passed this legislation, which is named in honor of two boys with autism who died after wandering from safety. This bill, which I cosponsored, promotes the use of technology to help locate children with autism and related conditions who may be susceptible to wandering away from safety. It also supports training for first responders and other community officials to help prevent and respond to these cases.  A related bill passed the other Chamber by a wide margin late last year. I am currently working with the sponsor of that companion bill, Congressman Chris Smith, to resolve the differences between our two bills. Congressman Smith and I intend to reintroduce an updated version of Kevin and Avonte's Law in each Chamber in the coming weeks.  Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to announce that I will soon introduce legislation, known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017. The bill I am developing includes several provisions to help in the fight against child exploitation. First, it promotes training of school resource officers, to ensure that they can better detect and respond to child trafficking cases. Second, it updates the authorization for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Third, it extends and updates some of the key programs that were established under the Trafficking Victims Protection  In closing, the feeling of dread and helplessness that families must feel when a child goes missing is unimaginable.

3452,topic-id,629,"Mr.President, for over 7 years, Republicans in Washington have cheered shortcomings in our healthcare system and blamed the Affordable Care Act for every problem under the premise that they would do so much better if just put in charge.  Repealing the law made for great bumper stickers and great campaign promises, but the trouble is that their opposition to the ACA has always been more about politics than it ever was about actual policy or, for that matter, plans to do better for the American people.  The shockingly rushed and secretive effort on display this week in the Senate is only further evidence that President Trump and Republicans in Congress don't have any real solutions to improve our Nation's healthcare system. After months of negotiations behind closed doors, when Senate Republicans released their secret TrumpCare bill, its contents proved too harmful for passage, even among themselves. Stuck without a path forward, their latest idea is to pass a small backroom deal before sundown today--which no one has seen yet--and then go to conference with the tea party and the Freedom Caucus in the House of  While we still don't know what we will be voting on, we know that the so-called skinny repeal bill would mean higher premiums and millions of Americans losing their healthcare coverage, not to mention deep cuts that would dismantle the Medicaid Program as it currently exists and throw millions of Americans off their healthcare coverage and put our entire healthcare system into chaos--all to give a massive tax break to the wealthiest among us. That is awful policy any way you look at it.  Since January, I have heard from literally thousands of New Mexicans who have told me how important their healthcare coverage is to them and their families. What answers do President Trump and Republicans in Congress have for the grandmother in Santa Fe who wonders where she will go when her nursing home closes because of Medicaid cuts or the woman in Albuquerque who wrote to me about how scared she is about losing access to mental healthcare for her depression and anxiety? What are they going to tell the single mother in Rio Rancho who relies on Medicaid to cover her children's medical costs or the young man in Espanola who needs treatment[[Page S4366]]to get clean from opioid addiction? These New Mexicans and millions of other Americans will be harmed if this bill becomes law.  I am not outraged about all of this because I am a Democrat or because of what I think of President I am outraged about this bill because of what it will do to my constituents in New I will do everything I can to oppose this appalling legislation and this appalling process and fight to keep quality healthcare accessible and affordable for New  If we can halt this mad rush, we can all work--Republicans and Democrats--to get to the things that we agree need fixing in our system. There is much work to be done there, no doubt about it.  As Senator McCain told us all Tuesday: ``We have been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.''  There is a better way forward. We can come together and work on the things that we know need to be fixed in the People's lives hang in the balance. There are real bipartisan solutions if we can get back to regular order.  I want to thank my colleague from New Mexico for his incredible leadership in this debate and say how hard we are going to work to make sure that we keep fighting for our constituents in New Mexico on this healthcare legislation.

3536,topic-id,862,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about my amendment, Heller amendment 502. It addresses one of the most onerous taxes enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as the Cadillac tax. The Cadillac tax is a 40-percent excise tax set to take effect in 2020 on employer-sponsored health insurance plans.  In Nevada, 1.3 million workers are covered by an employer-sponsored health insurance plan. These are public employees in Carson City and service industry workers that work on the Las Vegas They are small business owners, and they are retirees across my  Hardly anyone in Nevada will be shielded from the devastating effects of[[Page S4394]]this Cadillac tax. Across America, 54 percent of employers and almost 151 million workers who currently enjoy employer-sponsored healthcare benefits will experience massive changes to their healthcare by the year 2020. We are talking about reduced benefits, we are talking about increased premiums, and we are also talking about higher deductibles. Hard-working Americans will suffer.  That is why I joined Senator Heinrich from New Mexico in introducing what was called the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act earlier this year, with the support of over 75 organizations. Some of those organizations include unions, chambers of commerce, small business owners, State and local government employees, and retirees. They are all saying the same thing--that the Cadillac tax needs to be repealed. From unions to small businesses, employers are proposing sweeping changes to employee benefits today--right now--to avoid this onerous tax later.  First, over 33 million Americans who use flexible spending accounts and 13.5 million Americans who use health savings accounts may see these accounts vanish in the coming years as companies scramble to avoid the law's 40-percent excise tax. HSAs and FSAs are used for things like hospital and maternity services, dental care, physical therapy, and access to mental health services. Access to these lifesaving services could all be gone for millions of Americans if the Cadillac tax is not fully repealed.  Second, I have heard from employers, large and small, from all over Nevada, saying that they will inevitably have to eliminate services their workers currently enjoy, dramatically increase deductibles and premiums, and will have to cut certain doctors out of their networks. This goes right at the heart of ObamaCare's broken promise: If you like your healthcare, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  This onerous tax targets Americans who already have high quality healthcare, and Nevadans have reached out to tell me how this tax will affect them. One of the stories that hit me the hardest was hearing from a school teacher in Las As the son of a cafeteria worker, I know the sacrifices that these educators make each day. Cynthia, who works in the Clark County School District, sacrificed a higher paycheck to ensure that a quality health plan would be there when she retired. The Cadillac tax would place a 40-percent excise tax on her retiree benefits and cause her to deplete her savings to cover the loss.  Seniors have worked their entire lives for these benefits, and the Cadillac tax puts at risk the sacrifices they have made for decades to have a safe and stable retirement. That is why I am committed to repealing this very bad tax. Many are in the service industry, like Michael from Las Vegas, who wrote to my office and explained how he is worried that the cost of his union-sponsored health insurance premium will now skyrocket. He is already seeing his deductibles increase and understands that next year there will be more increases to his healthcare premiums. Michael also shares his concerns about an imposed fine from the Internal Revenue Service, should he not have health insurance. He makes a valid point. If he loses his job, then how can he be expected to pay for his healthcare?  Norm, a city employee from Southern Nevada, shared a concern with me recently: The last thing a self-insured provider wants to do is reduce benefits for his employees.  Back in 2015, 90 Senators voted on the record in support of repealing the Cadillac tax, and I hope all 90 will join me again today. They recognize it will hurt middle-class families who, for reasons outside of their control, have health plans that already or soon will reach the Cadillac tax's cost limits. The tax will force many employers to pay steep taxes on their employees' health plans, flexible spending accounts, and possibly eliminate some employer-provided health coverage plans altogether. Under this tax, deductibles will be higher and benefits will be reduced even more, putting a strain on middle-class families trying to make ends meet.  The short-term success of this was pushing the delay through 2020. Now it needs to be fully repealed. So I encourage all my colleagues to join me today in voting to support Heller amendment 502 to fully repeal this bad tax and send a message that Congress is serious about lowering costs for all  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey). The majority leader.  Mr.Mr.President, the legislation I just laid down is called the Health Care Freedom Act, and it restores freedom to Americans that ObamaCare took away. It does so in a number of ways.  First, the Health Care Freedom Act repeals the core pillars of It eliminates the so-called individual mandate that forces many Americans to buy ObamaCare insurance they don't want, can't afford, or can't use, and taxes those who don't. It also repeals the employer mandate that cuts hours, take-home pay, and job opportunities for workers.  Second, the Health Care Freedom Act provides significant new flexibility to The Health Care Freedom Act gives States just the kind of flexibility they need to implement reforms that provide more options for consumers to buy the health insurance they actually want. These reforms also help make insurance more affordable and flexible so it is something Americans actually want to buy.  Finally, the Health Care Freedom Act frees Americans from ObamaCare in several other ways too. It provides 3 years of relief from the medical device tax, which increases costs, hurts innovation, and has drawn significant criticism from both sides of the aisle. It expands, for 3 years, the contribution limits to health savings accounts so Americans can better manage their health costs and pay down more of their medical expenses like prescriptions with pretax dollars.  Also, the legislation will prioritize funding for women's health through community health centers instead of large abortion providers and political organizations.  The American people have suffered under ObamaCare for too long. It is time to end the failed status quo. It is time to send legislation to the President which will finally move our country beyond the failures of Passing this legislation will allow us to work with our colleagues in the House toward a final bill that could go to the President, repeal ObamaCare, and undo its damage.

I am proud to honor the significant contributions the Women's Mining Coalition has made to the mining industry in the State of Nevada and throughout our I am extremely proud of their successes and am grateful for how it has benefited the Silver  In 1993, three Nevada geologists--Kathy Benedetto, Ruth Carraher, and Debbie Struhsacker--started the Women's Mining Coalition in response to the congressional debate to enact major changes to the U.mining law that would threaten the future of Nevada's mining industry and hard rock mining throughout the country. At that time, they never dreamed that their concept would involve more than taking a couple of trips to Washington, to talk to lawmakers about mineral exploration, the importance of mining, and that mining is a good career for women, but this Battle-Born Nevada concept has become a nationwide, quarter-century commitment to talk to Members of Congress about how modern mining provides the building blocks of our society while caring for the environment and providing family-wage jobs to miners and the many companies throughout the country that provide equipment, goods, and services to the mineral exploration and mining sectors.  Each year, WMC's Nevada members travel to the group's annual Washington, DC fly-in. These Nevada women represent the diverse domestic mining industry and discuss legislative issues and proposed rules affecting mining. During these meetings, WMC members put a face to mining that lawmakers don't expect: women involved in all facets of mining, from equipment operators and manufacturers, engineers, executives, miners, metallurgists, geologists, and environmental scientists.  Last September at a banquet in Las Vegas, the group received the prestigious Prazen Living Legends of Mining Award from the National Mining Hall of Fame for their many years of service and commitment to the mining industry. Not resting on their laurels, the Women's Mining Coalition is in Washington, DC, this week to continue their work to let Congress know that a strong mining industry is essential to the future of Nevada and our Nation.[[Page S3327]]Our national defense, our infrastructure, our electricity, our technology, our agriculture, our transportation, and communication capabilities all rely on the products of mining. The Women's Mining Coalition will continue to make this message heard with energy, talent, and enthusiasm.  As the senior Senator from the Silver State, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in congratulating the Women's Mining Coalition on its 25 years of thoughtful advocacy on behalf of mining in Nevada and across the country.

3748,topic-id,352,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize Robert Hoo, the founder of Nevadans for the Common Good, an organization dedicated to community and making the great State of Nevada a better place through public service. Robert was born and raised in China and moved to New York with his family after the Communist revolution. For the last 5 years, Robert has lived in Las Vegas and committed himself to the goals of his impressive organization.  Nevadans for the Common Good trains everyday citizens for public service, such as running for political office or becoming active on an issue. The organization is run by 40 generous institutions and is a collection of religious congregations, civic associations, professional organizations, schools, fraternities, sororities, and other community-based groups.  Robert understands the importance of a good and honest government that truly works for the people. Having experienced the impact of communism on his family in China, he only further appreciated American ideals, and these values fuel the work he does to this day.  Robert Hoo has taken public and community service very seriously. Before he moved to Nevada, Robert worked for a nonprofit organization in Connecticut and also for an organization that targeted neighborhood blight in East The people of Nevada are very fortunate that Robert's journey took him to our  Lastly, Robert's dedication to finding common ground is truly admirable. In today's political environment, too often we focus on what divides us. Robert, on the other hand, chooses to focus on what unites us at the grassroots level and is committed to helping people solve real problems for others and themselves. The world needs more public servants that have Robert's dedication to helping others and making a difference.  I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Robert Hoo for his outstanding work. His organization is making a difference for so many people who want to better our great State through public service. As the senior Senator from the great State of Nevada, I am proud to call Robert a Nevadan and applaud the work he has done and will continue to do for years to come.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-07-pt1-PgS2446.txt,1863,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,7.0,July

3573,topic-id,680,"Mr.President, so many of us have spoken so many times now against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which would hurt millions and millions of people in our country and especially the sickest, poorest, and oldest among us.  I would say that I am probably the only Senator here who was not born in a hospital. I was born at home in rural I lost a sister to pneumonia when she was only 2 years old in She died at home, not in a hospital, where maybe her life could have been saved.  It is hard for me to talk about this. I think you can tell. Give me a moment.  When I came to this country as an immigrant, my mother brought me and my brothers to this country so we could have a chance at a better life. We came here with nothing. She had low-paying jobs. There was no health coverage. Growing up as a young girl in Hawaii, my greatest fear was that my mother would get sick and, if she got sick, how were we going to pay for her care, and how would she go to work? If she didn't go to work, there would be no pay, there would be no money. I know what it is like to run out of money at the end of the month. That was my life as an immigrant here.  Now, here I am, a U.I am fighting kidney cancer, and I am just so grateful that I had health insurance so that I could concentrate on the care that I needed rather than how the heck I was going to afford the care that is going to probably save my life.  Guess what. When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and facing my first surgery, I heard from so many of my colleagues, including so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who wrote to me wonderful notes sharing with me their own experience with major illness in their families or with their loved ones.  You showed me your care. You showed me your compassion. Where is that tonight?  I can't believe that a single Senator in this body has not faced an illness or whose family member or loved one has not faced illness who was not so grateful that they had healthcare. I cannot believe there is a single Senator who has not experienced that in their family or their lives.  I know how important healthcare is. What is in here? Why doesn't every single Senator know that? Why are we here tonight voting on a bill that has not had a single hearing? Why are we here tonight voting on a bill that would eliminate healthcare coverage that could save lives for 16 million people? Why are we here voting on a bill that would probably mean that people like me, millions in this country, who are now in the ranks of those receiving care with preexisting conditions will not get the healthcare we need? Why are we here tonight? Where is your compassion? Where is the care you showed me when I was diagnosed with my illness?  I find it hard to believe that we can sit here and vote on a bill that is going to hurt millions and millions of people in our country. We are better than that.  I listened to John McCain calling on us to have hearings and to do the right thing, and I am so saddened he was unable to move us in that direction. I would call on him tonight to vote his conscience, to vote for us who say we are going to stand for the millions of people in our country who will be hurt by what we are contemplating tonight.

By and large, we all share the same goals of creating more jobs and building a healthy economy; but, as we have seen too often in Washington, progress can get caught up in partisan gridlock. I am focused on cutting through the partisanship and the noise and finding commonsense solutions to the problems our country faces. H.338 is a prime example of that.  Much like the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that I was honored to help get signed into law several years ago, H.338 strengthens job training programs--specifically in the energy and manufacturing industries--to invest in our workforce. This legislation will help connect individuals with job training programs while also making current programs more efficient, and it takes important steps to increase opportunities for women, veterans, and minorities.  As I have traveled across my district, I have seen firsthand just how effective local, high-skilled job training programs can be:  In Kannapolis, Rowan-Cabarrus Community College has partnered with A.Brown High School on a welding program that will open doors for so many students;  At both Stanly Community College and Sandhills Community College, the advanced manufacturing programs are the critical training grounds for high-skilled manufacturing workers;  At Fayetteville Tech, veterans get the support and the skills they need to find meaningful employment outside of the Armed  I want to thank Chairman Upton, Chairman Walden, and Ranking Member Pallone for their support.

3699,topic-id,426,"Mr.President, as part of National Drug Court Month, I want to honor a program that has directly and indirectly benefited so many Americans and American families.  In my hometown of Marietta, GA, we had the good fortune of having a driving under the influence, or DUI, court program, established nearly 10 years ago in 2008. Since that time, the Cobb County DUI court program has saved our Cobb County Sheriff's office more than an estimated $3 million in incarceration costs alone.  However, these accountability courts have saved much more than just money. For example, there is the little girl who was living with parents in active addiction who now has a sober father who was able to gain custody of her and raise her in a stable home environment. We have seen parents, children, and entire families saved through recovery and restored through the healing work of counseling.  More than 300 individuals have been saved from addiction, crime, recidivism, unemployment, and incarceration by the structure, accountability, and tough love approach of the DUI court program. These individuals have been able to move forward with their lives as productive, tax-paying citizens. Through drug and DUI court programs, the cycle of probation and addiction is broken and history rewritten. The number we can't count is the number of lives potentially saved from fatal accidents and other tragic events that were prevented through participants' recovery.  It is such a special opportunity for me to write to many of the graduates of the drug and DUI court programs in our State and think of the strength of these individuals who are turning their lives around to live free of drug and alcohol addiction. I applaud their efforts, and I always remind them that, while getting off drugs or alcohol may be the hardest thing they will ever do, it is also the most important thing they will ever do for themselves and their families.  On May 2, 2017, the Cobb DUI court program hosted its 30th graduation ceremony. Graduation day is such a special one not only for these graduates, but for the staff who work tirelessly in trying to save lives. That is the day where they see the long hours, the countless emails, the midnight phone calls, and the reams of paperwork pay off. They can look at where a defendant used to be and see how that man or woman's life has changed. On graduation day, lives are reformed and new ones begin.  I applaud all those fighting to change lives for the betterment of all.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2718.txt,1608,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,3.0,July
3828,topic-id,348,"Mr.President, as a realtor and the former owner of a real estate company, it is my great pleasure today to congratulate the National Association of Home Builders on its 75th anniversary.  The National Association of Home Builders was established in 1942 to represent the interests of the Nation's homebuilding industry and to help create a business environment that facilitates homebuilding, enables more Americans to achieve homeownership, and provides for ample rental housing for all income levels. The National Association of Home Builders' membership includes not just builders, but professionals in a broad range of fields who are part of the homebuilding industry, including those who remodel, update, and help maintain existing homes.  For many years, the goal set forth in the Housing Act of 1949 of ``a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family'' has been a guiding principle for America's homebuilders, and they have made great strides in achieving that goal.  Since 1942, the total number of housing units in the United States has more than tripled, increasing from about 35 million to almost 136 million. Also the Nation's homeownership rate has increased from about 44 percent to almost 64 percent. Moreover, the Nation's standard of living has increased significantly thanks to the efforts of the National Association of Home Builders' members, who build about 80 percent of the new homes constructed in the United States each year.  The members of the National Association of Home Builders have served as a driving force behind the significant advances in the quality of the nation's housing and the resulting improvement in quality of life for America's homebuilders play important roles in the fabric of their communities, and they are essential to the Nation's economic health. Homebuilding accounts for about 16 percent of the total U.economy.  I congratulate the National Association of Home Builders and its members on the organization's 75th anniversary and encourage my colleagues in the Senate to reflect on the crucial role the homebuilding industry has played over the last 75 years in our Nation's economy and the lives of our people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-10-pt1-PgS2879-2.txt,1608,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,10.0,July
3538,topic-id,366,"Mr.President, if I could just pick up on the comments of my colleague from Hawaii, we had a comical discussion 2 days ago in the Democratic caucus lunch. Comedy isn't that unusual in a caucus with Al Franken, but the comic discussion was about how we would describe to the American public what a skinny repeal is. It was kind of phraseology that we might understand; how do we describe that to the American public? We took about half an hour to try to figure out how to do it, but about 2 hours ago, one of our Republican colleagues did it in 5 seconds. He said--and this is the Senator from South Carolina--that the skinny repeal is a fraudulent disaster. That is what Senator Graham said--the skinny repeal is a fraudulent disaster. He did such a better job than we did of describing what the bill is, and it is a fraudulent disaster because it hurts people. It takes health insurance away, according to the CBO, from 16 million people, and it would jack up premiums in a compounding 20 percent this year, then an additional 20 percent--40 percent the next year. That is why it is a fraudulent disaster.  But some Members, as was described by my colleague from Hawaii, are entertaining that: Even though we call it a fraudulent disaster, we can vote on it because, don't worry, the House will[[Page S4395]]create an opportunity for us to fix it and make it better. But the comments of the Speaker, which had to be clarified a few minutes later by his press spokesperson, have made absolutely plain that if this bill passes out of the Senate, it is intended to be passed by the House ASAP, and the President's spokesperson has said: We like this bill, and the pen is in hand--we are ready to sign it.  So no one in this body should have any illusions: If the skinny repeal--otherwise known as the fraudulent disaster--passes, it is not to continue a process; it is to take health insurance away from 16 million people, and it will raise premiums dramatically.

We needed to restore confidence, and the way to do that would be to return to operate as the Senate should operate, with putting bills in committees and having hearings and listening to the public and, most importantly, listening to each other.

3810,topic-id,542,"Mr.President, the U.infrastructure system is in critical need of an upgrade. The American Society of Civil Engineers recently graded the U.system a D+ given its capacity, condition, funding, future need, operation and maintenance, public safety, resilience and innovation. Any investment to improve our Country's infrastructure system would create millions of new jobs, requiring millions of skilled workers to fill them.  A recent study by the Center of Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University estimated that a $1 trillion infrastructure investment would create 11 million new jobs. Nearly half of these would require training[[Page S4118]]past the high school level. Even without a significant investment, though, infrastructure industries are already struggling to meet workforce demands. Workers in infrastructure industries are expected to retire at a 50% higher rate than the general workforce. And historic inequities that have limited women and people of color from accessing these jobs have further constrained the pipeline of potential workers. To ensure infrastructure investments benefit businesses, workers and the economy, the U.must invest in the creation of a diverse pipeline of workers with skills necessary to access in-demand opportunities.  Industry and sector partnerships are a proven strategy for helping workers prepare for middle-skill jobs and helping businesses find skilled workers. Congress requires States and local areas to support the development of these partnerships under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), but no dedicated funding has been provided for these activities. Work-based learning strategies, such as apprenticeships, are common pathways to skilled jobs in infrastructure industries. Many small and medium-sized businesses shy away from developing high-quality work-based learning programs, however, because of real or perceived costs associated with the strategy.  This is why I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator Portman, the Building U.Infrastructure by Leveraging Demands for Skills Act or BUILDS The BUILDS Act creates a grant program that would support industry and sector partnerships working with local businesses, industry associations and organizations, labor organizations, State and local workforce boards, economic development agencies and other partners engaged in their communities to encourage industry growth, competitiveness and collaboration to improve worker training, retention and advancement in targeted infrastructure clusters.  Specifically, the bipartisan BUILDS Act would leverage sector partnerships to engage businesses in work-based learning programs. Businesses and industries would be incentivized to work with the greater community to create on-the-job training programs to fill the jobs necessary to expand the Country's infrastructure system. Additionally, businesses and education providers would be connected to develop classroom curriculum to complement on-the-job learning. Workers on the other hand, would receive support services such as mentoring and career counseling to ensure that they are successful from the pre-employment to placement in a full-time position.  Our Country desperately needs improvements to critical infrastructure like our roads and bridges, however to do that work we must have a trained workforce that's ready to fill these good-paying jobs. Virginia businesses in the transportation, construction, energy, and information technology industries continue to tell me they have trouble finding job applicants with the necessary skills. This bill will help workers get the job training they need to be hired. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle consider the BUILDS Act as a necessary component to any investment in our Nation's infrastructure.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-20-pt1-PgS4117.txt,2176,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,20.0,June

I don't want to ascribe to the President or to our Democratic friends any ill motives whatsoever. They wanted what was best for the American people. It wasn't a question of bad motives.

I believe that President Obama and our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle in the Senate and in the House of Representatives passed ObamaCare with the best of intentions. But, you know what, Mr.President--I know you also happen to be a physician--150 years ago, doctors used to bleed their patients with the best of intentions, and they stopped doing that. They did it. They didn't have any bad motives in doing it. They did it because they thought it would help the patient. It killed many of them. So they stopped doing it.

The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. I think that is what he wanted, but you couldn't.  He said the Affordable Care Act would ``cover every American and cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.'' It is not even close.  President Obama said ObamaCare would ``bend the cost curve for healthcare'' without adding ``one dime[[Page S4372]]to the deficit.'' None of that was true. I think the President meant it at the time. I think he wanted it at the time. I know I did. I know you did, Mr.But it just turned out not to be true.  Now, the simple fact of the matter is--and I think every reasonable person has to conclude--that the Affordable Care Act has not worked for the American people.  Let's talk about the exchanges. As you know, Mr.President, there are two parts of the Affordable Care There are the exchanges through which people go and buy insurance directly from an insurance company, and then there is the Medicaid expansion. I want to talk about the exchanges for a moment.  In 2016, under ObamaCare, we started out with 281 insurance companies offering insurance to the American people. That is a good start. The problem is that now we have 141, and they are dropping like flies. In my State of Louisiana we are down to three. A third of all of the counties in America have only one choice--one insurance company that will still write insurance--and many of our counties have zero, none, nada, zilch. They can't get insurance at all. They have been given a bus ticket, but there is no bus.  As for Louisiana, let me talk just for a moment about my State--our State--Mr.In Louisiana, premiums have gone up 123 percent on the exchanges since 2013. That is an average of a $3,600 increase per plan. Nationwide, the average ObamaCare plan now costs 105 percent more than when it started. That is $3,000 per person. What is particularly incredible to me, Mr.President--you know these statistics better than I do--in Louisiana we have 136,000 people who, rather than buying insurance off the exchanges, have chosen to pay the fine. Let me say that again: 136,000 people in my State have looked at the insurance offered to them, with the subsidies, and have said: We would rather pay the fine. Of that 136,000 who said they would pick the fine instead of the insurance, 84 percent of them make $50,000 or less, 48 percent of them, or half, make $25,000 or less. Now, do you know what that tells me? That tells me that 136,000 people in my State, most of whom are too poor to be sick, looked at the Affordable Care Act plan and said: We can't afford it. We would rather pay the fine. We are better off paying the fine. So they are out of pocket the money for the fine, and they still don't have insurance. No reasonable person would call that a success.  Let me give a couple more examples because we talk around here in concepts, and we all know what we are talking about, but average Americans who get up every day and go to work, who obey the law and pay their taxes, who try to do the right things for their kids and try to save money for retirement do not have time to deal in concepts. They are too busy earning a living. They just want to know: What kind of health insurance do I have, and what is it going to cost? So let me give some examples right now from This is brought to you by the Affordable Care  Let's suppose that I am a 60-year-old, nonsmoking male who is living in Baton Rouge, I am making $50,000 a year. According to healthcare.gov--I did not make this up--the cheapest and most basic plan available to me would cost me $689.14 a month, with a $4,500 deductible, for a grand total of $9,000 a year--deductibles, my out-of-pocket, plus my premiums. Now, I am 60 years old. I am living in Baton Rouge, LA, where the cost of living is not that high, and I am making $50,000. The Federal Government has said: We have a great deal for you. Give us $9,000, and then we might be able to give you some healthcare.  For that $9,000, what do I get?  Suppose I say: Here is my $9,000.  I don't know where I am going to find it, as I am only making $50,000 a year, and, of course, the government is taking some of that for taxes, but I find $9,000 a year. Do you know what I get? I get four doctor visits, I get two lab tests, and I get nine prescription drugs and additional medical costs for a grand total of $100. That is not insurance; that is giving somebody a bus ticket without a bus.  All right. Let's suppose that I am a 50-year-old female. I don't smoke. I am living in Lafayette, LA, which is to the west of Baton I am making $50,000 over in The most basic plan in Lafayette--once again, I am 50 years old. So I am not 60 now; I am 50 years old, a female, and I don't smoke. The most basic plan, the cheapest plan I could get would cost me $450 a month in premiums, with a $4,800 deductible, for a grand total of $6,550. So I have to go into my pocket for $6,550 before I can get any kind of health insurance. That is not health insurance.  I would remind the Presiding Officer, as he is a physician who has been on the frontlines in caring for people in our charity hospital system in Louisiana--and God bless him for that--that the options I describe are the cheap ones. They are the most affordable ones. That is the best-case scenario.  Nobody wanted this. I know President Obama did not want it to turn out this way. I know our friends on the Democratic side did not. They wanted what was best for It was not a bad motive; it was just a bad idea.  What do we need? Everybody has his own opinion of that. That is what we are going to try to convince each other of over the next few days as we vote. I will tell you what I think we need. I think that in the healthcare delivery system, we do not need more government.  I know that some of my friends on the Democratic side think they have the solution, and I respect them for all of the time and care they have put into this. Some of my friends on the Democratic side say they have the solution. Government has failed, they will admit. They do not say it very loudly, but they will privately say: We realize the government has failed with Our prescription to fix it is more government, so let's go to a single-payer system. Let's have the Federal Government be in charge of everybody's healthcare, and let's let the Federal Government regulate our doctors and our nurses and our hospitals and our health insurance companies and our patients and our lab techs like they were utilities.  I have lived under a system like that. England has a system like that. You can not name me a single G20 country--not one--that has a single-payer system that is working. It is not the answer.

3546,topic-id,718,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for that really good and detailed description of how we got to where we are because I think it is really hard to explain to Americans at home who are watching this what a debate really is. I don't see my friends from the other side of the aisle right now, but watch what is happening here today because what I have seen in my State the last few months is extraordinary.  Families are coming up in the middle of a Fourth of July parade with their child with Down syndrome, bringing him over and saying: He is not just a preexisting condition. He is our child whom we love.  This last weekend, I was with a family with two identical twins, Mariah and One is the catcher and one is the pitcher on their 11-year-old softball team. Just in the last few years, one of them found out that she has a severe case of juvenile diabetes. The other one is perfectly healthy. What the mom told me is that they can hardly make it, paying for the cost of the insulin that has gone up astronomically over the years, paying for the testing strips and everything involved in this.  Yet, now, instead of seeing a bill which reduces the cost of prescription drugs by including some of the provisions I have long advocated for--from ending pay for delay, where big pharmaceutical companies are paying off generic companies to keep their products off the market, or bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries or allowing for negotiation under Medicare Part D--instead of doing some of those innovative things we need to bring costs down for regular Americans, what we see here is going to make it worse.  When I met with these two girls, I told them and their family that I had their back and that I would tell their story on the floor of the U.Never once did I think I would be saying it, even this last week, when we are facing this kind of onslaught to this family--because what I would tell these girls now is that this bill, from what we have learned--we have not seen it, we don't know exactly what is in it--but from what we have heard, what would happen is, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it would kick 16 million people off of healthcare.  I would ask those girls: Do you know how many people that is, girls? It is 14 States' worth of people. It is the combined population of 14 States in the United States of  What we have learned about this bill is that it would increase premiums by over 20 percent, again, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget What I would tell them is that is more than their school clothes, it is more than their softball clothes, it is a good chunk of their college education. This is real money for real people and this reduces coverage and it makes it more expensive. We can do so much better.  A few months ago, we went to that baseball game where the Republican men's team played the Democratic team. I was there in the stands, and I watched at the end this beautiful scene when the Democratic team won and they took the trophy and they gave it to the Republicans' team, and they said to put it in Representative Scalise's office.  Why did they do that? Because they were saying we are all on one team. That is what this should be.[[Page S4397]]  When we are dealing with one-sixth of the American economy, we shouldn't be at night passing a bill that one of our most trusted colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a Republican, has just called ``a fraudulent disaster.'' That is not what we should be doing. We should be working on the fixes that so many people have been working on for so many years--bringing drug prices down, making the exchanges stronger with reinsurance and cost sharing. These are things we actually can do together.  I ask my colleagues to work with us. We have opened the door. We want to work together on these changes and not to pass this fraudulent disaster.

3532,topic-id,2847,"Mr.President, I would like to tell my colleagues a couple of stories. We are going to talk about what is happening in healthcare right now. There is the healthcare that is happening here in this room in the debate that is ongoing that started months ago, continuing to try to figure out the solutions to what we face with the Affordable Care Then there are the healthcare issues happening at home.  Sometimes we get caught up in this conversation and think this is what the center of the healthcare conversation is about. It is not. The center of the healthcare conversation in America is around dinner tables. Let me tell my colleagues what that conversation sounds like.  This comes from one of my constituents who just wrote to me. He said:       My premium increases from $1,308 per month to $2,489 per      month. This is for just my wife and We are self-employed      small business owners and simply cannot afford to pay nearly      $30,000 per year for health insurance. We will have to pay      the penalty for not having healthcare, but we have to eat and      pay our bills. Sadly, we are both in our late 50s, and we      probably need healthcare more now than ever. Mr.Lankford,      this is not the America that I grew up in, the America my      father fought to preserve in World War  That is the healthcare debate happening in America right now--individuals who used to be able to afford their healthcare coverage, but now they cannot and no longer have healthcare.  The Affordable Care Act did cover a new group of people who were not covered before, but it also pushed out another whole group who used to have coverage and now does not.  This is an extremely personal issue. This is not a political issue. These are families and lives and children. These are individuals who have cancer and diabetes and a history of genetic diseases in their families, and they are very concerned about what happens politically in this room because it affects their families and their real lives.  Congress needs to act on this. What is happening right now with the status quo is untenable for families all across the country. Insurance carriers have left the market. Rates have gone up dramatically. We have fewer choices and more control but less control for families.  What does that look like in my State? Well, in my State, premiums went up last year 76 percent--last year--a 1-year increase. I have folks all the time who say to me that their great complaint is about the rising cost of college tuition. Let me give my colleagues a glimpse. College tuition has increased 76 percent in 15 years. Insurance in my State went up 76 percent in 1 year. In fact, since ObamaCare fully rolled out in 2013 until now, insurance in my State has gone up 201 percent. That is not the Affordable Care Act; that is a recipe to be able to push people out of insurance and keep them out.  ObamaCare was designed to force healthy people to buy insurance to increase the risk pools for those insurance companies. But when you can't afford the premiums, you are forced to pay this big tax. Now, the question is, Who is paying the tax? Originally, ObamaCare said: Well, people who didn't buy into the insurance who want to just take the risk on their own, these wealthy individuals, they would have to pay the extra tax. Really? What did that end up looking like? Again, coming back to my State, 96,000 Oklahomans are currently paying the tax to the IRS because they don't have healthcare insurance. Who are they? Eighty-one percent of the people who pay the penalty make less than $50,000 a year. These are individuals who cannot afford the insurance, and they also can't afford the fine that is coming from the It is a poverty tax that the Affordable Care Act created to try to force these people into insurance they cannot afford, and when they can't afford that, then they get a big hit on their taxes as well. It is literally a no-win situation for them.  One of the major goals of the Affordable Care Act was to provide affordable coverage. It was to be able to help people get into insurance. It was to be able to help improve the safety net. Those are not irrational goals. Those are good goals, but the execution of it was terrible, and the implementation has caused more problems than it has solved.  In my State, many physicians in rural areas used to be independent. Now they have all been forced into working for big hospitals because they can't afford the compliance costs to keep their office moving anymore. So independent doctors and independent clinics are now part of big conglomerate hospital companies. I am glad they are there, or we would have no access to care at all.  My State used to have four insurance carriers in the Now it has one, and that one is discussing leaving.  I hear all the time people who are mad at Republicans saying: Why haven't you solved this yet? Quite frankly, this is an incredibly difficult issue. But I also want to be able to respond back to people: Don't gripe at the firefighters fighting the wildfire. They didn't start it. We are trying to put it out. Yes, I know the fire line is big, and, yes, I know it is difficult to put it out, but we are doing our best to resolve a fire we did not start. We will resolve this.  So what is happening right now with our trying to resolve it? What are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to do several specific things dealing with the Affordable Care This is not about resolving everything in healthcare. There are, quite frankly, lots of issues on which we have bipartisan agreement that we should work on in the days ahead, things like prescription drugs and so many other things we can do to help bring down the cost of healthcare itself, but in the meantime, we do have a dispute.  Our Democratic colleagues have said to us that they want to be able to cooperate with us on healthcare, but the parameters are that we have to keep the individual mandate--that tax penalty on people in my State for people who make $50,000 or less to pay this giant tax; they want to keep that. They want to keep the employer mandate, which is dramatically driving up the cost of insurance for employers and decreasing wages. The initial estimates are that people in my State are making about $2,500 a year less now than they would be because of the employer mandate that is on them. So we can't negotiate and say ``Let's form a bipartisan agreement on this'' if they want to keep the individual mandate and the employer mandate. Those things hurt people at home.  So here is what we are trying to do. This is a budget bill. It is called reconciliation. We are limited to only budget-related items to be able to deal with. So we are working on some of the basics of what needs to be repealed in the Affordable Care We do want to get rid of the individual mandate. We do want to get rid of the employer mandate.  We do want to deal with how we can take control of healthcare out of Washington, DC, and get it back to the States, where it used to be. Prices are much cheaper when there is local control on healthcare than when there is Federal, centralized control.  We would also like to find a way to get some of the bureaucracy out of this. You see, when there is a healthcare dollar paid and it first has to pay the Federal bureaucracy, then it goes to the State bureaucracy, then it[[Page S4392]]pays an insurance company bureaucracy, and then it pays a hospital bureaucracy, there is not much of that dollar left to finally get to patient care at the end. If we can take out one of those bureaucracies, we can actually get more dollars to patients rather than having them just feeding the bureaucracy of another layer.  We are simply trying to deal with the mandates that are there, who actually makes the healthcare decisions for regulations and policy, whether it is the State or the Federal Government, and how we are going to balance out coverage for individuals who desperately need it in the safety net.  I have heard a lot of folks talking about CBO scores. I will tell you, I am in the middle, and I am very frustrated with CBO right now. Every policy we want to float to say this is something we think will be very effective to be able to help people in the safety net or to be able to help people purchase insurance, CBO responds back to us: That sounds like an interesting idea; it will take us about 4 weeks to study it. When we are in the legislative process, when we are doing amendments, we can't wait 4 weeks between each amendment. We have to be able to get answers from them.  So we are stuck in this spot, so our resolution is--we have a House version that has been scored, and we have a Senate version. We have a lot of changes we want to make, even to our latest version. The best answer we have while we wait on CBO scoring--another month to get us an answer--is to be able to get an interim bill, get into a conference between the House and the Senate, allow CBO the month that they need to score this, and for us to be able to pass a better bill in So that is where we are stuck right now.  This is not a final bill that is coming out. This is still an interim process that is moving. But we need to be able to keep this process moving because there are people at home who are counting on this actually getting better for them in the future. Their words to me are: This cannot get worse, because I can't afford what we currently have, and I can't afford that access I have been given to healthcare.  In the middle of all of this debate, a lot of people on the outside look at it and say: How come the Senate can't move faster?  I respond back to them: We can't get a score from CBO, so we can't move any faster. We are stuck waiting on them.  They typically will call me and say: Well, just run over  We are not going to ignore the law, and we are not going to ignore the rules of the Senate, but we are going to work to actually get this right.  In the meantime, I have heard an awful lot of scare tactics coming out. It usually circles around, there will be 22 million people who will suddenly not have insurance. That is a fascinating number to me since only 9 million people have ObamaCare right now. Nine million are actually on the exchange. So it seems difficult to me for 22 million people to lose what only 9 million people have. But if you are an economist, they look at, on the horizon, people who may one day join in at some point, and then those people who may have joined in then might have lost their insurance. It makes total sense to an economist, but to all of us who just look at math, it becomes very difficult.  CBO also believes that without a Federal mandate and a tax penalty on individuals, they will not buy this insurance product. People do not want to buy it and will not buy it unless they are made to buy it.  The problem is, there are 6.5 million people in the country who are also required to buy it who are just paying the tax rather than buying the insurance.  We need to allow people to make decisions on their own lives, but we need to also make sure there is actually an insurance product they can afford. And all the scare tactics about how we are going to throw out preexisting conditions and people who have preexisting conditions will be on their own--that is not true. Every single one that we have debated has included protection for preexisting conditions. We all are still honoring things like lifetime caps, annual caps. We have all included 26 and under. If you want to stay on your parents' insurance, you can still do that.  There have been all of these scare tactics, like this will throw senior adults out on the street, and Medicaid is going to have these dramatic cuts. I looked at one of the proposals that was put out by the Senate and one of the drafts that we went through, and it said ``dramatic cuts.'' Here are the ``dramatic cuts'' we had in Medicaid: Every year for the next 8 years, Medicaid increased at twice the rate of inflation. Every year for 8 years in a row, twice the rate of inflation, Medicaid went up. That is twice as fast as Medicare goes up--twice as fast as So Medicaid was accelerating twice as fast as Medicare, and then 8 years from now, Medicaid went back to growing at the same speed as Medicare--at the rate of inflation. That was the ``dramatic cut'' in Every year going up twice as fast as inflation is a cut? Nine years from now, only growing as fast as inflation is a cut? But it is being portrayed that people are going to be thrown out on the streets and Medicaid is going away.  I would encourage Americans to understand that the conversation has been a lot about political rhetoric. This body really is committed to the safety net. This body really is committed to allowing people to have choices again that they can actually afford for insurance. We are really committed to taking control of healthcare out of Washington, DC, and pushing it back to the States and to families so they can control healthcare decisions again. That is the real debate that is happening here. I know it is boisterous, and I know it is much easier just to have bumper sticker comments, but at the end of this, we have to realize there really are people who are involved in this, who are deeply affected by it.  A couple more stories. A gentleman recently sent me an email saying that he received word that his premiums are rising from $1,229 a month to $2,205 a month to cover just him and his wife. His deductible is rising to $4,000 a person. His out-of-pocket maximum is rising to $13,000. That is under ObamaCare now.  Another person who wrote me is currently enrolled in ObamaCare now. He is 62 years old, and his wife is 61.       Our monthly health insurance premium increased by 71      percent to $2,900 last year. My wife and I are healthy with      no major problems, so my health insurance is the size of my      mortgage payment.  That is under ObamaCare now.  Under ObamaCare now, a lady from my State wrote me and said that for her first year, her monthly premium was $1,200. This year, she will pay $1,900 a month. She just got a letter from the one insurance company left in her State--the one opportunity she has to get insurance--saying that her monthly premium next year will be $3,540. That is an increase of 84 percent, or $42,000 a year, for insurance under ObamaCare now. Her simple statement to me is, How is this possible?  I speak to some of my colleagues, and they say: Those stories aren't true.  I say: Let me introduce you to some real-life people outside of this political debate who are debating around their kitchen table about how they are going to make it with the rates that have been put on them.  What we have now has to be addressed. I know this is a boisterous, loud process. But as we walk through the process, the end solutions are for these families, so that our noise helps them to actually move back to thinking about their kids and what they are going to do next in their retirement, and not to say: How in the world am I going to pay for my health insurance anymore?  Let's get this finished. Let's move to the next stage. Let's get to conference and try to resolve the differences between the House and the By September, when we finally get a score back from CBO on all of our scoring and they finally get us information on the things we have asked for, let's get this passed so we can actually get this done.

3479,topic-id,1530,"Mr.President, on Tuesday, the Vice President cast a tie-breaking vote to move to debate on a healthcare reconciliation bill, the contents of which even now remain a mystery to most of us.  This vote to proceed without a transparent path forward underscores a process that has, from the beginning, been politics and policymaking at their worst. You would think that, after 7 years of campaigning to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the majority would have a plan in place to do just that. Instead, a dozen or so male, Republican lawmakers met behind closed doors, shielded from public view, to negotiate a grand plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and make devastating cuts to the Medicaid Program--no hearings, no debate, no process. This is not the path taken when we considered, debated, and approved the Affordable Care This is not the way the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, should conduct such far-reaching and impactful business. This is not the Senate that I know and respect.  In spite of multiple drafts and a go-it-alone, hyperpartisan philosophy, the majority leader was still unable to garner enough support within his own Caucus to pass a sweeping healthcare bill. I joined with many Democrats to offer motions to get the Senate back to regular order and have the appropriate committees study the effects of these policies on Medicaid beneficiaries and those with disabilities, on women and children, on seniors and the most vulnerable, but Republicans voted down those efforts and plowed ahead. During this debate, the Senate has also considered multiple amendments to rewrite the Affordable Care Each of these amendments would have caused tens of millions of Americans to lose insurance and would have made it harder for those with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage. When those amendments failed, the Republican leadership attempted to fully repeal the Affordable Care That did not work either.[[Page S4375]]  The collapse of these ideas should have resulted in a renewed spirit of bipartisanship, where we could work together to stabilize and improve the health insurance markets. Instead, the Republican majority is so intent on voting on anything, that we are considering voting to repeal two or three policies from the Affordable Care Act solely in order to get something through the Senate and into conference with the This is nothing more than legislative malpractice. We are presumably considering a bill that will devastate our health insurance markets, and the best reason the Republicans can come up with for supporting final passage is ``because we said we would.''  The notion that this majority would reduce themselves--and the Senate--to finding the lowest common denominator in order to move ahead with a policy of this magnitude is not only absurd, it is dangerous. While all the versions of the Republican plans we have seen differ slightly, they all have the same, basic structure. Let's call these plans what they are: a massive tax cut for the wealthy on the backs of pregnant women, children, and the disabled who depend upon Medicaid for their health coverage. It is a tax plan in the guise of a health plan. We are considering massive entitlement reform bills that the Republican majority is trying to sell as fixes to the Affordable Care Act, but we know that these bills would fix nothing and would instead create tremendous new challenges.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, each of the various Republican proposals would cause at least 22 million people to lose their health insurance. For instance, the CBO projected that the Senate Republican's first proposal would result in marketplace enrollees paying on average 74 percent more towards their premiums for a plan in 2020 than under current law. Another proposal offered by the majority would result in higher deductibles, rising from $3,600 under current law to $6,000. Under this one proposal, Americans would be expected to pay more money for less care. And as if the Medicaid cuts in the House bill were not deep enough--which caused the President to call the bill ``mean''--another Senate Republican proposal would double down and even deepen Medicaid cuts beginning in 2025. The Senate's proposals have certainly not been less ``mean'' than the House bill. If anything, the Senate's bills are meaner.  In Vermont, the effects of any of these bills would be disastrous. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Vermont has made exceptional progress to cut the rate of uninsured Vermonters by half. The number of uninsured Vermonters is now less than 4 percent. Because of the Medicaid Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as Dynasaur in Vermont, 99 percent of children have health insurance in our TrumpCare, in any version, places Vermont's progress at risk.  Vermont has also worked on new and innovative ways of delivering healthcare, which has brought down costs and increased coordination of care. One of the most significant ways Vermont has done this is through existing flexibility in It is through the Medicaid Program that Vermont has offered comprehensive treatment and counseling services for those suffering with opioid addition. In Vermont, 68 percent of those receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction are Medicaid recipients. If hundreds of billions of dollars are cut from the Medicaid Program, States will be forced to limit coverage, jeopardizing Vermont's ability to overcome this crisis. Provisions that cap Medicaid spending do not create ``flexibility'' in This policy would instead force States to ration care.  This spring, I met a Vermont mother who has two young daughters. Both of her daughters suffer from cystic fibrosis. Luckily, they have the disease mutation that allows them to benefit from new drug therapies, but it is because of Medicaid that they have the resources necessary to afford the $20,000 per month that it costs to provide medication for each of her children. How can we tell this mother that her daughters might no longer be able to take this medication because of fiscal constraints in Medicaid? How can we tell future children who should have access to Medicaid that it was more important to give the wealthiest Americans a tax cut?  I heard from another woman in Norwich who shared this story with me: ``Five years ago, both on the same day, my husband and I were diagnosed with cancer. The fact that we are both alive today is entirely thanks to President My treatment alone involved two hospital admissions, four months of chemotherapy, and fourteen surgeries. I still take drugs every day. There is no way we could have afforded any of this without Before the ACA, our health insurance costs--both premiums and deductibles--were sky high. My husband and I used to avoid going to the doctor, reserving that luxury for our three children. Without Obamacare, it's entirely possible that we wouldn't have had the check-ups that led to our diagnoses.''  These TrumpCare proposals are not healthcare bills. A true healthcare bill would not kick millions of Americans off health insurance. A true healthcare bill would not allow insurance companies to charge people more for less coverage. A true healthcare bill would not move us backwards to a time when healthcare was unaffordable.  Instead, we should be working on proposals that improve our existing system. Where there are deficiencies, let's fix them. Where we can find common ground, let's act. One of the first things we should do is stabilize the insurance market by making cost-sharing payments permanent. We should also be working to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, which is why I have introduced a bill, along with Senator Grassley, that would help reduce drug costs by helping generic alternatives come to market faster. The American people expect us to work on real solutions. We should not be voting on a cobbled together plan where the primary goal seems to be to get to 50 votes, rather than actually improving our health insurance system. Importantly, no Member should vote on a proposal unveiled at the eleventh hour, with no debate--a proposal that will impact such a large component of our economy and tens of millions of  Was the Affordable Care Act absolutely perfect when it was passed? No, and we acknowledged the need for continual improvement as the ACA would be implemented. Unlike other important social programs that have been created over the years--such as Social Security and Medicare--Republicans have not allowed us the opportunity to improve, strengthen, and perfect it over time. Those programs were also not perfect, but instead of playing partisan games, Republicans and Democrats came together to get something done, time and time again. We did not vote to repeal the Social Security No, we came together and we discussed what needed to be done to better help the American people, not unravel their safety net.  I hope that we can end this dangerous exercise and move forward in a responsible way. Let us act on the best interests of our constituents and not resort to cynical, bumper-sticker politicking. At its best, the Senate has been able to act as the conscience of the I hope now is such a time and that the Senate will rise to the occasion to defeat this harmful bill.

3638,topic-id,1233,"Mr.President, Brandon del Pozo proudly serves as the chief of police in Burlington, VT--Vermont's largest city. He arrived in Vermont 2 years ago, after serving for nearly two decades with the New York Police Department, where he rose through the ranks and learned hard lessons on the streets of such a large urban center. One needs only to sit with Chief del Pozo for a short while to understand his commitment to community service and to community.  So it comes as no surprise that Chief del Pozo grew alarmed when he heard President Trump recently tell a law enforcement gathering that police should not be ``too nice'' to those who are placed under arrest, seeming to suggest that police should go against the very policies that exist to protect against police misconduct. We cannot tolerate this kind of public comment and certainly not from the President of the United There is nothing the least bit humorous in any of this. In fact, President Trump's comments have undermined the efforts of police departments across our Nation to build trust within their communities at a time when that trust is most needed.  As a doctoral candidate holding three master's degrees, Chief del Pozo is well studied in the rules of engagement. He is also a talented writer. In an essay he submitted to CNN, Chief del Pozo responded directly to the President's comments, writing: ``Policing requires dealing with the emotions cops are bound to feel when they witness the worst things one person can do to another. It is criminals who act on these emotions and attack other people. Restraint is what separates policing from vigilantism.''  It is a viewpoint that is real, told through the eyes of an experienced street cop who works in reality, not reality I ask unanimous consent that Chief del Pozo's full CNN essay be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From CNN, July 31, 2017]                 Trump on Police Brutality: Har Har Har                         (By Brandon del Pozo)       When I was a New York Police Department cop in East      Flatbush in 2000, I once rushed into an apartment building      with fellow officers on a call of an assault. We found a boy      in the hallway under attack. He was crying, and bleeding from      stab wounds inflicted by his mother's boyfriend. The boy ran      into my arms. Our sergeant confronted his attacker. He could      have shot the man. Instead, he fought him into submission.       The boy had been stabbed because he had called the police      while the man was attacking his mother. She was lying on the      hallway stairs in a pool of blood. That her son had served as      a distraction was probably the only reason she survived.      ``You saved our lives,'' the boy sobbed. He hugged me. His      blood and tears wet my shirt.       As the suspect sat there in handcuffs waiting to be led      away, I asked him why he had stabbed a child. ``Boy gotta      learn not to get in a man's business,'' he said. ``So now he      learned.'' A fury rose within me that nearly caused me to      shake. ``We should have shot you,'' I said.       But we didn't shoot him, nor did we lay a hand on him once      he'd surrendered. Policing requires dealing with the emotions      cops are bound to feel when they witness the worst things one      person can do to another. It is criminals who act on these      emotions and attack other people. Restraint is what separates      policing from vigilantism.       Now we have a President who appears to want police to      satisfy their primal urges. Either as a joke--as White House      press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders has now suggested--or      as one of many true things that have been said in jest,      President Donald Trump addressed a roomful of officers on      Long Island on Friday and invited them to be ``rough'' with      their suspects. He advised them to be free with their hands      as they shoved arrestees into squad cars, to ``not be too      nice.'' His grin and his pause for an ovation erased any      uncertainty about his message.       An elected official could only say what Trump said if he      didn't understand policing. People who've gained this type of      experience know the real possibility of a cop losing his      temper, how hard we have to guard against it, and how much it      would erode the trust we strive for between police and the      people they serve.       It also seems like the President doesn't understand certain      things about There has been enough confirmed police      brutality here to send chills down the spine of a reasonable      person watching the President and a crowd of cops joke and      laugh about it. It's like laughing about the dire      consequences of inadequate health care, or the opioid crisis.       It's also clear that President Trump has never had to fire      or arrest a police officer: The cop sits there in front of      you, replaying a moment in his mind, wishing he could take it      back. He put on the uniform to be one of the good guys, and      now he's on the opposite side of the table. He worries about      supporting his family.       The way to get our officers to retirement safely, after a      satisfying career, is to lead them through policing's      cauldron. Excessive force could get them fired or arrested.      Making light of it is a failure of leadership.       It was hard to watch a roomful of officers laugh and      applaud in response to Trump's remarks. The only charitable      explanation was that it indicated a sense of relief that the      President understood how vicious some criminals are and how      frustrating the work of bringing them to justice can be. The      more[[Page S4721]]     likely explanation is that the President has a talent for      bringing out the darker side of people, and this was another      example of it.       What we witnessed will drive a deeper wedge between the      police and the citizens whose mistrust of them has grown. It      will cast doubt on legitimate uses of force.       What troubles me the most about the President's remarks,      however, is the way they patronized police officers. He has      never held a wounded child in his arms or had to decide      whether to punch or shoot a man with a knife. He has never      had to race to the scene of a police shooting and choke on      his feelings as he hunts for a suspect with precision and      restraint. His remarks failed to take police work and its      hazards seriously.       When I later served as a precinct commander in the Bronx, a      sergeant of mine was suspended because he stood there and did      nothing as he watched an officer slam a handcuffed suspect's      head into the street. A narcotics detective had been shot      during a scuffle with a drug crew, the responding officers      were blind with rage, and one exacted revenge. When a video      surfaced, the emotions didn't convey. It just looked      thuggish, like the cop was a criminal, too. By his own      account, it seems the President would also have been inclined      to stand there and do nothing. There are thousands of      American police chiefs who know what these situations      require. They want to protect their officers by leading them      in the right direction. We don't need the President joking      with them about giving in to their baser instincts.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-08-02-pt1-PgS4720.txt,1383,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,2.0,July
3568,topic-id,893,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the motion to commit by my friend from the State of Let me tell you why.  We have a problem that most all of you have in your States, which is opioids. This opioid addiction that goes on is affecting everybody--not just Democrats, not just I don't care whether you are poor or rich or whether you are conservative or liberal--it has no base at all; it is a silent killer.  For the first time, under the Affordable Care Act, we are able to get some treatment. We have not been able to do that before. The only treatment people have gotten before--when a parent comes to you and says: I just have to hope my child--if my child gets arrested, they can go into drug court, and maybe they can get some care, some treatment.  For the first time, through Medicaid, we can give treatment for opioid addiction. We never had this chance before, never had this opportunity. It is really lifesaving for these people. It gets them back into the workforce, too, and they can clean up their lives. They really want this done.  We are talking about 33,000 Americans who lost their lives in 2015. In any other scenario, that would be an epidemic or a pandemic. Here we go. We still don't have any adequate treatment centers. We have no way that we can go forward and fight this illness. We sit here and talk about it.  Now we are talking about, well, we know 16 million people are going to be thrown off. We know that. We know the premiums will go up 20 percent.  Some one said: You know, you can still have preexisting conditions. We are going to take care of them. They can find it. It is available.  I have said this before: A Rolls Royce is available to me; I just can't afford to buy it. That is what we are going to be faced with.  But this is fixable. What we have said about fixable, we as Democrats--there are those of us in this body who will sit down--as Senator Murray has said--will sit down tonight. We will start tonight if you want to and look at ways we can make this more effective, more beneficial for everybody.  When you think about the reinsurance, we know it has worked in The Affordable Care Act--the so-called ObamaCare--has been out long enough now that we know where the problems are, we know where the fixes need to be, and we know how do it. We have seen Alaska do something that looks very promising.  Also, when Vice President Pence was Governor in Indiana, they did a Medicaid expansion in They are putting in accountability and responsibility. It has great effects. My good friend Mitch Daniels was the Governor at the time they put this plan into place, and it has worked and worked well.  We are willing to sit and talk. These are good things. We think we can make this happen. We have been shut down at every turn. I have said: This is not how we were taught in West It is not how we do business. We sit down and work through it.  I don't care what side of the aisle you are on--we came here to do the right thing for the country. We are all We all have something in common. We are all on the same team, I hope, and that is Team Let's fix this.  Let me tell you what will happen if you don't fix it. Let me tell you what will happen for the people who lose it. Do you know where they go back to? And I don't know why people think there is a savings involved. They are going back to the emergency room.  When I was Governor, every year they came to me and said: Governor Manchin, we need $12 million for a rural hospital. We gave all this charity care away.  They are going to go back to that. Do you think that is quality? There is no preventive care. There is no planning. There is nothing to help these people[[Page S4403]]have a better quality of life. We are going to pay again. We are going pay dearly for this. We are not going to have any chance to get people back in the workforce.  All we are asking for, please vote for Senator Murray's motion to recommit. Give us a chance to do what we were sent here to do. Let's work the legislation. Let's sit down and find the commonality that we can find as Americans and move forward with a piece of legislation that can change people's lives, that can save people's lives and can give them hope again for the first time. That is all we are asking for.  I would ask each and every one of us to search our souls and our hearts while we are here, what we are here to do, what our purpose of being here is, and give us a chance to fix a healthcare system that needs to be fixed but also needs to be available for the people in my great State of West Virginia and everyone in this great country.

Indeed, our entire system was set up to be a government which produces results of, by, and for the people, but certainly right now, that is not what we are getting.  We are getting a secret plan which has not yet been put on this floor, with a promise that there will be a debate in the middle of the night--no chance for committee hearings on it, no chance to consult with experts, no chance for us to go home and talk to our constituents. This is about as far away from a deliberative democratic republic as you can possibly get.  It makes us think of 1787, when Ben Franklin came out of the Constitutional Convention and was stopped by someone in the crowd and asked: What do we have--a monarchy or a republic?  He answered: A republic, if you can keep it.  Well, we are not keeping it right now through this secret, middle-of-the-night, non-consultative process.

You tear a hole in the side of a swimming pool, the water drains out and there are only a few inches left, and the only people who would bother to go into that depleted swimming pool would be those who really, really want to swim. It is the same with the healthcare pool. The bill coming out tonight, we are told, will rip a big hole in the side of the insurance pool, and it will do so in a fashion that only those who have preexisting conditions, only those who are sick, only those who are old, will truly try to get that insurance. This means the price will be driven up, and many of them can't afford it, so they will drop out. So it means the pool will have even more people who are sick and older. This is the death spiral.  My colleagues today are planning to put forward a bill tonight, we are told, that creates a death spiral insurance. Who pays the price? Who pays the price? Our Nation pays the price with an estimated 16 million people who would lose insurance. We are talking about those who have every desire to have the peace of mind that if their loved one gets sick, they will get the care they need. We are talking about Americans who have every desire to know that if their loved one gets injured, they won't end up bankrupt. But all of that is at risk tonight.  A few moments ago, my colleague from Nebraska came to the floor, and he started out by saying we need to ensure that the President doesn't overstep his powers. Let's talk, too, about this Senate not destroying its procedures designed to ensure a ``we the people'' republic, which means we should all vote to send whatever bill comes out tonight to committee, where it can be duly considered in a bipartisan fashion, with experts, with consultation.

During the Presidential campaign, this was a very provocative claim, and he said Mexico would pay for it.  So why does the defense appropriations bill have a blank check for this wall?  I, like so many of my colleagues, including Republicans, know that this wall is unnecessary and environmentally catastrophic.  It will require us to seize property through imminent domain. It is ineffective, just like Homeland Security Secretary Kelly has said.  I urge my colleagues to oppose funding for this ill-gotten wall, to vote against the rule before us today, and begin to work on an honest conversation about the types of immigration reform that our country needs.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6479-5.txt,1676,FIXING INTERNAL RESPONSE TO MISCONDUCT ACT,2017.0,27.0,July

3545,topic-id,688,"Thank you, Mr. We are starting to hear rumors of what is in the so-called skinny bill, and it is not skinny. It is humongous. It is filled with all sorts of conservative priorities, whether it be--these are rumors--the end to the individual mandate, the elimination that insurance companies are required to include certain coverages, the denial of funding to Planned This is not a bill that is designed to go to conference. This is a bill that is designed to become law.  I just want to put all of the pieces together for folks what we are hearing tonight, because you are hearing, if you are following this all across America, different pieces of news emerging from different parts of this city. Let me try to put it together for you for a minute.  First, you are seeing this skinny bill get fatter and fatter, which all of a sudden looks like a piece of legislation that is not designed to go to conference. It looks like a piece of legislation designed to become law.  It is healthcare arson. It sets the insurance markets on fire. It immediately takes insurance from 16 million people and drives rates up by 20 percent on a compounding basis. This is insanity.  It is getting bigger and bigger, which makes you wonder, wait a second, is this about going to conference or becoming law? Then we got another piece of information. The White House doesn't support the conference. The White House likes the skinny bill and wants it to become law. Then we got another piece of information. The House of Representatives tomorrow morning will declare what is called martial law. That is a procedural move that will allow the House to pass the bill that comes from the Senate as quickly as possible. This isn't going to conference, this is becoming law. Then the icing on the cake is the most curious piece of news: a statement from the Speaker of the House in which he says, not ``we will go to conference,'' he says, ``I am willing to go to conference.''  Why ``I am willing to go to conference'' and not ``we will go to conference''? Well, maybe you got the clarification from his spokesman who said: ``Conference committee is one option under consideration, and something we are taking steps to prepare for should we choose that route, after first discussing with the members of our conference.''  Can you see what is happening here? Can you see what is happening here? This is a bill that is being sold as just a procedural step to get to conference, but everything else that is happening around it suggests this is becoming law. Even if I am not right, let's also be clear about the process. Even if there is a conference, how on Earth is the conference going to come to a conclusion that the Senate could not? Right? You are going to introduce the Freedom Caucus to the U.Senate and think you are going to get more functionality and not less functionality? Even if you get to that conference, it will last for a couple days, maybe a couple weeks. They will come to no conclusion, and then guess what. The skinny bill, which is not so skinny any longer, is there for the U.House of Representatives to pass and put into law. All the while, the President of the United States is cheering that on. That is the signal he gave you. The President of the United States does not support a conference. He supports a bill that we are going to have unveiled later tonight and passed. He supports that bill going into law.

3565,topic-id,784,"Mr.President, this process is an embarrassment. This is nuclear-grade bonkers what is happening here tonight.  We are about to reorder one-fifth of the American healthcare system, and we are going to have 2 hours to review a bill which, at first blush, stands essentially as healthcare system arson.  This bill is lighting the American healthcare system on fire with intentionality. To use the word ``freedom'' at its center--there is freedom in this bill. There is the freedom to go bankrupt, there is the freedom to get sick and not be able to find a doctor, and there is freedom in this bill to die early. That is not hyperbole. That is what happens when, overnight, 16 million people lose insurance.  Don't tell us that is because people all of a sudden will not be mandated to buy it. This is a vicious cycle that happens. When you get rid of the mandate, every insurance company will tell you that rates skyrocket because you are not getting rid of the provision that requires insurance companies to price sick people the same as healthy people. CBO says that rates go up immediately by 20 percent and then 20 percent after that and then 20 percent after that. So all of a sudden you can't have the individual mandate because nobody can afford to buy the product.  There is a lot of freedom in this bill, it is just not the kind of freedom we all thought was at the heart of this reform measure. This is real life. It is not a game.  I know lots of Members on the Republican side are voting for this because they have some promise that even though this bill is terrible--and everybody admits it doesn't solve any problems--it will get to a forum in which the problems can be truly solved. That is gamesmanship. That is not senatorial. That is not what this place was supposed to be. This was supposed to be the great deliberative body where we solved big problems, and this bill surrenders to the House of  Let's just be honest about what is going to happen when this bill gets to the Maybe there will be a conference committee, but it will not resolve any of the problems which have been inherent in the Republican conference here in the In fact, those problems will get worse because you will inject the Freedom Caucus into a Republican conference here that alone wasn't able to come to a conclusion. They will argue for a couple weeks, maybe a month, and then the House will decide to proceed with a vote on this bill.  There is nothing in the rules that locks this bill into the conference committee once it is there. The House can pick it up out of that conference committee and move it to a vote--and they will do that because none of the problems that were solved here will be solved there.  We have seen this happen before. Remember the budget stalemate in which this hammer of sequestration was created, and the supercommittee was supposed to solve all the problems the House and the Senate couldn't? They didn't, and now we are stuck with sequestration--something nobody thought would happen. This is the same thing.  This will not be a hammer sufficient enough to solve the dysfunction which has always been present in this process. Thus, the conference will be doomed, and this bill will become law--raising rates for everyone, locking millions of people out of the system of insurance, with no answer for the parents of those disabled kids who have been begging to get into Senators' offices. This isn't a game. This is real life. If this bill becomes law, real people will be hurt.  We are begging our colleagues to vote for the motion to commit. Take us at our word. We want to work with you. We acknowledge there are still problems that need to be solved, though we maintain there are parts of the Affordable Care Act that are working. What if we owned the problem and the solution together? What if this wasn't a perpetual political football? There is still time for us to work this out together if you support us and vote for the motion to commit.  This process is an embarrassment to the U.This isn't why we all came here--and don't delude yourself into thinking that this bill you are voting on will not become law.

3447,topic-id,898,"Madam President, I want all my colleagues and everyone listening right now to be very clear about what Republican leadership is planning for today. Faced with defeat after defeat on their plans to rip apart our healthcare system--``no'' on a bill that would spike families' premiums, gut Medicaid, and deny 22 million people healthcare; ``no'' on a bill that would cause chaos and healthcare costs to skyrocket and deny 32 million people healthcare--it appears the Republican leader has a last-ditch plan waiting in the wings.  As soon as they have an official score from the CBO--which could be hours from now--in the dead of night, Senator McConnell will bring forward legislation that Democrats, patients, families, and even many Senate Republicans have not seen, and try to pass it before anyone can so much as blink.  Now, we have heard rumors about what could be in this bill, and based on what we know, Democrats took it upon ourselves to do the best we could to figure out what its impact will be. The CBO scored our best guess at what Republicans are talking about doing, and here is what they found: Sixteen million people will lose their healthcare coverage in the next 10 years under this bill; premiums will increase by 20 percent every single year for the next 10 years; your premiums will increase 20 percent every single year in the next 10 years, all while special interests in the healthcare industry are going to get a massive tax break.  Republicans could still play games with the language as they negotiate in secret somewhere to try to get a bit ``better'' than this, but no matter what they do here, if they jam it through, they will be held accountable for the millions of people who lose care and the millions and millions more who will see their premiums go up.  I hope, when my Senate Republican colleagues began their process, they were not planning to pass a bill in the dark of night to deny millions of people healthcare and hand special interests billions in tax breaks, but, right now, that is the path they are careening down--even as more and more people are speaking up about what the impact of this legislation would have.  In fact, just yesterday, a bipartisan group of 10 Governors wrote a letter urging Senate Republicans to reject this secret bill, saying it would--I am quoting 10 bipartisan Governors--``accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.''  I hope every single Senate Republican read that letter.  I also hope they understand that if they pass this bill tonight, it will only get worse from here. If this secret bill--the lowest common denominator--goes through and a conference starts with the House, then every Senate Republican who voted for it has just bought TrumpCare a trip to the White The Senate Republicans who so loudly made clear they hated the TrumpCare bill when it passed the House could now very well find themselves being held responsible for sending that same bill straight to President Trump's desk because, let's be honest, extreme conservatives aren't going to rest until they have a bill on the way to the White House that would spike premiums and out-of-pocket costs, gut protections for preexisting conditions, end Medicaid as we know it, defund Planned Parenthood, and kick tens of millions of people off their coverage--a bill that would, in other words, shatter the promises of more responsible Republicans who I know are deeply concerned about ways these outcomes would impact the people they serve.  So, to put it simply, a bill in conference is no excuse to kick people off coverage, spike premiums by 20 percent for everyone, and give a massive tax break to the wealthy, especially because it will simply be an opportunity to hand the keys over to the House Freedom  I want to remind any Senate Republican who doesn't want to have TrumpCare on their hands--who truly does want to make our healthcare system work better for patients and families--there is a better path. As Senator McCain said so powerfully earlier this week, we shouldn't let the ``bombastic loudmouths'' drive our work. We should get back to regular order, and we still can.  I am saying to every Senate Republican every chance I get: Drop this partisan, sham floor process. Drop it. Start over with an open, transparent process in which both sides, patients, and families across the country have a voice.  I hope that as big as our differences are, many of my Republican colleagues would prefer that bipartisan voice and route. They have said as much. Their votes to reject the partisan TrumpCare and full repeal bills this week made it even clearer.  So let's have hearings like Chairman Alexander has proposed to do in our HELP Let's have a public[[Page S4363]]debate. Let's focus on policies that lower costs, that expand coverage, and improve quality.  Democrats are ready. We are at the table. I hope Senate Republicans who are ready to work on real solutions will join us, but, first, for that to happen, Senate Republicans need to step away from this sham process we are on today. Say no. Vote no. Return us to a process we are all involved in.  I yield the floor.

Mr.President, after months of secret negotiations and backroom deals and shutting out patients and families and women and Democrats and even many Republicans from the process, Republican leaders continue to say they are planning to force a vote on this latest TrumpCare bill tonight--a bill even Republicans admit would throw our markets into turmoil. It is going to kick millions of people off of care, it is going to raise premiums for millions of families, it will eliminate healthcare for women across the country, and so much more--none of it good.  It does not have to be this way. In fact, Republicans can still reverse this course. They can drop this once and for all and join with Democrats to get to work to actually improve healthcare, to reduce costs, to increase access, and to improve quality. We can start over with an open, transparent process, in which both sides--Democrats and Republicans--have a voice and one in which patients and families can make sure their priorities are being addressed.

3427,topic-id,1148,"Madam President, we have chaos in It is a protracted crisis in Venezuela, which took yet another turn for the worse yesterday.  Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro pushed ahead with a vote to form a constitutional assembly despite the vehement opposition of the Venezuelan people and overwhelming international criticism. It became a sham vote. Only about 10 percent of the population voted. The opposition stayed home. Plain and simple, the vote was illegal, and it was rigged. Once again, on the streets and at the ballot box, the Venezuelan people have made themselves heard loud and clear. Two weeks ago, more than 7 million Venezuelans voted against even holding this vote, and, yesterday, millions of people stayed home.  Maduro wants to rewrite Venezuela's Constitution so that he can cling to power, and yesterday's vote was only the latest attempt to undermine, if not to completely undo, Venezuela's democracy. He continues to crack down on protesters, killing more than 100 and injuring and arresting thousands more. His thugs have raided homes and terrorized the opposition's families. He has tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers, undercut the Attorney General, and he has co-opted the courts. His thugs attacked the National Assembly and injured opposition lawmakers. He blocked a lawful referendum to recall his election.  His cronies steal the country's money and enrich themselves. All the while, the Venezuelan people suffer. The people go hungry; children are malnourished; there are no staple products--no medicines, no medical supplies for the people. Of course, you know who gets the food and the medical treatment. It is the privileged few--the Maduro ones whom he protects. This is Venezuela's tragic reality.  Maduro has made himself a dictator, and he and his cronies are bent on turning Venezuela's once vibrant democracy and once vibrant economy into a Cuban-style regime. Nevertheless, the Venezuelan people, in the face of violence, oppression, and deprivation, continue to fight for their democracy--for the little bit of freedom they have left. They are doing everything they can--at great risk to themselves and their families--to save their democracy and, thus, to save their country. The task just got a lot harder.  The issue before us is what we can do to support them since Maduro has now installed himself with this fake referendum on the National What can we do to keep Maduro from being the dictator he is?  What we need to do is to condemn the National Assembly as the sham that it is. It also means the United States increasing the pressure on the Maduro regime. I just spoke this afternoon with the Treasury The United States announced a little earlier this afternoon that it has frozen Maduro's assets. I expect at least two other countries to follow suit--and probably more after they do. This is an important step, and I hope that it is the first in what will be the strongest possible economic sanctions to stop It is time that we consider cutting the imports of Venezuela's oil also.  What have we done thus far?  There was already a group of Maduro's cronies--some in the private sector, some in the government--on whom the sanctions have been slapped. You ask: What does that do? What good does that do? Listen, all of these cronies of Maduro's love to come to They love to have offshore bank accounts and all kinds of assets stashed overseas--if not in the United States, perhaps in some of those other countries that are going to follow suit. We should do that with his cronies.  What we have done today with the announcement by the Treasury Department is to freeze Nicholas Maduro's assets, and if other countries will follow suit, they are going to freeze his assets as well.  Maybe we should take the next step. The next step is that Venezuela exports a lot of its oil to the United It is such a heavy, dirty crude that a good part of that has to go to the refineries in the United States because those refineries are the ones that are capable of refining that heavy, dirty crude. Maybe we just ought to stop our imports of Venezuela's oil and absorb that percentage of loss of oil that is coming into the United States from Venezuela as, clearly, on the world marketplace, oil is fungible. Maybe that is what we ought to do because we are now dealing with a Cuban-style dictator who is the head of  I think, in going forward, that the United States must insist on the release of all political prisoners and the rule of law and that Venezuela has to go back to when it was a thriving democracy. That was back when they respected human rights and the people had some freedoms. As the United States, we ought to help rally the nations of the Organization of American States and rally the support of the world to bring about a meaningful end to this crisis because it is just going to get worse and worse.  The violence that you have seen on the TV yesterday and today is going to continue. As you continue to squeeze the people, to starve them, to take away all semblance of human decency, what do you think they are going to do? They are going to revolt, and the violence is not going to stop.  There is a role for Congress, and there is an opportunity for the Congress to lead. The President's budget eliminated the funding for democracy programs in Venezuela that supported the old National Assembly and civil society and those same democracy programs that promoted human rights and the encouraging of an independent media.  Recently I wrote to the Senate Appropriations Committee, along with a number of other Senators, urging that the committee continue that funding for those democracy programs in In May, this Senator joined Senators Cardin and Rubio and seven others in introducing the Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance That bill addresses the many aspects of the crisis in  It codified targeted sanctions on regime officials--something we are now implementing--and thank goodness for this announcement today by the administration. I give them kudos for that. That act would authorize badly needed humanitarian assistance. It would back OAS efforts to bring about an end to the crisis, and it funds election observation organizations and[[Page S4612]]groups working to defend democracy in  These are bipartisan efforts, and I urge our colleagues to support them, and I urge that we bring them up as soon as possible.

Mr.Speaker, as we know, the energy and manufacturing industries are two of the most critical and fastest growing sectors both domestically as well as internationally. The potential of these two industries can help bolster the American economy and are also vital to the growing number of people seeking middle class status--not just a change of lifestyle, but seeking more money. They are satisfied with their lifestyle; they just need more income.  It is important, Mr.Speaker, that we equip our citizens with the skills needed to meet this growing demand so that we can tap into these tremendous opportunities, and this bill, Mr.Speaker, will help us accomplish that goal.  Mr.Speaker, this 21st century workforce legislation addresses an issue that is neither partisan nor bipartisan, but, rather, it is nonpartisan. It is a nonpartisan issue that benefits communities, benefits industry, and benefits the overall American economy.  This bill brings together government agencies, including the national labs, the energy and manufacturing industries, unions, schools, community colleges and universities, among others, and promotes cooperation and collaboration to ensure that we are tapping into a wealth of underutilized talent and are training and preparing workers for the energy and manufacturing jobs of the present and also of the future.  Mr.Speaker, one of the challenges that many of my constituents--and constituents all across the land--have brought to my attention pertains to individuals participating in training programs that, in many cases, don't even lead to finding a job.  With that in mind, Mr.Speaker, this bill will help industry, schools, and community-based workforce organizations to identify candidates for enrollment into training and apprenticeship programs. The objective will be to ensure that the skills learned are immediately transferable to good-paying jobs and good-paying careers within the energy and manufacturing sectors regionally, nationally, and, indeed, internationally.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is important because it matches up the needs of industry with a willing and able workforce and, in the process, helps start new cycles of hope and opportunity for groups who have, in many cases, been overlooked and underserved: the White working class, the Black working class, and the Brown working class.  This legislation can help to open new pathways to jobs, careers, and entrepreneurial opportunities for women, minorities, our veterans, and all the different working classes that comprise the American workforce while also helping to move our overall economy forward.  Mr.Speaker, at a time when African-American and Latino unemployment rates are too high, when coal miners throughout the Rust Belt and beyond are finding themselves without work, when too many female heads of household cannot find adequate employment to take care of their families, and when veterans returning from defending our country still cannot find a job, it is a travesty--Mr.Speaker, a travesty--that eager employers still cannot locate the trained workers that they so desperately need.  This is common sense, Mr.Speaker, and this is a commonsense jobs bill that will help match up trained and qualified candidates with good-paying jobs and careers that will help lift up communities, strengthen the energy and manufacturing industries, and bolster the entire American economy as a whole.  With its focus not only on underserved communities such as minorities, women, and veterans, but also displaced and unemployed coal miners and other out-of-work energy workers, I can assure you, Mr.Speaker, that when this legislation ultimately becomes law, it will go a long way in helping not only communities that look like the one I represent on the south side of Chicago, but look like communities all across the Nation, including communities in West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and New Mexico--all across this country, every community and every district throughout this  ",CREC-2017-06-12-pt1-PgH4831.txt,1003,HONORING KBTX-TV,2017.0,12.0,July

After years and years, some of my Republican colleagues have begun to understand that we cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which allows 28 million Americans to have no health insurance, which forces us to pay the highest prices in the world, by far, for healthcare and even higher prices--outrageously high prices--for prescription drugs.  I understand that Senator Daines has offered a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system, and I congratulate him. It sounds to me as though the Republicans are beginning to catch on about the need to transform our healthcare system and join the rest of the industrialized world.  So I say to Senator Daines, if he is prepared to vote for this legislation and if he can get maybe five, six more Republicans to vote for this legislation, I think we can win it, and I think the United States can join the rest of the industrialized world and finally guarantee healthcare to all people.  So if Senator Daines and five or six other Republicans vote for this, count me in. And we are going to work together, finally, to provide healthcare to all people.

3570,topic-id,1198,"Mr.President, at last count, I think it was the Gallup poll that found 12 percent of the American people had confidence in the U.I think we are on our way tonight to single digits because in the modern history of this country there has never been a process as absurd as what we are seeing right here.  We are talking about legislation that impacts one-sixth of the American economy--over $3 trillion. We are talking about legislation, because it is healthcare, that impacts every man, woman, and child in this country.  Mr.President, maybe you can help me. How many public hearings have we had dealing with legislation that is of enormous significance to tens of millions of people? Well, I will help you with the answer: There have been zero hearings.  What impact will this legislation have on doctors who are trying to treat us every day? One might think that we would hear from the doctors of the American Medical Association to tell us how this legislation would impact their work. We have not had one public hearing to hear from one doctor.  What has the American Hospital Association had to say about how this legislation would impact rural hospitals in America, many of which may close down? They have not had one moment, one opportunity to say one word on this legislation.  We are proceeding here with major legislation written behind closed doors by a handful of Most Republicans have not been involved in this process, let alone Democrats, let alone the American people.  By the way, when we think of the American people, how do they feel about this legislation? Well, the last poll that I saw was USA They had 12 percent of the American people thinking that this legislation makes sense. Well, maybe the American people got it wrong. How do the major healthcare organizations in America feel about this legislation--the people who are on the cutting edge, the people who do the work every day? Well, guess what. The AMA, the American Medical Association, is opposed; the American Hospital Association is opposed; AARP, the largest senior group in America, is opposed because they know the horrendous impact this will have in raising premiums for older workers; the American Cancer Society is opposed; the American Heart Association is opposed; the American Academy of Family Physicians is opposed; the American Academy of Pediatrics is opposed; the American Psychiatric Association is opposed. Virtually every major national healthcare organization is opposed to this disastrous legislation.  So the American people are opposed, and the healthcare organizations all across this country are opposed. The bill was written behind closed doors. Yet, under those circumstances, they want to bring it to the floor for a vote.[[Page S4404]]  Now, what most Americans are sitting around and thinking--they are saying: Look, the Affordable Care Act has done some good things. Before the Affordable Care Act, we had some 50 million people without any health insurance. The Affordable Care Act provided insurance for about 20 million people. That is no small thing.  In the majority leader's own State of Kentucky, the rate of uninsured went from 20 percent down to 7 percent. That is pretty good--not great, but it is pretty good. In West Virginia, the rate of uninsured went way down. We have seen 20 million people gain insurance. We have dealt with the Affordable Care Act under a total obscenity; that is, if somebody had a serious illness--breast cancer, diabetes--they could not get insurance at an affordable cost because of a preexisting condition. How insane is that? The American people said that is nonsense. What is the function of insurance if not to cover us when we need it the most for those illnesses that we have had? We ended that absurdity. That was a good thing. The Affordable Care Act has done other very important things.  Have you heard one Member of this body say that the Affordable Care Act is perfect? Have you heard one person here say that the Affordable Care Act does not need to be improved? Of course, it does. Right now, throughout this country--in my State of Vermont and all over this country--deductibles are too high. I have talked to people with $5,000, $10,000 deductibles. They can't go to the doctor when they should. We have to lower deductibles. Copayments are too high. Premiums are too high.  I will tell you something else. Donald Trump ran for President, and he campaigned, and he said: I am going to stand with the working people of this country. Prescription drug costs are too high. I am going to take on the pharmaceutical industry. We are going to lower prescription drug costs in Today, if you can believe it, one out of five Americans under 65 cannot afford to fill the prescription their doctors write. Today, somebody walked into a pharmacy and found that the cost of the medicine they have been using for 10 years has doubled, maybe tripled, because we have no legislation that stops the drug companies from charging us anything they want. And they will charge us anything they want. The result is, we have the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  Those are the problems that the American people want answers to: Deductibles are too high, premiums are too high, copayments are too high, and prescription drug costs are too high. We are not doing enough good work in primary healthcare. Too many people, even with insurance, cannot find the doctors they need. There are many other problems. Those are what the American people want us to solve.  This legislation only makes a very bad situation worse. How do you improve healthcare in America when you throw 16 million people off of the health insurance they currently have? How do you improve healthcare in America when, according to the CBO, premiums are going to go up 20 percent every year? Let's get that clear: 20 percent on January 1, another 20 percent the following year--that is 40 percent--and another 20 percent the year after. Do you think this is really improving healthcare, bringing freedom to the American people? I think not.  So what is the solution? The solution is--I know this is a radical idea--that maybe we should do what the American people want us to do and not what special, powerful interests want, not what billionaire campaign contributors want--whose rightwing ideology wants to end government services for working families all across this country.  I hope that we will have the common sense and the decency to sit down, throw the problems on the table, and then resolve them. I think we can do that. That is why we have to end this absurd process. We have to go back to regular order, which simply means go back to the committee.  I am a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Let's have that discussion. Let's hear different ideas. Let's solve problems. Let us not make a bad situation worse, and let us not make the American people even feel more contemptuous of this institution than they currently do.  Thank you.

3448,topic-id,2062,"Madam President, in the fall of 2015, when I first spoke on the Senate floor, I gave Nebraskans and every Member of this body my word that I would speak up when a Republican President exceeded his or her powers. At that moment, the Democratic President had taken to himself powers the Constitution had not given him. My opposition was not that President Obama was a Democrat but rather that our brilliant Constitution intentionally separates executive and legislative powers.  I gave my promise then because, despite the lazy, partisan rhetoric of this city, not everything is actually a blood feud between Republicans and That is because American politics at its best is acutely aware of the difference between justice and strength. That is because when our body is working well in the Senate, we take seriously our history, our duties, and our unique place in the Constitution's architecture of separate powers, both vertically and horizontally.  In 2014, the U.Supreme Court ruled that the Obama administration had made unconstitutional appointments when it declared this body to be in recess when the U.Senate was not, in fact, in recess, and it functionally claimed power--that is, the administration functionally claimed power--that belonged to the Senate under our  So today I have come to the floor to keep my promise and to offer a word of humble advice to the If you are thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the Attorney General, forget about it. The Presidency isn't a bull and this country isn't a china shop. Mr.President, you are a public servant, in a system of limited government, with a duty to uphold and to defend and to teach to our kids the Constitution's system of checks and balances. This--this is the world's greatest experiment in self-government. It works only if all of us--Presidents, Senators, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and judges--if we all keep our faith to the American institutions and to the rule of law.  Our oath is not to popularity, it is not to polls, and it is not to political parties. Our oath is to the Constitution and to the rule of law. Our duty is to the American people--the men and women who elected us, the men and women who came before us, and especially the men and women who will come after us in this greatest of experiments in self-government.  Madam President, with respect to the healthcare debate that we are having in this body, while I obviously look forward to taking seriously and considering any and all amendments offered by my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, the basic trajectory of where we are in healthcare has not changed. We should all be disappointed by where we are.  Here is what I mean. It is very likely that in the coming decade, basic math is going to force Americans and those who will serve them in this and other institutions of government--they are going to be forced to choose between two paths. This isn't that hard to see. We are ultimately going to choose between single-payer, socialized medicine--something I think is terrible policy, but it is intellectually coherent--or we are going to actively build the innovative, disruptive system of consumer-based health insurance that actually goes with consumers and patients and Americans and taxpayers across job and geographic change. We are ultimately going to make a choice.  Sadly, this has been a missed opportunity. We are not making the big choice now. We are making a choice between a couple of small options. We have forks in front of us that are, I think, dissatisfying to everyone. I have one constituent at home, who also happens to be my wife, who when she checks in on the processes of Washington, she regularly says: Both of your political parties are so gross. She is dissatisfied, like so many of the constituents who call us and come to our offices, with the fact that we are not debating the real stuff around here. We are making a choice between two small, pretty crappy options, when really the big choice that is in front of us--when we have health entitlements which dwarf everything else on the Federal budget--the two choices before us aren't really that hard to see. We are ultimately going to migrate toward a European-style single-payer system, where government will be more effective at controlling costs, but it will do it by crowding out lots and lots of the private sector. We are either going to have single-payer healthcare or eventually we will create a system where you have portable, affordable insurance.  We have none of those things today. We have no portability today. You can't take your insurance policy with you across job and geographic change. When I change jobs, I don't lose my life insurance. I don't have to cancel my car insurance because I changed jobs. But we are still living on a system that launders our insurance, which is really mostly the collectivized prepayment of mostly predictable medical expenses. We launder it through a tax accident from the 1940s. So you have to do that through your large employer group. You can't do it in the small market or as an individual. So we don't have portability, and we all know we need portability.  We did this 30 years ago in pensions. We used to also launder through a tax accident where, when people were presumed to work at one firm through their whole career, they had a defined benefit pension plan. It worked when you worked at the same place from high school graduation to retirement. It doesn't work when the average duration at a job for Americans is now under 4 years. So we did the hard work of reforming a pension system from a defined benefit to a defined contribution, tax-protected, portable 401(k) plan.  Obviously, we all know that if we are not going to end up in socialized medicine, we should have portability in our health insurance benefits. We should have farmers and ranchers in the Presiding Officer's State or in my State able to keep their insurance that they usually have to buy through the individual market, or we need the gig economy mobile workers who are going to change jobs even faster than every 4 years to not become uninsured for 4 to 6 months every fourth year when they change jobs. That is actually the 1 driver of uninsurance in America today.  To listen to pundits screaming on TV, you would think that somehow there are so many sicker or so many poorer Americans and that is why we have had arcing uninsurance since 1990. But that is not true. We don't have more poor people and we don't have more sick people. Uninsurance went up from 1990 to 2009 because people change jobs more rapidly, and every 4 years when they change jobs, if they have a 4- to 6-month period of uninsurance, that is when they get the breast cancer diagnosis, or probabilistically that might be when they get in the car accident, and now they become the preexisting condition population of 5 and 10 and 15 years from today.  This isn't rocket science. Uninsurance has grown in America over the last 25 years because we change jobs more and we have a stupid, clunky system from 60 years ago that we still launder through a tax accident. We should have portability. We should have affordability. We should have a real debate in this body about why so many--and by the way, I have been critical of my party for not having a good plan for replace. But I will say to those on the other side of the aisle, the ``Affordable Care Act'' is an absurdly Orwellian name for a piece of legislation that those who were in this body and voted for 7 years ago told the American people--you all did a press conference at the White House, and you said premiums would fall $2,500 per family of four. They have risen $3,200 on average per family of four. So your plus or minus sign was off to the tune of $5,700 per American family.  In my State and in the Presiding Officer's State, we now have a lot of[[Page S4364]]farming families in counties where there is only one insurer, where premiums are now north of $20,000 a year for the insurance market.  Stop pretending this is in any way affordable.  What we have is a system where the assumption is that because the system is so broken, the only way anybody could ever get health financing--and supposedly, health financing is the means to getting access to the health delivery system--is that everybody needs to be on welfare. That doesn't work.  We should have a robust social welfare safety net for the poorest and sickest among us, and we all in this body should be accountable for passing a piece of legislation that delivers a system where lower middle-class and middle-class and upper middle-class Americans can afford their own health insurance. Not everybody in America needs to be on welfare, and not everybody in America wants to be on welfare.  So our system is not affordable, it is not portable, and fundamentally it is not really insurance.  We have a system that is mostly about the collectivized prepayment of all medical expenses. We don't do this in any other sector of the economy. Think how absurd it would be for us to pass a law in this body mandating that Allstate and State Farm have to buy all your gas and schedule all your Jiffy Lube appointments. That is what we are trying to do in healthcare. Guess what. We can guess what it would look like. Jiffy Lube would be open at the wrong hours; it would be at the wrong locations; we wouldn't know what services they deliver; there wouldn't be quality metrics on any of it; and it would probably grow at 2 to 2\1/2\ times inflationary or GDP growth--just like healthcare.  We are trying to hyper-regulate and micromanage all of the largest sector of the U.economy from here by pretending we are talking about insurance, when we are not. What this body and what the Congress and what Washington, DC, have wanted to do for years is run every decision in healthcare but not tell the American people the truth--that it turns out it is really expensive.  Nobody comes to the floor and advocates--maybe Bernie does. Maybe Senator Sanders comes to the floor and actually honestly advocates for raising taxes to the level of all the micromanagement of the health sector that people in this body want to do. But what most people want to do--and it isn't just your side of the aisle; it turns out it might be a lot of people on my side of the aisle as well--they would like to have so much control over the healthcare sector but not admit how expensive it is, that we will do it by regulations on the financing model so you can hide it under the word ``insurance.'' Most of what is happening in American healthcare isn't insurance. Insurance is insulating people from catastrophic loss from non-behaviorally-driven, unpredictable events.  Everybody in this body wants every American to have health insurance, and everybody in this body should also want a health delivery system where the average American family living on middle-class wages could afford to buy their healthcare without potentially going broke or needing to become a ward of the State in the form of welfare. We should be having that debate. We should have a debate about portable insurance, about affordable insurance, versus socialized medicine. I am against socialized medicine, but people who want to advocate for it have an intellectually coherent position. That is the debate we should be having. Instead, we are going to kick the can down the road and have another small-ball debate. This is a lost opportunity for the American people, and it kind of makes a sham of the joke that this is the greatest deliberative body on the face of the  I live in a little farm town in There are 10 not-for-profit boards in my town that deliberate a heck of a lot better than we deliberate in this body.

3537,topic-id,444,"Mr.President, you know, late this afternoon, around 5 o'clock, a number of Republican Senators indicated their unwillingness to support the so-called skinny bill, which would rip healthcare from 16 million people, according to CBO, and increase health insurance premiums by 20 percent--and not 20 percent over several years, 20 percent per year for the next several years, doubling health insurance premiums over the next 4 or 5 years. That is the bill we are talking about. They said that they don't like this bill, but they are willing to vote for it if they are provided assurances that this is just sort of a procedural vote.  We just had a motion to proceed that was procedural in nature, according to them. We think it is the vote on healthcare.  Now, this second vote, which is actually a vote to enact legislation--they are saying they are going to vote for it but only on the condition that we go to conference committee.  Something just happened over the last couple of hours that is actually pretty astonishing. The House Rules Committee adopted what they call martial law. Now, it is not quite as bad as it sounds, but it is pretty bad. What that means is it gives total control over the procedures to the House majority.

Our first order of business should be to stabilize the individual market and then both parties should work together through regular order through committees to discuss other improvements. Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray have indicated they want to work together, have public hearings, and do this the right away. I am hopeful Chairman Hatch, Ranking Member Wyden, both of whom have proven themselves willing and able to work across party lines, also will be willing to work closely together to address broader problems with our healthcare system.  Let me repeat. The first order of business should be to stabilize the individual market, which has been racked by uncertainty.  Right now, as insurers prepare to lock in their rates and plans for 2018, the Trump administration is dangling a massive sword of Damocles over the heads of millions of Americans, threatening to end payments the administration is supposed to make that would lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for so many These payments are critical to keeping healthcare costs down and keeping the markets stable. Remember, AHIP--the largest trade group of insurers--has said the uncertainty about these payments is ``the single most destabilizing factor in the individual market.'' That is not Chuck Schumer or some Democrat saying it, it is the insurers saying it. Make no mistake, by refusing these payments, President Trump is sabotaging our healthcare system. He is actively trying to make it collapse, taking out his political loss on the American people. That is not being Presidential; that is small, it is vindictive, and it will hurt millions of Americans he has sworn to help.  In Pennsylvania and North Carolina, insurers have filed two separate sets of possible rates for 2018; one if the payments are made and one if they are not. If the payments are not made, premiums would be 20 percent higher.  Let's repeat that. If the payments are not made, if President Trump follows through on his vindictive idea of not making the payments, premiums will be 20 percent higher for the people of North Carolina and So if President Trump does not guarantee these payments permanently, Americans will have to pay a Trump tax on their premiums next year.  Let me say that again. If President Trump does not guarantee these payments, Americans will be paying a Trump tax of 20 percent higher premiums.  President Trump has a responsibility to make our healthcare system work, and millions of Americans will hold him accountable if the system implodes on his watch, if insurers leave the markets on his watch, or if their premiums go up 20 percent or more on his watch.  Of course, we in Congress could remove the uncertainty hanging over the market and take the decision out of the President's hands. We can and should guarantee these payments as soon as possible, before the insurers set their rates for next year. I urge my Republican friends to join us on Senator Shaheen's bill to guarantee these payments and prevent President Trump's premium tax from going into effect. Republican Senators Alexander, Collins, Hatch, Portman, and Johnson have all spoken about the need to do this. I hope they will help us move forward. We could get this done very quickly and show the American people that we are able to work together on healthcare in a very bipartisan way, to help keep costs down for so many ratepayers.                             Sanctions Bill  Now, Madam President, on the matter of Russia sanctions. I was very proud last week, as nearly every Member of Congress, save five, voted to pass legislation for sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea; that there was such bipartisanship on that issue. According to reports, the President will sign the legislation.  These are tough sanctions. They will have a real effect on Russia, and they are more than justified. President Putin violated the sovereignty of Ukraine, aided and abetted human rights abuses in Syria, and attacked the very foundation of our democracy by meddling in the 2016 election.  Just as importantly, the sanctions bill gives Congress the ability to review any decision to weaken, dilute, or lift sanctions on President Putin will not be able to get out from under the sting of these sanctions without the consent of  Let this be an unequivocal message to Mr.Putin and any other nation that is thinking of interfering in our elections: If you interfere with our elections, which we hold sacred, you will be sanctioned. Those sanctions will be severe.                          Russia Investigation  Finally, Madam President, a word on the investigation conducted by Special Counsel  Since the beginning of the investigation of Russia's meddling into our elections both here in Congress and in the executive branch, the heavy hand of the administration has never been far away. We know that the administration solicited the help of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee to beat back reports in the press about Russia's interference in our election, and that was after 17 intelligence agencies said that it happened. The President fired FBI Director Jim Comey and admitted on national television that he was thinking about ``this Russia thing'' when he did it. Then, after Special Counsel Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation, allies of the administration went on television to defame his character, to sully his reputation--a shameful ploy to degrade a man with[[Page S4611]]one of the most sterling records of nonpartisan public service that a man can have in this country.  On Twitter, the President routinely berates and humiliates his former friend--maybe he still is a friend; who knows--his Attorney General, his great ally in his campaign. Jeff Sessions was one of President Trump's earliest friends, one of his first supporters in Not only does that get to character--I cannot imagine any American likes the way Senator Sessions was treated, whether you agree with him or disagree with him--but it also raises questions about whether the President wants the Attorney General to resign so that he can appoint a new Attorney General who is willing to fire Special Counsel  If such a scenario were to pass, we would have a constitutional crisis on our hands. The Senate should remove even the possibility of its coming about. So, in the tradition of the Senate, I expect that we will hold pro forma sessions throughout the upcoming recess to prevent a recess appointment from being made.  The fact that President Trump continues to meddle with the Department of Justice and impede the Russia investigation gets to a larger question: If President Trump has nothing to hide, nothing to fear, why not let Special Counsel Mueller do his job, follow the facts, and finally get to the bottom of the matter?  On a matter as important as foreign interference in our elections, the American people deserve a thorough and impartial investigation into the facts. President Trump should come nowhere near it.

3624,topic-id,522,"Mr.President, let me thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for yielding us time.  This august body has been around for over 220 years. It has rules. It has traditions we are very proud of. In recent years--both parties to blame--many of those traditions have been eroded. What happens when you erode the traditions--the bipartisanship, the ability to work through the regular order--is very simply that the product that emerges is not very good. There is a reason this body has been the greatest deliberative body in the world, and it is because it had those traditions. Now we don't have them.  We have a bill that we have seen for 2 hours. It affects the healthcare, perhaps the lives--almost certainly the lives--of millions. It affects the daily lives of men and women and children. We haven't even had a chance to explore all the ramifications. There is a lot of anger on the other side at the I understand that, but you are repeating what you claim are the same mistakes.  Just as maybe ObamaCare could have been made better if it were a bipartisan proposal, this one certainly would have been made better. This skinny repeal, CBO tells us, will kick 15 million people--16 million people--off care. This skinny bill, after all the cries of reducing premiums as the major reason that ObamaCare needed changes, will raise premiums 20 percent a year, ad infinitum. The average working family is going to struggle to get healthcare even more than they have now.  Why is this being rushed through this way? Why is this being done in the dark of night? I can't believe my colleagues are proud of it. If they were, there would be brass bands down the streets of smalltown America celebrating this bill. That is not what is happening. It is midnight. Debate is curtailed. We can't amend it in the open. We can't do what is needed.  So I would plead once more with my colleagues, let's start over. We are the first to admit that the present law needs some changes. We are the first to want--maybe having learned our own lessons--that it should be done in a bipartisan and sharing way. Let's start over.  We can do better. We can do better for all those people who are going to be hurt. We can do better for the traditions of this great institution. We can do better as Americans who love our country and love our democracy and love our process. It is not too late to turn back from this proposal ideologically driven and do better because we all are not proud of this product. I don't think there is hardly anyone in this body who is proud of this product.  Let's make this a turning point, not just on healthcare but in how we function together.

I support this and look forward to a vote on the measure. It is important we do it.  I also understand that the majority leader will consent to an amendment vote alongside that bill on bipartisan Russia sanctions legislation. There is a broad bipartisan consensus for moving forward on tough sanctions against Russia defied the sovereignty of the Ukraine with the annexation of It has been accused of human rights abuses including propping up the brutal Assad regime in Syria, and of course the intelligence community has confirmed that Russia interfered with our democracy.  I appreciate that the majority leader has committed to having a vote on Russia sanctions, and I thank so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for pushing this issue. It is the right thing to do, and I appreciate them doing it.  I strongly believe that Russia's sanctions legislation needs to do three important things. First, we must codify existing sanctions on Russia; second, we need to give Congress a chance to review any decision by this administration before sanctions are lifted; and, third, we need to impose tough, new sanctions on Russia for its attack on our democracy.  Two pieces of legislation, one posted by the two lead sponsors, Senators McCain and Cardin, the other by Senators Graham and Cardin--both bipartisan and both, I believe, with at least 10 cosponsors from each side of the aisle--do these things.

3817,topic-id,1442,"Mr.President, the American people are looking to Congress to turn the page on healthcare and start working on bipartisan improvements to our healthcare system. Stabilizing the individual market is the first thing we should all focus on. The repeated attempts to repeal and replace the healthcare law, as well as the administration's threat to stop making the cost-sharing payments that help keep premiums down and keep markets stable, have injected massive uncertainty into the system.  Insurers hate nothing more than uncertainty. It drives them to jack up the costs of premiums and to pull out of markets. Already, insurers in three States have issued two separate sets of proposed rates for 2018--one if the administration makes the cost-sharing payments and one if it does not. The set of proposed rates if the payments are not made is 20 percent higher in all three I don't know the third, but two of them are North Carolina and Pennsylvania, which are very significant In Idaho, the State insurance commissioner said that rates on the most popular plans would be 50 percent higher next year because of ``the potential refusal by the Federal Government to fund the cost share reduction mechanism.'' That comes from the State insurance commissioner. I do not know if that is an elected position, but whether it is elected or appointed, my guess is that he is a They do not elect too many Democrats out there.  The administration is supposed to announce today or sometime this week its decision on whether to make the next set of payments. The ball is in the President's court. He can make the payments as the law requires and needs or he can sabotage our healthcare system and impose a Trump premium tax of 20 percent higher premiums on the American people next year by not extending the cost-sharing program.  Why would he do this? Why would he raise people's rates? His only stated reason is petty, is childish, is un-He will get back at people because his hope to repeal and replace was rejected. You do not hurt innocent people when you lose politically. That is not That is not, frankly, what an adult does. The ball is in the President's court, as I said, and let's hope he does the right thing.  President Trump has already made it harder for Americans to afford insurance next year by publicly rooting for our Nation's healthcare system to collapse, injecting a baseline of uncertainty into the system. President Trump would make things a whole lot worse by not making the next set of payments--20 percent higher premiums, more bare counties, even more market instability.  The American people need a President who puts their interests first, not someone who plays political games with their healthcare. The American people can ill afford a Trump premium tax this year, and it is completely avoidable. All the President has to do is to make the payments and carry out the law as he is supposed to. Afterward, Congress should move to guarantee these payments permanently or at least for a significant period of time.  This uncertainty caused by the President's threats has been the most destabilizing factor in the individual market. That is not according to Chuck Schumer or any Democrat; it is according to the insurers' largest trade group, The President has proved that he cannot be trusted to faithfully execute the procedures that keep our healthcare system on track.  The only good news here is that there are moves by people on both sides of the aisle in this Senate to take some of this uncertainty off the table by guaranteeing these payments in the future.  My good friends, the chairman of the HELP Committee, the senior Senator from Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, and the ranking Democratic member, Senator Patty Murray, have an ability to work together on many issues. I know they are meeting almost as we speak--in 5 minutes--to discuss how we can move forward. I spoke to Senator Alexander in the gym, where the Presiding Officer, I want to tell his constituents, was exercising and staying fit, too, and he seemed very eager to try to work together to stabilize the system.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, on another matter--taxes--it is clear that our economy would benefit from a bipartisan package of changes to our Tax Code that would focus laser-like on increasing wages for working families, improving middle-class job growth, and promoting domestic investment, while modernizing our outdated business and international tax system.  From what we have heard from the White House so far, its plan would not do any of that. We Democrats are open to a bipartisan discussion on those issues, but we also believe that, in an economy in which wealth is seemingly funneled to the already wealthy, it is working Americans who deserve tax relief, not those at the very top. The wealthiest Americans have seen outsized benefits from recent economic gains. Now is not the time to shower millionaires and billionaires with another tax break while working Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet.  Today, 45 Members of the Democratic caucus sent a letter to our Republican friends, writing that we are open to bipartisan discussions on tax reform but that we will not support any effort to rewrite the Tax Code to give another tax break to the top 1 percent or add even more to the deficit and the debt.  Here are our three principles outlined in the letter:  First, no new tax breaks for the top 1 percent.  Second, it must not increase the debt and must be fiscally responsible.  Third, we must use a regular order process that will ensure true bipartisan input in the product, not the reconciliation process that was used in healthcare, which excluded the Democrats from the get-go and, in part, led to the failure of the Republicans to[[Page S4636]]pass repeal or repeal and replace. Ramming tax cuts through under reconciliation--the very same partisan process that failed for healthcare--is the wrong way to do business for this country.  Again, the Democrats are open to a bipartisan discussion on tax reform, but it has to be truly bipartisan, not under reconciliation, and tax reform cannot be a cover story for delivering tax cuts to the wealthiest or result in a ballooning deficit and debt.                         China and North Korea  Mr.President, finally, on the matter of China and North Korea, under President Trump, North Korea continues to ramp up its aggression; yet China has not taken any significant steps to bring to an end its threatening and destabilizing behavior.  President Trump has staked his administration's approach to North Korea on China doing more, but right now 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade is with China, and 95 percent of its foreign direct investment comes from  Even as the U.Security Council and the U.Congress have again sanctioned North Korea, China's trade with this rogue nation has risen more than 30 percent over the past year, according to some reports. Even after the recent ICBM tests--clear violations of international resolutions--China and Russia have worked behind the scenes to water down and weaken additional U.Security Council sanctions resolutions.  President Trump has talked about his ``wonderful relationship'' with President Xi, but this is not the behavior we should expect from a partner that is serious about the crisis on the Korean  The bottom line is simple. China could put pressure on North Korea right now, but they are taking a pass, as they have for over a decade.  President Trump began the year by offering a ``better trade deal'' to China if they put pressure on North That clearly hasn't happened. The soft-touch approach has gotten us nowhere, as usual, with China; they only understand strength. China continues to do the bare minimum as North Korea becomes more and more bellicose.  So, today, I am urging President Trump to use his authority over the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, and instruct the Treasury Department to suspend the approval of mergers and acquisitions of U.assets by Chinese companies until China works to bridle its neighbor's aggression.  China and its surrogates must face economic pressure if they are not going to help deter North This is an important tool in our country's toolbox, and the President ought to use it.  I urge President Trump to take a tougher line and suspend the approval of all mergers and acquisitions in the United States by Chinese companies.  I yield the floor.

3552,topic-id,699,"Mr.President, I want to support what my colleagues have been saying on this floor. The reason we haven't seen a bill, the reason we have no idea what is coming is that this is a political exercise by the It is about winning and losing. But for people in the country, for people in Michigan, it is personal. This is not a political game. This is personal. For everyone who cares about their children and wants to make sure they can take them to the doctor; if you have a mom with Alzheimer's and you might lose the ability to have nursing home care; if you have cancer and know you may not be able to get the full treatments that you need, this is personal. And, as has been said, every single proposal of theirs is higher costs and less coverage.  So we voted on what was behind door 1, which would gut Medicaid healthcare. Three out of five Michigan[[Page S4398]]seniors get their nursing home care from Half of the people we see with Medicaid healthcare are children. All of the funds in the first proposal would go to tax cuts for the wealthy few and pharmaceutical companies and destabilize and undermine and raise costs for everybody else. So that is door 1: higher costs, less coverage.  Then, when that didn't go forward, it was door 2. Door 2: Repeal everything that was passed under the Affordable Care Act and then say to folks somewhere down the road, we will figure out how to replace it. That is higher costs and less coverage.  Now we are at door 3, and we don't know what is behind door 3. All we know for sure is that it will be higher costs and less coverage.  Now, we as Democrats want just the opposite. We want to work together with our Republican colleagues to lower costs--by the way, starting with the outrageous increases in prescription drug costs. And we want to increase coverage options, increase health insurance. That is what we are all about. I believe--I know in Michigan--that is what people want me to be focused on.  Are there problems in the current system? Of course, and we should fix those, but we don't have to rip away healthcare and raise everybody's costs 20 percent a year as is being talked about now in order to fix the problems that are there.  I want to quote Senator McCain, who said that it is time to ``return to regular order,'' work to reduce ``out-of-pocket costs,'' and learn to ``trust each other'' again.  It is pretty tough to trust colleagues, to trust the majority, when we aren't even given the respect of knowing what we are going to be voting on. And it is not just--it is not about us. It is not about us as individuals; it is about the fact that every person who is getting cancer treatments right now needs to know what the U.Senate is going to be voting on and have a chance to respond. Every person who cares about their child, who cares about their parent in a nursing home, who cares about their future has the right to know and to read a bill and know what is going on.  I want to say in conclusion--I want to close with the words of Margo, who manages a health clinic in Kent County in the western part of Margo knows the benefits of increased access to healthcare because she sees it every day. She knows it is not political; it is personal. There is nothing more personal than being able to take your child to the doctor and get the healthcare you need or care for your parents.  Margo wrote:       Seeing working people who have struggled all of their adult      lives to manage their chronic health conditions finally have      access to regular doctor visits, health education, and      prescription medications has been a tremendous relief. It is      amazing how different the lives of our patients are today      compared to what they were a few years ago.  She added: ``You can't imagine the sense of dignity the people I see feel.''

3521,topic-id,452,"Thank you.                           Amendment 389  Mr.President, I rise today in support of an amendment that will relieve millions of Americans of a moral conflict. For too many, access to healthcare coverage comes only with the restriction of deeply held personal convictions about the sanctity of human life.  The amendment before us offers the opportunity to end the flow of taxpayer dollars to abortion procedures once and for all. It allows Hyde protections to be extended to all funds appropriated through the healthcare legislation we are considering today.  Let me provide some context. Premium tax credits implemented under ObamaCare currently provide over $8.7 billion in annual subsidies for nearly 1,000 different insurance plans that cover elective abortion on the State exchanges. This provision stands in violation of the fundamental principle of the Hyde amendment and the long-held understanding that the U.Government has no role in funding abortions.  In recent weeks, the Senate has debated countless nuances of healthcare policy, and we have taken several crucial votes on efforts to rescue the American people from a failed social experiment, bringing us to this moment. Under our current procedural circumstances, in order to ensure that both the spirit and the letter of the Hyde amendment's provision against taxpayer-funded abortion is upheld, we need a new solution.  My amendment would establish a matching arrangement between stability funds and premium tax credits, delivering an arrangement that complies with the Byrd rule. Starting in 2019, the value of premium tax credits that continue to subsidize elective abortions would drop to 10 percent, with the remaining 90 percent being made available as Hyde-protected monthly payments to insurers to benefit the same people who relied on those tax credits.  Let me be clear. This amendment does not reduce the amount of tax credit dollars available to low-income It does not result in their losing coverage. It certainly does not create or expand an entitlement program.  When hard-working Americans pay their taxes, they do so with the understanding that the rights granted to them by the Constitution are not checked at the door. For the people of my State, the right to life is foremost among these, codified by the Hyde amendment and engrained in the conscience of a majority of The amendment before us allows for a clear conscience. It allows for a concise, conservative solution to a problem that has dogged this Chamber for the 44 years since Roe v. Wade changed the landscape of American society.  On behalf of the unborn and the conscience rights of millions of Americans, I am proud to offer this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

3455,topic-id,1649,"Mr.President, I wanted to weigh in on a debate that took place on the floor a couple of hours ago--actually, when I was presiding in the chair--between the majority leader and the minority leader on what we are going to be doing here in the next couple of days on the Senate floor.  So right now we are having a healthcare debate. We are finally having a healthcare debate. Many Members on both sides of the aisle--I say to the Presiding Officer, I saw your speech a few hours ago--are talking about the importance of healthcare for our country, the importance of, from our perspective, repealing, replacing, repairing a healthcare system that is not working. It is certainly not working the way in which it was promised to I will not repeat all the promises made by the former President and many Senators, but we know those haven't come to pass.  As a matter of fact, a number of us--I certainly believe in my State, the State of Alaska, the so-called Affordable Care Act has done a lot more damage than good. Here are just a few statistics in Alaska: Premiums in the individual market went up over 200 percent since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act--200 percent. Alaskans in that market--individual Alaskans, for one health insurance plan for one individual, pay almost $1,100 a month in premiums for healthcare. That is not affordable.  So we are debating it. It is important. There is an open amendment process. We are probably going to be debating all night, and that is what we should be doing--the world's greatest deliberative body debating a very important topic, but healthcare is not the only issue the Senate is focused on.                                  NDAA  As a matter of fact, a number of us on the Armed Services Committee, over the last several weeks, have been working on and debating and bringing amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act, the yearly act that authorizes funding and training and equipment and policy for our military and young men and women who serve in our military. It is one of the most important things we do in the Senate, by far. So we have been doing that as well as healthcare, which is also extremely important.  Three weeks ago, after a lot of debate in committee, after a lot of hard work, debate between Republicans and Democrats, the draft NDAA of 2017, the National Defense Authorization Act--focused on our national security, focused on our troops--passed out of the Armed Services Committee 27 to 0, a very bipartisan bill, a very important bill, and a very important bill for the country to move on after the healthcare debate.  So the majority leader and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee had a very simple request of the minority leader this morning when I was in the chair presiding, and the request was: Once we are done for now--because it is going to continue with the healthcare debate, we will not be done for a long time--once we complete the business we are undertaking for the next several hours on the healthcare debate, that we move forward to debate and pass the NDAA of 2017. It is a pretty simple request, a very reasonable request.  This bill, like healthcare, is extremely important for the Nation, for our troops, for national security. On a personal note, it is particularly important for one of our Members, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain of We all know him. Americans[[Page S4368]]know him. He has been a mentor to many of us, a leader, certainly an American hero who has sacrificed immeasurably for our country. In another of a series of heroic acts by the Senator from Arizona, he returned to the Senate this week after announcing that he is fighting brain cancer. Now, Senator McCain is a fighter. He is going to win this fight, but he is going back to Arizona very soon for treatment.  So many of us--but especially the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee who did more than anyone to move that bill forward in such a bipartisan way--want to take up the NDAA after the healthcare debate. It is pretty simple, pretty reasonable, and really good for the country: finish the healthcare debate for now with this open amendment process that we are beginning already on the floor, then turn to the NDAA after and debate that. It is good for our troops, good for our national security, and it would show a lot of respect to the chairman of the committee who has done more for his country and more to advance this important bill than anyone else.  I hope all of my colleagues--this shouldn't be a partisan issue--can agree to this, but unfortunately we are hearing rumors that the other side is saying: Unless we vote against any healthcare bill to continue to move forward, unless we vote against it to move forward, then they are not going to take up the Now, does that make any sense? We are going to debate healthcare. That is really important, but now we are hearing the other side saying: If they don't get their way in the debate, then forget about it. We are not going to take up the bill that authorizes the training and equipping and the policies of the U.military. Does that make any sense?  The answer to everybody--everybody in the Senate Chamber, anyone watching on TV--it makes no sense. These are not connected. These are not connected issues.  Is playing politics with our troops, tying it to another bill, any way to advance the national security and the welfare of the men and women serving in our military? The answer is no.  Unfortunately, we have seen this movie before. Some might remember last summer, right around this time, we were working hard on appropriations bills. The Appropriations Committee voted different appropriations bills out of committee, as they are supposed to do, and they voted the Defense appropriations bill out of committee with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  So what did we do? We brought it to the floor to debate it and try to pass it--funding for the troops. That bill was filibustered six times by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, six times. Go home and explain that vote, why you filibustered spending for our troops--when they are in combat, by the way--six different times. I came down to this floor numerous times asking somebody, anybody on the other side to come down to the floor and explain why they were filibustering spending for our troops on a bill that passed out of the Appropriations Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support.  I am going to ask the same question. The NDAA came out of the Armed Services Committee 27 to 0. If the minority leader is going to filibuster that, he should come down and explain it. If he is really saying we will only take up the NDAA if we get our way on the healthcare debate we are having right now, he should come down and explain that because it makes no sense. It makes no sense, particularly because we all know that right now we are seeing very significant national security threats to our country. Pick up the paper--Iran, Russia, China, and in particular North  There was a report in the paper just the other day--yesterday, front page of the Washington Post--saying it is now estimated that North Korea is going to have an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile likely by next year that could range not only my great State of Alaska but the rest of the continental United These are serious national security threats. One of the provisions in the NDAA that had bipartisan support was to significantly enhance our country's missile defense. Is that important? Given the North Korean threats that are at our doorstep, do you think the American people care about that? It is important. It is important, as are the hundreds of other bipartisan provisions in the NDAA that will enhance our national security, authorize funding for our military forces, increase the numbers in our military end strength--and again very bipartisan.  Mr.President, you and I have the honor of serving on the Armed Services It is a great committee. It is very bipartisan. We get a lot of work done, led again by a great U.Senator, John It is an honor to serve there.  I believe right now the Senate is trying to reach a unanimous consent agreement that as soon as we are done with healthcare, we will then take up this critically important bill. As the chairman wants, as he has requested, and as our military needs, we should do that. This is not a hard decision by Democrats or I hope we can do that.  I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whatever your plans are in the next couple of days, we will get through this healthcare debate--very important for the country--and then let's get through the NDAA debate and pass that bill as well. What we shouldn't be doing is playing politics with our military or somehow tying moving forward on an important piece of legislation for them to another issue that has nothing whatsoever to do with it. We shouldn't be doing that, and if we are, shame on those who are.  So let's move forward, let's have this healthcare debate, and when it is completed, let's immediately move to the NDAA and pass that. It is a bipartisan bill. It is going to help our Nation, help our troops, enhance our national security in dangerous times. There is no reason anyone should block moving forward on that important piece of legislation as well.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Perdue).

3768,topic-id,640,"Mr.President, I am honored to speak tonight after casting my vote to confirm Heather Wilson as Secretary of the Air I have known Heather for nearly 20 years and submit that President Trump could not have selected a more qualified candidate to lead the Air Force in these demanding times. I am pleased that the Senate was finally able to confirm her nomination, and I wish her great success.  As an Air Force veteran, former Member of Congress, and most recently the leader of one of the top science and engineering schools, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Wilson has repeatedly demonstrated leadership abilities that will serve her and the Air Force well in this next chapter.  Her commitment to duty links back to her time as a cadet at the Air Force Academy, where she was a distinguished graduate. In fact, she will be the Academy's first graduate in history to serve as a Secretary of the Air Wilson went on to serve as an Air Force officer in Europe during the Cold War, where she was based in the United Kingdom and at the U.Mission to NATO in Upon leaving the Air Force, she served on the National Security Council staff of President George H.Bush, working on NATO and conventional arms control.  At a time when America's partnerships are being challenged by threats around the world, I am confident that her experience will lend a steady hand to our military decisionmaking.  Wilson will also bring with her great experience honed in the Halls of At the start of her decades-long representation of New Mexico's First Congressional District, she quickly became one of the go-to Members on national security issues. Heather took on tough issues not unlike the ones she will surely face as Secretary of the Air Whether on issues of strategic objectives and readiness or personnel matters, such as military sexual assault, she is prepared to have frank discussions on the issues and will contribute insightful proposals on how to best tackle the many challenges facing the Air She understands not only the Air Force's key capabilities but the perilous outcomes we may face as a nation if we do not properly train and fund our military. She knows that rising to meet the challenges of the day must be done with an eye to the future so we may also deter and defeat the threats of tomorrow.  At a time when national security is of foremost concern, Wilson understands the Air Force's tremendous responsibility in keeping Americans safe and will be guided by the core values of the Force: integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all that the Air Force does.  I could not be happier for my friend, Heather Wilson, and wish her and her husband Jay the best of luck. South Dakota and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology are losing an asset, but I am confident that the new era of excellence Heather helped usher in leaves the school well-positioned to remain a foremost engineering, science, and research institution. We are proud of Heather's continued success and trust she will represent us well as the 24th Secretary of the Air  I would like to thank my colleague, Chairman McCain, for his work to advance Wilson's nomination through the Senate Armed Services Committee and for granting me the opportunity to introduce Wilson at her confirmation hearing. It was my honor to endorse her before the committee and to cast my vote in support of her nomination this evening. I am glad the Senate has advanced another of President Trump's nominees and wish Wilson, our next Secretary of the Air Force, continued wisdom and success as she continues her outstanding leadership in service to our country.

Likewise, I thank Roe for all that he has done for veterans.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization  Fixing this outdated system was one of my top priorities while I served as ranking member of the VA Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs When I assumed that position, much of the focus was on the VA disability claims backlog, which had ballooned, causing many veterans to wait almost 2 years just for their initial claim decision. After that backlog was addressed and reduced, the problem shifted to the appeals process, where today, as you have heard, almost 470,000 veterans are currently waiting in an overburdened and overcomplicated system that was first developed in the 1930s and last updated in the 1980s.  I regularly hear from my veteran constituents who are stuck in this appeals process about the need for reform. One veteran we are helping in Las Vegas has been working since August of 2013 to have his appeal adjudicated; and another Nevada veteran who, out of desperation, came to my office, took 4 years to complete his process.  So, obviously, the current system is just unacceptable. If we don't act, it is only going to get worse. We have heard statistics that soon veterans may be waiting for more than a decade just to have their appeals adjudicated.  Last year, working closely with the VA, with the committee, and with many of our partners in the VSO community, I introduced legislation to address this outdated process. I am very proud that my proposal is the basis for the legislation we are considering today.  The changes that were made to that legislation are positive additions, and I appreciate the work that Chairman Bost and Ranking Member Esty have done to improve the bill and bring it to the floor.

3509,topic-id,3378,"Mr.President, I am going to speak mostly about some Medicaid reforms that were proposed in the BCRA, but in the course of the discussion, I am going to touch on some of the issues that our colleague who just finished raised.  As we know, the BCRA bill is not going to be the vehicle we will take to a conference committee with the House, but I hope we will get to a conference committee with the House, and I hope the result of that, among other things, is that we will address the need to make important reforms to Medicaid because they are long overdue.  I will start with a chart which illustrates our Federal deficits and what exactly is driving our Federal deficits. The fact is--I think we all know here--we have two big categories of Federal spending. One is the discretionary spending which Congress approves at Congress's discretion every year. The other category is the programs on autopilot--programs where spending is driven by a person's eligibility for the program without Congress acting in any way.  That latter category we call mandatory spending. In 1980, that was only 50 percent of the Federal budget. By 1995, it was 64 percent. Last year, it was 70 percent of our entire budget, and we are on a path to have these mandatory spending--the blue line. We can see the growth in mandatory spending. We can see the relative lack of growth in the other categories of spending, be it defense or nondefense discretionary spending.[[Page S4382]]  The budgetary problem we have is mandatory spending. This is not breaking news. This is nothing that is controversial. Anybody who has taken an honest look at the numbers can come to no other conclusion. The discretionary portion of the budget, which used to be the lion's share of the budget, has been relatively flat. Actually, it has even declined in recent years. The mandatory spending has been going through the roof.  Of course, there are multiple problems with this, not the least of which is--at this kind of growth in mandatory spending--the first thing it does is it squeezes out all other categories of spending. We are already living through that, as the discretionary spending--including on our Nation's defense--has been declining because you can't do so much of both, but in time you could zero out all the discretionary spending, and there still will not be enough for all the mandatory spending which is coming our way if we stay on the path we are on.  Where is all this mandatory spending coming from? The next chart shows that pretty clearly. The bulk of mandatory spending, especially in recent years, is from The reason I say that is, Social Security is a big program, but Social Security has a dedicated revenue stream. The payroll tax historically used to cover all of it. For a while there, it covered more than the ongoing payments for Social While that fluctuated when we suspended the payroll tax, by and large, the payroll tax pays most of the Social Security costs that we have day-to-day.  Medicare also has a revenue stream that is dedicated from payroll taxes, but it doesn't cover nearly as large a percentage of the Medicare costs as Social Security so we see the green line generally is higher than the blue line.  The line which is higher than all by far is the Medicaid line because there is no dedicated revenue stream to Medicaid, and the net expense, therefore, is by far the biggest of all our entitlement programs.  Medicaid has been growing at a really shocking rate for years. In 1980, Medicaid spending was only 2.4 percent of our budget, a half a percent of our economy; by 1995, it was almost 6 percent of our budget; and today it is 10 percent of our whole budget, 17 percent of all healthcare spending. So this is happening because Medicaid is growing much faster than our economy is growing.  The fact is, no Federal program can grow faster than the economy indefinitely because the economy has to fund the entire Federal Hopefully, funding the government is only a portion of what our economy is doing. The main purpose of our economy is to provide a livelihood for the people who create it, but Medicaid, as we can see, is growing at a staggering rate compared to our economy as measured by  This picture right here summarizes, really, for me the very definition of an unsustainable Federal program because as it continues to grow at a rate that is much greater than our economy, it necessarily is consuming an ever greater percentage, an ever greater portion of our economy and our Federal budget. Nothing can grow faster than our economy indefinitely. It is just arithmetic. Eventually, it would become bigger than the economy, which is obviously an impossibility, and long before that happened, it would cause a fiscal crisis. This is the very essence of what is unsustainable.  You don't have to take my word for it, and I am certainly not the first person to observe this. We could take the words of Democratic President Bill Clinton, who told us this very thing. Back in 1995, President William Jefferson Clinton said:       We all now, looking ahead, know that our number one      entitlement problem is Medicare and They are      growing much more rapidly than the rate of inflation plus      population.  Now, President Bill Clinton wasn't making this point because he is some kind of ideologue who wants to get rid of I don't think he has ever been accused of that. It is not because he has some passionate ideological commitment to reducing the size of government. I don't think he has ever been accused of that. I think Bill Clinton was making this point because he knew this program was unsustainable, and he wanted to reform it so it would be sustainable, so our Federal budget would be sustainable, so Medicaid would be there for the next generation. I think that was Bill Clinton's motivation at the time.  So what was his solution? What was it that Bill Clinton thought we ought to do about this program that was unsustainable?  President Bill Clinton suggested the Federal Government put caps on the amount of money it would contribute to the States based on the number of individuals enrolled. In other words, it was a per beneficiary limit on the Federal contribution. That was what Bill Clinton proposed in 1995. He wanted to maintain the eligibility of individuals to participate in the program, but he wanted to put limits on what the Federal Government's share would be. He wanted to have it grow at about the rate the economy would grow so you wouldn't continue to have this wildly accelerating line relative to this modest growth line but that the two lines would converge, because then, as Bill Clinton knew, the program would be sustainable over time. We would be able to afford it.  One might wonder, what did Congress think of this idea at the time. This is 1995. Bill Clinton came along and said: Let's establish per beneficiary caps on Medicaid expenditures by the Federal Government, and let's limit the growth of those caps to about the growth of the economy. That was Bill Clinton's idea.  Helpfully, the Democrats, who controlled the Senate, decided to weigh in on the matter, and on December 13, 1995, Senator Patty Murray--who serves with us today--submitted a letter to the Congressional I am going to read a very brief comment she made when she submitted this for the The senior Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, said:       Mr.President, I hold in my hand today a letter to      President Clinton that is signed by all 46 members of the      Democratic This letter urges him to hold firm to our      commitment to basic health care for children, pregnant women,      the elderly, and the disabled in this country. This letter      supports a per capita cap approach to finding savings in the      Medicaid program.  It was signed by every single Democratic They expressed their strong support for the Medicaid per capita cap structure.  I want to be very specific about this because as they developed the particulars, they decided the cap should not grow at an index that was tied to healthcare spending. They wanted it to be tied to an index which would grow at the rate of the economy overall, and they proposed it would go into effect the very next year. They didn't want to wait. They didn't want to have a transition. They didn't want it to be gradual. They wanted it to go into effect the next year. They proposed implementing the changes for the very next fiscal year.  So you can imagine that some of us are a little bit surprised by the shrill, over-the-top attacks we have been hearing from the other side. We Republicans have been accused of launching a war on We have been accused of draconian cuts. We have been accused of wanting to decimate healthcare for the most vulnerable. We could go on. As you and I both know, all across this country, on this floor, in every form imaginable, our Democratic colleagues have attacked Republicans for the proposal in the BCRA bill we have been considering.  What is really so outrageous about this is, we proposed the Democratic solution. What we proposed was Bill Clinton's idea, as ratified by every single Democrat serving in the Senate at the time, including several who are still with us today. We proposed that we take Medicaid and restructure it the way the Federal Government reimburses States for their expenses so that we would put caps on the amount the Federal Government would contribute per beneficiary. We would allow the caps to grow, but just as President Clinton and all the Democrats in the Senate suggested, we would make sure that growth eventually converged to the growth of our economy so we would have a sustainable program.  There are two big differences between what the Democrats proposed in the mid-1990s and what many of us have proposed these last few weeks:  One, we proposed that the change occur more gradually. We suggested that we would implement these[[Page S4383]]changes, but we do it over time, not suddenly, the way they had proposed it.  The other big difference, I would suggest, is they proposed this structural change to Medicaid before ObamaCare came along and made an unsustainable program worse. We are proposing it in the aftermath of that huge problem.  I get our Democratic colleagues have done a 180 reversal. I get they no longer acknowledge that this is unsustainable. I get that they don't want to do anything about entitlements. I understand all that. You are entitled to change your opinion, you are entitled to decide you want to ignore this issue, but it is a little bit over the top to attack our motives, our integrity, when we are proposing exactly what they themselves proposed just a few years ago under President  I wish we could have a substantive discussion about the policy without the character attacks.  Let me get into a little bit more about these changes to  As the Presiding Officer very well knows, traditionally, Medicaid was available, from the time the program was launched, to four categories of Americans--four categories of people who were of very low income and were deemed to be unable to purchase healthcare for themselves. Those are the elderly poor, disabled, blind and disabled children, and adults with dependents. So the program set up a partnership with the States--a generous partnership. The Federal Government has always paid a majority of the costs, ranging anywhere in some States as high as 75 percent of the costs and no State less than 50 percent--on average, 57 percent.  ObamaCare came along and created a new category of eligibility. Under President Obama, for the first time--under ObamaCare--a new category was created; that is, adults, working-aged, able-bodied people with no dependents, would now be eligible for Medicaid if their income was below 138 percent of the poverty line. The Federal Government would pay all of the costs initially, and then after a short period of time, it would go to 90 percent. Then the Federal Government would pay 90 percent in perpetuity.  Well, there are a few problems with this design. The most fundamental and obvious is the Federal Government couldn't afford this. We were not on a sustainable path before, and now we have created this whole new liability which can only make it worse and bring a fiscal crisis closer to the present.  The second thing is, when States have no skin in the game, we find out they behave as though they have no skin in the game. When States have to contribute only 10 percent of the cost--think about it. Every dollar a State spends in this category gets matched with nine Federal dollars, nine free dollars. That is a huge incentive to spend a lot, and guess what. That is exactly what they have done. Medicaid spending in this category has ended up being over 50 percent more than what was expected.  So what did the Senate propose in our legislation? We proposed not that we would disallow this coverage, not that we would eliminate this category of eligibility, not that we would throw a single person off Medicaid--we have said, in fact, we will codify the expansion. We will make it permanent. No one loses eligibility, no one gets thrown off.  What we will do is gradually, over 7 years, we will ask States to pay their fair share for this new category--this expansion category, the able-bodied adults with no dependents. We will ask the States to pay the same amount for these folks that they pay for the traditional four categories of eligibility. That is the first category.  The second reform we proposed is what I alluded to earlier, the Bill Clinton-Democratic Senate proposal of establishing per beneficiary caps. That was in our legislation. What the underlying Senate bill did was allow the spending to grow very rapidly on those caps. Only in the eighth year did we ask that the growth rate slow down slightly so we would have a reasonable chance so the growth in the program would be about the same as the economy. That is what we proposed. That is what was in the bill. That is what we have been hearing about--all of these draconian cuts.  Let's get to the discussion about these cuts. We have another chart that illustrates this because it has been a favorite theme for some of my colleagues on the other side to talk about all of these cuts.  If you look at the CBO score--again, this is the Senate BCRA, the legislation on which we didn't get enough votes this week to pass, but I hope we will revisit it--the largest of the so-called cuts in Medicaid spending comes from CBO's assumption that if you repeal the individual mandate--the statute that says you must buy insurance, you must have insurance--millions of people on Medicaid, millions of people who did get free health insurance, will decide: Oh, I don't want free health insurance anymore. If I am not being forced to buy it, I am not going to take free healthcare. Why would I do that?  I don't know about you, but that is a little counterintuitive to me. To my friend from Oregon who is attacking the so-called skinny bill, 100 percent of the so-called Medicaid cuts in that bill come from exactly this source. The assumption is that, if people are not forced by the government to have insurance, they will not want You can decide how much credibility you want to put in that assumption. It strikes me as ridiculous, but that is the truth. That is the reality of the so-called CBO cuts in  In the BCRA, that was only the lion's share of the so-called cuts. Another category of so-called cuts to Medicaid in the CBO analysis of the BCRA are their assumptions about expansion. They decide that under current law, if nothing else happens, a whole lot of States will choose to become Medicaid expansion  They haven't made that choice yet. They can't point to which ones. It is a political decision in the various They don't know who is going to be leading those They have no idea about how that would happen, but yet they predict States that have chosen thus far not to be Medicaid expansion States would adopt the expansion under current law. If we passed the law that was proposed earlier, those States would not make that decision. Furthermore, some States that have expanded will rescind the decision to expand.  Any honest person, including the folks at the CBO, have to acknowledge that this is entirely speculative. They can't name a single State that will expand under the current law but hasn't yet. They can't name a single State that would rescind its expansion having already done so. They are just speculating that could happen.  That, my friends, is the lion's share of the CBO's headline numbers about all these cuts in  Let me go to chart 5. Despite that, even if you accept the CBO's unbelievable assumptions that people only participate in Medicaid if they are forced to and that these mysterious States will expand and others will not--these are the draconian cuts--each and every year, under the BCRA, Federal spending on Medicaid grows. It grows every year--every single year. It is only in Washington that spending can increase every year, and it is a draconian cut.  No, the truth of the matter is that what we do under that legislation is that we slow down the rate of growth. We slow the rate at which the program grows to a rate that is sustainable, so that this program is viable, so that we are diminishing the certainty of a fiscal crisis. That is what we do.  If somebody has a better idea for how we put Medicaid on a sustainable path, I am all ears. I would love to hear it. In the 1990s, our Democratic colleagues proposed exactly what we are proposing now. That was a very constructive idea. Unfortunately, there wasn't a consensus to do it, and that is a shame.  I urge my Democratic colleagues to go back to their notes, to go back to the discussion, to go back to the arguments they were making together with President Bill Clinton on the floor of this Senate and around the country about Medicaid, because we are making those arguments now. You would think we might be able to find some common ground.  The fact is that Medicaid is a very, very important program. The most vulnerable Americans depend on Medicaid to a very significant degree. The fact is that, in its current form, it is unsustainable. Our Democratic colleagues in the past used to recognize[[Page S4384]]this. They used to acknowledge this, and they used to want to do something about it. I urge them to return to that attitude so that we can work together and get something done.  The sooner we act on this, the sooner we can have gradual, sensible, thoughtful reforms that make the program sustainable and allow our States to plan for these changes and allow for a transition. If we wait too long, the fiscal crisis that will hit us will force sudden and draconian changes.  We are not going to vote on this provision today. This was embedded in the That is behind us this week, but it is my hope that we will pass a version of ObamaCare repeal that will enable to us to go to conference and that we will be able to begin to repair the enormous damage to the individual markets that ObamaCare has done, that we will be able to stabilize them, that we will be able to move in the direction of consumers actually having control of their own healthcare once again, and that we will put Medicaid on a sustainable path, because the time is overdue.

3450,topic-id,1052,"Mr.President, the Senate is now in its third day of voting on major healthcare legislation, and we still have no idea exactly what the Republican leadership wants or what bill they are going to put on the floor. The Republican leadership tosses out options, bills that would affect the lives of millions of Americans and one-sixth of our economy. Not even Republicans know what proposal is coming next, and the American public certainly doesn't know what is coming, and they are very interested because they have healthcare and they want to know if it is going to be taken away from them.  It is as if the Republicans are playing healthcare roulette. The leader spins[[Page S4365]]the roulette wheel, the ball lands arbitrarily on some version of the ACA repeal, and the leader quickly calls a quick vote on that random version of ACA repeal.  Soon we are going to vote on a cynical amendment from the Republicans offering Medicare for all. My understanding is the Senator offering this isn't even going to support his own amendment. If you were in a State legislature, you would be prohibited from offering an amendment like that. They oppose this Medicare-for-all amendment. They oppose Medicare for all. So why are they seeking a vote? To distract from their own dangerous bills and reckless process. It is a desperate ploy, and everyone sees through it. I support healthcare for all. It should be a right in this But this is a phony and insincere amendment.  All the while, the President stands to the side, not caring one whit what the bill looks like or how many people will be hurt in the rush to get a bill out the Senate door.  On Tuesday, we voted on the leadership's Better Care Reconciliation Act 2.0. That would cut 22 million Americans off healthcare. It also has been rejected overwhelmingly by  Yesterday, we voted on straight ACA repeal, not replacement. That bill would throw 32 million Americans off of healthcare. That idea is no more popular than the other bills.  Today, maybe we will vote on a last-ditch version which would repeal parts of ObamaCare, the so-called skinny repeal option. That bill is no better. It would mean 16 million Americans get thrown off healthcare, and the other very important part of this is that it would raise premiums 20 percent. We have heard our friend from Nebraska come down here on the floor and talk about their concern about healthcare and concern about the cost of premiums. They ought to know that this proposal is going to raise premiums 20 percent.  This bill is the Republicans' last hope. It takes away the individual mandate to get health insurance and the employer mandate to provide health insurance to employees. Like the other schemes the Republicans have tried, it would hike premiums for the elderly and for the sick.  Blue Cross Blue Shield is opposed to this proposal. They say ``strong incentives for people to obtain health insurance and keep it year round''--that is what they are looking for, that is what is in current law, and we have the Republicans wanting to take it out.  There must be Affordable Care Act cost-sharing provisions for consumers. Otherwise, there will be--and this is Blue Cross Blue Shield again--``steep premium increases and diminished choices that would make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible.''  Like the other schemes, this won't ensure that more Americans will have healthcare; it means many fewer will. It doesn't decrease healthcare costs; it increases healthcare costs. Even worse, there have been no committee hearings, no public input on this or any of the other versions of ACA repeal the Republican roulette ball has landed on.  To give you a sample of the public feeling on this issue--I am seeing it across New Mexico--my office has received 14,500 calls, emails, and letters rejecting the Republican plans. It is an unprecedented number from the small State of New  I agree with Senator We must go back to regular order. We must stop this gamesmanship. We need to work together on a solution to improve the Affordable Care Act by bringing down costs, making it easier for small businesses to provide healthcare, and especially making prescription drugs more affordable--but not by denying New Mexico families and millions more access to quality healthcare.  The Republicans are playing with people's lives. Making sure severely disabled children have healthcare through Medicaid is not a game; neither is kicking elderly grandparents out of their Medicaid-funded nursing homes or enabling women to get breast and cervical cancer screenings from Planned  It is hard to keep up with the Republican versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.5, 5.0 of the Affordable Care Act repeal. Every bill is consistent in cutting care for millions of  The Republicans keep proposing so-called healthcare bills that are not actual healthcare bills. The real healthcare bill would protect gains made, cover more people, and make health insurance more affordable. The Republican bills do none of these things. Their bills reverse the gains, cover millions fewer people, and make health insurance less affordable, especially for those most vulnerable.  The American people want everyone to have affordable healthcare. That must be our goal. Republicans and Democrats should be working hard right now to get us to that national goal.  I have shared the stories of New Mexicans who have lives that have been changed, and even saved, because of the Affordable Care Act--New Mexicans like Mike, from Mike had an aggressive cancer but was diagnosed early, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and doctors saved his life. Alexis, from Albuquerque, had a stroke and brain surgeries when she was 28. She had affordable health insurance under the ACA, and those subsidies helped her keep health insurance and get healthcare coverage. Elena was able to afford a lifesaving mastectomy because of Medicaid expansion. These are real people who are now jeopardized by the Republican bills and Republican proposals.

3792,topic-id,229,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this bill, H.627, is an important bill that would help the Nation's schools make use of existing Federal programs to actually reduce their energy use. There currently are a number of such programs that help schools undertake projects that improve energy efficiency. Unfortunately, school districts don't always have the know-how to navigate the complexities[[Page H4826]]of the Federal system and take full advantage of these programs.  The bill creates a simple one-stop shop to get all the needed information and help school districts participate more fully in these programs. The bottom line is that the Nation's schools will, in fact, reduce their energy costs.  As it is, energy use in American K-12 schools totals $6 billion every year, and reducing this figure can certainly save taxpayer dollars or free up funds that schools can use on things other than energy bills.  This bill, H.627, has no cost since it merely sets up a system under which existing school energy efficiency programs can work better.  A similar bill was passed under suspension of the rules at the end of the last Congress, and I would hope that we can do it today, at the beginning of this Congress, so that the Senate can follow suit and get this to the President's desk.

Mr.Speaker, I am also pleased that we are considering this legislation, H.338, a bill to promote a 21st century energy and manufacturing workforce, introduced by my friend and great colleague, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Rush), and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Hudson).  This bipartisan bill takes steps to help make training for energy manufacturing jobs available to women and minorities as well as veterans.  By way of background, the bill was unanimously approved by the House last Congress by a voice vote. It was also included in the energy bill conference negotiations. But, unfortunately, even though the bill received overwhelming support in both the House and the Senate, it didn't make it to the President's desk before time ran out.  The U.has undergone an energy renaissance, driven by newly discovered resources, technological innovation, and a skilled workforce. Millions and millions of new jobs had been created, and many more are opening up, but we have got to continue to invest in our workers in order to maintain global leadership and maximize the economic potential of our energy abundance.  This bill, H.338, takes important steps in the right direction by requiring that the Department of Energy modernize and improve coordination among the numerous workforce development programs and activities that expand the Department's programs, offices, labs, and technology centers.  This bipartisan bill places an emphasis on maximizing the Department's existing resources and increasing the diversity of our energy and manufacturing workforce by increasing opportunities for women, minorities, and veterans.  It also improves reemployment opportunities for out-of-work and dislocated workers, which, for example, would provide welcome relief to workers discouraged by sharp downturns in the coal industry.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation before us today is a good government bill that is going to increase benefits for American workers. I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment to H.2288, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. This has truly proven to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform the disability claims process for the benefit of our Nation's veterans.  I want to specifically thank Chairman Roe for bringing this bill to the floor today and for ensuring that the entire process that got us here was open, fair, bipartisan, and followed regular order. It is gratefully appreciated, and I think we end up with a good piece of legislation because of his leadership.  I also want to recognize the efforts of our colleagues, the chairman of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, Mr.He has been an incredible addition to the VA committee and dug his heels in on this one and got us this far, so I thank him; and to his counterpart on our side of the aisle, Ranking Member Esty, for exceptional work that they have done together to get this bill to the floor.  I would also like to thank our veterans service organizations. This is how I think the American people think legislation should be brought; on issues at hand, experts are brought in, Representatives talk. The expertise that was brought by the VSOs helped us work out some of the kinks. It is not perfect, but the coalition got us to a point where I think many of us are comfortable moving forward.  The bill is complicated. To those who still have concerns in the process, let us know. There is still work to be done. It is still working in the Senate, but there is an openness that has been expressed through the entire process.  Secretary Shulkin and the VA leadership have been vital in this effort. They helped pull the stakeholders together, providing the technical expertise to help us understand what it takes over the past several years.  I want to recognize our former colleague on the committee, Dina She is going to be speaking a little bit later, but I think what is so important on veterans issues, members come and go from the committee, but their commitment to getting this right stays. And her tenaciousness in the 114th Congress laid the groundwork for this.  So in short, Mr.Speaker, as you heard the chairman say, there are 470,000 veterans. Each one of them is an individual. Each one of them is someone's friend, father, mother, sister, brother. It is time we peel back the layers of the complicated rules governing the process, modernize it with new technology, and get the benefits delivered in a timely manner to those who have earned them.

3569,topic-id,759,"Mr.President, this bill is the product of the most secretive and partisan process I have seen in my 10 years in the Who did the magicians who came up with this listen to? They obviously didn't listen to the doctors. The American Medical Association is opposed to this. The American Pediatric Society is opposed to this. The American Academy of Family Physicians is opposed to this. Certainly the doctors didn't get a chance to get heard in this process.  How about the hospitals? The American Hospital Association is opposed to this. Catholic hospitals are opposed to this. Rural hospitals are warning that this could end their very existence. Let's have a process that gives the hospitals a chance to be listened to.  The nurses in Rhode Island are opposed to this. I think nurses around the country are opposed to this. Why not have an open process that gives the nurses a chance to be heard?  Our community health centers are opposed to this. They have been to Washington to say: Please don't do this. You will be hurting real people whom we care for.  Illness advocacy groups--the people they are fighting for are stuck in this healthcare system with serious illnesses. Did we listen to the American Cancer Society? Did we listen to the American Lung Association? We didn't even listen to the hemophilia group, for Pete's sake. Addiction treatment groups are against this.  We have listened to nobody. We didn't even listen to the Republican Governors, let alone the Democratic Governors, like my Governor, who is telling me: We are working fine. We having people on Our exchanges are working.  Why fire this torpedo into perfectly working exchanges when we can be working on fixing the few where it is not working?  Why are we here? Who is behind this? Who was telling the little group of magicians in their secretive back room what to do? This is what happens when a party becomes beholden to a small handful of creepy billionaires and stops listening to the people. They are conducting a freakish social experiment on other people's health coverage, because you can bet those billionaires have all the coverage they need, but they have this ideology about taking coverage away from people by the millions. And our Republican friends are standing up in lockstep to march the billionaire march on a bill that everybody hates and that will cause damage in everybody's home And it doesn't matter because the billionaires have the dark money, the dark money floods our politics, and everybody marches to the tune of the anonymous billionaires.  We could be doing great things. We could be solving the known problem of end-of-life care and making sure people get their wishes honored at that precious time. We could be dealing with opioid and behavioral health issues that are bedeviling communities across this country. We could be helping doctors with payment reform that lets them treat people in a way that keeps them healthier, rather than having to wait to be paid until they do stuff to people--running up the cost of healthcare.  We could be dealing with hospital-acquired infections. How many people know someone who had a hospital-acquired infection, which brings enormous costs into the system as you have to treat it? Do we address that? No, because we didn't bother to listen to the hospitals.  We could do something about pharmaceutical prices. People in America are irate about jacked-up pharmaceutical prices, driven up by people who aren't even in the drug manufacturing industry but are just speculating on their ability to use monopoly pricing to drive up prices. But they put money into the system, so they get what they want.  This bill is a nightmare in and of its own, and it is a colossal missed opportunity to do something good for the American people that will actually help them. So let's support Senator Murray's motion to recommit and just try the regular order that the majority leader has proclaimed he was a champion of for year after year, until the creepy billionaires said to him: We are giving you the money; this is the bill we want. We don't care about those people or those hospitals. Shove it through because it suits our ideology.  This is no way to govern.

I appreciate their leadership on this issue.[[Page S4393]]  Let me, at this point, also give a salute to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, to the right of freedom of speech, which we have seen exercised in this building and in this Nation during the course of this debate, and the freedom granted to petition the government for address of grievances. We have seen examples of that. They have been on full display in this healthcare debate, a phase of which will come to a close I hope this evening.  Let me give a shout out to our staff members. They have fielded thousands, if not tens of thousands, of phone calls, letters, emails, and visits from Americans exercising their rights under the First Americans have come to their Capital City, almost all of them in an appropriate and nondisruptive way--sometimes intense, for sure--expressing their opinions but also in display of their First Amendment rights.

But here is one thing I know for a fact. For four straight elections--2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016--Republicans ran on a promise to repeal and replace We ran on that platform, and for four straight elections Republicans prevailed at the ballot box on the strength of that platform. I know that for a fact, and this I believe. Millions of Americans are at work today or at home or getting home from their offices, from their shops, from their factories. They are turning on the media. They are checking online. They are turning on the radio. They are wondering if a campaign promise is going to be kept by this party to which they have given the reins of government in four straight elections.  We are close to keeping that promise. We are closer than we have ever been, and we can take a big step tonight on making good on that promise. That is not just a matter of keeping a promise, but I will say to my colleagues that it is important this platform be honored.

3534,topic-id,858,"So we are keeping a promise, but there is a lot more to it, as my friend from Oklahoma outlined, not only in fact but also in stories from honest-to-goodness  This debate is about keeping Americans from hurting, about relieving the pain that this 2009 ACA has caused people to have. They were told they could keep their doctors. They wanted to keep their doctors, and it turns out they lost their doctors. They were told they could keep their healthcare plans. They liked their healthcare plans, and, in fact, they were not able to keep their healthcare plans. They were told their premiums would go down, and we have seen chapter and verse--as the gentleman from Oklahoma so forcefully outlined--of the dramatic, drastic, unspeakable increase in premiums that Americans have undergone. They were told they would have choice when it came to health insurance, and they have not had that choice. They have lost their freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, and that has been sacrificed in favor of a big government approach. So people are hurting, as has been explained on the floor tonight.  Families in my State who do not have employer-based health insurance are paying nearly $3,000 more per year in premiums than they did 4 years ago. In my State, it is a 116-percent increase in premiums under the Affordable Care Act over this short period of time. I guess we should be thankful we are not the 201-percent increase in premiums that our neighbors from Oklahoma have, or the 223-percent increase in healthcare premiums that our neighbors across the line in the State of Alabama have. But still, it is pretty bad wherever you go, and they were told and this program was sold on a promise of reducing healthcare premiums.  As has also been pointed out, 6 million independent-minded Americans have just said: I will not purchase this required insurance. I will pay the penalty, instead. The Supreme Court says it is a tax. We know it is a penalty. It comes right out of their pockets. They are doing that many times because they are independent-minded but many times because it is the only thing they can afford.  So Americans are hurting. Americans from Missouri, Oklahoma, and Mississippi are hurting, and they are hurting all across My Republican colleagues know this. My Democratic colleagues know this.  They say: Well, the ACA needs adjustment. It needs some help.  But what is their solution? I think we are beginning to know, based on statements made and based on information coming forward, that our Democratic friends really want a single-payer system. That is their solution to the failed ObamaCare system we have now--a British-style, European-style, government-run insurance-for-all program. I don't think we need that in I don't think that is what Americans thought they were getting.  My wife and I have never moved our family to Washington, We have kept our home on the same street in Tupelo, MS, the whole time. We raised our kids in When the last bell rings this weekend, I will be on a plane back home to my State, moving around the State, talking to Mississippians, speaking to people who gave me this great opportunity to serve in this great body and this great system of government.  I want to be able to tell them when I go home after this vote that I have taken a big step in keeping the Federal Government out of the business of deciding healthcare for their families. I want to be able to tell them that they are now going to have more options to choose the plan that works for them. I want to tell people back home who put me in office that we put more power in the hands of the States, not unelected Washington, DC, bureaucrats. I want to be able to tell them we passed a bill that, as my friend from Oklahoma says, answers their concerns about preexisting conditions and takes care of those people with low incomes who need assistance in buying insurance. I want to assure the people back in my home State and all across America, as my friend from Oklahoma just did so eloquently, that the Medicaid Program will continue. As a matter of fact, it will continue to grow, but at a rate that is more sustainable, so we can afford it today and so we can afford the Medicaid Program in future generations.  This has taken long hours of give and take. It may take more long hours in debates tonight and in a conference with the House, but we can get there. I see the solution formulating, and I am as optimistic as I have ever been that we will be able to keep this four-election promise we made.  These reforms are now within reach. We should take advantage tonight of this opportunity to deliver on what was promised to the American people, to relieve Americans who are hurting from the current ObamaCare system, and to give them a better opportunity for affordable and accessible healthcare.

3478,topic-id,2903,"Mr.President, there has been a lot of talk here on the Senate floor about this so-called skinny health package, and if you believe the reports, the skinny health package was going to be written today at the Senate Republican lunch. On the day that the Senate is supposed to vote, the future of American healthcare may have gotten an overhaul between the salad course and the entree.  I would like to talk a little about where things are and really contrast these reports about the skinny health package with the process that brought together the Affordable Care  Our colleague, the Presiding Officer, now serves on the Finance There were dozens of hearings in the Finance Committee about the Affordable Care Act, and there were dozens of hearings in the HELP Both committees had markups that lasted longer than a week and incorporated ideas from both sides. I was a pretty junior member of the Finance Committee at that time, and I remember a flock of Republican amendments being added, in the Finance Committee, to the Affordable Care When the bill came to the floor, the Senate debated it for 25 legislative days. It was the second-longest consecutive debate in history.  We are not seeing anything that resembles that today. You have a rush job. So I am going to try to spend a few minutes talking about what comes out when you have a rush job and about some of the red flags that I think my colleagues might want to think about, particularly some on the other side of the aisle who are thinking about voting for this skinny package.[[Page S4373]]  Any Senator who believes that Medicaid makes it out of the skinny package without taking a hit ought to take a look again. Senator Murray and I spent a long time in working with the Congressional Budget Office to, in effect, get them to do some analysis of some of the ideas that are part of a CBO package. What the Congressional Budget Office said--and it is the impartial, nonpartisan umpire--is that under this skinny package that is not supposed to do any harm to Medicaid--and it is on the first page of the CBO report--Medicaid gets hit with a $220 billion reduction for over a decade under this so-called skinny proposal.  So if you are one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who say they really feel strongly about Medicaid and about seniors--Medicaid, we all know, picks up the cost of two out of three nursing home beds, and it covers a wide variety of community-based services.  I have loved to watch the development of those community-based services. We started them in Oregon back in the days when I was the director of the Gray  In this so-called skinny budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Medicaid would get hit with a $220 billion reduction. I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are saying ``Hey, the skinny package isn't going to have any implications for Medicaid'' would want to take a look at it because I think the Congressional Budget Office is saying there really are implications for vulnerable seniors, for kids with special needs, for the disabled, and for all of those Americans who are walking on an economic tightrope every single month in balancing their food costs against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their health bills.  The numbers on skinny repeal show that 16 million Americans will lose coverage and that premiums are going to jump by 20 percent immediately if it becomes law. Industry experts are saying there is not any way this can work. It just causes too much bedlam and uncertainty. It is like pouring still more gasoline onto the fires of uncertainty in the marketplace. Republican and Democratic Governors have come out against the skinny bill.  By the way, as the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee--I guess we have 100 percent of the Senators who are here who serve on the Finance I do not even see Republican Senators making much of an attempt to defend the skinny bill on its merits. In fact, in the halls, many of them seem to be telling folks, including some folks, I believe, in the press, that they are kind of worried about its becoming law.  There are a few directions for this process to take. It is possible that, if you pass it, the House could just take up the skinny repeal and then they could pass it. My guess is that when people around here think about what that means and what those CBO numbers mean, the premium hikes and the implications for Medicaid, they will look at those CBO numbers and probably get a little heartburn--my Republican colleagues in this Chamber who are thinking about being for this.  The other possibility is that passing the skinny repeal bill leads to a conference. I am telling you that if it heads to conference, a skinny repeal is sort of a gateway drug to The fact that a conference is going to fix every problem and solve every disagreement is just fantasy. If this gets to conference and if suddenly there is a new Republican replacement plan that everybody likes--that is about as likely to happen as my joining the NBA for the upcoming season.  Let's take an honest look at how the debate has unfolded.  Republicans have had 7 years to come up with a replacement to the Affordable Care Act that they can all agree to. Obviously, that has not worked out. In the Senate, the process flatlined until the majority leader began the shell game that has culminated in today's vote. There were not 50 votes for TrumpCare here in the There were not 50 votes for repeal. That is why a skinny repeal is the only proposal left on the table. As I indicated, who knows what was done at the Republican lunch today at noon between the salad course and the entree?  Yet let's be clear about what is likely to happen when the House gets involved. The guarantees that Members of this body will get to protect their constituents are out the window--kids with disabilities and older people--say, a baby boomer. My colleague in the chair, who is a skilled physician, understands this. You have a baby boomer who has had a stroke, who is in his late fifties, early sixties, and he is in a nursing home. He is going to really face some challenges in terms of how to be able to afford that care with the kinds of cuts that, on page 1 of the report to Senator Murray and me, the CBO has said it believes will take place in  We know these rural hospitals are the economic engine of communities. I have made eight stops on a rural healthcare listening tour in my home State, and what we see is, without rural healthcare, you aren't going to have rural life. It is going to be particularly important because other efforts could conceivably result in seniors between 55 and 64 paying five times as much as younger people and getting fewer tax credits. Nobody can honestly say that the millions of Americans with preexisting conditions will be shielded from discrimination, and what a step backward that would be.  Before the Presiding Officer was here in this body, 14 Senators--7 Democrats and 7 Republicans--joined me in the 2008, 2009 period. Many of them are still here on both sides of the aisle. Republicans were a part of the effort and Democrats were a part of the effort. We wrote a bipartisan bill that had air-tight, loophole-free protection for those who have preexisting conditions. We got it in the Affordable Care All of the Senators who joined on that bill ought to feel pretty good about taking a big step to move America away from healthcare that is just for the healthy and wealthy. Now we are talking about the prospect of policies that will walk that back.  It is my view that the clear choice for my colleagues who don't like the risks in skinny repeal and don't like TrumpCare is to reject the process. It seems to me the surest way to prevent a bill you don't like from becoming law is to vote against it. Quaint idea: Just vote against it.  I want to turn, as well, to another bit of breaking news, which comes from our Parliamentarians who do so much good work, and they have an extraordinarily stressful job. Another key part of the Republican plan has been deemed ineligible in the last few hours to move forward via the partisan approach--reconciliation. The decision pertains to a proposal that lets States undo the consumer protections built into insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care That proposal will not get fast-track privileges or a 50-vote threshold under reconciliation here on the Senate floor.  Here is what that section of the bill was all about. I wrote a provision--and, again, our group of 14 bipartisan Senators, seven Democrats and seven Republicans, can take credit for this as well--about an issue that the Presiding Officer and I have talked about a number of times: letting the States be the laboratories of democracy, taking the lead on creative health solutions.  So out of our bipartisan bill--14 Senators--we said that we are going to give the States the chance to do better. The States would have the chance to do better. When we did it, we got some flak from all over the political spectrum. But we pushed very hard, and we got it in to the final legislation. It was about providing flexibility to States because so many on both sides of the aisle--my guess is our friend from Pennsylvania, and anyone who is on the Finance Committee, has heard again and again that State officials, business leaders, and others have said: If you just give us the freedom, we can do better. They don't say: Give us the freedom to let us do worse. They say: Give us the freedom to let us do better.  That is what section 1332 was all about. It said that States could chart their own course on healthcare as long as they were going to do better--better for coverage, better for affordability. They made it clear that if you feel you can do better--if the Louisiana Legislature says: We have ideas for what works for Louisiana, which may not necessarily work for Oregon; give us the freedom to go do our thing--that is in the Affordable Care Act, the freedom to do better.[[Page S4374]]  I would be the last person to tell my friend from Louisiana, a skilled physician who has a great interest in health policy--I would be the last person to say: Hey, I am going to dictate to Louisiana what an approach involving a waiver should be all about. It is quite the opposite. I am prepared to say to Louisiana, to Pennsylvania, to all of our colleagues, if you have ideas that are going to do better by people--better coverage, more affordable--God bless you and your constituents. That is what 1332 is all about.  We said that all we are going to say is we have to have some basic consumer protection here. You can't just get a waiver and go off and do nothing or just spend the money on some pork kind of project; you have to do better by people--better coverage, more affordable coverage, having basic consumer protections. The Senate TrumpCare bill tried to basically throw those consumer protections out the window. States would be able to get waivers to opt out of basic consumer protections--basic, plain, vanilla consumer protection for coverage and affordability. My view was that kind of stuff is a backdoor way to set up junk insurance--junk insurance that wouldn't cover much more than gauze bandages and aromatherapy.  Some people may wonder why this is important today, since the Senate resoundingly voted down the Better Care Reconciliation Act earlier this week.  The answer is that my colleagues on the other side still seem to be trying to shoehorn this scheme for worse coverage--not better coverage--under a waiver into the skinny repeal proposal the Senate is going to vote on in a matter of hours. But the decision has come down. The decision has come down from the Parliamentarian that regulatory changes that gut consumer protection, that was right at the heart of that waiver in the Affordable Care Act, isn't going to fly. And, frankly, I think it calls into question what the Parliamentarian said--it calls into question whether any of these big anti-consumer schemes are going to get 50 votes.  So this is yet more uncertainty ahead if Senate Republicans pass this skinny repeal bill and the debate drags on.  Now, at the risk of boring our wonderful pages and the staff who have heard me on the floor saying this before, there is a bipartisan approach. I think I have shown my bona fides over the years with respect to bipartisanship. I mentioned our universal coverage bill--the first time Republicans, Democrats came together and said that this is something where there is common ground because it is common sense. I have worked with colleagues who are perhaps some of the most conservative Members of the Congress on initiatives to move healthcare forward. That is what I have wanted to dedicate my entire professional service to--bipartisanship in health. Ever since those days with the Oregon Gray Panthers, that is what I always thought was the most important thing because if Senator Toomey, the Presiding Officer, all of our colleagues--all the people here--if you don't have your health, then pretty much everything else is uphill. So healthcare has always been the most important issue--an important issue we have to deal with in a bipartisan way.  I have said--which is why I wanted to alert the pages and the professional staff about the prospect of true boredom and just nodding off through the afternoon--that there is an alternative. If Republicans drop the reconciliation, the our-way-or-the-highway approach, colleagues on this side have said that they want to work on a bipartisan basis. It doesn't take rocket science to figure out what that needs to be.  The first thing that Democrats and Republicans would do is stabilize the private insurance market--the first thing. Everyone over here has said that the Affordable Care Act is far from perfect. We have colleagues here, including Senator Kaine with his reinsurance proposal, Senator Shaheen with her cost-sharing effort, Senator McCaskill to try to help areas where there is little or no coverage, and I am certain there are Republicans who have ideas that would be part of a good bipartisan package if we drop this our-way-or-the-highway partisan approach.  We ought to be working together to bring down prescription drugs prices. I have spoken on a number of occasions with the Presiding Officer about the fact that literally out of nowhere over the last few years we saw a whole industry develop around prescription drugs, where a bunch of middlemen are supposed to be getting the consumer a good deal on medicine, but nobody knows what they put in their pocket and what they put in the consumers' pocket. They are called pharmaceutical benefit managers. So I said: How about a little sunlight on that? How about a little sunshine, the best disinfectant?  I sure think people ought to be able to work together on those kinds of things. That, colleagues, is not what is on offer right now.  I urge my colleagues to say: We are getting out of this shell game. Nobody has to accept the skinny repeal option or the dictates of the other body. If you are unhappy with the option on the table--and I hope more people will be unhappy now that I have outlined what some of the key considerations are in this Budget Office report Senator Murray and I worked hard to get--I hope some people are going to think again, especially on the other side of the aisle, about voting it down. Twenty percent premium hikes--those go into effect on January 1 of 2018. And I expect we will have more information on it, but I think there are going to be 20-percent hikes after that. That is real. That is not what some interest group made up or some liberal partisan or anybody else who has an ax to grind. That is what our impartial umpire found.  So if you are unhappy with a proposal with those kinds of options, you ought to vote it down.  I want to close by way of echoing a point that so many colleagues on this side have said. This is not about saying: Look, we are just against what you want to do. Quite the opposite. For all my time in public service, I have said what I want to do is try to find common ground with people with common sense.  Let us defeat this skinny, sham, shell game kind of process that looks like what we are going to be voting on tonight and then get serious about doing what legislators do, which is not take each other's crummy ideas, but take good ideas and work on them in a bipartisan way.

3541,topic-id,160,"Mr.President, just very quickly, the Senator pointed out this analysis we have gotten where the premiums go into the stratosphere. Senator Murray and I worked a long time on it.  Wages for working people are going up about as fast as a snail trying to climb uphill. I am curious what you think that means for working-class families in Virginia, because I know in my home State--and Senator Merkley and I have talked about this--we have working families right now who every single month are walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against the fuel bill, the fuel bill against the rent bill.  Because my colleague was correct with respect to the fact that this would start, by the way, in January--this is not some kind of far-removed thing--people are going to feel the hit of these skyrocketing premiums right away. What does my colleague think that is going to mean for working-class families in his home State?  ",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4389.txt,1247,AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT OF 2017--Continued,2017.0,27.0,August
3623,topic-id,525,"Thank you, Mr. I thank my leader, Senator  Colleagues, before morning, millions of Americans could be on their way to lives filled with healthcare misery, eye-popping cost increases, hollowed-out coverage, and gutted consumer protections.  Colleagues, there are already stories of Americans hoarding pills and clamoring for screenings because they fear what the future is going to bring. These are the Americans who took deep breaths of relief 7 years ago when the Affordable Care Act became law. Women were no longer penalized for their gender. Cancer survivors no longer had to worry about busting a limit on coverage and facing personal bankruptcy. Entrepreneurs with a big idea had the freedom to set out on their own, no longer tied to their employer insurance because they had a preexisting condition. Now all of them are looking at lives on hold.  The skinny repeal package makes a mockery out of the President's promise to lower premiums. He made that promise repeatedly to the American people: no reductions in coverage, no increases in premiums. This bill makes a mockery out of that Presidential[[Page S4414]]pledge. Don't take my word for it. The Congressional Budget Office--the independent umpires--have told us the premiums are going to jump 20 percent next year as a result of this bill. That goes into effect, colleagues, January 1 of this year. Some happy New Year: Your premiums have jumped through the roof.  Colleagues, vote for this and try to explain it to the people you represent and have them tell you that there is not going to be anything they can sacrifice to pay for that rate hike. Their wages are flat, they are on an economic tightrope, and they are going to have to have premium hikes with a 20-percent hit.  The Finance Committee is accountable for funds that are critical for women's health. This measure begins the effort to take away the right of women to go to the provider they choose. That, too, will be hard to explain to millions of Americans who simply want what we have: the right to make your own healthcare choices.  Colleagues, the damage may get worse. Skinny repeal could be the gateway drug to We still don't know what is going to happen with Medicaid so seniors are worried, kids with special needs, disabled folks. If the Senate and the House head to a conference--that is a big ``if''--this body is going to face a radical set of demands from a very stubborn extreme on the other side of the  My time has expired. I appreciate Leader Schumer getting me this time. The promises Senators have gotten to protect their constituents, those promises could well be in the trash can within 48 hours.  I urge my colleagues to think about what it is going to be like to go home and explain to their constituents how this misery--how this healthcare misery came to be a part of their lives every single day. I don't think they are going to be able to make the case.  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray on this motion to recommit.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Democratic leader.
