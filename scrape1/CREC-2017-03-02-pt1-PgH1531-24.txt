           By Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee:
       H.R. 1339.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8--this bill regulates Commerce among 
     the several states.
       Amendment V--the bill assures that citizens' liberty and 
     property (their businesses and livelihood)are not deprived, 
     that the government does not take property (market share, 
     potential for profit and livelihood) without just 
     compensation.
       Amendment X--Nothing in the Constitution authorizes the 
     Federal government to do anything other than those things 
     enumerated (coin money, enter into treaties, conduct a Census 
     - - - which are inherently governmental). Thus, under 
     Amendment X, the right to carry out commercial activities is 
     reserved to the people.
