                    WELCOMING BISHOP JOSHUA K. LYNN

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
Brooks) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, it is a great privilege to 
welcome Bishop Joshua K. Lynn to the House of Representatives. I thank 
him for serving as today's guest chaplain.
  Joshua is the senior pastor serving Mastin Lake Church of God of 
Prophecy in Huntsville, Alabama. He also serves as the area presbyter, 
regional overseer, of north Alabama.
  Bishop Lynn earned his bachelor's degree and his master of arts in 
biblical studies from Clarks Summit University. He serves Huntsville 
not only as a pastor, but as a volunteer with the Covenant Christian 
Academy Athletic Committee.
  Bishop Lynn and his wife, Chrissy, also direct a summer youth program 
at Camp Boothe in West Blocton, Alabama.
  Bishop Lynn and Chrissy have been married for almost 18 years, and 
they have four children: Camille, Ava, Heidi, and Elias. I understand 
they are here with Joshua today. We welcome them to Washington.
  I appreciate the work Bishop Lynn has done and the positive impact he 
has had on north Alabama by providing care and support not only for the 
spiritual needs, but also the social and physical needs of our 
community.
