10184,topic-id,304,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to recognize a cutting-edge aerospace and defense company located in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, SMC Manufacturing Services.[[Page H1251]]  For more than 30 years, the Coats family has been the epitome of Kentucky ingenuity and progress. In 1978, they began Southland Manufacturing Company, which has evolved into SMC Manufacturing Services, and now employ more than 140 people at its Nicholasville, Kentucky, headquarters.  Recently, I had the chance to visit SMC and tour their 45,000-square-foot facility, which helps to build components for the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station, or This product is a stabilized mount that contains a sensor suite and fire control software, allowing on-the-move target acquisition and first-burst target engagement.  This facility has increased by 20,000 square feet in 2016 and has the ability to house more than 300 employees, drawing its employees from counties in the Sixth District and surrounding counties.  However, SMC not only supplies companies in Kentucky, but across the United States and abroad. One example of where SMC supports the defense of this Nation is their partnership with Kongsberg Protech Systems, KPS, of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, which is located in the district of my friend and colleague Congressman Keith  Today, with more than 15,000 CROWS in service, this weapon system can be found on more than 25 different platforms in the United States arsenal, including the Stryker, MRAP, Abrams, and Amphibious Combat It is a tested, proven system that is relied on by the Army, the Navy, and the  I applaud SMC for being a veteran-friendly workplace and a manufacturing company that is proud to employ about an equal number of men and women.

10243,topic-id,935,"Mr.President, I am proud and honored to follow my very distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Murray of Washington in this cause which invokes a line that I think the President used last night in his address to us, pledging cooperation for causes where we can make a common cause.  Surely no cause is more important than healthcare, no goal is more important than preventive services for[[Page S1528]]women so we can all avoid the costs not only in dollars and cents but the cost of human suffering and foreclosed futures that will come when women are denied these kinds of basic services.  I met this morning with a group from Planned Parenthood, patients and providers working in clinics across New They told me their story--some of them patients, some of them service providers and volunteers--about the kind of transformative effect that primary care, examinations and screenings, can have for women who would otherwise lack those services. The community health centers cannot substitute for them.  Family planning programs under title X are often the only Federal programs dedicated to providing comprehensive services in family planning but also in related preventive health services.  Over the past year alone, title X providers have provided cancer and HIV screenings, contraceptive services, and other primary and preventive services to over 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers in New England and across the country. This network of healthcare providers is a safety net. They compose a network, the title X network, including providers of State and local health departments, federally qualified health centers, and family planning councils. They create a network that provides a critical source of healthcare to people who otherwise would be denied it. They are trusted providers who are willing to serve the uninsured, the uninsured and low-income individuals who risk losing all access to healthcare if it was not for this network.  These clinics are often the only healthcare providers in rural areas and other parts of the country. So the political attacks on providers that provide abortion services would mean a loss of access to all family planning and preventive healthcare in these parts of the country--rural, metropolitan, suburban. Not only are these services necessary, but family planning services are really good investments, especially when it comes to the money that otherwise would be spent when illnesses or diseases become more serious.  In 2010, the $1.14 billion that was spent in this country on family planning resulted in more than $8 billion in gross savings. That is a clearly worthwhile investment.  The resolution that passed the House last month that Senator McConnell is considering bringing to the Senate floor would eliminate protections that prevent discrimination against these very providers, discrimination based on facts or sometimes nonfacts that have nothing to do with the quality of care or the worthiness of the investment in these clinics and healthcare providers.  The regulation that Republicans are seeking to eliminate ensures that no qualified providers will be excluded from eligibility for Federal funding for discriminatory reasons outside of that provider's ability to provide care. That is really the criterion that matters. The ones who want to eliminate this regulation apparently would rather risk limiting access to healthcare in order to score political points. Unfortunately, it is really that simple.  At a time when Republicans continue to try to push ahead with repealing the Affordable Care Act, which also includes essential support for preventive healthcare, they also want to disrupt the country's healthcare system for this kind of women's healthcare.  Just last night, after President Trump claimed he wanted to work with Members of both parties to invest in women's health, we are threatened with this step to eliminate an important regulation that protects women's health. I ask the President and my colleagues across the aisle to join in this common cause, which should unite us on a bipartisan basis. If they want to continue these attacks, we are ready for the fight, but we would much rather cooperate and collaborate in the cause of women's healthcare.  I urge my Senate colleagues to listen to the kind of providers and patients whom I met with this morning, the kind of provider that Senator Shaheen brought with her last night as her guest, the kind of providers and patients and volunteers who work in these clinics all across the country, whether it is Planned Parenthood or other kinds of clinics. I ask them to listen to the advocates here, supporters, like the National Coalition of STD Directors, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the American Psychological Association, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the ACLU, and the American Medical Student They are just a few of the stakeholders who advocate strongly that this regulation be continued and who oppose the step the House passed and that the majority leader may bring to the floor.  These people have dedicated their lives and their careers to assisting the vulnerable, whether they are providing healthcare or legal services or other kinds of support, and they are saying to us: Do not eliminate this regulation. I think we ought to listen to them. I hope my colleagues will.  I am determined that we will fight tooth and nail if we need to do so, but I would much rather that we follow the President's offer and that we collaborate to stop the elimination of this regulation, which is so important to making sure that women's healthcare is based on quality, not on discriminatory reasons based on political motive.

10296,topic-id,1393,"Mr.President, I am here today to discuss the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.Supreme So far this year, we have heard that it is too early to do everything, that the process of putting the President's Cabinet in place, which took longer than any administration since George Washington and is still not completed, was somehow too early. We heard that every single nominee was being handled too quickly, even though every previous President since the first President has managed to have a Cabinet confirmed by the Senate quicker than this one.  Clearly the process going on right now--hours of questioning beginning today for Judge Gorsuch, who has a 10-year record as an appeals judge on the Tenth Circuit, where all of the other judges in the district courts under the Tenth Circuit's jurisdiction see their cases go to be appealed.  The Supreme Court is ``distinctly American in concept and function,'' according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and there is, frankly, nothing quite like it in any other constitutional government. It is a Court that was supposed to be part of this very unique at the time idea of a government that was so finely balanced that it would run itself, a machine that was so finely balanced that it didn't take a King, it didn't take the intervention of somebody to decide who would be the one person who would run the country.  The Supreme Court--the only Court mentioned in the Constitution--is a uniquely American court. In the history of the country, only 112 people have had the honor to serve on the Supreme On the last day of January, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to be one of those unique individuals who get to serve on this Court, to be an Associate Justice on the U.Supreme  Since his nomination, he has visited individually with a significant majority of Members of the I think he has had 70 visits with Members of the Senate in their offices. Many of my colleagues on the other side--several of whom I will mention in a minute--voted for Judge Gorsuch to have the job he currently has. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle left their meetings with Judge Gorsuch impressed by his character, by his intellect. Here is what just a couple of our colleagues on the other side said:  ``He did a very good job in the meeting with me. He presents himself very well.''  Another one of our colleagues said: ``He's a very caring person, and he's obviously legally very smart. . . . I think we are dealing with someone who is impressive.''  Another one of our colleagues said they ``had a thorough conversation about the importance of the rule of law and of a judiciary that is independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.''  As more Senators had a chance to meet Judge Gorsuch, they came to see him as an independent-minded judge who has a deep appreciation for the law and a real understanding of what a judge should do.  It was mentioned earlier that the judge should be required to talk about how he would rule on individual cases. Of course not. In fact, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is on the Court now, was very strident before the committee in pointing out that it would be wrong for a judge to explain how they would judge an individual case. She said that if a judge did that, a judge would actually have to recuse themselves, in her opinion, from the case, and others on the Court today have all said similar things when asked the kinds of questions that the minority leader just said that Judge Gorsuch would have to answer if he was going to be confirmed to the If that was the test, there would be nobody on the Court today, and if that was the test, none of the 112 people who have served on the Court[[Page S1861]]would have, in all likelihood, passed that test.  When I had a chance to visit with Judge Gorsuch, it was clear that he understood the proper role of a judge. The role of a judge--the job is to adhere to the Constitution, to apply the rule of law, and not to legislate from the bench.  When he was nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch said:       It is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It      is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the      people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he      reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he      prefers, rather than those the law demands.  What does that mean? How would a person reach a conclusion they didn't like and that is what makes them a good judge? Well, a good judge reads the law, reads the Constitution, and applies the law. A good judge doesn't try to determine what the Constitution and the law should say but only has the job of determining what the Constitution and the law do say.  Justice Scalia--the vacancy Judge Gorsuch will fill--according to Justice Scalia, setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge''--not determining what you would like to happen but determining what the law and the Constitution say has to happen. I think Judge Gorsuch understands that.  He comes to the Court very well prepared. He is a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford His academic credentials are unrivalled in preparation for this job. He served his country admirably as a Supreme Court Justice clerk for Justice Byron White, who was appointed to the Court by President Kennedy and confirmed by the Senate, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed to the Court by President Judge Gorsuch served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, and then in 2006, President George Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of The Senate confirmed his nomination unanimously by a voice vote. There are 12 Democrats currently serving in the Senate who were then in office and supported Judge Gorsuch's nomination 10 years ago to the job he has today.  In the decade Judge Gorsuch has served as a circuit court judge, reviewing the work of other Federal judges on appeal, he has demonstrated the integrity, professional qualifications, and judicial temperament to serve on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch said recently that judges are not politicians in robes. It is not the job of a judge to determine what the law is or should be; it is the job of a judge to determine what the law is. The job of a judge is to determine what the Framers intended the Constitution to say.  Judge Gorsuch received high praise from legal experts across party lines. He has gotten the highest level of recommendation from the American Bar Association, unanimously rating him as ``well qualified,'' its highest rating. He is respected by people who know him in his community. He has really dedicated himself to a lifetime of service that prepares him for this job.  The Supreme Court is one of the foundational institutions of our country. It is designed to protect our democracy and is designed to really understand and apply the Constitution and the law so that the rule of law is uniquely dependable in the United States of  If you are a citizen and you read the law and you understand what the law says, that should get you a long way toward success before the courts and ensures that in this country, the rule of law matters. The ultimate determiner of what the law says is the Supreme  I think Judge Gorsuch will serve well and I hope long on the I believe that in the next couple of weeks, he will join the Justices, one of whom he clerked for. If that happens, he will be the first person in the history of the country to be sitting as an Associate Justice with another Associate Justice who decades earlier he was the law clerk for when he and Associate Justice Kennedy had an opportunity to serve together.  With that, I notice my colleague from Iowa is here, and I yield the floor.

The institution was named for Bishop Caleb Clinton, then the presiding bishop of the Palmetto Annual Conference of the A.M.Zion Originally named Clinton Institute, in 1909, it was renamed Clinton Normal and Industrial Institute, and was authorized to grant State teaching certificates.  In the late 1940s, the school was again reorganized as Clinton Junior College, offering various associate degrees in religion and other liberal arts. Still affiliated with the A.M.Zion Church, the college has grown and expanded under its current president, Elaine Copeland, who has led the institution since 2002.  In 2013, the college, for the first time, was accredited to offer two bachelor's degree programs, a bachelor of arts in religious studies, and a bachelor of science in business administration. Subsequently, it has changed its name to Clinton College, and enrollment is at a 15-year high.  For the past 120 years, Clinton College has been providing academic excellence, as well as instilling moral and spiritual growth into their students. The college takes pride in being, and I quote its motto, ``A Beacon of Light for Today's Scholars and Tomorrow's Leaders.''

My father studied theology at Morris in the early 1940s for 3 years, but was not allowed to finish his studies because he had not graduated high school. Having been born in 1897, in segregated South Carolina, he was not[[Page H1250]]allowed to advance beyond the seventh grade. But because he continued to self-teach and study, he was able to pass the college entrance exam. Though he was not allowed to graduate in 1945, as he should have, he was posthumously awarded his bachelor of theology degree 58 years later, in 2003.

I commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this bill and for shining a spotlight on the atrocious crimes perpetrated against young American athletes.  Sexual abuse is a heinous crime that must be eradicated in every corner of our society. I have long worked to prevent sexual assault and ensure that survivors have access to the resources and support they need. Last year, the Indianapolis Star reported on allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct made against coaches, gym owners, and other adults affiliated with USA Gymnastics over several decades. These very serious allegations included sexual abuse against young athletes. Predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight. The investigation also revealed that officials at USA Gymnastics, one of America's most prominent Olympic organizations, failed to alert police to many incidents of sexual abuse that occurred on their watch.  These crimes have hurt hundreds of victims across various sports. This Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act would require amateur athletic governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics and other U.Olympic organizations, to promptly report every allegation of sexual abuse to the proper authorities. This legislation would help survivors receive justice and protect more people from becoming victims.  In addition, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Assault Act would require these national governing bodies to develop robust policies and procedures for mandatory reporting to law enforcement and to develop training and oversight practices to prevent abuse. This bill would also bolster Masha's Law, the law that lets minors bring civil suits against sexual predators and extends the statute of limitations for such cases.  The young athletes who train to represent our country at the top levels of competition and those at all levels who aspire to compete should not have to fear victimization by trusted coaches and sports officials.

I believe what we stand for is the universal values on which we forged the Transatlantic Alliance more than 70 years ago, a Transatlantic Alliance that has been a force for stability and good in the world, a Transatlantic Alliance that has secured peace in Western Europe, North America ever since the close of the Second World War but a Transatlantic Alliance that is rooted in values, values of freedom of speech, freedom of press, rule of law and democracy, and in opposition to authoritarianism.  We support American leadership because a stable and prosperous world makes us safer and more economically secure. So I would ask my friend from Florida what he views as the agenda or the objective of Russia and whether we can be hopeful, in any way, that Vladimir Putin's Russia has an agenda that is harmonious with ours, that can be put in the same direction as ours or whether it is fundamentally at odds.

10254,topic-id,668,"We have worked together on a number of bills in this area. Let me respond to my friend the Senator by saying it is clear that Vladimir Putin's Russia has been a serial human rights violator. When we talk about human rights, we talk about things that belong to everyone, and they are necessary as a check on state power. When nations break these rules, we believe they should be held accountable.  Russia continues to engage in efforts, as my colleague said, that undermine democracy in free elections throughout We have shared concerns about the upcoming elections--the Dutch elections, French, and German elections--where there are overt actions and covert actions by Russia to influence the outcome of those elections, but part of why they are doing that, part of why they are violating these norms around Europe is because they are seeking to distract from their brutal rule at home.  The reality is, many of the critics of Putin's regime end up dead or incapacitated.  Boris Nemtsov, a Russian politician who supported the introduction of capitalism into the Russian economy and frequently criticized Vladimir Putin, was assassinated 2 years ago, on February 27, on a bridge just near the Kremlin in  Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian politician and journalist, was apparently poisoned last month, the second time in recent years. He had been actively promoting civil society and democracy in Russia.[[Page S1534]]  Back in September of 2012, Putin threw USAID out of Russia altogether, claiming that U.efforts were undermining Russian sovereignty when, in fact, we had been working in Russia since the nineties, supporting human rights, independent journalism, and promoting fair elections.  Most importantly, in my view, Russia doesn't just violate the human rights of its own citizens, it exports brutality.  Russia's support for Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime and brutal war in Syria continues. Their military has targeted hospitals, schools, and Syrian first responders. They have blocked the provision of food and medicine to starving families and children. Russia's diplomats have vetoed any efforts at the United Nations to act to stop the suffering in Also, Russia, having illegally invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea, continues to promote violence and instability in eastern Ukraine, in the Donbas region, leading to the deaths of thousands.  All of these human rights violations within Russia and in countries around its sphere of influence, in its region, suggest to us that they need to be held accountable for these violations of basic human rights.  Like the Senator from Florida, I led a codel to Eastern and Central Mine was not last week. It was last August, but with two Republican House Members and two Democratic Senate Members, the five of us went to the Czech Republic, to Ukraine, and to We heard widespread concern about this record of human rights and a disrespect for democracy in Russia and about this aggressive hybrid warfare campaign that threatens Ukraine's very stability and existence, that puts Estonia, our NATO ally, on warning, and that is putting at risk Czech independence and Czech elections all across Central and Western  We have heard from Ambassadors, experts, those who have testified in front of committees on which we serve, about a Russian campaign--a brutal campaign--to undermine human rights within Russia and to undermine democracy throughout Western Europe, with a larger strategic goal of separating the United States from our Western allies and undermining the Transatlantic Alliance that has been so essential to our peace, security, and stability for 70 years. We cannot let this stand.  There is no moral equivalence between Russia and the United If we believe in our democracy and if we believe in our commitment to human rights, we must stand up to this campaign of aggression. So I ask my colleague what he believes we might be able to do on the Foreign Relations Committee, on the Appropriations Committee, or here in the Senate, what we might do, as voices working in a bipartisan way, to stand up to these actions undermining democracy and human rights?

10256,topic-id,435,"Well, briefly, if I could. Two bills that are currently gathering cosponsors--and which I hope our colleagues will review and consider joining us in cosponsoring--one is 341, the Russia Sanctions Review Act of 2017, which currently has 18 cosponsors. The other is 94, the Counteracting Russian Hostilities Act of 2017, that has 20 cosponsors--10 Republicans and 10 In both cases, we are proud to have a very broad range of both Republicans and Democrats engaged in this important legislation, which ensures that Russia pays a price for breaking the rules. It starts by taking action to support the sanctions against the Russian Government for its occupation, its illegal annexation of Crimea, for its egregious human rights violations in Syria, and for meddling in the U.election. It prevents the lifting of sanctions on Russia until the Russian Government ceases the very activities that caused these sanctions to be put in place in the first place. It supports civil society, pro-democracy, anti-corruption activists in Russia and across Europe to show that many of us are determined, as members of the Foreign Relations Committee, as members of the Appropriations Committee, as Senators--not as partisans--that we intend to fund the tools that will enable the United States and our NATO allies to push back on Russia's aggression. Most of these tools come from the international affairs budget: State Department and foreign assistance accounts.  I want to commend you, Senator, for giving a strong and impassioned speech on the floor today about the importance of our keeping all of these tools in our toolkit so that as we confront our adversaries around the world, we have the resources and the ability to partner with and strengthen our allies as well.  We have no quarrel with the Russian people, but we are here because there is nothing Vladimir Putin's regime would love more than to see his actions divide us in this Chamber and divide us in this country from our vital allies in Europe and divide the whole North Atlantic community that for seven decades has brought peace and stability to[[Page S1535]]Europe, has brought prosperity to the United States, not as an act of charity but as an investment in the best interests of security.  We are here to say with one voice that we will stand up to Russian aggression that undermines democracy and violates human rights.  I am grateful for my colleague, for the chance to join him on the floor today, and I look forward to working together with any of our colleagues who see these issues as clearly as my friend and colleague, the Senator from  ",CREC-2017-03-01-pt1-PgS1523.txt,1984,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,1.0,March

(c) Hearings, Selection of Witnesses.--To ensure that the      issue which is the subject of the hearing is presented as      fully and fairly as possible, whenever a hearing is conducted      by the committee or a subcommittee upon any measure or      matter, the ranking member of the committee or subcommittee      may select and call an equal number of non-governmental      witnesses to testify at that hearing.

Staff of other Senators who are not members of the      committee may not attend closed sessions of the committee.       Attendance of committee staff at meetings and hearings      shall be limited to those designated by the staff director or      the minority staff director.

(c) Reporting.--A majority of the membership of the      committee, including at least one member from each party,      shall constitute a quorum for reporting any measure or      recommendation to the No measure or recommendation      shall be ordered reported from the committee unless a      majority of the committee members is physically present,      including at least one member from each party, and a majority      of those present concurs.                            rule 5--proxies       Proxies must be in writing with the signature of the absent      member. Subject to the requirements of Rule 4 for the      physical presence of a quorum to report a matter, proxy      voting shall be allowed on all measures and matters before      the committee. However, proxies shall not be voted on a      measure or matter except when the absent member has been      informed of the matter on which he is being recorded and has      affirmatively requested that he or she be so recorded.                           rule 6--witnesses       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations will      consider requests to testify on any matter or measure pending      before the committee.       (b) Presentation.--If the chairman so determines, the oral      presentation of witnesses shall be limited to 10 minutes.

(c) Filing of Statements.--A witness appearing before the      committee, or any subcommittee thereof, shall submit an      electronic copy of the written statement of his proposed      testimony at least 24 hours prior to his appearance, unless      this requirement is waived by the chairman and the ranking      member following their determination that there is good cause      for failure to file such a statement.       (d) Expenses.--Only the chairman may authorize expenditures      of funds for the expenses of witnesses appearing before the      committee or its subcommittees.       (e) Requests.--Any witness called for a hearing may submit      a written request to the chairman no later than 24 hours in      advance for his testimony to be in closed or open session, or      for any other unusual procedure. The chairman shall determine      whether to grant any such request and shall notify the      committee members of the request and of his decision.                           rule 7--subpoenas       (a) Authorization.--The chairman or any other member of the      committee, when authorized by a majority vote of the      committee at a meeting or by proxies, shall have authority to      subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the production of      memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials.

(b) Return.--A subpoena, or a request to an agency, for      documents may be issued whose return shall occur at a time      and place other than that of a scheduled committee meeting. A      return on such a subpoena or request which is incomplete or      accompanied by an objection constitutes good cause for a      hearing on shortened notice. Upon such a return, the chairman      or any other member designated by him may convene a hearing      by giving 4 hours notice by telephone or electronic mail to      all other members. One member shall constitute a quorum for      such a hearing. The sole purpose of such a hearing shall be      to elucidate further information about the return and to rule      on the objection.       (c) Depositions.--At the direction of the committee, staff      is authorized to take depositions from witnesses.                            rule 8--reports       (a) Filing.--When the committee has ordered a measure or      recommendation reported, the report thereon shall be filed in      the Senate at the earliest practicable time.       (b) Supplemental, Minority and Additional Views.--A member      of the committee who gives notice of his intentions to file      supplemental, minority, or additional views at the time of      final committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be      entitled to not less than 3 calendar days in which to file      such views, in writing (including by electronic mail), with      the chief clerk of the committee, with the 3 days to begin at      11:00 p.m. on the same day that the committee has ordered      a measure or matter reported. Such views shall then be      included in the committee report and printed in the same      volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be      noted on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely      notice, the committee report may be filed and printed      immediately without such views.       (c) Roll Call Votes.--The results of all roll call votes      taken in any meeting of the committee on any measure, or      amendment thereto, shall be announced in the committee      report. The announcement shall include a tabulation of the      votes cast in favor and votes cast in opposition to each such      measure and amendment by each member of the committee.                            rule 9--treaties       (a) General.--The committee is the only committee of the      Senate with jurisdiction to review and report to the Senate      on treaties submitted by the President for Senate advice and      consent to ratification. Because the House of Representatives      has no role in the approval of treaties, the committee is      therefore the only congressional committee with      responsibility for treaties.       (b) Committee Proceedings.--Once submitted by the President      for advice and consent, each treaty is referred to the      committee and remains on its calendar from Congress to      Congress until the committee takes action to report it to the      Senate or recommend its return to the President, or until the      committee is discharged of the treaty by the       (c) Floor Proceedings.--In accordance with Senate Rule      XXX.2, treaties which have been reported to the Senate but      not acted on before the end of a Congress ``shall be resumed      at the commencement of the next Congress as if no proceedings      had previously been had thereon.''       (d) Hearings.--Insofar as possible, the committee should      conduct a public hearing on each treaty as soon as possible      after its submission by the Except in      extraordinary circumstances, treaties reported to the Senate      shall be accompanied by a written report.                          rule 10--nominations       (a) Waiting Requirement.--Unless otherwise directed by the      chairman and the ranking member, the Committee on Foreign      Relations shall not consider any nomination until 5 business      days after it has been formally submitted to the       (b) Public Consideration.--Nominees for any post who are      invited to appear before the committee shall be heard in      public session, unless a majority of the committee decrees      otherwise, consistent with Rule 3(f).       (c) Required Data.--No nomination shall be reported to the      Senate unless (1) the nominee has been accorded a security      clearance[[Page S582]]     on the basis of a thorough investigation by executive branch      agencies; (2) the nominee has filed a financial disclosure      report and a related ethics undertaking with the committee;      (3) the committee has been assured that the nominee does not      have any interests which could conflict with the interests of      the government in the exercise of the nominee's proposed      responsibilities; (4) for persons nominated to be chief of      mission, ambassador-at-large, or minister, the committee has      received a complete list of any contributions made by the      nominee or members of his immediate family to any Federal      election campaign during the year of his or her nomination      and for the 4 preceding years; (5) for persons nominated to      be chiefs of mission, the report required by Section      304(a)(4) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 on the      demonstrated competence of that nominee to perform the duties      of the position to which he or she has been nominated; and      (6) the nominee has provided the committee with a signed and      notarized copy of the committee questionnaire for executive      branch nominees.                            rule 11--travel       (a) Foreign Travel.--No member of the Committee on Foreign      Relations or its staff shall travel abroad on committee      business unless specifically authorized by the chairman, who      is required by law to approve vouchers and report      expenditures of foreign currencies, and the ranking member.      Requests for authorization of such travel shall state the      purpose and, when completed, a full substantive and financial      report shall be filed with the committee within 30 days. This      report shall be furnished to all members of the committee and      shall not be otherwise disseminated without authorization of      the chairman and the ranking member. Except in extraordinary      circumstances, staff travel shall not be approved unless the      reporting requirements have been fulfilled for all prior      trips. Except for travel that is strictly personal, travel      funded by non-U.Government sources is subject to the same      approval and substantive reporting requirements as U.     Government-funded travel. In addition, members and staff are      reminded to consult the Senate Code of Conduct, and, as      appropriate, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, in the      case of travel sponsored by non-U.Government sources.       Any proposed travel by committee staff for a subcommittee      purpose must be approved by the subcommittee chairman and      ranking member prior to submission of the request to the      chairman and ranking member of the full committee.       (b) Domestic Travel.--All official travel in the United      States by the committee staff shall be approved in advance by      the staff director, or in the case of minority staff, by the      minority staff director.       (c) Personal Staff Travel.--As a general rule, no more than      one member of the personal staff of a member of the committee      may travel with that member with the approval of the chairman      and the ranking member of the committee. During such travel,      the personal staff member shall be considered to be an      employee of the committee.       (d) PRM Travel.--For the purposes of this rule regarding      staff foreign travel, the officially-designated personal      representative of the member pursuant to rule 14(b), shall be      deemed to have the same rights, duties, and responsibilities      as members of the staff of the Committee on Foreign           rule 12--transcripts and materials provided to the committee       (a) General.--The Committee on Foreign Relations shall keep      verbatim transcripts of all committee and subcommittee      meetings and hearings and such transcripts shall remain in      the custody of the committee, unless a majority of the      committee decides otherwise. Transcripts of public hearings      by the committee shall be published unless the chairman, with      the concurrence of the ranking member, determines otherwise.       The committee, through the chief clerk, shall also maintain      at least one copy of all materials provided to the committee      by the Executive Branch; such copy shall remain in the      custody of the committee and be subject to the committee's      rules and procedures, including those rules and procedures      applicable to the handling of classified materials.       Such transcripts and materials shall be made available to      all members of the committee, committee staff, and designated      personal representatives of members of the committee, except      as otherwise provided in these rules.       (b) Classified or Restricted Transcripts or Materials.--       (1) The chief clerk of the committee shall have      responsibility for the maintenance and security of classified      or restricted transcripts or materials, and shall ensure that      such transcripts or materials are handled in a manner      consistent with the requirements of the United States Senate      Security       (2) A record shall be maintained of each use of classified      or restricted transcripts or materials as required by the      Senate Security       (3) Classified transcripts or materials may not leave the      committee offices, or SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center,      except for the purpose of declassification or archiving,      consistent with these rules.       (4) Extreme care shall be exercised to avoid taking notes      or quotes from classified transcripts or materials. Their      contents may not be divulged to any unauthorized person.       (5) Subject to any additional restrictions imposed by the      chairman with the concurrence of the ranking member, only the      following persons are authorized to have access to classified      or restricted transcripts or materials:       (A) Members and staff of the committee in the committee      offices or in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;       (B) Designated personal representatives of members of the      committee, and of the majority and minority leaders, with      appropriate security clearances, in the committee offices or      in SVC-217 of the Capitol Visitors Center;       (C) Senators not members of the committee, by permission of      the chairman, in the committee offices or in SVC-217 of the      Capitol Visitors Center; and       (D) Officials of the executive departments involved in the      meeting, hearing, or matter, with authorization of      the chairman, in the committee offices or SVC-217 of the      Capitol Visitors       (6) Any restrictions imposed by the committee upon access      to a meeting or hearing of the committee shall also apply to      the transcript of such meeting, except by special permission      of the chairman and ranking member.       (7) In addition to restrictions resulting from the      inclusion of any classified information in the transcript of      a committee meeting or hearing, members and staff shall not      discuss with anyone the proceedings of the committee in      closed session or reveal information conveyed or discussed in      such a session unless that person would have been permitted      to attend the session itself or is a member or staff of a      relevant committee or executive branch agency and possess an      appropriate security clearance, or unless such communication      is specifically authorized by the chairman, the ranking      member, or in the case of staff, by the staff director or      minority staff director. A record shall be kept of all such      authorizations.       (c) Declassification.--       (1) All noncurrent records of the committee are governed by      Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate and by      474 (96th Congress). Any classified transcripts or materials      transferred to the National Archives and Records      Administration under Rule XI may not be made available for      public use unless they have been subject to declassification      review in accordance with applicable laws or Executive      orders.       (2) Any transcript or classified committee report, or any      portion thereof, may be declassified, in accordance with      applicable laws or Executive orders, sooner than the time      period provided for under 474 if:       (A) the chairman originates such action, with the      concurrence of the ranking member;       (B) the other current members of the committee who      participated in such meeting or report have been notified of      the proposed declassification, and have not objected thereto,      except that the committee by majority vote may overrule any      objections thereby raised to early declassification; and       (C) the executive departments that participated in the      meeting or originated the classified information have been      consulted regarding the declassification.                    rule 13--classified information       (a) General.--The handling of classified information in the      Senate is governed by 243 (100th Congress), which      established the Office of Senate All handling of      classified information by the committee shall be consistent      with the procedures set forth in the United States Senate      Security Manual issued by the Office of Senate       (b) Security Manager.--The chief clerk is the security      manager for the committee. The chief clerk shall be      responsible for implementing the provisions of the Senate      Security Manual and for serving as the committee liaison to      the Office of Senate The staff director, in      consultation with the minority staff director, may appoint an      alternate security manager as circumstances warrant.       (c) Transportation of Classified Material.--Classified      material may only be transported between Senate offices by      appropriately cleared staff members who have been      specifically authorized to do so by the security manager.       (d) Access to Classified Material.--In general, Senators      and staff undertake to confine their access to classified      information on the basis of a ``need to know'' such      information related to their committee responsibilities.       (e) Staff Clearances.--The chairman, or, in the case of      minority stag the ranking member, shall designate the members      of the committee staff whose assignments require access to      classified and compartmented information and shall seek to      obtain the requisite security clearances pursuant to Office      of Senate Security procedures.       (f) PRM Clearances.--For the purposes of this rule      regarding security clearances and access to compartmented      information, the officially-designated personal      representative of the member (PRM) pursuant to rule 14(b),      shall be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and      responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on      Foreign       (g) Regulations.--The staff director is authorized to make      such administrative regulations as may be necessary to carry      out the provisions of this rule.                             rule 14--staff       (a) Responsibilities.--       (1) The staff works for the committee as a whole, under the      general supervision of the chairman of the committee, and the      immediate direction of the staff director, except[[Page S583]]     that such part of the staff as is designated minority staff      shall be under the general supervision of the ranking member      and under the immediate direction of the minority staff      director.       (2) Any member of the committee should feel free to call      upon the staff at any time for assistance in connection with      committee business. Members of the Senate not members of the      committee who call upon the staff for assistance from time to      time should be given assistance subject to the overriding      responsibility of the staff to the committee.       (3) The staff's primary responsibility is with respect to      bills, resolutions, treaties, and nominations and other      matters within the jurisdiction of the committee. In addition      to carrying out assignments from the committee and its      individual members, the staff has a responsibility to      originate suggestions for committee or subcommittee      consideration. The staff also has a responsibility to make      suggestions to individual members regarding matters of      special interest to such members.       (4) It is part of the staff's duty to keep itself as well      informed as possible in regard to developments affecting      foreign relations and national security and in regard to the      administration of foreign programs of the United      Significant trends or developments which might otherwise      escape notice should be called to the attention of the      committee, or of individual Senators with particular      interests.       (5) The staff shall pay due regard to the constitutional      separation of powers between the Senate and the executive      branch. It therefore has a responsibility to help the      committee bring to bear an independent, objective judgment of      proposals by the executive branch and when appropriate to      originate sound proposals of its own. At the same time, the      staff shall avoid impinging upon the day-to-day conduct of      foreign affairs.       (6) In those instances when committee action requires the      expression of minority views, the staff shall assist the      minority as fully as the majority to the end that all points      of view may be fully considered by members of the committee      and of the The staff shall bear in mind that under      our constitutional system it is the responsibility of the      elected members of the Senate to determine legislative issues      in the light of as full and fair a presentation of the facts      as the staff may be able to obtain.       (b) Personal Representatives of the Member (PRM). --Each      Senator on the committee shall be authorized to designate one      personal staff member as the member's personal representative      of the member and designee to the committee (PRM) that shall      be deemed to have the same rights, duties, and      responsibilities as members of the staff of the Committee on      Foreign Relations where specifically provided for in these      rules.       (c) Restrictions.--       (1) The staff shall regard its relationship to the      committee as a privileged one, in the nature of the      relationship of a lawyer to a client. In order to protect      this relationship and the mutual confidence which must      prevail if the committee-staff relationship is to be a      satisfactory and fruitful one, the following criteria shall      apply, unless staff has consulted with and obtained, as      appropriate, the approval of the Senate Ethics Committee and      advance permission from the staff director (or the minority      staff director in the case of minority staff):       (A) members of the staff shall not be identified with any      special interest group in the field of foreign relations or      allow their names to be used by any such group; and       (B) members of the staff shall not accept public speaking      engagements or write for publication in the field of foreign      relations.       (2) The staff shall not discuss their private conversations      with members of the committee without specific advance      permission from the Senator or Senators concerned.       (3) The staff shall not discuss with anyone the proceedings      of the committee in closed session or reveal information      conveyed or discussed in such a session unless that person      would have been permitted to attend the session itself or is      a member or staff of a relevant committee or executive branch      agency and possesses an appropriate security clearance, or      unless such communication is specifically authorized by the      staff director or minority staff director. Unauthorized      disclosure of information from a closed session or of      classified information shall be cause for immediate dismissal      and may, in certain cases, be grounds for criminal      prosecution.                 rule 15--status and amendment of rules       (a) Status.--In addition to the foregoing, the Committee on      Foreign Relations is governed by the Standing Rules of the      Senate, which shall take precedence in the event of a clear      inconsistency. In addition, the jurisdiction and      responsibilities of the committee with respect to certain      matters, as well as the timing and procedure for their      consideration in committee, may be governed by statute.       (b) Amendment.--These rules may be modified, amended, or      repealed by a majority of the committee, provided that a      notice in writing (including by electronic mail) of the      proposed change has been given to each member at least 72      hours prior to the meeting at which action thereon is to be      taken. However, rules of the committee which are based upon      Senate rules may not be superseded by committee vote alone.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgS580.txt,1825,REPEAL WILL AFFECT EVERY AMERICAN,2017.0,1.0,March

From America's hallowed battlefields in Gettysburg and Fredericksburg, to the glacial peaks, geysers, and big game in my home State of Montana, to the ancient cultural resources, volcanoes, and marine life of Hawaii and all across the plains, many of the units of the National Park System bring remarkable opportunities for cultural education and outdoor recreation for people from around the world to enjoy. I am excited to be joined by ranking member Mazie Hirono and over 30 of our bipartisan colleagues from Alaska to Maine and Florida in introducing this resolution. The support of this resolution is a reflection that our National Parks bridge political divides and make our Nation uniquely As the National Park System begins its second century this year, we have seen record visitation with 331 million visits in 2016, but record visitation also brings additional strain on the National Park Service's failing infrastructure.

10237,topic-id,3784,"Mr.President, last night, I joined most of the Members of Congress to hear President Trump give his first address to a joint session. His speech lasted about 60 minutes, and I listened carefully, as did everyone in the Chamber, to the President's first remarks from that historic setting as he addressed a joint session of  There were some omissions, which I found very interesting. Not once--not one time--in the course of an hour did President Trump ever say the word ``Russia''--not one time--even though we have been told by 17 of our intelligence agencies that Russia made an overt effort to influence the outcome of the last Presidential campaign. That has never happened before in American history. A foreign country attacked the sovereignty of the United States in the election process for the highest office in the land. I think that is noteworthy. It is certainly historic. It would certainly be worth at least a mention when a President speaks to a joint session of Congress just a few months after that election. Instead, there was radio silence, mute button, crickets--nothing about  What do we have in terms of congressional response to the possibility that Vladimir Putin was trying to pick our next President? We have the suggestion by the Republican leaders in the Senate and the House that this matter should be taken up by the Intelligence  It sounds reasonable on its face. Having served on Intelligence Committees, I can tell you it is an awesome responsibility and assignment. I can also tell you we have some extraordinarily gifted, talented, patriotic members of those committees from both political parties in the Senate and in the House, but there is a fundamental flaw to this approach. If you went searching on Capitol Hill to find the room in which the Senate Intelligence Committee meets, you would come up empty. There is no sign on the door. It is basically kept clandestine, confidential, and secret. For 4 years, I entered that door, sat down in closed hearings, with no one from the public able to hear or even appreciate what we were doing. It is a lonely assignment--unlike any other committee on Capitol  I wonder: Is that what we want to do to explore the involvement of Vladimir Putin in our Presidential campaign--to go behind closed doors in secret and meet clandestinely? I think not.  There is an aspect of this that will require some intelligence gathering, some discussion of intelligence--and certainly that would be secret--but there is much more of it that is public in nature that will never be disclosed if we rely on the Senate Intelligence It is an invisible process, and that invisible process does not serve the needs of a democracy that wants the truth--the straight talk, the answers.  Secondly, the work of an Intelligence Committee ends up in a report that is classified, which means the public doesn't get to see it. We have seen some renditions of it--heavily redacted pages, where one or two words might escape being crossed out.  How do you move from a classified document on Putin's involvement in our Presidential campaign to a public document the people can understand? It takes declassification. Who makes the decision on whether we declassify the information from the Intelligence Committee investigation? The White  So, with the possibility--and I underline that word--with the possibility that some people in the President's campaign may or may not have been involved in this, the President has the last word as to the American people ever hearing the results of an Intelligence Committee report.  Many of us believe this is serious, and many of us believe there should be an independent, transparent commission, just like the 9/11 Let's call on people we respect, such as GEN Colin Powell, Sandra Day O'Connor, a former Supreme Court Justice, and many others just like them, who could get to the bottom of this and answer the basic questions: What were the Russians up to? We hear they had 1,000 trolls sitting in offices in Moscow dreaming up ways to hack into the computers and Internet of the United States and to disclose information to try to influence the outcome of the election. It is not a new tactic from They have done it over and over again.  The last couple of weeks I visited Poland, Lithuania, They know these tactics oh so well. Under Soviet times and since, Russia has tried to invade their space when it comes to election decisions--overtly, covertly, through propaganda, through cyber attacks. They have done it in many countries around the world. Sadly, they are good at it. Now they have decided they can do it in the United They can decide who our President will be or at least try to. Are we going to take this sitting down?  November 8, 2016, election day, was a day that will live in cyber infamy in the United The Russians invaded the U.election process. The President of the United States spoke to the American people last night and never mentioned one word--not a single word--about this.  How many Republican Senators and Congressmen have come to the floor? I don't know about in the House, but I can tell my colleagues I know about the Not one has come to the floor to even address this issue.  So when President Trump ignored it last night, refused to even mention it, I wasn't surprised, but it is not going away. It is a fact.  We currently have an investigation underway in our intelligence agencies. I just met with former Senator Dan Coats of He has been designated by the President to be the DNI--the Director of National He made a statement publicly yesterday before a hearing in Congress that he is going to cooperate with the committees and with Congress in disclosing information they have accumulated in our intelligence agencies as to this Russian involvement in our election.  We also know the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in this same exercise to find out exactly what happened and to disclose as much as possible and take action--prosecutorial action--if necessary.  There is a problem, though. The Federal Bureau of Investigation works for the Attorney The Department of Justice has the power to impede or stop any FBI investigation. Our former colleague Jeff Sessions was deeply and personally involved in the Trump Presidential campaign. He should recuse himself. He has an obvious conflict of interest on this issue. For the integrity of the office and for his own personal integrity, he should step aside and appoint a special prosecutor who can follow up, if necessary, with this FBI investigation.  This is a serious matter that was not addressed at all last night by the President of the United States speaking to a joint session of  The Associated Press went through some of the claims that were made by the President last night, and I want to give them credit for their homework on this. It is important for the Record that some of the things the President said be explained.  The President said:       According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current      immigration system[[Page S1524]]     costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.  The Associated Press writes:       That's not exactly what the report says. It says immigrants      ``contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add      expenditures by consuming public service.''       The report found that while first-generation immigrants are      more expensive to governments than their native-born      counterparts, primarily at the state and local level,      immigrants' children ``are among the strongest economic and      fiscal contributors in the population.'' This second      generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis,      for example, than non-immigrants in the period, 1994-2013.       The report [that the President unfortunately      mischaracterized] found that the ``long-run fiscal impact''      of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as      more positive ``if their role in sustaining labor force      growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial      activity were taken into account.''  So to argue, as the President did yesterday, that the National Academy of Sciences, as he said, stated that our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars is, at best, incomplete and misleading.  The President then went on to say during the course of his speech last night:       We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by      bringing down the price of the F-35 jet fighter.  I remember when he said that.  The Associated Press says as follows:       The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured      in full or large part before he became  He has taken credit for something he didn't do.  According to the AP:       The head of the Air Force program announced significant      price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35      fighter on December 19--after [candidate] Trump, [President-     Elect Trump] had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he      met with the company's  The AP goes on:       Pentagon managers took action even before the election to      save [this] money. . . . Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with      the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no      evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of      President Trump's actions.  Here is another statement made by the President last night:       We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.  I remember that one. That is something I hope we all can aspire to, but let me tell my colleagues what the Associated Press says about that claim.       Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen.      Independent analyses of his campaign tax proposals found that      most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families.      The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly      $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population      would get a tax cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax      Policy Center, a joint project with the Brookings Institution      and Urban  Here is another statement the President made last night:       Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.  The Associated Press says:       That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's      because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes      everyone aged 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't      looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are      staying home to raise children, high school and college      students who are studying rather than working.       They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the      economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching      retirement age many of them retiring, the population of those      out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do      so, most economists forecast.       It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of      working age and have given up looking for work. But that      number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million      President Trump cited.  Another statement the President made: He said his budget plan will offer ``one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.''  I will not dwell on this other than to say that the absolute number--a $54 billion increase, or about 10 percent, is the largest single number. On a percentage basis, there have been larger increases in previous years, like 2002, 2003, and 2008.  Here is another claim made by the President last night:       Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors,      Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others      have announced they will invest billions of dollars in the      United States and will create tens of thousands of new      American jobs.  The Associated Press reports that ``many of the announcements reflect corporate decisions that predate [Trump's Presidential] election,'' making it unlikely his administration ``is the sole or even primary reason for the expected hiring. . . . In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth.  Another statement made by President Trump last night in his speech:       We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and      poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those      who have become so badly addicted.  The facts:       Addicts and mentally ill people who gain access to      treatment programs for the first time as a result of      ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--are worried about repeal      that President Trump has called for. Repeal could end      coverage for 1.8 million people who have undergone addiction      or mental health treatment, cut $5.5 billion on spending on      such services according to estimates by economist Richard      Frank, a former administration official under Barack Obama,      now with the Harvard Medical  The AP goes on to say:       The key question is what will happen to Medicaid as a      result of changes Republicans are pursuing? Broadly speaking,      Republicans want to transform the health insurance program      for low-income people from an open-ended Federal entitlement      to a system that provides States with a limited amount of      financing and gives them latitude on how to spend it.  The AP goes on to say:       If Congress is too stingy with State allotments, States      would be hampered dealing with the emergencies like the      opioid epidemic.  The next statement by President Trump last night:       According to data provided by the Department of Justice,      the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-     related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our      country. We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston to San      Bernardino to the Pentagon, and yes, even the World Trade       The Associated Press responds:       It's unclear what Justice Department data the President is      citing. The most recent government information that has come      out doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people      President Trump talks about were actually born in the United      States, according to Homeland Security Department research.      That report said of 82 people the government determined were      inspired by foreign terrorist groups to attempt to carry out      an attack on the U.S., just over half [of them] were [born in      the United States] native-born citizens.  The AP goes on to say:       Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the      work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his      Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in      San Bernardino, California, was born in       It's true that in the immediate aftermath of September 11,      the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas      feared to be plotting attacks in the United But      that's no longer the case. The FBI and Justice Department      have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the      U.who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of      the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has      prosecuted scores of Islamic State-related cases since 2014,      and many of the defendants are U.citizens.  Another statement by President Trump last night:       ObamaCare is collapsing . . . imploding Obamacare disaster.  The AP writes:       There are problems with the 2010 health care law, but      whether it's collapsing is hotly disputed.       One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act      has been a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from      insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems      to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern.       Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the      whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured      if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say      GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating      uncertainty about the future.       The health law offers subsidized private health insurance      along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income      people. Together, the two arms of the program reach more than      20 million people.       Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid      are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the      administration to keep this expansion, and maybe even build      on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of      Medicaid.[[Page S1525]]       While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the      markets for subsidized health insurance are stressed in many      states. Also affected are millions of people who buy      individual policies outside the government markets, and face      the same high premiums with no financial help from the health      law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation      says ``implosion'' is too strong a term. An AP count found      that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite      the Trump administration's threats to repeal the law.  I might add, that it is despite all of the speeches made on the floor of the Senate and the House, promising that it would be repealed as well.  The last point I want to make is this. I was troubled last night by a recurring theme in the President's speech. It was a theme about immigration in the United We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this country. I am proud to serve as a Senator from the State where she and her family settled. I am proud of the struggle they went through--coming to this country, not knowing the language, going through some pretty rough times, facing poverty, taking the dirtiest and toughest jobs. Because of that, the second generation of my family--the one I represent--has brought some great people to this world in our own families and perhaps even added to the benefits of the United States for others.  Last night, if you listened to the characterization of immigrants, it was negative, virtually from start to finish.  In the audience last night, I had a young lady as my guest. She is an extraordinary lady. Her name is Aaima She is Pakistani, and she was brought to the United States at the age of 3 by her parents from They settled in Chicago and eventually moved to New It turns out the family had its difficulties and the mother and father split and separated. When the father left, he left behind his paperwork--which was in place or at least in the process--of trying to legalize the presence of his family, and nothing was done.  It wasn't until she was in high school that this young lady realized that she was undocumented. That creates obstacles for any young person. In her case, a special obstacle was the cost of higher education. As an undocumented child in America, she didn't qualify for government assistance--Federal Government assistance--and limited State assistance. Yet she aspired to go on to school and to borrow the money, if necessary, at high interest rates from private sources in order to finish her education. She graduated from Rutgers University magna cum laude and then wanted to go to medical school.  There weren't many medical schools accepting undocumented students, but there was one. I am proud to tell you that it was Loyola University of Chicago, the Stritch School of There were about 65 undocumented young people in medical school in the United States, and 30 of them were at Loyola in I have met most of them. Each and every one of them is more inspiring than the next.  They opened up the competition. They didn't give them slots to fill. They said: Compete with everyone. These students were so outstanding from across the United States that they made it to  This young lady, in her third year, faces another 6 years of education before she completes her medical degree. When she is finished with those 6 years, it isn't over. In Illinois, we told her she could go to school, but it was part of a contract. She could attend school, and we would reduce the interest payments at a later part in her life if she gave us 1 year of service in an underserved community in Illinois for each year of medical school. She has 6 years of school left and 4 years of serving in a rural community or an underserved neighborhood clinic in the city of Chicago or nearby.  She signed up for it. She is an amazing young person. She is determined to get this medical degree--despite the debt, despite the obstacles. The only reason she can do this is because she is protected by something called  Let me explain. Some 16 years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM It said that if you were brought to the United States, like she was, under the age of 16, you had a good life, no criminal record or history of a problematic nature, and completed your education, you can stay in the United States and eventually work your way toward legalization.  President Obama took it up and created an Executive order called DACA and said to the young people in that situation: Come and apply, pay a $600 filing fee, then go through a criminal background check, and if you make it, we will give you 2 years to live in the United States without fear of deportation, with a work permit.  She signed up. That is how she can go to medical school. You need to work to go to medical school. She is going through a clinical experience where she is actually working in these hospitals. Without a work permit, she wouldn't be able to complete medical school.  The obvious question is this: What is going to happen to this program under President Trump? In fairness, the President has said positive things about DACA and I thanked him personally. I have only met him three times, but I thanked him personally twice for doing that. I hope that it means that ultimately there will be some path for the 750,000 young people, just like her, who are simply asking for a chance to be educated and be part of America's future.  I hope that, as people who listened to the speech last night think about immigrants to the United States, they will think about this young woman, as well, who has worked so hard her entire life to better herself and to be able to help others at a later point in life.  She is an extraordinary person, and there are so many more just like her. They are immigrants to this country. In this case it is Muslim immigrant to this country who someday will be an exceptional doctor, who is going to give 4 years of her life back to my home State and then is going to help others all across the United That, to me, is an image of immigrants that shouldn't be lost with the negative connotations that were raised last night.

10297,topic-id,574,"Mr.President, I rise today to praise President Trump for selecting an eminently qualified nominee in Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.Supreme No one can dispute the academic credentials and intellectual rigor of Judge In fact, even a former Acting Solicitor General under President Obama, Neal Katyal, called Judge Gorsuch ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our Nation over the last century.'' Just yesterday, he joined the Republican and Democratic Senators from Colorado in introducing Judge Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Judge Gorsuch graduated with honors from Columbia University and then Harvard Law He later earned a doctorate in legal philosophy from the University of Prior to becoming a judge, Neil Gorsuch was Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, worked as a litigator in private practice, and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Moreover, earlier this month, the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Gorsuch ``well qualified,'' its highest rating.  One of my constituents who went to high school with Judge Gorsuch took the time to send me a note in support of his character, calling him ``the most reasonable, smart, principled, kind, and humble person I know.'' Even at a young age, he made a positive impression on his colleagues--something he has continued to do today.  During the course of Judge Gorsuch's 10-year judicial career, his opinions have reflected not only his outstanding legal acumen but also his respect for the Constitution and his Scalia-like ability to explain his decisions.  Judge Gorsuch was nominated to his current position on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by President George Bush in 2006. As a testament to Judge Gorsuch's exceptional credentials, the Senate confirmed him by unanimous voice vote. Several current Members of the Senate from both parties, including Minority Leader Schumer, supported Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. The people spoke last November, and our new President has put forward a well-respected nominee whom the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. It is time for Washington to work together as our constituents expect us to do, to help protect and defend our coequal branches of government and the rule of law. If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch's dedication to interpreting the text of the Constitution and statutes as they are written rather than attempting to legislate from the bench will help to do just that.  As Judge Gorsuch himself has stated in one of his opinions: ``A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.''  I have had the great honor of meeting with Judge Gorsuch to learn more about his judicial philosophy, and over the next few days, the American people will also get to learn more about Judge Gorsuch through his confirmation hearing. I am confident they will also determine he is qualified to serve on our Nation's highest I look forward to moving ahead to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with this eminently qualified nominee, and I thank him for his willingness to serve his country in this critically important role.

10268,topic-id,2037,"Mr.President, yesterday I introduced the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, a bill to protect young athletes who participate in the U.amateur ranks from sexual abuse.  Before last summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, the Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that revealed that amateur gymnasts were sexually abused in gyms all across the country. No one knew how widespread the problem was in that sport.  But throughout the investigation, the Indianapolis Star tallied--after reviewing police files and court cases across the country--368 gymnasts who alleged they were sexually abused over a 20-year time period.  Kids as young as 6 were secretly photographed in the nude by coaches. Young athletes were molested by coaches during ``therapy'' sessions. Sexual predators spent countless hours with children one-on-one and abused them for years before anything was done. These accounts were devastating. And they were just the tip of the iceberg.  After reviewing this report, I, along with my colleagues Senator Leahy, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Donnelly, wrote to USA Gymnastics to urge the organization to do more to protect their young athletes.  Specifically, we urged the organization to update its policies and require that all members--including coaches, athletes, and others--immediately report to law enforcement when there is an incident of sexual abuse committed against an athlete.  After we sent the letter, several sexual abuse victims from California reached out to my staff. They revealed that they were abused by individuals affiliated with USA I told my staff that I had to meet them.  Six brave women, who were each abused as young gymnasts at various points in their careers, then travelled across the country to share their testimonies with me. Two athletes from another sport who were sexually abused also joined us. I will never forget their faces that day. When I walked into the room, I could sense the overwhelming devastation wrought on their lives.  One by one, they shared their hopes and dreams as young athletes. The gymnasts talked about how, while pursuing future Olympic glory, they put their complete faith in the USA Gymnastics infrastructure. They fully trusted the coaches and doctors who had the USA Gymnastics seal of approval. And it was in this environment that they were sexually exploited by those whom they trusted.  Several of the women had been abused repeatedly--over the course of months and years--by a USA Gymnastics team doctor named Larry Nassar is currently being prosecuted for a number of horrific crimes against children. One of those brave women was Jamie Dantzscher, a retired gymnast who won the bronze medal competing in the 2000 Olympics in Jamie told me how she trained as a young girl in When she was 13 years old, she was thrilled to be invited to train with the national USA Gymnastics team. It was with the national team that Nassar gained her trust. Nassar became her ``buddy,'' in the midst of an intense training environment. With USA Gymnastics backing him as a famous doctor and trainer, Jamie felt that there was absolutely no reason to believe Nassar was not trustworthy.  So when Jamie went to see Nassar for back pain, she was confused when Nassar began to touch her in inappropriate places. She was 13 and 14 years old. As she described the abuse to me in graphic detail, the other women around the room began to sob quietly. The tactics that Nassar used were too familiar to them.  And for the longest time, each of the victims believed that their horrific experiences were one-off events, that they were isolated in their own subjective memories. But the sharing of their stories--together in that room with me and the others--affirmed to them that what they had experienced was wrong.  One of the other gymnasts who bravely shared her story with me was Jeanette Antolin, who competed on the national team in the late nineties. Hailing from southern California, Jeanette shared how she was incredibly fearful of ever saying anything about the abuse committed against her because she believed she was being treated by a world-class doctor with USA Gymnastics' approval. As an aspiring Olympian, she feared that if she complained about anything, it would affect her career.  The same fears had overcome Jessica Howard, a rhythmic gymnast who was 15 years old when Nassar began abusing her. She was sent to Nassar for hip problems, and he told her that she should not wear any underwear for her treatment. At the time, she was confused and afraid to say anything to anyone. She believed she would be prevented from pursuing her dreams if she said anything.  I also met Doe Yamashiro from southern Doe was sexually abused by a 1984 Olympic Coach named Don In the mid-1980s, Coach Peters began fondling Doe and then had sex with her. Doe told me and the group of the pain and anguish she still suffers from many years later. The same pain and devastation was felt by all of the young victims who were in the room.  One of the common themes I heard from their stories was not just the predatory behavior of the perpetrators, but also how the USA Gymnastics institution failed to protect them. One of the women told me how she heard USA Gymnastics officials say at one point that it was their top priority to obtain ``medals and money'' and that a ``reputation of a coach'' should not be tarnished by an allegation raised by a victim.  This shocked me, and as I dug deeper into the USA Gymnastics institution, which is considered a ``national governing body'' under Federal law and oversees over 3,000 gymnasiums nationwide, I saw that their policies made it harder for victims, rather than easier, to report incidents of abuse. Their bylaws stated, for example, that the only way for a member athlete to ``effectively'' make a complaint about a coach was through a signed, written complaint.  Furthermore, USA Gymnastics' policy indicated that the organization ``may'' report sexual abuse to law enforcement authorities if a child's safety was at risk, but it was not mandatory. It further stated that it complied with State mandatory reporting laws, but if a State law didn't require anything more, there was no other obligation to do anything else.  It is my strong belief that these arcane policies left children vulnerable to the advances of sexual predators and failed to protect them even when incidents came to light. For example, in reviewing USA Gymnastics' history in public accounts, there were multiple instances where gymnastics coaches were convicted of heinous child sex crimes, years after USA Gymnastics had received complaints about those coaches. In other words, USA Gymnastics appears to have sat on reports of sexual abuse for years, while predators continued to prey on children.  At the end of my meeting with the survivors, I looked at each of them and told them that I would work on legislation to protect other kids and amateur athletes like them from sexual predators.  The legislation we have introduced does three main things to help child sex abuse survivors. It is a strong bipartisan bill, and I want to extend my deepest thanks to those Members who have worked with me on it, including Senators Collins, Grassley, Donnelly, Nelson, Blumenthal, Flake, McCaskill, Ernst, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Warren, Harris, Cortez-Masto, Rubio, and  The first thing the bill does is to mandate that any person affiliated with USA Gymnastics or other national governing bodies immediately report child abuse, including sexual abuse, to local or Federal law enforcement. This requirement would apply not only to USA Gymnastics, but to each of the other 47 national governing bodies that oversee various Olympic sports, including USA Taekwondo, USA Speed Skating, USA Swimming, and USA It is absolutely imperative that a bright line be drawn for all those working with national governing bodies that, once there are facts giving rise to suspect child or sex abuse, a report must be made as soon as possible to proper authorities. This bill mandates that.[[Page S1635]]  Second, this bill strengthens Masha's law, which was named after a 5-year-old Russian orphan who was adopted by an American man only to be raped and sexually abused by him for 6 years until he was finally caught by the FBI in 2003. Her adoptive father had not only abused her, but he had also produced over 200 sexually explicit images of that abuse. Masha's law allows civil suits by minors against sex abuse perpetrators who violate a variety of crimes against children, including sex trafficking, sexual exploitation, and child pornography crimes.  This law is significant for victims to obtain justice because there are times when criminal cases against perpetrators are declined due to difficulties in proving a criminal case. Therefore, for many traumatized victims, the only avenue for them to ever seek justice against their perpetrators is through Masha's law or other civil remedies.  The bill, therefore, updates Masha's law to help victims. It clarifies, for example, that victims of child sex crimes are entitled to statutory damages of $150,000 and possible punitive damages, due to the particularly severe nature of the crimes.  The bill also extends the statute of limitations for Masha's law. The statute of limitations extension is part of legislation that Senator Cornyn and I have worked on over the past couple of years, called the Extending Justice for Sex Crime Victims  Finally, the bill makes reforms to the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which establishes ``national governing bodies'' like USA The Stevens Act specifically lists the authorities and duties of national governing bodies.  When I first wrote to USA Gymnastics about its poor handling of sexual abuse allegations, they replied that the Stevens Act limits their abilities to fully protect athletes from sexual abuse, so this bill fixes that. It requires national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics to develop for each of its members: specific policies and procedures for the mandatory reporting of sex abuse to law enforcement, policies and procedures to keep track of coaches who leave one gym due to complaints and then go to another gym and repeat cycles of abuse, policies to ensure that minors and amateur athletes are not in one-on-one situations with adults, policies to facilitate reporting of sex abuse allegations to national governing bodies and other authorities, and stronger oversight and enforcement policies so that the national governing bodies take a greater role in making sure that the policies are actually being implemented and enforced throughout the country.  These provisions give national governing bodies like USA Gymnastics absolutely no excuse to make sure that all members are subjected to the strongest training and procedures to prevent sexual abuse.  It further forces organizations like USA Gymnastics to impact the culture of their sports, through various oversight mechanisms, to make sure that all members of such organizations adhere to the strictest standards when it comes to sexual abuse prevention.  Finally, I would like to close with this. All over the country, victims of sexual abuse are coming forward to disclose how they were abused and exploited at the height of their innocence when they were children. Multiple victims from California and throughout the country have, for example, contacted my office and described with great courage their pain and anguish. Rather than list statistics, I want you to know that each of these individual stories represents an untold amount of pain and suffering that reverberates throughout generations, leaving devastation in its path. I urge my colleagues in this body to work with me and the sponsors of this bill to pass this important legislation to protect victims.  I would also like to acknowledge the support for this bill from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, National Children's Alliance, Rights4Girls, University of Utah Law Professor Paul Cassell, Child Sex Crime Victims' Lawyer James Marsh, Crime Victims Expert Steve Twist, National Crime Victims Center, Child USA, National Association of VOCA Administrators, National Organization for Victim Assistance, ToPrevail, ChampionWomen, National Children's Advocacy Center, National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Association to Protect Children, and the Rape Abuse & Incest National  They are on the front lines of this work, and I greatly appreciate their support.

10311,topic-id,782,"Mr.Speaker, given that last week I took the oath of[[Page H536]]office as a Member of the new 115th Congress ofthe United States and given that next week we will watch President-elect Trump also take the oath of office, I want to share afew thoughts on the deep importance of this constitutional duty that we share.  Mr.Speaker, as you are aware, last week on Capitol Hill was marked by a day of celebration. It was a day of renewal offriendships, even between people who have deep, deep disagreements in this body. Families and guests all gathered to share inthe moment's excitement and meaning, and Members of Congress congratulated one another on their recent victories. We all took areprieve from the intensity of the policy debate for just a moment. But amidst all of that swirl of activity, the day was setapart by the oath of office.  Mr.Speaker, the oath lays down a clear marker of the serious obligations ahead for all of us. In our day and time, we nolonger are deeply connected to this concept of oath. We see it in the courtroom when somebody is required to tell the truth. Wewill see it again next week when President-elect Trump is sworn in. But we rarely take the time to reflect on its deepermeaning.  We see it more like an old tradition, a nostalgic option that we exercise out of deference to our history. However, the oathis much, much more. It is a solemn declaration. It is a pause, the start of sacred duty.  By taking an oath, you effectively hold your very self at ransom. You commit, at the deepest levels, that you will performthe tasks ahead of you to the best of your ability.  The oath is the ultimate test and measure of integrity. If you violate it, you tear at the center of your being, to thedetriment of not only yourself but to the community, to those you are sworn to serve. This is a very high bar, indeed, Mr. I am reminded of the words of Sir Thomas More, who was the Lord High Chancellor of England during the 16th century. Hestrove to live a life worthy of excellence in public service. But in the end, he was put to death by the very state that hesought to so nobly serve.  In an earlier reflection on the idea of oath, Sir Thomas More had this to say:  ``When a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own hands like water, and if he opens his fingers then, heneedn't hope to find himself again.''  Mr.Speaker, throughout that wonderful day last week of our swearing in here in the body, I was reflecting personally on asingular word. That word is replenishment.  Our American system of governance has an extraordinary capacity to replenish itself with new ideas, new people, andrefreshed perspectives. Our political system starts with the belief that political power is derived from each person's dignity.  By voting, citizens invest that very power in the Representatives that are sent here to make judgments on their behalf. But,of course, to earn that right in the first place, the Representative must make his case to the people. In spite of the drama, inspite of the raucous nature of elections--and we have just come through one--the fact that America goes through this cycle ofconstant replenishment is truly an extraordinary gift.  Mr.Speaker, as I stood in the center aisle right here last week, I raised my right hand. I raised it right along witheveryone else who is a Member of this new 115th Congress, and I took that oath of office.  Mr.Speaker, I just think it is worthwhile to read these powerful words:  ``I do solemnly swear, or affirm, that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without anymental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I amabout to enter, so help me God.''  Mr.Speaker, indeed, this is a very high bar. This is a sacred duty. This is a solemn task. It sets this body and our systemof governance apart by forcing each of us who have been given this extraordinary privilege of taking on the heavy mantel andweighty responsibility of making decisions on behalf of this great country, and to do so to the best of our ability, having putour very self, the integrity of what it means to be a person, on the line to uphold that commitment.

10397,topic-id,582,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of H.1304, the Self-Insurance Protection  Mr.Speaker, across the country, hardworking men and women are struggling to afford rising healthcare costs, and their options continue to drop year after year. At the same time, employers, large and small, are finding it harder to provide the type of high-quality, affordable healthcare coverage their employees need.  With over 150 Americans relying on an employer-sponsored health plan, Congress must do everything possible to ensure employers have the tools they need to help control healthcare costs for working families. Preserving access to self insurance is one simple step we can take as part of that effort.  More than 60 percent of employers who offer healthcare coverage choose to self-insure. This means that instead of purchasing a plan from an insurance company, employers pay their employees' healthcare costs directly. As a result, the employers have greater flexibility to structure a healthcare plan to the unique needs of workers and their families.  Although these plans provide important protections, they are free from certain restrictive rules that force workers to purchase one-size-fits-all benefits that they may not want or need. Self-insurance is a popular option that often leads to lower health insurance premiums for workers and their families.  In years with below average medical claims, any remaining healthcare dollars can help offset premiums for workers the following year, or can be used to help create new jobs and higher wages.  It is not just private sector employers who like the flexibility and affordability of self-insured health coverage. It is also embraced by labor organizations, schools, cities, and counties.  Of course, there is some level of risk associated with these plans. That is why employers purchase stop-loss insurance, so that employees can count on their healthcare coverage when they need it. Because it simply serves as a financial backstop to an actual health insurance policy, stop-loss has never been regulated as health insurance by the Federal  But as we all know, the previous administration had a constant urge to regulate practically every aspect of American life, regardless of the consequences. It was only a matter of time before the Obama administration made stop-loss insurance one of its regulatory targets, even though many employers would find it nearly impossible to self-insure as a result.  Limiting a popular free-market healthcare option that millions of Americans rely on was a price they were willing to pay in order to push their government-run healthcare scheme.  Fortunately for working families, the Obama administration was unsuccessful, and we now have a new administration committed to expanding, not limiting, affordable healthcare options. However, all this highlights the need to protect access to self-insurance.  Employers need long-term certainty when it comes to the healthcare benefits they provide, and working families deserve peace of mind that they won't lose the plan they like because of a partisan, unnecessary Federal regulation. The Self-Insurance Protection Act provides that certainty and peace of mind by reaffirming existing law and preventing Federal bureaucrats from regulating stop-loss as health insurance.  There is more we can and should do to promote affordable healthcare coverage for working families. This legislation is one small step we can take to ensure Americans can continue to benefit from flexible healthcare plans that help lower costs.  I urge my colleagues to stand up for affordable healthcare options for workers and employers by voting in favor of H.1304.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

10342,topic-id,1192,"Mr.President, with all the division and conflict in politics today, it would take something truly compelling to unite all 100 Senators, including Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals. Well, it has happened. This week I sent to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a letter, signed by all 100 Senators, asking that it be conveyed to Russian President Vladimir The letter supports the decades-long quest by Agudas Chasidei Chabad of the United States to recover from Russia its collection of sacred religious texts and manuscripts.  Chabad was established in the 18th century in Russia and is today the largest Hasidic Jewish organization in the world. The organization's past leaders, or rebbes, accumulated this collection of sacred texts, which includes a library and an archive and is central to Chabad's religious life. The Soviets took control of the library in 1920 and in 1927 arrested the sixth rebbe and sentenced him to death. He was allowed to leave Russia later that year but had to leave the library behind. In 1933, the sixth rebbe and the archive moved to  In 1940, after both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland, the sixth rebbe fled to the United States without the archive. It was confiscated, first by the Nazis and then by the Chabad has since worked to reclaim both the library and the archive.  It is important to place the letter we sent this week in its full context because this is only the latest in a long series of actions by all three branches of the U.Government to support Chabad's quest. Members of Congress, for example, began calling for the return of these works in the 1930s. Just weeks before the Soviet Union dissolved on Christmas Day 1991, both President Mikhail Gorbachev and a state arbitration panel ordered that the library be returned to On January 24, 1992, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe wrote President Boris Yeltsin, urging him to carry out the court's order and return the collection.  Unfortunately, both President Gorbachev's directive and the court's order were effectively nullified when the Russian Federation replaced the Soviet Within a few months, however, the U.State Department expressed ``strong support'' for returning the full collection to On May 31, 1992, all 100 Senators signed a letter to President Boris Yeltsin urging the collection's ``quick release.''  On February 20, 2005, all 100 Senators signed a letter to President Putin, again urging that the collection be returned to The letter said this: ``The religious texts that Chabad seeks to retrieve consist of rare and irreplaceable books, archives and manuscripts on Chabad philosophy, Jewish religious law, prayer and tradition. . . . We urge you to return these sacred religious texts, archives, and manuscripts to Chabad, which would be a significant example of your government's commitment to justice, human rights, and religious freedom.''  Chabad filed suit against Russia in Federal court.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding again.  I was encouraged by the bipartisan agreements we reached on the MILCON/VA bill and the defense appropriations bill. As you know, together, these two bills make up roughly one half of our total discretionary spending.  However, I was disappointed to hear that Democrats have apparently walked away from the negotiating table on further bipartisan agreements like these. Personally, I was disappointed to hear rumors that Democrats are hoping for a government shutdown.  The New York Times is reporting that, ``as a minority party struggling to show resistance in the era of President Trump''--Democrats--``are now ready to let the lights of government go dark.''  I sincerely hope these rumors and reports are not true. I know the gentleman disagrees with ever having a government shutdown.

I want everybody to know that my door is always open, especially to you, my friend from Maryland, and any other House[[Page H2577]]colleague who wants to play a constructive role in the process.

Frankly, I want to tell the majority leader, honestly, nobody on my side, maybe someplace else, but nobody on my side is wanting to shut down the government. We don't want to shut down the government.  Of course, I will remind my friend, the majority leader--and I appreciate his comments about our cooperation and ability to work together--the only way the government has been kept open over the last 5 years has been with Democratic votes. My friend didn't have 218 votes on his side of the aisle that would do that. So I think that belies the fact that we want to shut down the government.  I would assure my friend that that is neither our intent or desire. As a matter of fact, we want to work quickly to avoid that happening. That is not good for, obviously, the American people, it is not good for managers trying to plan on how to deliver services, and it is certainly not good for our Federal employees. So I would want to work with you to make sure that doesn't happen.  As we have in the past, we will be prepared to provide votes, as we have every time, to ensure that that does not happen.  Let me ask my friend, as we work towards the end of not shutting down government and passing, hopefully, an omnibus which will complete the 2017 appropriations process and fund the government through September 30, let me ask him--he was quoting some information. I have a quote for him as well. I know he would be disappointed if I didn't have a quote. This is not nearly as difficult as some of the others, however. It says:       House Republicans are considering making another run next      week at the passing of the healthcare bill that they abruptly      pulled from the floor in a setback to their efforts to repeal      Two Republican lawyers say the leaders are      discussing holding a vote, even staying into next weekend, if      necessary, but it is unclear what changes would be made to      the GOP's healthcare bill . . .

I know the majority leader didn't announce that for next week, and I know on Thursday we will break for the Easter break.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman does know, from the widespread disagreement, that ObamaCare is failing. He disagrees with that, but the majority of Americans agree that it is collapsing and that we have to solve this problem.  As of today, I do not have anything scheduled for next week.

Mr.Speaker, the House will also continue our work under the Congressional Review Act to undo onerous Obama administration regulations through three more joint resolutions.

That is the exact opposite of what Americans want for their children.  The second, sponsored by Representative Todd Rokita, would address how the accountability provisions of the Every Student Succeeds Act are being implemented. This bipartisan law empowered States to hold schools accountable, but somehow, when the regulation came out, there was an expanded Federal role. This was not what Congress intended nor what is best for our students.  And the third, Mr.Speaker, sponsored by Representative Liz Cheney, addresses how the Department of the Interior regulates resource management plans. These plans guide how BLM manages all Federal lands. But the rule only addresses how BLM must deal with the public, as well as State and tribal governments. We are rightfully concerned that there is no process or procedure for local governments in these new rules.

In fact, we are going to have some discussions about all of these regulations which we believe reduce the protections, according to the American people, by a number of the regulations that are sought to be repealed.  However, first, Mr.Speaker, let me note that, first of all, we have another Ben in He is the senior Senator, a former colleague of ours, Ben He had a TV ad which ended with ``My Friend, Ben.''  I want to say hi to my friend Ben, who has--indeed, as all of you know, I think the staff that serve with us make such an extraordinarily positive difference, and they sometimes--or most of the time--rise above what might be the partisan confrontation that Members have and continue to try to reach consensus so that this institution will run positively and well for the American people. Ben Howard has been one of those people.  I know that Shuwanza Goff, who sits next to me and is my floor director, has worked very positively with Ben through the years and appreciates very much his working with us.

Now let me move on to, perhaps, some subjects that we might not have as much agreement on as we do have on Ben Howard and his quality and the service he has given this institution.  One of the first acts of Congress, of course, as you know, Mr.Leader, which was the plan, was to begin the reconciliation process to repeal the Affordable Care The budget resolution set a deadline of January 27 for committees to report legislation repealing the law. It is now the 3rd of February, and after voting 65 times to repeal the ACA, House and Senate Republicans, Mr.Speaker, do not have, as far as I know, and don't appear to have, a replacement and are, as I read in the papers, Mr.Speaker, divided on the path forward.  Repealing the ACA without replacing it immediately will not only cause 30 million Americans to lose their coverage, but it would increase the cost for tens of millions more and would, I suggest, disadvantage everybody who has insurance, and clearly those who do not and would not have access.  Mark Meadows, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said: ``We need to slow down the process so we can understand a little bit more the specifics and the timetable of replacement votes and reconciliation instructions. . . .''  That was in Politico on January 9 of this year.  Senator Bob Corker, in the Senate, said: ``There's more and more concerns about not doing'' repeal and replace ``simultaneously. You would think after 6 years, we would have a pretty good sense of what we would like to do.''  We have not seen a repeal and replace bill. The President said it ought to be done contemporaneously. Bob Corker and others have said it ought to be done contemporaneously. We haven't seen it. So my question, Mr.Majority Leader, is: Does the gentleman expect that if repeal does move forward, that a replacement bill would be considered simultaneously?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I am not sure if, in the beginning of your question, you want us to speed up or slow down, but I thank the gentleman for the question.

I know that the position is, oh, this is not a ban. The complication you have to that representation is the President keeps mentioning it as a ban, as he said he was going to do in the election, and he referred to it as a ban just a few days ago.

Every one of us on this side of the aisle wants to make sure that that happens, and we certainly want to make sure that the vetting is appropriate.

Senator Graham and Senator McCain, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the gentleman from South  They go on:  ``We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Such a hasty process risks harmful results.'' This continues to be a quote by Senator McCain and Senator ``Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.'' Senator McCain knows something about increased risk.  He went on to say, along with Senator Graham:  ``This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.'' They said that on the 29th of January, just 4 days ago.  At least four times this week, Mr.Leader, we asked for the consideration of H.724, which rescinds and defunds the refugee ban. The Speaker said, when he took office initially--and he repeated this year--that we were going to have an open, transparent process and that we would consider the important issues of the day on this floor, with an opportunity for every Member of this House to offer alternatives.  I know the committee would not report it out, but this is a critical issue to our country, to our safety, and to our values; and I ask the gentleman:  Is there a possibility that you would bring to the floor next week or the week thereafter--preferably next week--H.724 so that the Members of this House--the people's Representatives--could speak to this critically important issue consistent with the observations of Senator McCain and Senator Graham?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I listened to the Speaker when he took office, too, and he also said ``regular order.'' In the schedule for next week, it is not on the list.  The executive order signed by the President, really, as you know, is based on legislation that passed this House with overwhelming bipartisan support. It was following the attacks over the past 2 years. It was the SAFE Act that passed this House 289-137, and the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act that passed by 407-19. I will point out that these two bills received veto-proof majorities, and President Obama signed the visa waiver bill into law.  President Trump's actions are temporary pauses and reassess our vetting procedures to keep our country safe. While there was, certainly, some confusion with how this was implemented over the weekend, the Secretary of Homeland Security is effectively addressing key issues to ensure legal permanent residents who are returning to our country are allowed entry unless our security services have a compelling reason to suggest otherwise. America remains a place of refuge for those seeking peace, freedom, and opportunity across the world.  Now, my friend knows, because we have been in meetings this week, that our rhetoric matters. Other people listen to what we say. In these types of situations, especially with a new administration, I have always told my children: at any time in a situation, let's take a deep breath; let's not lose our heads. Especially with a brand new administration, I try to give them the benefit of the doubt. They don't have their Cabinet there yet. Let's let them get their footing. It is not a ban--it is a pause. It is based upon two pieces of legislation that passed this  You love to quote people; so if I may:  ``House Democrats and House Republicans have no greater priority than keeping Americans safe. This is neither a partisan issue nor is it a partisan difference. Many Americans are frustrated with the pace of progress against ISIS in Iraq and I want to see the administration and Congress working together to protect our The reforms in this bill are an excellent start.  ``This legislation will make it easier for law enforcement to vet those visitors who are coming from Visa Waiver countries, such as in Europe, to ensure that we are not admitting those who have traveled to places like Iraq and Syria and link up with ISIS.''

10353,topic-id,712,"Mr.President, I would like to use my remaining time to voice my strong support of Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Let me stress that Judge Gorsuch won my vote when I first heard his definition of the role of a judge. Let me quote:       It is the role of a judge to apply, not alter, the work of      the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome      he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results      he prefers rather than those the law demands.  That is the quintessential definition of the role of a judge. I met with Judge Gorsuch last Tuesday morning, and in that meeting he further reinforced my support. I asked Judge Gorsuch and voiced my concern that far too often we have seen judges evolve into superlegislators--judicial activists on the court. I asked the judge: How can I be assured that won't happen with you? To paraphrase his response to me, he said: Senator, I am going to follow the law; you will not like some of my decisions.  That was music to my ears. I realize there is a lot of bad law, and we have a judge who follows the law and applies it. Sometimes I am not going to like those decisions, but that is That is the role of a judge.  He went on to say: I am not itching to be anything other than a good judge. He further said that legislative power cannot be delegated. Judge Gorsuch gave me a great deal of confidence that he is well qualified and that he deserves to fill some pretty big shoes--Justice Scalia's seat on the Supreme  It is not just I who considers Judge Gorsuch well qualified. The ABA has given Judge Gorsuch their ``well qualified'' rating, which is the highest possible rating. Of course, Democratic Leader Schumer, in a Washington Post article from March 18, 2001, said: ``The ABA'S evaluation is the gold standard by which judicial candidates are judged.''  Vice President Biden, back in 1994, talking about the ABA rating system said:       I look at no other recommendation more closely. I value no      recommendation more highly.  So the ABA says Judge Gorsuch is highly qualified, and I agree. Judge Gorsuch also has bipartisan support. I am heartened by the fact that three of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have already voiced their support for Judge Of course, President Obama's Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, also said:       Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant      judges to have served our Nation over the last century. As a      judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve      the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with      him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.      I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme  Again, that is a quote from President Obama's Solicitor My final comment has to do with the fact that this is the will of the American people. In my lifetime, I really cannot remember when a Presidential election elevated the issue of Supreme Court nominations to as high a level as it was elevated in this election. As a matter of fact, this election, point blank, elevated this particular vacancy.  So many of my Republican colleagues said exactly what I said: It is so close to the election; so why don't we let the American people decide not only the direction of this country but the composition of the Supreme The American people spoke. The voters in my State of Wisconsin spoke. They voted for the 10 electoral votes in support of President Trump, and they voted to elect me to confirm President Trump's nominee to this Supreme Court vacancy.

10244,topic-id,1143,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose S.13, which is a Congressional Review Act resolution to undo the regulations which protect title X health centers. I believe this resolution, although well meaning, will have the opposite effect of its intention.  I particularly want to discuss the organization known as Planned Parenthood, but, more generally, these women's health centers, these title X health centers, 1, provide many healthcare services to women, particularly low-income women. They are the choice of those women. They are a place they have chosen to go to receive their healthcare treatment.  I do think that one of the problems with this whole debate is the use of the term ``funding'' of Planned What we are talking about here is not funding, as in a budget line or a budget provision that says: Planned Parenthood gets $58 million or $100 million or $10, whatever it is. That is not the way it works. What we are talking about is reimbursement for women's healthcare services provided on an individual, case-by-case basis, and this does not include abortion. It does not include abortion.  These organizations in Maine--Planned Parenthood, for example, serves 10,000 people. Ten thousand women choose to get their healthcare services from Planned  The other piece of this debate I have never understood is why those who are opposed to abortion would be so opposed to organizations that allow women to make choices about pregnancies and provide contraception and contraception advice, which statistically we know reduces abortion.  In Maine, because of the access to organizations like Planned Parenthood and other women's healthcare clinics, we have seen our teen pregnancy rate drop 58 percent in the last 20 years or so--58 percent. That is a significant reduction, and it is attributable, at least in some significant part, to the availability of the services provided by these organizations.  It has always struck me as ironic, in the extreme, that someone who says they are against abortion should be against an agency that provides contraception and family planning services that prevent pregnancy and therefore prevent abortion.  I subscribe to President Clinton's formulation that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. It should not be something that is chosen just casually--and of course it isn't. This is a terribly difficult decision for a women, but that is not the subject today. The subject today is curtailing the reimbursement for women's healthcare services to an organization or organizations that may also provide abortion services.  It is contrary to the very idea of trying to prevent abortion, but it is also denying healthcare services of choice to thousands of women in Maine and millions across the country.  I have sat in this body for 4 years and heard people talking about how consumers and patients should be able to choose their physicians, they should be able to choose their healthcare options. This was a basic principle. It is one of the arguments we have heard as we have been discussing other healthcare[[Page S1529]]issues in this body. This Congressional Review Act provision would take away that choice. I think that is a great disservice to those citizens, many of whom are low income, many of whom are covered by Medicaid, many of whom do not have private health insurance. To take this step that this resolution would entail would be very shortsighted, and I believe it is a violation of the rights of those people to choose their healthcare providers.  It also does not achieve the ends that the sponsors want to achieve. That is why I believe that this resolution--although it may be denominated as something to do with being anti-abortion, I think it is just the opposite. If this resolution passes and these healthcare centers under Title X, including Planned Parenthood, are unable to deliver these services, there will be more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions. I think that is a sad and unfortunate outcome to be perpetrated by people who say they are trying to oppose abortion.  Planned Parenthood provides women's healthcare services. It provides contraceptive services. I know the people in Maine who work for this agency, and I know this is a terribly controversial issue, but I believe that if what we want to do is minimize the number of abortions, then it makes no sense whatsoever to somehow indiscriminately strike out at the funding of the agencies that provide healthcare services.  Nobody in this body is talking about Federal funds for abortion. That is not what the issue is. If that were the issue, this would be an entirely different debate. The issue is taking reimbursement away from the Planned Parenthood clinic or Title X clinic for mammograms, cervical exams, or other women's healthcare services. Why would we want to do that in the name of achieving some other goal that won't even be achieved? In fact, it will be made a more widespread issue.  I hope the Senate will realize that whatever the motivation behind this provision is, it just makes no sense. It makes no sense from the point of view of preventing abortion. It makes no sense in terms of the taxpayers. Preventive services, contraceptive services, cost about $200 a patient; a Medicaid birth costs about $10,000. If it is a Medicaid patient, those are taxpayer dollars. We are talking about saving taxpayers money.  This goes to the healthcare system in general: Why would we want to undo prevention, whether prevention of unwanted pregnancies or prevention of a disease? Prevention is part of the solution to the healthcare crisis in this country because of the excessive cost.  Here is a specific case. Again, we are not talking about funding abortions. We are not talking about funding Planned We are not talking about funding these Title X health centers. We are talking about protecting them in terms of their reimbursement for women's health services delivered. That is what this vote is about. If you vote for this, you are voting to take away reimbursement for health services that are necessary to protect the health and well-being of women across this country.  I hope my colleagues will vote no on this resolution, and I believe it will serve the public and it will even serve those people who are concerned most deeply--and I understand--about abortion. If you want fewer abortions, fund Planned It seems to me that is a fairly clear correlation, and it is one we should respect. But we also should respect the rights, needs, and choices of those millions of women who rely on these clinics for their healthcare needs aside from the issue of reproductive rights, just straight healthcare needs. That is what this vote is all about.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

John McCarter, Jr., of Illinois has had a long and distinguished career. He was first appointed as a regent in 2009 and was elected chair in 2013. In addition, John has lent his expertise and wisdom to a number of the regents' other committees.  During his tenure, John has overseen a number of important strategic initiatives, including the search for the Smithsonian's 13th secretary; the development of the Institution's relationship with the Victoria & Albert Museum in London; the reopening of the Arts and Industries Building to the American public; and most recently, the opening of the National Museum of African American History and These opportunities will help to ensure the Smithsonian's continued success.  John also led the charge in reopening the historic Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall to the public. The building, shuttered since 2004, was reopened to the public for the secretary's installation ceremony in October 2015 and was the site of a very successful pop-up cultural exhibition over Memorial Day weekend in May 2016. John's vision and leadership have made this national treasure available to the American people once more.  A tireless advocate for the Smithsonian in his home State of Illinois, John has raised the institution's profile across the Nation and around the world. Thanks to his recruitment efforts, the Smithsonian advisory boards are more diverse, more dynamic, and more engaged than ever before. Through all of these initiatives, John has pushed the Smithsonian to be more ambitious and to renew its commitment to ``the increase and diffusion of knowledge.''  I want to thank John for his exceptional leadership as chairman of the board of regents, and I look forward to working with him through the remainder of his term as a regent.  Shirley Ann Jackson of New York is the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic She was appointed as a regent in 2005 and has served as board and executive committee vice chair since 2013.  Shirley was the regents' representative for the successful events that opened the Smithsonian's 19th museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, in September 2016. Alongside other notable guests, Shirley helped inaugurate the newest Smithsonian museum by delivering remarks at the museum's dedication ceremony. As she noted during her speech, the museum furthers ``the Smithsonian's founding mission, to promote `the increase and diffusion of knowledge,' by opening a museum dedicated to the African-American experience in the United States, and its crucial place in the American experience.''  Shirley has a remarkable life story: She was the first African-American woman to earn a doctorate from MIT, and since 1999, she has served as the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--marking the first time an African-American woman has led a top research university. She was also the first woman and the first African-American to serve as chair of the U.Nuclear Regulatory Shirley is emblematic of everything the Museum was founded to celebrate about the African-American experience, and we were proud to have her serve as the board's representative at all of the opening ceremonies.

As a trained physicist, she is particularly passionate about inspiring the next generation of scientists and conservationists. As vice chair, she has been a staunch advocate for the Smithsonian's scientific researchers, trumpeting their successes and inviting them to speak at She has made a point of going beyond the brick and mortar of the Smithsonian museums to visit the Smithsonian's many research centers, including the Smithsonian Tropical Research Center in  This past year, Secretary David Skorton tapped into Shirley's extensive leadership and management experience, asking her to cochair the institution's initiative to create a new strategic plan for 2017-2022.

10238,topic-id,1450,"Mr.President, I rise today to call for immediate action on the Miners Protection Today, as we sit here, 22,600 miners have received letters. This is a copy of the letter, and I am going to read it to you. This is a letter they received today letting them know their healthcare benefits will be terminated at the end of This letter basically says:       The UMWA 1993 Benefit Plan notified you in December 2016--  This is one of multiple letters they received. Can you imagine getting a 4-month extension? Then by law you have to have 90 days before they can terminate you. Every time you get an extension, within 30 days you get another letter saying you are going to be terminated. That is the inhumane treatment our retired miners and mostly widows are receiving--     that the U.Congress had passed the Continuing Health      Benefits for Miners Act, which provided for the transfer of      federal funds to the Plan to cover the health care benefits      you receive through April 30, 2017. The Plan cautioned that      further Congressional action would be necessary in order for      the Plan to provide health care coverage to you after April      30. At this time, Congress has not taken the action needed to      continue your benefits. Unless Congress acts before the end      of April, the 1993 Benefit Plan will not be able to provide      you with the health benefits that you have been receiving      from the 1993 Plan, and those benefits will terminate      effective May 1, 2017. In addition, your Funds' Health      Service Card will no longer be valid.  Can you imagine a 75- or 80-year-old woman--a lady, a widow--who has lost her husband, probably because of black lung, and all the work he did for our country and for himself and his family, and she has received that three times or more now--not knowing what in the world or why they can't do something that we promised, something that was done in 1946, where the Krug amendment and the Krug act basically said that we would take care of our miners so that they would have permanent healthcare and a pension. It was not done by taxpayers' dollars. It was done by the coal they mined. For every ton of coal, there would be so much set aside. Then we had the bankruptcy laws happen in the 1980s, which basically destroyed a lot of companies for paying into it. Then we had the crash of 2008, which took it further down.  Now we stand here today, and we have a fix coming out of the AML, the[[Page S1526]]abandoned mine lands, coming, again, from coal that was mined to pay for the miners' pension and benefit plan, and we can't get it done.  I will tell you, if that piece of legislation was allowed to be voted on tonight, we would have well over 60 votes, bipartisan. My Republican colleagues and all of our Democrat colleagues here understand the importance of the working people.  President Trump is speaking about this every time. Last night he shouted out to miners. I was so pleased. I have not heard that since I have been here--anyone saying: Thank you for the job you have done. We are not leaving you behind. You have given to this country the country we have, the superpower of the world. You have produced the energy through the toughest of times, and we appreciate that.  I was very, very appreciative to see that type of recognition. I can't tell you how much more appreciative I would be right now to see us as a bipartisan group--Democrats and Republicans--standing up for the working people that we talk about every day and saying: Listen, as to the pension guarantee act, which basic to the Miners Protection Act, we are going to pass that. We are going to put this aside. We don't have to worry about this anymore. We have done it.  That is all we are asking for. Everybody who has joined me in this journey understands that we are all fighting for the working people, which is what we were sent here to do, from your wonderful State of South Carolina to my beautiful State of West They depend on us. The retired miners are walking our halls. Maybe you have seen them. If not, I am sure they will come by and say hi to you. They are very appreciative of the consideration we are all giving them. They are hoping we finally get this done.  I am doing it for them and for their families and what they have done for our country. The 4-month extension is not even humane. I have said that. My reason for saying that is that these people can't comprehend it. I can assure you that, when I go back to my office after I leave the floor, I will get phone calls: Joe, they are going to take my healthcare again. What am I going to do?  I keep saying: Ma'am, please, trust us; hold tight.  We could have had this fixed before. We kicked the can down the road 4 months. Now I have been told--and we all seem to accept it--that they are going to do a permanent healthcare fix. I am appreciative of that. The bottom line is that we have pensions out there hanging, which is going to be a bigger albatross around us if we don't something, and we have a chance to fix it all and put that aside.  I spoke to President Trump, and I am hopeful that he will speak out on this, and he has spoken out. He has told me that he supports it.  I said: Please, Mr.President, speak to our friends on the other side--our leadership--and let them know how much you support this, and let us put this behind us because we can fix it once and for all.  We were told to get a legislative hearing, and we did that. We were told to go through regular order. We went to the Finance Committee, and it was passed out--bipartisan, overwhelmingly bipartisan.  I know we have the 60 votes. I was told we have to reintroduce it again. So here we are. I reintroduced it, and we have bipartisan support again. We are ready to go.  Why do we put these people through this type of agony? I don't know. We have so many other challenges, and we have to come together. This is one we have already agreed we are together on and can't move it.  I know you have always been a dear friend and supportive, and you know the hard work our people have done, and I appreciate that. However, it is time to act. It is time to get this done. If we wait until April, that is exactly when our continuing resolution is coming up, and, basically, we have no budget to work off of. So we have to do another extension until we can get something more permanent. They could get caught up in that CR again. We are going to say: We are sorry; we couldn't get it done, but we will give you another 2, 3, or 4 months.  I can't go home and continue to tell these wonderful people who have been so good and so patient that I am sorry, but we just have to wait another few months.  When is enough enough? When are those few months going to be up and we do the right thing? I am asking all of you; I am asking all of my colleagues: Please, this is one time when we can do something and feel good about it and go home over the weekend and go back to our constituents and tell them that this one is finished, that we fixed this.  I am asking for that vote. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same, to speak to the leaderships to make sure that we can move the miners protection and make sure the miners get the healthcare and the pension benefits they were guaranteed and they have been promised and which has been kept until now, and that we are not going to let them down.  With that, Mr.President, I thank you, and I thank all of my colleagues for the support we have been receiving. I am asking the majority leader to please let us have this vote and put it on the floor.

10402,topic-id,309,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Self-Insurance Protection Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. Restoring health care is more than one bill--our plan has always included a series of efforts to directly address the challenges facing our healthcare system. The challenges resulted from This legislation is one such effort, part of a series of measures to increase choice and access. This bill would make it easier for families to get health insurance from their employers.  As my colleagues have noted, more than 160 million Americans get their insurance from an employer. Of that, 60 percent of employers offering healthcare coverage are self-insured, meaning employers directly reimburse healthcare providers and employees for medical expenses. These self-insured plans provide more flexibility than traditional healthcare plans, as they can be designed and operated to meet the unique needs of workers and families. For many years, the company I led, in fact, was self-insured, and we bought stop-loss coverage.  For most self-insured employers, choosing to buy stop-loss insurance simply assists them in avoiding catastrophic losses. It is a business insurance policy. Regulating it like a traditional healthcare insurance would restrict access to self-insured plans dramatically.  We should be making it easier, not harder, for employers to offer their employees comprehensive health packages, and it certainly should not be left to an unelected bureaucrat to decide which types of plans or which benefits work for American families.  This legislation is a simple, straightforward approach to protect self-insured healthcare plans. It offers clarity, reaffirming longstanding policies recognizing that stop-loss insurance is a distinct business insurance and prevents bureaucrats from--one more time--tinkering with our economy and damaging health care.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, as it is an important measure to promote and to increase access to health care.

10248,topic-id,2581,"Mr.President, last night, President Trump began his speech with an appropriate reference to the anti-Semitic attacks that have occurred all over the country. Two bomb threats were called into a Jewish community center in the New Haven area in I visited that center and the staff and the kids of that center, who are now being housed in a nearby synagogue. He also condemned, in strong terms, the murder of a young man in Kansas City, the victim of an apparent hate crime, targeted for simply being a foreigner or being of a different religion. We can't know exactly what the reason was, but it was an attack based on hate.  I want to tell my colleagues a little bit about that young man, to begin with, as a means of, once again, coming to the floor of the Senate to tell my colleagues about the victims of gun violence in this country--the 86 or so[[Page S1531]]people every day who are taken by guns, suicides, and murders and accidental shootings; the 2,600 people a month whose lives are taken through gun violence, and the 31,000 a year. By the way, that number is just the number of people who are killed. Those are the lives that are eliminated. There are another 75,000 every year who are injured by gun fire, whose lives are irrevocably altered by that act of violence.  Srinivas Kuchibhotla was a 32-year-old engineer. He was working for He was just hanging out at a bar. It was Austin's Bar and Grill, and he was enjoying the company of friends. Witnesses saw a man enter the bar. He was agitated, and he was drunk. He was a patron of the bar. He had left and he reentered, and he began shooting at Srinivas and his friend. Witnesses say that the shooter told Srinivas to ``get out of my country'' before killing him and then critically injuring his friend and an unbelievably brave bystander who tried to stop the shooter.  Hundreds of grief-stricken family members and friends gathered in his hometown in India for this young man's funeral. In accordance with Hindu tradition, his body was carried on a carriage and his ashes were laid to rest. Friends said that his mother was absolutely wailing as the carriage went by.  His mother had wondered whether America was a safe place for her son. Months before the shooting, she asked him to return to India if he was feeling insecure, but he told her he was safe, that he was fine. His wife also wondered how safe it would be to stay in the United States, but she said that Srinivas always assured her that only good things could happen to good people.  He undoubtedly was a good person. His family members remember him as the kindest person you would meet. He was, in their words, ``full of love, care and compassion for everyone. He never uttered a word of hatred, simple gossip, or a careless comment.''  His friends and family members remember him as ``brilliant, well-mannered and simply an outstanding human being.''  He was ``a very sharp, top-of-his-class kind of guy,'' said one of his classmates at the University of Texas at El Paso where Srinivas earned a master's degree in electrical and electronic engineering. He was also an avid cricket player and a big fan of cricket as well.  He was 32 years old. He was sitting at a bar, enjoying time with his friends when a man who was at the bar, who probably saw Srinivas, thought that he looked different from him and, filled with hate, walked back into the bar and shot and killed him.  That is only one story from that day. On average, there are 85 other stories across the country in which people lose their lives to gunfire. What made me so mad last night was that after that moment--that appropriate moment in which President Trump talked about this horrible shooting--moments later, he referenced the daily slaughter that happens in our cities. He spoke in front of the joint session for, it seemed, nearly an hour and a half and offered absolutely no solutions to do anything about the cascading gun violence that is enveloping our  Irony of all ironies, the same week that he is lamenting, eulogizing Srinivas's death in Kansas City, he is signing a law passed by this body that would allow for more people with serious mental illness to get their hands on guns.  We don't know the full story of Adam Purinton yet, but you have to imagine that this was someone who was deeply disturbed. Maybe he was just drunk, but in order to decide to pull out a gun in a bar and shoot someone just because they look different than you do probably means that there is something going on--more than a few beers. Mr.Purinton probably had some stuff going on. He might have been mentally ill.  When I got here, I thought that one of the few things we agreed upon--Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives--was that if you were seriously mentally ill, you probably shouldn't be able to buy a weapon, not because people with a mental illness are inherently dangerous--that is not true at all--but because erring on the side of caution when it comes to someone who is seriously ill would probably be the safe thing to do. That used to be a bipartisan commitment.  A few weeks ago, this body passed a law to allow tens of thousands of people who have serious mental illness, who have been judged by a government agency to be so sick that they can't manage their own financial affairs, they literally can't cash a check, their Social Security check has to be sent to someone else because they can't manage their affairs--we passed a law to allow those people to buy guns.  Spare me your concern for the victims of gun violence if you are not willing to do anything about it and, in fact, you are going to take steps to make gun violence more likely rather than less likely in this country. So 31,000 people a year, 2,600 a month, 86 a day--there is no other country in the world in which this happens. There is no other country in the world in which these numbers of people are dying from guns. It is our fault because week after week, month after month, year after year, we do nothing about it, and now we are making it worse.  In the 4 years after Sandy Hook happened, I went back to tell people that we had done nothing. That was embarrassing enough. Now I have to go back to the families of Sandy Hook and tell people that when Congress thinks about gun violence, we think about making changes in the law to make gun violence more likely, to put more guns into the hands of dangerous people. We are going backward now.  Teresa Robertson owned a floral shop in a beauty shop in Fairfax, Fairfax is a really small town, a really tight-knit community. It is still on edge because about a week ago, Teresa's estranged husband walked into the store, started shooting at Teresa, and then barricaded himself inside city hall, firing shots at the local police, who returned fire, fatally killing Teresa's husband.  She had filed a protective order against her husband about 2 weeks before because she feared for her life. She filed for divorce a week later, and a week following that, he shot her.  Laws can protect against something like that, right? We have the power to stop that. In Connecticut, if you file a protective order against a spouse who you believe is going to harm you, the police have the ability to take those weapons away for the period of time in which you were adjudicating that protective order.  If that law had been in effect in Oklahoma, maybe Teresa Robertson would still be alive today and maybe her husband would still be alive and maybe their two kids--ages 13 and 16--wouldn't be without both of their parents.  The fact is, every single day, domestic partners--women primarily--are killed or are shot by boyfriends or estranged husbands. It often plays out just like this: protective order, divorce filing, murder. That is on us.  We have the ability to protect women from their estranged husbands. There are laws. We can't stop every shooting, but it certainly can cut down on these numbers.  Two days later, emergency responders found 26-year-old Michael ``Shane'' Watkins bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to the head on Berkshire Avenue in Bridgeport, He died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The police are still investigating the shooting, but they believe that Shane was an innocent victim of a robbery that went bad.  His friends said that Shane was someone who was always laughing, who was always smiling, who had a good heart, was a caring person. A neighbor said that Shane was ``always upbeat, always joking, always smiling.'' This was a good kid.  He was a dedicated family man. He was a long time employee of the local Stop & He was 26 years old. This was a robbery gone bad. Shane Watkins was one of those 86.  Twelve-year-old Kanari Gentry Bowers was playing basketball with friends in Chicago, IL, at Henderson Elementary A stray bullet hit her on February 11. For 4 awful, agonizing days, Kanari sat lying unconscious in the hospital with a bullet lodged in her 12-year-old spine before she died on February 15.  Her family released a statement that said: ``Please keep your children close and do whatever it takes to protect them from the senseless gun violence in our city.''[[Page S1532]]  That doesn't sound exceptional, does it? ``Please keep your children close and do whatever it takes to protect them.'' Think about that idea. Think about the idea that you can't let your children get far away from you in Chicago today because they are not at risk of getting lost; they are at risk of being shot.  The little girl had dreams of becoming a judge. That is not something that a lot of 12-year-old girls are thinking about, but Kanari wanted to be a judge. She was described as a vivacious young girl.  I hear President Trump talk about Chicago all the time. He talks about Chicago as though he cares, but he doesn't propose anything that would reduce the trajectory of gun violence, the horror of living in neighborhoods that you can't let your child stray more than a few feet from you without fearing for their lives. He has proposed nothing to do with making that city safer.  People say Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the Nation, yet it is one of the most violent places. Exactly, exactly: Chicago has some of the toughest gun laws in the New York City has some of the toughest gun laws in the They are still violent places. Why? Because the vast majority of guns in those cities, the illegal guns that spread throughout the city like poison ivy come from outside of They come from In New York, they come from South They come from North They come from places in which it is easy to buy a gun without a background check at a gun show or on the internet. They flow into these cities and become used in murder after murder.  If you don't have a Federal requirement that background checks have to be conducted wherever you buy a gun, no matter how strong the laws of Chicago are, they can't be protected; 12-year-old girls can't be protected.  This was all in February, by the way. This was all in the last 3 weeks.  On February 20, some friends got together at a local church in Pomona, CA, and all of a sudden, gunshots started firing through the windows and the walls of this church--a drive-by shooting.  You know who was dead at the end of that? An 8-year-old little boy named He was adopted from an orphanage in He had been in the United States for only 3 years. His adoptive parents and his friends--you should read what they say about this kid: ``He had an infectious smile and loved everyone and everything.''  He was still learning English, but with his playful demeanor, he had adapted almost immediately to life in the United He loved wrestling with his adoptive dad, running, laughing. He loved superheroes. He was always injuring himself jumping off of something. He loved living in this country.  He was a 5-year-old in an orphanage in Taiwan, and then he was in the United States with a dad and with superhero action figures, and now he is dead because somebody fired bullets randomly into a church in Pomona,  Why don't we do anything about this? We are not so coldhearted as to be unable to understand what life is like for a mom and a dad who lose an 8-year-old child. We are not so brain-dead as to not be able to comprehend the fact that every time someone is shot, there are at least 20 people whose lives are permanently altered.  The post-traumatic stress involved in one shooting has enormous ripple effects. I have talked at length on this floor about the constant grief that envelopes my town of Sandy Hook because of what happened there. It will never end.  Now, instead of defending the status quo, we are talking about making it easier for deeply mentally ill people to get guns. A bill was just introduced on the floor of the Senate this week that would allow for someone to carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the Nation, regardless of what that local State jurisdiction wanted. If you had a concealed weapon permit in Texas, you would be able to walk into Manhattan without any way for the local police to check you out. There is even an effort to make silencers legal.  Mr.President, 31,000 a year, 2,600 a month, 86 a day. I have come down to the floor I don't know how many times--certainly not as many as Senator Whitehouse but many times to tell the stories of the victims. I told a few more this afternoon because if the data doesn't move you--again, only in this country; in no other country in the world does this happen--then maybe the stories of these victims will move you. Maybe being able to put yourself in the shoes of a mom who lost a child, of a husband who lost a wife way before their time, will move you to action.  This is only controversial here. Ninety percent of the American public wants us to move forward with the universal background checks. The majority of Americans think these super-powerful military weapons should stay in the hands of the military and law enforcement. Everybody out there wants to give law enforcement the tools and the funding necessary to carry out the existing law. It is not controversial out in the American public; it is only controversial here.  It is about time that we do something about this epic level of carnage that continues to plague our Nation and have some response to these voices of victims that seem endless.  I yield the floor.

10241,topic-id,633,"Mr.President, thank you, and thank you to some of my colleagues who are going to be joining me on the floor this afternoon.  The day after President Trump was inaugurated was one of the most inspiring I have ever gotten a chance to be part of. Millions of people, men and women, marched in Seattle, in Washington, DC, and in cities and towns in between. They carried signs, they chanted, and they made it absolutely undeniably clear that when it comes to women's rights and healthcare, people across the country do not want to go backward. Since then, they have continued to speak up and stand up.  But we are here today because Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress simply are not getting the message. I want to discuss one crucial example in particular--the possibility that in a matter of days, Senate Republicans could roll back a rule protecting family planning providers from being discriminated against and denied Federal funding.  Let me start by explaining a bit about what family planning providers mean to our community. These providers--part of the Title X program, which has bipartisan history--deliver critical healthcare services nationwide but are especially needed in rural and frontier areas. In 2015 alone, Title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing, to more than 4 million low-income women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers. In my home State of Washington, tens of thousands of patients are able to receive care at these centers each year. They often have nowhere else to turn for healthcare. In fact, 4 out of 10 woman who receive care at health centers funded by Title X consider it to be their only source of healthcare.  Taking resources away from these providers would be cruel. It would have the greatest impact on women and families who are most in need. But that is exactly what the law passed in the House, which is now on its way to the Senate, would mean. It would undo a valuable effort by the Obama administration to ensure that healthcare providers are evaluated for Federal funding based on their ability to provide the services in question, not ideology. In doing so, the bill would make it even easier for States, led by extreme politicians, to deny family planning providers Federal funding, not because of the quality of the care they provide or the value to the communities they serve but based on whether the politicians in charge agree that women should be able to exercise their constitutionally protected rights to safe, legal abortion.[[Page S1527]]  It is the 21st century. It is time for politicians to stop telling women what they can and can't do with their own bodies. That is what the women and men who have been marching and speaking up all over our country believe. That is what I believe. It is what Democrats believe.  If Leader McConnell thinks he can rush this harmful legislative effort through without a fight, we are here to say he is wrong. He can expect Democrats and maybe even some Republicans who are concerned about losing healthcare providers in their own States to fight back. So today I am calling on the leader to commit right now to drop this effort and agree not to bring this bill to the floor. It is well past time that extreme Republicans end their damaging political attacks on women. I think the opportunity to start that is right this minute. So we urge him to take this action and not bring this to the floor. We want him to know that we are going to fight back every step of the way if he does.  I yield the floor.

Nat defined himself as a ``Jewish, atheist, civil libertarian, left-wing pro-lifer.'' A writer for the Village Voice and brilliant jazz critic, he joined forces with constituents across political, ideological, and religious spectrums if he believed he shared common ground with them.  He was not afraid to alienate his fellow liberals by agreeing with pro-life heretics, as he once jokingly called them, nor was he afraid to speak to crowds of Christian pro-lifers, even when many of them said being atheist and pro-life were mutually exclusive.  Rather than worry about their judgment, he cared too much about fairness and equality to remain silent. He was more concerned with expressing what he believed to be true: that the unborn have great potential and that, with their own unique genetic code, they are human persons with as much a right to life as any of us.

10253,topic-id,983,"To answer that question, I would begin by reminding everyone that when we are talking about Russia, we are not talking about the Russian people. We are talking about Vladimir Putin and the cronies who surround him and their goals for the future. We have no quarrel with the Russian people, who I actually believe would very much want to have a better relationship with the United States and certainly live in a world in which their country was more like ours than the way their government now runs theirs.  The second thing I would point to is, it is important to understand history. At the end of the Second World War, Nazism had been conquered, and the Japanese Empire and its designs had also been ended, fascism defeated. The United States and the world entered this period of a Cold War, a battle between communism and the free world. The United States and our allies stood for that freedom. At the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet bloc, the fall of communism, the world we all hoped had entered into this new era, where every nation had a different system--maybe some had a parliamentary system, maybe some had a republic, such as ours--but in the end, more people than ever would have access to a government responsive to their needs.  That was the growing trend around the world, up until about 7, 8, 10 years ago. We now see the opposite. We see a rising arc of the totalitarianism, and within that context is where I believe Vladimir Putin's world view is constructed. He views the values we stand for, which some may call Western values, and perhaps that is the right terminology, but I really believe in universal values: the idea that people should have a role to play in choosing their leader, that people should have a freedom to worship as they see fit, that people should be able to express their opinions and ideas freely without fear of retribution or punishment by the government.  These are the values I think we have stood for and that our allies have stood for and that we had hoped Russia would stand for in this new era, but Vladimir Putin viewed that as a threat. In particular, over the last number of years, he has decided the best way for him to secure his place in Russian politics is through an aggressive foreign policy in which he views it as a zero-sum game.  That is not the way we view it. We actually view the world as a place where we can help rebuild Japan; we can help rebuild They are stronger, and we are stronger. It isn't one or the other.  He does not see it that way. He views the world as a place where in order for Russia to be greater, America has to be less; in order for him to be more powerful, we have to be less powerful, and it is a world in which he has to undermine democratic principles and try to expose them as fraudulent.  That is why you saw the Russian intelligence services meddle in our elections in 2016. One of the main designs they had was to create doubt and instability about our system of government and to not just discredit it here at home but to discredit it around the world.  I just returned from Europe a week ago. Germany and France, which both have upcoming elections of their own, are seeing an unprecedented wave of active measures on the part of Russian intelligence to try to influence their elections. In the Netherlands, we have seen some of the same. So this is very concerning.  Our European allies are very concerned about the weaponization of cyber technology to strategically place information in the public domain for purposes of undermining candidates, steering elections, and undermining policymaking.  I want everybody to understand this is not just about elections. The exact same tools they used in the 2016 Presidential election, they could use to try to influence the debate in the Senate by attacking individual Senators or individual viewpoints and using their control over propaganda to begin to spread that.  I will give you just one example, and that is in May of 2015, the German intelligence agencies reported an attack on the German Parliament, on energy companies, on universities. They attribute that to Russian hackers.  In Montenegro, the Prime Minister has sought membership in NATO, an action we have supported in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which both of us serve on, but Russian intelligence has plotted at a very aggressive level to disrupt their elections late last year.  Moscow has used TV and Internet outlets like Russia Today, or RT, and Sputnik to launch propaganda campaigns to galvanize anti-EU extremists ahead of the Dutch elections. The list goes on and on. There is no shortage of them.  The point is, we are in the midst of the most aggressive, active measures ever undertaken by a foreign government to not just meddle in American policy debates and American elections but in those throughout the free world, and it is deeply concerning.  I think another matter that I would love to hear the Senator's opinion on is on the issue of human rights violations because, on top of being a totalitarian state, what goes hand in hand with totalitarianism are human rights violations. In fact, totalitarianism is, in and of itself, a human rights violation; that there can be no dictatorship, no repressive regime, no totalitarian leader who can maintain themselves in power without violating the human rights of their people.  So I would ask the Senator--I would love to have his comment on whether or not, indeed, Vladimir Putin is a serial human rights violator and what our policy should be in terms of outlining that to the world.

10255,topic-id,617,"That is the central question. The first is what we are doing now, which is an important part: shining the sunlight on all of it, making people aware of it. For example, we know in France two of the leading candidates have views that I think the Kremlin would be quite pleased with, if that became the foreign policy of France--a third, not so much. He is a very young candidate running as an independent. His last name Suddenly, as he began to surge in the polls, all these stories started appearing, ridiculous stories about his personal life, about his marriage, things that are completely false, completely fabricated. Fortunately, French society and the French press understands this and has reported it as such.  It is important for us. This is happening and is real, and it is unprecedented in its scope and in its aggression. So shining a light on the reality and understanding, as I always tell my colleagues--I said this last October, that this is not a partisan issue.  I am telling you that--to my Republican colleagues who might be uncomfortable about discussing Russian interference--this is not about the outcome of the election; this is about the conduct and what happened throughout it. And what they did last year, in the fall, in the Presidential race, they can do against any Member here. If they don't like what you are saying, if they think you are getting too far on policy, you could find yourself the target of Russian propaganda in the hopes of undermining you, perhaps even having you eliminated from the debate because they understand our political process quite well.  The second is to do no harm. There is this notion out there--and I think on paper it sounds great, right--why don't we just partner up with the Russians to defeat ISIS and take on radicalism around the world.  The problem is this: 1, that is what Russia claims they are already doing. Vladimir Putin claims he is already doing that. So if he is already doing it, why would we have to partner with him? He is already doing it. Obviously, the answer is because he hasn't. This has been about propping up  Here is the other problem. When you partner up with someone, you have to take responsibility for everything they do and all the actions they undertake.  Senator Coons just outlined a moment ago, he said: Well, we talked about the bombing in  Think about it. If we had partnered with Russia in Syria and they were bombing Aleppo and they were hitting hospitals and they were killing civilians and they were our partners, we have to answer for that as well. We would be roped into that.  The third is to understand their strategic goal is not to defeat radical elements in the Middle East; their strategic goal is to have inordinate influence in Syria, with Iran, potentially in other countries at the expense of the United  We have had two Presidents--a Republican and a Democrat--previous to the current President who thought they could do such a deal with Vladimir Both of them fell on their face because they did not understand what they were dealing with. It is my sincerest hope that our current President doesn't make the same mistakes.  In addition to that, I know there are a number of legislative approaches that we have worked on together, as members of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, and I would ask the Senator from Delaware if he could highlight some of those legislative matters that we have been talking about: resolutions, laws, and public policy that we have been advocating.

10257,topic-id,847,"I thank the Senator for joining me in this endeavor here today. It is important that we speak out about this.  In a moment, the majority leader will be here with some procedural matters that will, I guess, take the Senate to a different posture.  Before that happens, I wanted to close by not just thanking him for being a part of this but by making a couple more points.  The first is, I want you to imagine for a moment, if you are sitting at the Kremlin and you are watching on satellite television the debate going on in American politics today, you are probably feeling pretty good about yourself. You have one group arguing that maybe the elections weren't legitimate because the Russians interfered. In essence, there have been news reports about a tension between the President and the Intelligence You have these reports every single day back and forth. You are looking at all this chaos, and you are saying to yourself: We did a pretty good job. If what we wanted to do was to divide the American people against each other, have them at each other's throats, arguing about things, and sowing chaos and instability into their political process, I think you look at the developments of the last 6 weeks and 6 months, and if you are in the Kremlin, you say: Well, our efforts have been pretty successful with that. I think that is the first thing we need to understand.  The second thing is, this should all be about partisanship. I am a member of the Senate Intelligence It is probably known that we are undertaking an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections. I want everyone to know--I speak for myself and I believe almost all of my colleagues when I say, on the one hand, I am not interested in being a part of a witch hunt; on the other hand, I will not be part of a coverup. We are going to get to the truth. We want to get to the truth. We want to be able to deliver to this body and to the American people a document with truth and facts, wherever they may lead us, because this is above political party. Our system of government and this extraordinary Republic has been around for over two centuries. It is unique and it is special, and with all of its blemishes and flaws, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.  I want people to think about that. The next time you wonder and say to yourself that things are so tough in America and things are going so poorly, well, with whom would you trade places? I am not saying we don't have problems, because we do, but I ask, in what country would you rather be? I promise you that you won't say China if you know anything about I promise you that you won't say Russia if you know anything about There is no nation on Earth we would trade places with, and there is no process of government I would trade for ours. It is not perfect.  One of the strengths of our system is our ability to stand up here in places like the Senate and discuss our differences and our problems and make continuous progress forward even if the pace is slower and more frustrating than we wish. That is what is at stake in this process and what is at stake in this debate. That is what none of us can allow to see erode because of interference by a foreign government, especially one that is a thug and war criminal in every sense of the word.  So our quarrel is not with the Russian people and it is not with I have extraordinary admiration for the Russian people. I have extraordinary admiration for the sacrifices and contributions they have made throughout history to our culture and to the world. But, unfortunately, today their government is run by an individual who has no respect for his own people and no respect for the freedom and liberty of others, and it is important for our policymakers on both sides of the aisle to be clear-eyed and clear-voiced in what we do moving forward.  I thank the Senator for being with us today and allowing us to engage in this discussion. I hope we will see more of that in the weeks and months to come so we can speak clearly and firmly in one voice that on issues involving America and our sovereignty and our system of government and decisions we must make, we will speak with one voice as one Nation, as one people, as one country.

10335,topic-id,905,"Mr.President, the House Republicans have finally unveiled their healthcare plan after nearly 8 years without a plan of their own.  TrumpCare is finally public, and each hour that goes by brings a new set of concerns and new groups that oppose the bill, from all places along the ideological spectrum. Even a growing number of conservatives are expressing their distaste for the legislation.  The fact of the matter is that TrumpCare is a mess. It will mean higher costs and less care for most When you look at the details, you can see that TrumpCare amounts to two separate systems of healthcare in America: cheaper healthcare for the rich, more expensive healthcare for everybody else.  Under TrumpCare, if you make more than $250,000 a year, you will get a huge tax break. The average is $200,000 a year, because most people are way above that $250,000. If you are in the middle class, the cost will increase by $1,500 annually, and by 2020, over $2,000 a year.  Let me repeat that. If you make over $250,000, your average tax break is $200,000. If you are in the middle class, your average increase in costs is $1,500 up. What kind of plan is that?  Donald Trump has talked about helping working The plan he has embraced, TrumpCare, helps the rich and hurts the average That is not surprising given all the other things they are doing the same way. This administration continues--and healthcare is part of that--to talk like populists but act like those helping the wealthy special interests time after time.  Let me repeat that. Under TrumpCare, if you make more than $250,000, you will get a tax break on average of $200,000 a year. If you are in the middle class, the cost will increase by about $1,500 annually, and after 2020, by $2,000 a year.  TrumpCare is a healthcare handout for the wealthiest Americans and fake healthcare for everybody else. Under TrumpCare, if you are a member of the Trump Cabinet--stocked with billionaires--you are going to get a tax break, but if you are 60 years old, on the cusp of retirement but still waiting because you are not yet eligible for Medicare, TrumpCare would allow insurers to charge you more simply because of your age--discrimination against the elderly, against those 50 to 65, who have worked so hard but don't yet have That is wrong.  If you are between 55 and 64, the total cost for you will increase $5,269 a year. Let me repeat that. If you are between 55 and 64, the total cost would increase by $5,269 a year. That is only the next 2 years. By 2020, it goes up to $6,000 a year.  For a working family, they can't afford that. What is this all about? They said it would be better care and cost less. It is worse care and it costs more.  How about this? Under TrumpCare, a wealthy insurance executive making over $500,000 a year is allowed a tax break. If you are struggling to make it into the middle class with an income of 250 percent below the poverty line, your costs are going to go up by nearly $3,000 a year, and by 2020, $4,000 a year--once again, helping the wealthy special interests, in this case insurance executives, and hurting those struggling, climbing the ladder to get into the middle class.  If you are a working mother and you get healthcare from Planned Parenthood, too bad, TrumpCare cuts all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood for a year.  I am wearing my red tie today to honor the Day Without Unfortunately, TrumpCare is the healthcare bill that forgot about women. Women are an essential part of our workforce in They ought to be able to go to the doctor or provider of their choice, even if that is Planned  When you look at the fine print of this bill, it has jagged edges. TrumpCare shifts the costs and burdens from the wealthy to the poor, from the insurance executive to the middle-class family.  The more Americans hear about this plan, the less they are going to like it. They were already against repeal before this plan came out. Can you imagine what is going to happen now as they read the details? I believe the Congressional Budget Office, when they score it, will ultimately show America everything America needs to know--how this bill would likely hurt overall coverage numbers and affordability and, at the same time, explode the deficit.  You are getting worse healthcare and increasing the deficit. What kind of combination is that? No wonder the Republican leadership in the House is trying to rush through the bill even without a score. They don't want the American people to see it. I don't think they even want their own Members to have a chance to study it because it is a near certainty that this bill will cause millions to lose insurance as well as blow a gigantic hole in the Federal budget.  In conclusion, it is reckless for Republicans to make Congress vote on this mess of a plan before we have those answers from Simply put, TrumpCare is a mess for the American people. We Democrats will fight it tooth and nail.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

10242,topic-id,1134,"Mr.President, I came to the floor to join my colleague and friend Senator Murray to say that I, too, am ready for this fight to oppose S.13, which would allow the discrimination against Title X family planning providers. This is a misguided measure that would leave millions of women and families with fewer healthcare options. It would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary and preventative health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and HIV testing.  Make no mistake, as Senator Murray said, the primary target of this legislation is Planned For years now, Republican leaders in Congress have tried to keep women from choosing Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider--this at a time when Planned Parenthood serves millions of women nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in New Hampshire, my home Most of the women in New Hampshire have incomes below or near the poverty line. Many of those women live in rural areas where they don't have other options for healthcare coverage.  The sad irony of this attack on Planned Parenthood is that study after study has shown that cutting back access to birth control and to other family planning methods actually increases the number of abortions. So I understand that opponents are interested in supporting this legislation because they think Planned Parenthood provides abortions, but the coverage Planned Parenthood is providing to women in New Hampshire and across this country with Federal dollars does not allow for abortions. So what we are doing is taking away women's access to contraception and to other family planning services and saying: You have no choice now.  More than ever right now, facts matter. Research matters. Talking away women's access to birth control and family planning will lead to more abortions, not fewer abortions. Yet this legislation is part and parcel of a broader national campaign against Planned Parenthood, whose clinics have been the target of vilification, of threats, and of violence. In October of last year, the Planned Parenthood clinic in Claremont, NH, was vandalized not once but twice. The second attack, a breaking-and-entering incident, caused extensive damage. It forced the clinic to close for 5 weeks.  I have great admiration for the courage of doctors and other healthcare providers at the Claremont clinic. Despite threats and attacks, they are determined to continue serving women across the Connecticut River Valley, many of whom have no alternative to the Claremont clinic. They are typical of the dedicated healthcare professionals at Planned Parenthood clinics all across our country.  The good news is that, according to poll after poll, the American people across the political spectrum--from Independents, to Libertarians, to Democrats, to Republicans--strongly support Planned Parenthood and oppose efforts to take away women's ability to choose Planned Parenthood as their healthcare provider.  At last night's Presidential address to Congress, I was honored to have as my guest Jennifer Frizzell of Planned Parenthood of Northern New Jen knows exactly what is at stake for women if President Trump and Republican leaders succeed in closing hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics across the United  So let's be clear again: Supporting family planning clinics is not about abortion, which by law is never funded by taxpayer dollars--something that I think is often misrepresented by some of our colleagues here in What this is about is ensuring that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need. For 40 percent of women, their visits to a family planning center is the only care they receive annually. In 2015 alone, Title X provided basic primary and preventive healthcare services, such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and HIV testing, to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health centers.  I am sure that every one of our colleagues is receiving letters and emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are pleading with us not to take away their access to Planned Parenthood and the healthcare they trust and depend on.  I received this message from Caitlin Parnell of Hampstead, She said:       As a young mother of a 2-year-old, my husband and I knew we      wanted to wait to have more children. We were both working      full time but barely making ends meet. The companies we      worked for offered health insurance, but they were small      companies, and the monthly cost was well more than we could      afford. So we went without. With no insurance, I turned to      Planned Parenthood for birth control. With the sliding pay      scale, I was able to get exams and birth control within my      budget. We were able to decide the best time to have more      children, which also allowed us to responsibly manage our      finances as well. An unplanned pregnancy at that point would      have destroyed the little financial stability we had. I don't      know where our family would be without Planned  Karla Canderhoof is a stay-at-home mother in Newfields, She wrote this:       After being diagnosed with ovarian cyst issues that caused      debilitating pain, I turned to Planned Parenthood for      treatment. In my case, the treatment for ovarian cysts was      birth control. At the time (during my college years) I could      not afford the cost of birth control due to my lack of      insurance. But Planned Parenthood gave me birth control free      of charge.  Amanda Arel of Rochester, NH, sent this message:       During the ages of 22 to 25, I utilized Planned Parenthood      for my annual exams and birth control. As I did not have      insurance and was in college, I was not able to afford most      medical care. Planned Parenthood not only provided me with      essential care, they made it very comfortable for me and were      very knowledgeable and answered any questions I had. They      provided birth control for me that, if it wasn't for them,      I would not have been able to get, at a cost I could      afford.  I still support Planned Parenthood because they provide safe, affordable healthcare for all, and that is so important.  We need to listen to our constituents, those who are speaking out in passionate support of Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics.  As Senator Murray said so eloquently, this is about respecting women's access to healthcare services, including those millions of vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn for essential care. This is also about respecting women's constitutionally protected right to make our own reproductive choices. We must not allow Congress to strip away Federal investments in family planning clinics by allowing States to discriminate against providers like Planned  I urge our Republican colleagues, don't bring S.13 to the floor. If it does come to the floor, I certainly intend to join in the fight with my colleagues--Senator Murray, Senator Blumenthal, and so many other Democrats and, I believe, Republicans--to defeat this legislation.

10400,topic-id,287,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1304, the Self-Insurance Protection I thank my good friend, Phil Roe, for his leadership and insights on this issue.                              {time}  1500  As the Affordable Care Act continues its death spiral--and indeed it does, very clearly, and ultimately will leave people without insurance--too many small businesses in the process and working families in my district have been left without real options for healthcare coverage that they can afford.  Self-insured plans are one solution that small businesses have tried to push back against these rising costs. These policies provide employers flexibility to design a healthcare plan tailored to the unique needs of their workers and their families. Last year, over 60 percent of employers who offered healthcare coverage utilized self-insured plans.  Unfortunately, the previous administration pursued regulations that would jeopardize access to self-insured plans by redefining stop-loss insurance as traditional health insurance under Federal law. Stop-loss insurance does not pay our medical claims; rather, it is a tool--I remind you--that simply provides protections for employers to guard against a catastrophic medical claim.  Mr.Speaker, our constituents need more affordable healthcare options, not fewer; and the bill before us will stop any future administration from putting harmful limitations on self-insured plans. To achieve meaningful healthcare reform, we must promote flexibility and innovative options, not curtail them.  H.1304 provides much-needed certainty to the workers and employers who access quality care through self-insured healthcare plans. As employers and their employees look to plan for the future, the Self-Insurance Protection Act will help provide some long-term certainty that these affordable health insurance options are available. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and promoting healthcare choice for American workers and for their employers.

10247,topic-id,1835,"Mr.President, I am here today for the 158th time to ask this Chamber to wake up to the mounting evidence of climate change. The sad truth is that, in Congress anyway, this issue has turned starkly partisan thanks to a torrent of dark political money that the fossil fuel industry uses to both threaten and reward the Republican Party in a dirty, dark money game of stick-and-carrot. Republicans in Congress ignore climate change for the simple reason that the fossil fuel industry has become their political life support system. It does not have to be this way.  Outside this Chamber, even Republicans see things very differently. In the investment sector, where people have to make decisions based on real facts and where duties to shareholders limit overly creative accounting, the Republican signal is clear.  An impressive group of Republican former Treasury Secretaries and Republican former Presidential economic advisers recently proposed a conservative, market-based climate solution. Republican Presidents trusted these folks with the conduct of the U.economy. Jim Baker was Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan, Hank Paulson was Secretary of the Treasury under President George Bush, and George Shultz was Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon, in addition to other distinguished offices that they held. Joining those three were Martin Feldstein, Chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, and Greg Mankiw, who held that position for President George Bush; Rob Walton, the former chairman of the board of Walmart, the world's largest retailer and employer; and Tom Stephenson from Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm out in Silicon This Republican group proposed a ``carbon dividends'' plan. It combines a carbon tax on fossil fuels--which reflects harm from carbon emissions which market economics ordinarily requires to be built into the price of the product--with a big dividend returning all of the revenues to the American people, and a reduction of regulations, which may be mooted by a good enough carbon fee. This idea is actually not so different from my own American Opportunity Carbon Fee  In their report, they all note that the ``mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong to ignore.'' Many would say that it grew too strong to ignore a good decade ago, but it is important that these Republican leaders have acknowledged this.  They also said: ``Economists are nearly unanimous in their belief that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce carbon emissions.''  This report lines up with many other Republicans outside Congress who support a revenue-neutral carbon fee. It is the favorite climate solution in conservative economic circles. Indeed, it is the only widely accepted climate solution among  The Niskanen Center, a Libertarian think tank that spun off from the Cato Institute, last month wrote this:       The case for climate action is now so strong that one would      be hard-pressed to find a serious academic economist who      opposes using market forces to manage the damage done by      greenhouse emissions.  Like the Treasury Secretaries, economists and investors throughout the financial community are saying loud and clear: We can no longer ignore climate change.  Goldman Sachs, for instance, in 2015 did a report on the low-carbon economy. It was called: ``Goldman Sachs equity investor's guide to a low carbon world, 2015-2025.'' So unless somebody here is going to say that Goldman Sachs is in on the hoax, Goldman Sachs is taking this pretty seriously.  Last year, the investment firm BlackRock, with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, issued a report titled: ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.''  I don't think investors trust $1 trillion to a firm that falls for hoaxes. BlackRock, like Goldman, knows that climate change is real and is helping its investors plan for the economic fallout.  BlackRock warns in its report: ``Investors can no longer ignore climate[[Page S1530]]change. . . .'' Parenthetical editorial comment: That is the job of Republicans in  BlackRock also had something to say about a price on carbon. They said this: ``Higher carbon pricing would help address [externalities from fossil fuels] and would be the most cost-effective way for countries to meet their Paris agreement pledges.''  So in the real world, where real decisions are being made by very smart people backed by real money, they are telling their clients: You must take climate change seriously, and you must take carbon pricing seriously.  The BlackRock report had this data on prices that companies are setting on carbon internally--in their own internal accounting--across sectors, including healthcare and energy and utilities. As we can see, the price per metric ton ranges from a low of about $10 in information technology, up to over $350 per metric ton--internal costs of carbon accounting in these industries.  The point ought to be pretty clear. The business community is acting, investors are insisting on it, and a price on carbon is a key part of the program.  The legendary Wayne Gretsky's rule was to ``skate to where the puck is going to be.'' These major firms recognize where the carbon economy is heading. We should too. We would, if it weren't for the political mischief wreaked in Congress by the fossil fuel industry.  BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are not alone. The insurance and reinsurance industry is one of the world's biggest investors, as well as one of the world's best analyzers of risk. Munich Re and Swiss Re, and others in property casualty and reinsurance, warn us that climate change is real and portends huge costs for society. Munich Re's head of risk accumulation in the United States said in 2015: ``As a nation, we need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as we see greater variability and volatility in our climate.''  One of the biggest investors in the housing market is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Freddie Mac has warned about climate change impact on the real estate sector: ``The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis of the great recession.''  When we think of what we went through in the housing crisis of the great recession, wow, Freddie Mac is warning that the economic losses and social disruption from climate change in our housing markets are likely to be worse.  These are all serious investors and they have serious warnings for us, and ignoring all of them just to please fossil fuel industry patrons is a big, big mistake.  Even President Trump's nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, thinks we need action. For years, his law firm has encouraged clients, including ExxonMobil, to disclose climate change-related risks to the SEC and to investors. If he is confirmed, I hope he will enforce the SEC's existing disclosure requirements for climate risk and clarify that public disclosures should include asset valuations based on global compliance with international treaties. Investors need climate change risks disclosed against a ``reality check'' baseline that assumes international compliance with the Paris climate commitments. An assumption that we fail should not be acceptable.  Slowly, investor disclosures are improving. Last year, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman forced Peabody Energy to restate its disclosures. Just last week, Chevron acknowledged to its investors in an SEC filing that, lo and behold, some of its products ``may be considered pollutants,'' noted ``new conclusions about the effects of the company's operations on human health or the environment,'' and they acknowledged ``an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against the company.''  It is better late than never, I suppose. Now it is time for the rest of the industry to report fully and fairly, first on the risks that shareholders bear from assets that are wrongly valued now--that are falsely valued in their reports--and, second, on the company's potentially culpable behavior in climate denial.  Institutional investors are joining in those efforts. Our Rhode Island pension fund, managed by our treasurer, Seth Magaziner, is pushing for greater transparency on political and lobbying spending at large energy companies like Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and For the resolution filed at ConocoPhillips, Rhode Island was joined by over 20 other cofilers, including the State of Connecticut, Senator Murphy's home State, whom I see here on the floor.  Just recently, the G20 nations--the 20 biggest economies in the world--set up a group called the Task Force on Climate-related Financial It is made up of 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies, and accounting and consulting firms--you know, liberal extremists. And they are saying: Here it comes; let's get ready. They have asked that companies begin to come clean on the climate risk they face.  The big energy companies need to come clean on how much they are spending to deny climate science and where they are spending it, because, ultimately, it is their own investors who will be hurt by their irresponsibility. Ultimately, all the phony climate denial they pay for is a fool's errand because the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology aren't going away, and a day of reckoning for all this mischief and nonsense they have paid for inevitably will come.  We in the Senate have a duty to the American people to find a way to combat climate change. I realize this body will need help in that task. We will need help from the business community, which can apply its understanding of market forces and risk analysis to this challenge. It would help if the fossil fuel industry would focus on the long term health of its shareholders rather than on short-term gain. The fossil fuel industry should stand down the relentless political opposition it has maintained to any climate solution, and it should stand down the phony climate denial operation it continues to support.  It will take all of us coming together--companies, investors, regulators, governments, citizens, Republicans and Democrats--to achieve Donald Trump's once-stated goal of combating the ``catastrophic and irreversible effects of climate change''--his quote: ``catastrophic and irreversible effects of climate change.''  I did not misquote President Trump, although he was Donald Trump then. It was 2009, and this full page advertisement was taken out in the New York Times declaring that the science of climate change was ``irrefutable'' and the consequences of climate change would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' It was signed by none other than Donald Trump, as well as his children, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka They were right then. If they get back to this, they will be right now.  The evidence and the science have only piled up since 2009. It is time for all of us to heed the advice of our universities, our scientists, and the people who actually know what they are talking about, and put the arguments of the fossil fuel industry where they belong--in the trash bin of history. We need to wake up before it is too late.  I yield the floor.

10181,topic-id,242,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to pay respects to an admired, respected, and visionary educator, and a genuinely terrific person, Billy Bert Baker, of Gilbert, Arkansas, who passed away on Friday, January 6, at the age of 84.  My relationship with Baker goes back decades. He was a family friend. After spending 17 years as a faculty member and administrator at my alma mater, Arkansas Tech, in 1974, he became the first employee of North Arkansas College in Harrison, served the college for more than 27 years, was its founding president, and retired at the age of 68.  Under his leadership, Northark achieved several firsts, one of the most noteworthy being the 1993 merger of Northark and Twin Lakes Technical College, the first consolidation of a community college and a technical college in Billy Bert was also instrumental in the creation of both Northwest Arkansas Community College in Bentonville and the ASU--Mountain Home campus.  Baker's own unofficial motto was to ``help people grow, one at a time.'' That is exactly what he spent his life doing. He touched the lives of thousands--made them better men and women--and his legacy continues to enrich the lives of people throughout northern and northwest Arkansas through the institutions of higher learning that he envisioned decades ago.  Rest in peace, My deepest condolences are with Bonnie, your wife of 63 years; your two sons, daughter, grandchildren; and the entire Northark family in this time of great loss.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-09-pt1-PgH200-2.txt,1991,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,9.0,March
