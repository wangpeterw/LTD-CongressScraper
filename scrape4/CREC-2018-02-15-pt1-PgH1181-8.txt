              PASS A DREAM ACT TO PROTECT DACA RECIPIENTS

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to share Miriam's DACA

story and continue to demand that House Republicans allow a vote on the 
Dream Act. Miriam was brought to Oregon by her parents when she was a 
little girl. She is grown and has not allowed her immigration status to 
deter her from working hard or pursuing her dreams.
  When DACA was established in 2012, it opened a path that was unknown 
to her and has allowed her passion to flourish. Miriam is currently a 
sophomore in college, and her future is full of hope. She dreams of one 
day holding public office here at home and hopes to work towards a 
career in either public schools or as a computer engineer in the 
healthcare sector. This is a young lady who is working hard, doing the 
right things to better herself, and who maintains goals that give back 
to her community and this amazing country that raised her.
  The sad reality is this Republican-controlled Congress and 
administration are holding Miriam's dreams hostage by not allowing a 
vote on the Dream Act. It is inhumane to continue to entangle the lives 
of these young folks in partisan games.
  Let's do the right thing. Let's get a Dream Act passed so that our 
country can move forward and protect the 800,000 DACA recipients.
