            AMERICA DOES NOT NEED THE STREAM PROTECTION RULE

  (Mr. CRAMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CRAMER. Madam Speaker, North Dakota does not need the stream 
protection rule and neither does the Nation. By passing this resolution 
today disapproving the Office of Surface Mining edict, we are 
responding to the cries of the American people who are tired of 
nationwide job-killing regulations from Washington.
  Madam Speaker, the Obama administration took nearly an entire term 
and over 10 million taxpayer dollars developing this job killer 
designed to prevent billions of dollars of coal reserves from ever 
being developed with absolutely no environmental benefit.
  Today's action prevents further destruction of jobs and low-cost 
energy for the American people.
  I urge the Senate to swiftly send this resolution to the President's 
desk.
