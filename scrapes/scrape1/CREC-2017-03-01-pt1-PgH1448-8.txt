                       REDDING VA LEASE APPROVAL

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, my district is home to nearly 60,000 men 
and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces, and many more 
are still serving today. Yet for too long, veterans have had trouble 
receiving veterans medical care in our area, instead being forced to 
travel to Sacramento or farther from places like Redding, Chico, or 
Yreka.

[[Page H1449]]

  So I am proud to announce that the Transportation Infrastructure 
Committee will authorize the VA to lease a new facility in Redding, 
California. This new lease will consolidate two buildings into one and 
will expand the regional VA square footage by over 50 percent in that 
consolidation, which will house an additional 17 mental health 
providers, a mammography division, and a second X-ray unit, 
significantly increasing the types of care available in Redding and in 
the north State.
  Taxpayers will put up the money for the facility. Now it is time for 
the VA to ensure that this facility is properly staffed and these tax 
dollars are not wasted and instead respected, and, most importantly, 
that our veterans are respected with timely care.
