812,topic-id,347,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share with you an inspiring story about a community rallying to honor one of our Nation's heroes. On September 12 of this year, Thomas Edward Hunter passed away at the wonderful age of 93.  He was a World War II veteran who served in Normandy and fought with our troops to liberate Europe from the Unfortunately, Mr.Hunter spent his final years mostly alone in a nursing home, and died without much close family. He literally outlived all of his siblings. He never married, nor had any children. As a result, he had no one to serve as pallbearers at his funeral.  Word of Mr.Hunter's passing reached the folks at Winnfield Senior High School, which is in a small community in rural north central Louisiana that I had the privilege of representing. After learning about Mr.Hunter's fate, six Winnfield football players--Matthew Harrell, Brett Jurek, Justin Lawson, T.Homan, Christian Evans, and Lee Estay--stepped up to serve as pallbearers for Mr. In addition, the folks at Southern Funeral Homes arranged for military honors, along with the flag and the playing of taps.  I am so inspired by the actions of Matthew, Brett, Justin, T.J., Christian, and Lee, as well as others in the community, who gave Mr.Hunter the hero's sendoff that he so deserved. They didn't know this man, but they knew that every veteran deserves to die with dignity and to be honored for the sacrifices they made for our great  Mr.Speaker, I think the actions of these men that you see in the photo to my left here speaks volumes of what is so truly important in our country: community, country, family,  Our flag and the Nation it stands for is special because of veterans like Thomas Hunter who answered the call to serve without question. Thousands have given their lives for that flag and this Nation, and they deserve our respect for their ultimate sacrifices.  These young men in Winnfield, they get that. They got that at this funeral. I think others in this country will learn from their wonderful example.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-25-pt1-PgH7437-4.txt,2244,RECOGNIZING THAT FOR 50 YEARS THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN,2017.0,25.0,September

Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects red blood cells and rapidly destroys sickle cells in the body. During an attack, victims can experience acute chest pain, stroke, and damage to vital organs like the kidneys and liver.  This disease is personal to me because, growing up, I watched my sister suffer from it. She was always in and out of the hospital. Oftentimes, the only resources we had to treat her were our family's love and support. This was devastating. My sister lost her battle at age 26.  But this doesn't have to be the story of others. While medical treatment and research for sickle cell anemia has evolved, it is imperative to support Federal funding for additional research and treatment opportunities.  I am a proud cosponsor of H.2410, the Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment  Mr.Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sickle Cell Awareness Day by not only supporting community efforts to treat patients with this disease, but by cosponsoring legislation that provides Federal resources to advance medical treatments for this disease.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgH7538-4.txt,2201,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,27.0,September

427,topic-id,950,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to explain my reason for the objection.  First, I would like to say to the Senator from Wisconsin that I am grateful for her work on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where she is a valuable, diligent, and constructive member. We work on a great many things together and have agreed to very many things. However, we disagree on this one, and here is why. Let me summarize it at the beginning of my remarks and then explain it with a little more detail.  No one who has a Perkins loan today loses that loan, period. So if you are a student anywhere in the country and you have a Perkins loan for this year, you don't lose that loan, period.  Second, no one who has a Perkins loan for next year loses that loan because no one has one. They were ended 2 years ago. Every student was told in his or her financial aid information that the Perkins Loan Program ends this year, so no one could expect to have one next year. No one has been granted one for next year, so no one who has a loan is losing a loan.  Why did we, in December of 2015--2 years ago--reach a bipartisan agreement to sunset, or end, the Perkins Loan Program in 2 years, which is the end of this week? In that agreement, we allowed graduate students to receive Perkins loans for 1 additional year and undergraduates to receive Perkins loans for 2 additional years. It was made clear at that time--2 years ago--that this was the last time the program would be extended, but we wanted to have a smooth transition, and we did not want students and colleges and universities to be surprised. That agreement, therefore, included many requirements for institutions of higher education to inform students over the last 2 years that the Perkins Loan Program would end on September 30 of this year, which is the end of this week. That agreement also set policies to make the sunsetting of Perkins loans as smooth as possible for students. The expiration of this loan program was not and should not have been a surprise. It has not received any appropriation since the year 2004, and the U.Department of Education reminded institutions that it was ending the program this year.  Now, why? Why are we ending the program? Why did we agree to do that 2 years ago, and why have the last three Presidents recommended that we end it--President Obama, President Trump, and President Bush?  The Department of Education estimated that in the 2016 to 2017 school year--that is the school year that just ended--the Perkins Loan Program provided less than $800 million in new Perkins loans to about 300,000 recipients. That may seem like a lot, but by comparison, the Department estimated that the Federal Government disbursed over $22 billion to almost 7 million undergraduate students in the Stafford Subsidized Loan Program, or the regular Direct Loan The Perkins loan--a separate loan--provides an average loan of roughly $2,000, and it illustrates the complicated mess in which students find themselves because of our Federal student aid system today.  The Perkins loans have a higher interest rate than other loans that are available to students today. The interest rate is 5 percent, compared with 4.45 percent for undergraduate loans. And students who have a Perkins loan aren't eligible for certain programs that exist for students with other loans, such as the income-based repayment programs and the public service loan forgiveness programs, which help students manage repayment of their loans. Those aren't available to students with a Perkins loan. The default rate for Perkins loans is higher than for the Stafford loan.  The bill which the Senator from Wisconsin has offered would cost taxpayers, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $900 million for a 2-year extension. If we were to extend the program over 10 years, it would cost $6.5 billion, according to the Congressional Budget The bill does not have an offset, so these billions of dollars would only serve to add to the $20 trillion Federal debt we already have.  I object because I think it is time for our country, through legislation by this Congress, to move on to a simplified Federal student aid program that has only one Federal loan for students, one Federal grant for students, and one work-study program for students.  As I have spoken often about on this floor, along with Senator Bennet from Colorado, we would like to reduce the application form for those Federal grants and loans called FAFSA--the dreaded FAFSA which 20 million students and their families fill out every year. We would like to reduce that from 108 questions to 2 or 5 or 10 questions.  We need a much simpler program for Federal student loans, and the end of the Perkins Loan Program is a small step toward that end.  As I mentioned, President Bush recommended that the program end, President Obama recommended that the program be changed and folded, in effect, into the regular Direct Student Loan Program, and President Trump has the same position.  I look forward to working with my colleagues, including the Senator from Wisconsin, on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act later this year, when we can work together to improve our Federal student loan programs and our grant programs, find ways to simplify them, make it easier and cheaper for students to attend college, and to help students pay those loans off, after they get them, in a fair and simpler way.

Of course I will be glad to work with the Senator from The fact is, 2 years ago we agreed to end the program. The graduate loans ended last year, and the undergraduate loans end this year. Everybody was told about it.  Every student who wants a loan can get a direct student loan from the government at a lower rate, with better repayment programs and better payment provisions than the Perkins loan. So no one is losing a loan, and everyone can get a better loan if they apply for a direct loan.  We do need a simpler program, and we need to simplify the application process for applying for the loans and grants and for paying them off.  I thank the Presiding  I yield the floor.

738,topic-id,701,"Mr.President, today the Senate will vote on the confirmation of William Emanuel to be a Member of the National Labor Relations Board, I am glad that we are moving this nomination because, once Mr.Emanuel is confirmed, we will have a full five-member National Labor Relations Board, which has not been the case in nearly 2 years.  The NLRB was created in 1935 by the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, which was significantly amended in 1947 by the Taft-Hartley It has the statutory mission to promote ``free flow of commerce'' by allowing employees to organize and bargain collectively.  The statute provides that ``employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities.'' The statute further provides that it is an unfair labor practice for unions to ``restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of their rights.''  After years of playing the role of advocate for organized labor, the new Board should return to the role of neutral umpire. Board partisanship did not start under President Obama, but it became worse under him. When the Board is too partisan, it creates instability in our Nation's workplaces and does not serve the intent of the law, which is stable labor relations and free flow of commerce. The Obama Board overturned numerous longstanding precedents that had been upheld for decades by both Republican and Democrat boards.  Under President Obama, the Board took three particularly harmful actions. First, the joint-employer decision, which was the biggest attack on the opportunity for small businessmen and women in this country to make their way into the middle class that anyone has seen in a long time--threatening to destroy the American Dream for owners of the nation's 780,000 franchise locations. Second, the ambush elections rule, which can force a union election before an employer and many employees even have a chance to figure out what is going on. This rule also forces employers to provide union organizers with a list of employees' telephone numbers, email addresses, employee work locations, shifts, and job classifications--highly personal information that many employees may not wish to share. Third was the microunion decision, which gave factions of employees within single businesses a path to forming their own unions. This decision risks fracturing workplaces and creating the potential for conflict and uncertainty among employees.  The Senate has the opportunity today to help reverse this harmful trend and bring stability to our Nation's workplaces by voting for William Emanuel and filling out the Board--again, for the first time in nearly 2 years. Mr.Emanuel is eminently qualified to serve on the He is currently a shareholder at Littler Mendelson in Los Angeles where he works on labor and employment matters. Mr.Emanuel has spent the entirety of his impressive career in the private sector, representing trade associations, hospitals and healthcare organizations, schools, as well as transportation, logistics, and manufacturing companies. Mr.Emanuel has previously represented his clients before the NLRB and has filed amicus briefs on behalf of trade associations.  Mr.Emanuel was nominated to be a member of the NLRB on June 29, 2017. The committee received Mr.Emanuel's HELP application on June 30. On July 6, the committee received Mr.Emanuel's Office of Government Ethics paperwork, including his public financial disclosure and ethics agreement. Based on these documents, OGE determined that Mr.Emanuel ``is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.''  We held Mr.Emanuel's hearing on July 13, and he completed all paperwork in accordance with the HELP Committee's rules, practices, and procedures.  Mr.Emanuel offered to meet with all HELP Committee members. Mr.Emanuel met with nine of them, including five Democratic members. Following the hearing, Mr.Emanuel responded to 62 questions for the record, QFRs, or 101 if you include subquestions, and those responses were provided to Senators prior to the markup. The HELP Committee favorably reported out Mr.Emanuel's nomination on July 19.  I look forward to voting for William Emanuel, who will serve on the National Labor Relations Board with distinction.

871,topic-id,2432,"Mr.President, in 1985, when I was Governor of Tennessee, I got a call from Don Hodel, the Secretary of the Interior for President He asked me to be the chairman of ORRRC 2, a follow-up (commission to the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission, which was led by Laurance Rockefeller a generation earlier. I agreed in part because of my love for the outdoors, but also because Don told me that Gil Grosvenor would serve as vice chairman of the commission and Pat Noonan would serve on the board.  The chance to work with them and the National Geographic Society made the request to serve as chairman of the commission even more attractive. My first act as chairman was to change the name from ORRRC 2 to the President's Commission on Americans The new name did a better job of conveying our mission: ``to look ahead for a generation and see what needs to be done for Americans to have appropriate places to do what they want to do outdoors.''  More than a generation has passed now, and on this 30th anniversary of the commission, we can look back on the recommendations of the report and take an assessment.  Overall, the commission found that ``outdoor recreation occurs close to home, in or near towns or cities where 80 percent of us soon will live. So, more and more, the solutions must be found close to home. We have concluded that the best way to assure that Americans will have adequate outdoor recreation opportunities is through a prairie fire of concern and investment, community by community. State and local governments will play a major role, but implementation of our recommendations ultimately will depend on the efforts of thousands of individual citizens, nonprofit organizations, and businesses.''  The idea that outdoor recreation occurs close to home was especially true for me.  I was one of the luckiest guys in the world growing up in Maryville, in Blount County,  When you grow up next to a national park, what do you do? You grow up in the park. You spent your weekends and special times there, and most all the memories I have are related to the  When I was 15, my dad dropped me off at Newfound Gap on the day after I was with two other boys in 3 feet of snow, and my dad said, ``I'll pick you up in Gatlinburg,'' which was 15 miles away. He did, later that afternoon.  Then, later that same year, we were in Spence Field, and we made an error in judgment. About 3 in the morning, I looked over, and I thought one of my bunkmates was moving around, but it turns out it was a bear. We left breakfast in our packs inside the tent, which is something you should never do and something I have never done since. These are memories that stick with us forever.  A generation earlier, in 1958, Congress created the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission to ensure America did not neglect its heritage of the outdoors. The commission was chaired by Laurance Like me, Laurance Rockefeller was fascinated with the natural world from a young age. His father, John Rockefeller, Jr., was an enthusiastic supporter of park-building and historic preservation. John Rockefeller, Jr., also had a hand in shaping my childhood outdoor memories.  1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park, carving the park out of land already owned by the Federal In the following years, Congress followed this model, protecting and preserving Federal acres out In the early 20th century, citizens in the eastern part of the country began to push for national parks of their own. However, the land was already privately owned and would need to be purchased and donated to the Federal Government before a park could be created.  In the late 1920s, $5 million was raised to create a new national park in the Smokies on the border of Tennessee and North The two States had appropriated $2 million each for the effort and combined that with $1 million in private donations, but that was only half the money needed to purchase the land that was needed to create the new park.  That is when John Rockefeller, Jr., stepped in and matched the money that had been raised with a donation of $5 million through the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Rockefeller's donation assured the purchase of the land and the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where I spent my childhood and still live next to today.  Nearly 25 years after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established, John Rockefeller, Jr.'s son worked with Congress to find solutions to continue to protect our Nation's treasures. The Rockefeller Commission advocated for a Federal national recreation policy ``to preserve, develop and make accessible to all Americans the resources needed for individual enjoyment and outdoor recreation.''  The Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System grew out of the recommendations of the report. Years later, the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors reaffirmed our commitment to these Federal programs, and we also took an important step forward by recommending policies that States, towns, and individuals could adopt. We focused on State and local action, calling for investments from communities around the country to help keep our outdoors great.  First, our commission recommended land trusts, ``private landowners recognizing the opportunity to provide expanded recreation resources and services to the public.'' Local land trusts have been one of the fastest growing conservation tools in the past 30 years. These local land trusts work with landowners who volunteer to preserve their property through conservation easements. According to the Land Trust Alliance's ``Land Trust Census,'' there are over 1,300 land trusts that are active in the United  These 1,300 national, State, and local land trusts have conserved more than 56 million acres as of the end of 2015, an increase of 9 million acres since 2010. In Tennessee, 15 active land trusts have protected nearly 900,000 acres throughout the In 1999, Jeanie Nelson and former Governor Phil Bredesen founded the land trust for In less than 20 years, the land trust has[[Page S6220]]protected over 100,000 acres of Tennessee landscapes. In 2015, the Foothills Land Conservancy, which ``is dedicated to protecting, preserving, and enhancing the lands and environments of the Southern Appalachian region,'' completed ``a record number 24 land partnerships totaling 7,215 acres'' spanning five States and seven Tennessee counties.  When our report came out 30 years ago, less than 5 million acres were protected by State and local land trusts. Today more than 20 million acres are protected by State and local land trusts. The explosion of state and local land trusts has greatly increased access to our country's outdoors.  Second, our commission recommended that ``local and state governments create a network of scenic byways, compose of scenic roadways and thoroughfares throughout the nation.'' We are seeing the benefits from that recommendation today. In 1991, Congress created the National Scenic Byways Program to recognize and protect roads for their archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational, and scenic value.  Today, according to the Federal Highway Administration, there are 150 designated National Scenic Byways and American Roads in 46 States throughout the Five of these national scenic byways pass through  In the 1980's, as Tennessee was building new highways to attract the auto industry, the State created 10,000 miles of State roads and scenic highways. These roads, marked with mockingbird signs, prohibited new billboards and new junkyards and allow people to enjoy the beauty of the state as they drive across the country. These scenic byways bring visitors to Tennessee and the beauty of our State keeps them coming back.  Third, we recommended that ``communities establish greenways, corridors of private and public recreation lands and waters, to provide people with access to open spaces close to where they live, and to link together the rural and urban spaces in the American landscape.'' Today, there are almost 1,000 greenways and trails in Tennessee that provide access to the outdoors to Tennesseans in their own communities.  A good national example of the popularity of greenways is the dramatic increase in rails-to-trails projects across the country. In communities throughout the Nation, unused railroad tracks and the land surrounding the tracks are sold or donated and converted into to new recreational trails.  According to the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, there are over 22,000 miles of open trails that were converted from previous railroad tracks and rights-of-way. In Tennessee, today there are over 30 rails-to-trails projects that cover 125 miles.  Fourth, we recommended full funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was first proposed in Laurance Rockefeller's The idea for the Land and Water Conservation Fund was very simple. It was to say, ``When we have an environmental burden, we should have an environmental benefit.'' If we are going to drill for oil offshore for example, that is an environmental burden. We said let's take some of those revenues and use them for an environmental benefit.  So since the 1960s, we have used oil and gas revenues to conserve important parts of Rocky Fork, in my home State of Tennessee, is an excellent example of the productive use of LWCF funding. Ten years ago, the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and the Conservation Fund began working with the U.Forest Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to protect Rocky Fork, a 10,000-acre tract in Tennessee within the Cherokee National  In 2015, working together and using Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars, Federal, State, and local partners saved the largest unprotected tract of land in the Southern Appalachians from development. To make sure everyone could enjoy this natural treasure, the State of Tennessee used some of the land to create the Rocky Fork State The State park--with its proximity to the Appalachian Trail, miles of native brook trout streams with cascades and waterfalls, historic battle site, Black Bear Reserve, significant wildlife habitat and scenic vistas--may 1 day be the State's most popular park. It wouldn't have been possible without tree Land and Water Conservation  As chairman, I also called on my fellow Governors to establish State-level outdoor commissions. Twenty-five States responded by establishing commissions or holding Governors' forums. Seven additional States had recently completed conferences on the topic in anticipation of a national study. The purpose of my call to the Nation's Governors was ``to stimulate action at the local and state levels on behalf of the outdoors. More than 2,000 people testified at hearings or participated in meetings sponsored by States in 1986.'' The Tennessee State-level outdoor commission, Tennesseans Outdoors, sought to ``look 40 years down the road, to consider what people will want to do outdoors, and to see that there will be places for them to do those things.''  The Tennessee Commission recommended setting aside special places throughout the State, making the most of the State's resources, ensuring a quality environment, spreading the word on the importance of the outdoors and recreation, and providing stable funding for important conservation and outdoor recreation projects. Specifically, one of the report's recommendations was for cities to promote urban open space preservation and riverfront planning. Today all of my home State's major metropolitan areas have taken steps to implement this recommendation.  In 2004, Memphis adopted the Memphis Riverfront Master Plan, and the city has been making progress on riverfront redevelopment. Just 3 months ago, the Big River Crossing--the longest public pedestrian and bike bridge across the Mississippi River--opened in  In 2005, the city of Chattanooga completed the 21st Century Waterfront Project, which redeveloped 129 acres ``along the river to create multiple public spaces and opportunities for citizens to enjoy Chattanooga's waterfront.''  In 2006, Nashville began the process to revise the Nashville Riverfront for the 21st Century to ``provide new public attractions, parkland and waterfront access, giving residents and visitors a reason to come and enjoy both banks of the Cumberland River.''  Also in 2006, Knoxville adopted the Knoxville South Waterfront Vision Plan to implement an improvement strategy for 750 acres along the 3-mile shoreline of the Tennessee River that flows through  Last year, the Tennessee Wildlife Federation called for the State to create a forum on Tennessee's great outdoors to ``assess the current status of our state's natural resources, identify critical challenges facing their management and conservation, and develop strategic solutions to ensure their persistence well into the future.''  When advocating for a new forum, Mike Butler, the CEO of the Tennessee Wildlife Federation, acknowledged the success of the implementation of many of the recommendations of the Tennesseans Outdoors report, but also recognized that much has changed over the last 30 years and ``these changes have had a profound effect on our natural resources and outdoor recreation needs.'' Mike understands the need to reexamine the issues facing our State's great outdoors and to work together to maintain and expand the benefits that our outdoors provide.  Like the State of Tennessee, 30 years ago, we looked at ways to help our future generations enjoy the great American outdoors like we did. Our report stated: ``We have learned over the course of our study of urgent needs for action to protect our outdoor recreation estate. Preservation of fast-disappearing open space, investment in rehabilitation of deteriorating facilities, getting ahead of urban growth as it races across the land--these are actions which cannot wait, but must be taken now, for tomorrow they will be more expensive, or in some cases, impossible.''  From land trusts to greenways to scenic highways, many of the recommendations have been implemented, and we, as a country, have been able to preserve some of our open spaces and protect our outdoor recreation estate.[[Page S6221]]  One way to illustrate the success of these programs is to take a look at the economic benefit of today's outdoor economy. According to an Outdoor Industry Association economic study in 2012, outdoor recreation generates $646 billion in consumer spending and 6.1 million direct jobs each year. In Tennessee, outdoor recreation generates $8.2 billion annually in consumer spending and supports 83,000 direct jobs across the  Our work is not done. Theodore Roosevelt once said that nothing short of defending this country in wartime ``compares in importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us. . . .''

445,topic-id,397,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of 1866, the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, September has been a difficult month for many students and families in areas such as Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, and even my State of Georgia, just to name a few.  We have all seen the truly saddening images of families who have been impacted by the likes of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and now we must come together as a nation to help our fellow Americans recover from these life-changing storms.  These storms have left many Americans with questions on how to continue living their daily lives as they try to return to a sense of normalcy, and students are no exception. Hundreds of thousands of students have been impacted by these storms, and the Federal Government must be ready to address the needs of students, as well as their institutions of learning, so that their education may continue.  The Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 allows the Department of Education, as well as other Federal entities, to use the emergency tools at their disposal to immediately assist students impacted by the storms of this past month without the need of additional appropriations from  First, the bill equips the Department of Education with temporary authority to waive certain rules governing campus-based aid programs for those institutions impacted by recent hurricanes.  Second, the legislation ensures students and teachers at private schools receive services under the Project SERV grant program. This program helps school districts and institutions of higher education reestablish a safe learning environment after a violent or traumatic crisis. The program has issued grants to school districts, State educational agencies, and institutions of higher education after natural disasters, including Superstorm These funds have helped reopen schools or, in some cases, provided resources to operate a school at an alternative site while the original site is being repaired.  Mr.Speaker, Congress has the power to use its resources to help students and families return to a sense of normalcy after these terrible storms, and we should do everything within our authority to help students remain on a pathway to success even in the aftermath of these storms.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all Members to support 1866, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgH7593-4.txt,2239,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,September

1109,topic-id,1183,"Thank you very much for yielding. I would like to thank my colleague, Randy Weber, my neighbor. I represent the 36th District in Texas and he represents the 14th, and he also represents my hometown of Beaumont, Texas, for this Special I really appreciate that.  It was about a month ago that Hurricane Harvey began wreaking havoc on southeast Texas, dumping record amounts of rainfall across our region, upending the lives of thousands of families, businesses, and communities. Across our congressional district, the 36th District of Texas, we saw anywhere between 20 and 50 inches of rain, setting a new record for the United In fact, unofficially, ranchers in Liberty County, which I also represent, measured over 60 inches of rain.  Our entire district, from Houston to the Louisiana border, turned into, essentially, one gigantic lake, as thousands of homes that had never flooded before succumbed to Harvey's floodwaters. The impact was devastating and widespread.  No one was spared. People from all walks of life and socioeconomic situations, with the majority never having been displaced before, were baffled and desperate in their situations.  Each of the nine counties that I have the privilege of representing have been declared Federal disaster areas. The devastation is simply overwhelming, and the vast lake now is a vast debris field. But in the midst of this devastation, there were, and still continue to be, incredible stories of goodness. Let me share just a few examples.  In Orange, Texas, a young couple canceled their wedding to help their friends and neighbors clean up and begin the process of rebuilding. These newlyweds have now welcomed nearly a dozen family members into their nonflooded home.  A volunteer fire department in Buna, Texas, became a big staging area, like many, many schools and volunteer fire departments all across this area.  In Cleveland, a constable organized a flotilla of boats to deliver shelter and supplies.  Dozens and dozens of churches immediately marshaled their congregations and good Christian people for food, supplies, and shelters to be delivered.  In Deer Park, church members sprang into action immediately and began cooking and sharing meals with evacuees from  In Silsbee, a church opened a community shelter after the county's only other shelter was cut off by floodwaters.  In Rose City, a really good friend and neighbor rescued nearly everyone in his entire neighborhood on his airboat, even as his own home was flooded. His name was Dennis  Since the flood, neighbors have organized mucking crews, where they help neighbors remove furniture, appliances, Sheetrock, carpets from one another's flooded homes.  This has happened all across the Texas Gulf Coast, and the stories go on and on: neighbors helping neighbors, communities helping communities, strangers helping strangers. Churches, first responders, private citizens, businesses, people from out of State all around our district are helping one another. But that is what we do in east When times get tough, we pull together and we get to work.  No one waits around to be told what to do. We are people of action, and we act when we see a need. And, quite frankly, this is what makes east Texas so special. Our communities are strong. And through our faith in God, we take care of one another in times of need regardless of our own means. It is our shared value for our fellow man that makes the difference.  In that same east Texas spirit, our office has been doing everything possible that we can do to help. From the very start, we have been working overtime to help people get back on their feet. We are blessed with a professional and dedicated staff that is second to none. And despite some of our own staff being flooded themselves, we have worked tirelessly to help our east Texas neighbors and friends get the information and resources they need to recover and build.  We are extremely grateful for their service, and I would like to personally recognize some of our staff: Lanie Brown, Lauren Jones, Rachel Iglesias, Sarah Blacksher, Beverly Ferguson, Will Carter, Jeannie Kranz, Joyce Morgan, Kelly Waterman, Beth Barber, Sarah Reese, Steve Janushkowsky, Lauren  These individuals have spent the past month doing everything they can to help the people of District 36. These are often the unsung heroes who go the extra mile each and every day, and lately, on weekends and evenings, to serve the needs of our constituents. It has not gone unnoticed and is part of the incredible good that has come out of a tragic hurricane. We are extremely proud and very grateful to them and their families and everyone who has pitched in.  I would also like to recognize our friends from Louisiana, and specifically my colleague, Congressman Garret Graves, and his staff, Paul Sawyer and David  Everywhere we went, we saw folks from Louisiana coming over and helping in the recovery, and we would tell them: Thank you so much. And we said: This is payback because of  Countless churches and individuals and neighbors from our neighboring State of Louisiana came out to help. Thank God for the Cajun Airlift, the Cajun Navy, the Cajun Special Forces, and the Cajun  And lastly, I would like to thank our first responders. The death toll would have been much higher if it had not been for these brave men and women. And for our game wardens, our police departments, our DPS officers, sheriff's deputies, all the way to our U.Coast Guard and Texas and other States' National Guardsmen, we thank you for everything that you did, and we remember those who gave their lives in the line of service.  As we push forward, we have a long road ahead. People are still very much in need of assistance and resources as they work to put their lives back together. In fact, the fact that over 800 folks showed up for our Disaster Recovery Town Hall Meetings over the past several days demonstrates that there are still many in need.  Last Thursday night in Lumberton, Texas, we had over 200 people come out. In Orange, Texas, we saw that 77 percent of all homes in that county were impacted. We had over 500 people come out to meet with FEMA, State officials, and my staff on a Friday night, and that is big, because that is football night in  It is our goal to help folks cut through the bureaucracy and the red tape to get the answers and help that they need. We have been spreading staff out across our nine counties, setting up mobile offices to provide constituents with one-on-one assistance in applying for help and ensuring they have access to a computer or to complete the application. And this is not unusual. My colleagues and all of the other counties, up to 38 counties, I believe, were involved in this thing and have been doing the exact same thing.  This will be a long road to our recovery, but together, we will recover, and we will rebuild and come back stronger than ever.  Congressman Weber, I want to thank you, and God bless.

425,topic-id,451,"Mr.President, in 2 days, unless Congress acts, the Federal Perkins Loan Program--the Nation's oldest Federal student loan program--will expire, leaving thousands of students with one fewer option to help them afford a higher education.  Since 1958, the Perkins Loan Program has existed with broad bipartisan support and has provided millions of students a stronger path to the middle class.  In the 2016 to 2017 academic year, the program has served more than 770,000 students with financial need across more than 1,400 institutions of higher education. In my home State of Wisconsin alone, Perkins provided aid to more than 23,000 students who are working hard to achieve their dreams.  Colleges and universities are invested in This program operates through campus-based revolving funds that combine prior Federal investments with significant institutional resources. While Congress stopped appropriating new funds for Perkins more than a decade ago, these schools continue to invest in this program because they know it works, and the campus-based nature of the program allows them to target aid to students they know are in the greatest financial need.  I am here to call on all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the extension of this critical program and investment in our students across  Two years ago, we allowed this important program to lapse, but thanks to the tireless efforts of students, institutions, advocates, and a bicameral, bipartisan majority in support of Perkins, we were able to advance a compromise that ensured that this source of support continued to be available to students in need.  Once again, we are facing a deadline. Once again, there is strong bipartisan[[Page S6198]]support for extending the Perkins Loan Last week, Senators Portman, Casey, and Collins joined me in introducing the Perkins Loan Program Extension Act, which would provide for a 2-year extension. My fellow Wisconsinite, Representative Mark Pocan, together with New York Representative Elise Stefanik, have introduced a House companion bill that is supported by over 225 of their colleagues--a bipartisan majority in that  I am here to call on my colleagues to act once again and support a 2-year extension of the Perkins Loan And while I look forward to a broader conversation about improving Federal supports for students as we look to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, we cannot once again sit by and watch it expire as America's students are left with uncertainty.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of 1808, a bill to extend the Federal Perkins Loan Program for 2 years; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration and the bill be considered read a third time and passed, with no intervening action or debate.

428,topic-id,288,"Mr.President, I am certainly disappointed that my effort to extend the Perkins Loan Program today was just blocked by my Republican colleague, but I want to say that it is an honor to serve on the HELP Committee, where we do some very impressive bipartisan work.  I understand the Senator's concern about the program and his belief that we must simplify. I share his desire to work on a broader reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and I look forward to that broader conversation about our Federal financial aid programs. However, I do not think it is right or fair to end this program, with nothing to replace it, to the detriment of students in need.  Also, I cannot agree that the compromise we hammered out 2 years ago was an agreement to wind down the program. I guess it is the perspective that we each bring to this subject, because I believed we were acting to ensure that the Perkins Loan Program could continue until we could discuss changes, improvements, and reforms to it and all Federal financial aid programs as part of broader legislation to improve higher education. We have yet to get to that bigger conversation, and it would once again be unfair to let this program end now without the benefit of a holistic assessment of the many ways the Federal Government helps to make college affordable for students across this country.[[Page S6199]]  I will continue to fight to extend this support for America's students, and I hope the chairman of the committee will once again work with me and the bipartisan supporters of this program to find a path forward for the Perkins Loan  I yield the floor.

The Congress finds that--       (1) on March 15, 1919, The American Legion was founded in      Paris, France, by members of the American Expeditionary Force      occupying Europe after World War I and concerned about the      welfare of their comrades and communities upon their return      to the United States;       (2) on September 16, 1919, Congress chartered The American      Legion, which quickly grew to become the largest veterans      service organization in the United States;       (3) The American Legion conferences in Washington, DC, in      1923 and 1924 crafted the first United States Flag Code,      which was adopted in schools, States, cities and counties      prior to being enacted in 1942, establishing the proper use,      display, and respect for the colors of the United States;       (4) during World War II, The American Legion developed and      presented to Congress its case for vastly improved support      for medically discharged, disabled veterans, which ultimately      became the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (58      284; chapter 268), better known as the G.Bill of Rights,      and was drafted by former American Legion National Commander      Harry Colmery in Washington's Mayflower Hotel;       (5) through the leadership and advocacy of The American      Legion, the G.Bill was enacted in June 1944, which led to      monumental changes in United States society, including the      democratization of higher education, home ownership for      average people in the United States, better VA hospitals,      business[[Page H7453]]     and farm loans for veterans, and the ability to appeal      conditions of military discharge;       (6) defying those who argued the G.Bill would break the      Treasury, according to various researchers, the G.Bill      provided a tremendous return on investment of $7 to the      United States economy for every $1 spent on the program,      triggering a half-century of prosperity in the United States;       (7) after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, The American Legion      established the National Emergency Fund to provide immediate      cash relief for veterans who have been affected by natural      disasters;       (8) American Legion National Emergency Fund grants after      Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, for instance, exceeded      $1,700,000;       (9) The American Legion fought to see the Veterans      Administration elevated to Cabinet-level status as the      Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring support for veterans      would be set at the highest level of the Federal Government,      as a priority issue for the President;       (10) after a decades-long struggle to improve the      adjudication process for veterans disputing claims decisions,      The American Legion helped shape and introduce the Veterans      Reassurance Act to create a venue for judicial review of      veterans' appeals;       (11) building on these efforts, legislation was passed in      1988 to create the United States Court of Veterans Appeals,      today known as the United States Court of Appeals for      Veterans Claims;       (12) The American Legion created the American Legacy      Scholarship Fund for children of military members killed on      active duty on or after September 11, 2001;       (13) in 2016, The American Legion's National Executive      Committee amended the original scholarship criteria to      include children of veterans with 50 percent or greater VA      disability ratings;       (14) President George Bush signed into law the Post-9/11      Veterans Educational Assistance Act (title V of the      Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008; 122 2357), a      next-generation G.Bill strongly supported by The American      Legion and the most comprehensive educational benefits      package since the original G.Bill of Rights was enacted in      1944;       (15) in August 2018, The American Legion will begin its      centennial recognition at the 100th National Convention in      Minneapolis, Minnesota, the site of the first American Legion      National Convention; and       (16) in March 2019, the organization will celebrate its      100th birthday in Paris, France, and September 16, 2019, will      mark the 100th anniversary of The American Legion's Federal      charter.     3.

504,topic-id,414,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2519, The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which would require the Department of the Treasury to mint and issue commemorative coins in recognition and celebration of the 100th anniversary of The American  For nearly 100 years, The American Legion, which was formed for veterans and by veterans, through the support of Congress, has helped to provide services to wartime veterans and the communities in which they live across the United States and the globe.  On March 27, 1919, Theodore Roosevelt sent a telegram to Mr.William Marshall Bullitt of Louisville, Kentucky, and many more respected military wartime veteran leaders across the country which announced: ``A conference will be held at Louis about May 1 for the purpose of organizing an association composed of those who[[Page H7454]]have been in the land and naval forces of the United States in this war. A convention held in France has already organized forces there in an association called The American Legion and will have its representatives at this convention.''  Shortly after this first national gathering of unified veterans held in Louis, Missouri, the United States Congress officially chartered The American Legion on September 16, 1919.  Since this charter, The American Legion has grown to be one of the most influential, nonpartisan, nonprofit, and the largest veterans service organization in the United States, with a standing membership of over 2.4 million veterans in 14,000 posts worldwide.  The Legion annually raises millions of dollars in donations at the local, State, and national levels to help veterans and their families during times of need and to provide college scholarships and other opportunities for deserving students.  Even in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, which I proudly represent, The American Legion continues to be a strong and aggressive advocate for wartime veteran-centered issues. Just yesterday, I met with many of The American Legion Nicholasville Post veterans right there serving and honoring the Gold Star families at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County,  The American Legion Department of Kentucky has established 139 posts, 3 areas, and 11 districts in our Commonwealth of 120 counties. The American Legion continues to strive to achieve what has always been held as a sacred duty to every good American since General George Washington's vision to promote the importance of providing provisions for the adequate care for war disabled veterans and their families.

510,topic-id,530,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, once again, in support of The American Legion 100th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, I want to share a story from just yesterday in Nicholasville, Kentucky, where The American Legion was there, as they always are, supporting our veteran families.  We were at Camp Nelson--which was originally a Union Army cemetery, but since the Civil War, has become a final resting place for many of our heroes--yesterday to honor many of the Kentucky Gold Star families who had lost loved ones, heroes, in the war on terror.  The first one was a U.Naval officer killed on September 11, 2001, in the And most recently, Captain Matthew Roland, a captain in the United States Air Force, was killed in action in August of 2015 in And the families of these fallen heroes were there. We were there to honor those fallen heroes and unveil a dedication, a memorial to those Gold Star families who had sacrificed so much. Not only did those heroes sacrifice everything for this country, but those families have sacrificed because they have lost their loved ones, and they are missing anniversaries, birthdays, and their children growing up and walking down the aisle.  But who was there to honor those Gold Star families?  The American And The American Legion was there holding those American flags high, and they were there to deliver the three-volley salute in honor of those fallen heroes.  The American Legion is, first and foremost, a local organization. They pride themselves in that, and that is what they were in Jessamine County, Kentucky, honoring those Gold Star families. Yes, they represent a country of heroes and servicemembers and veterans, but they are local, and they showed that yesterday in the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, and they show that all over this country.  I would just note also, Mr.Speaker, that when we think of how to honor our veterans, we have to remember what General George Washington--who, of course, was the Founder of our country, and who, of course, was that famous general during the American Revolution who arguably was the first veteran--said. And what General Washington--President Washington famously said about our country and veterans was that the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive veterans of earlier wars and how they were treated and appreciated by our  The American Legion embodies that. They are a group of patriots, of veterans who know that it is critically important to instill in other Americans the importance of patriotism, love of our country, love of the American flag, so they help us and future generations respect our veterans and their service and their sacrifice.  We appreciate the fact that we have a piece of legislation before this body today that honors that great organization--The American Legion--that provides that level of patriotism and support to our men and women in uniform and veterans who have served this country so heroically and patriotically.  Mr.Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.Walz), the legislation's sponsor.  ",CREC-2017-09-25-pt1-PgH7452.txt,2238,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,25.0,September

543,topic-id,581,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.1235, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin  Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, by James Naismith in 1891.  I have the privilege of representing the Sixth Congressional District of Kentucky, home of the University of Kentucky We affectionately know the University of Kentucky Wildcats basketball team as the greatest tradition in the history of college basketball; the winningest program in college basketball; eight national championships; and, of course, the greatest fans in the history of college basketball. We call them the Big Blue  While it may be to the surprise of many that a Kansas Jayhawk and not a Kentucky Wildcat invented the game, there is no doubt that this sport has helped many Americans learn the value of teamwork, sacrifice, and hard work.  Today, by some estimates, basketball is considered the fastest-growing sport in the world. With current megastars like LeBron James, Steph Curry, Candace Parker, and Brittney Griner, we don't have to wonder why we are in the Golden Age of basketball again.  And while the sport is wildly successful today with rising stars like former Kentucky players John Wall, Anthony Davis, Devin Booker, and Karl-Anthony Towns, the future is in good hands.  I could talk all day about the upcoming NCAA basketball season, but instead I want to turn my attention to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of  Established in 1959, the Basketball Hall of Fame has honored players, coaches, referees, and other basketball icons for their contributions to this great American sport. From Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Charles Barkley, Bill Russell, Jerry West, Patrick Ewing, Oscar Robertson, Pete Maravich, Bill Walton, Yao Ming, Shaq, TMac, A.I., the Millers, Swoopes, Coach Summitt, Coach Calipari, Magic Johnson, J., Wilt Chamberlain, Coach Adolph Rupp, Coach John Wooden, to Coach Dean Smith, the Basketball Hall of Fame allows fans, young and old, to reminisce or even discover the rich history of the game they love.  To the basketball lore of Chamberlain scoring 100 points in a single game, to the athletic heroics of Michael Jordan, to Lisa Leslie's dunk, to the UConn Ladies' streak of 111 wins, to Curry and company revolutionizing the game with a constant barrage of 3-pointers, the Basketball Hall of Fame is helping fans relive the greatest moments in basketball history while teaching important life lessons to youngsters through educational programs.  To honor 60 years of excellence in 2020 by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, it is with great pleasure that I am on the House floor today encouraging my colleagues to support the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin This legislation requires the U.Mint to produce commemorative coins for fans to collect and enjoy in celebration of this momentous occasion, in denominations of $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar clad coins. Importantly, these coins would be produced at no cost to the taxpayer, and surcharges on the sale of these coins would go to support programs at the Hall of Fame after raising matching funds from the private sector.  I especially want to thank Congressman Richard Neal from Massachusetts, home to the Springfield location of the Hall of Fame; and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy from California, for their hard work on this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation honoring this great American sport.  Go Cats, go Big  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas and, as I said before, the gentleman from Massachusetts for their advocacy of this bipartisan piece of legislation, again, honoring a great American tradition: the great sport of basketball.  Whether at the high school level, the collegiate level, or the professional level, it is true--the gentleman from Texas is absolutely right--this great sport unites our country. There is friendly competition--sometimes vigorous competition--in the rivalries that we see, whether it is Kentucky playing Louisville or North Carolina versus Duke, or if it is the Lakers and the Celtics from the 1980s or the Pistons and the Bulls in those great games in the 1990s.  There are a lot of people behind this legislation that deserve thanks and appreciation. I want to thank, in particular, Jim Host, who is credited for coining the phrase the ``Final Four,'' and Coach Calipari of the University of Kentucky, who has been a tireless champion of this effort. Without his leadership, I don't think this would have happened.  I want to also thank all of the members of the Hall of Fame who have come to Washington to talk to us. Jay Bilas came down here in the Ways and Means Committee and talked about the importance of this, and many of the other former players. I have to thank the players because the Hall of Fame recognizes their amazing skills and their talents, and if it weren't for their advocacy, this wouldn't have happened as well.  Finally and probably most important of all, the Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act that we are enacting here today is in honor of the fans who make this great sport possible, the American people who have fallen in love with this great American sport. We have to thank the fans for creating such excitement. Whether it is the McDonald's All American Basketball Game at the high school level, or if it is the Final Four in the national title in the NCAA in both men's and women's basketball, or if it is Game 7 of the NBA Finals, there is nothing more electric than this sport at crunch time.

120,topic-id,1616,"Madam President, last week the Senate passed the bipartisan Defense Authorization The world is a very dangerous place. This legislation is very important to keeping our country safe.  Another thing we need to do to keep America safe is to get the economy going and growing. We need a strong and healthy economy in this country, and we need it now. A strong economy means a strong country with enough money to pay for the defense needs that we have at this time.  Over the 8 years of the Obama administration, Washington doubled its debt. Why? Because our economy grew so slowly and the administration spent too much money. If this sort of thing continues, it is going to leave America in a much more vulnerable position.  America needs a stronger economy that grows faster. To get the kind of growth we need, we are going to have to provide real tax relief for America, for hard-working families, and for the economy. That means cutting tax rates, and it means simplifying taxes for everyone. If we get this right, we are going to be able to produce more jobs, Americans will have higher wages, more take-home pay, and we will have a stronger economy.  According to the Internal Revenue Service, Americans spend about 6 billion hours a year on taxes, just trying to prepare their taxes. Between businesses and individual families, we spend an average of 18 hours for every man, woman, and child in America, just trying to comply with Washington's complicated Tax The National Taxpayers Union says that the total cost of all of this is $263 billion a year. That works out to about $800 for every person in This is not spending that does anything productive. It is just figuring out how much tax to pay, and how to do it in a way to send it back to Washington so that the IRS will not come knocking at your door--how to get your numbers right.  The instructions for last year's standard 1040 tax form were 106 pages long. These are the instructions--15 different worksheets for people to fill out just to try to fill out the forms. The people who can deal with this level of complexity are the ones who basically can afford to hire expensive accountants and lawyers, who then take full advantage of a very complicated tax code. It penalizes hard-working Americans who can't afford the high-priced help that helps them fill out and take full advantage of a complicated tax code.  We hear a lot about people who talk about how millionaires and billionaires are gaming the system so that they can pay less in taxes. If that is their concern, then maybe we should try to make this system simple enough that there is no system to game and everyone can understand it.  Just think about how much we could save this country if we simplify things even a little bit. All the time we could save, all the extra money in the pockets of hard-working American families--that would really help to grow the economy and do it quickly. It would also make life a lot simpler for most  If we also, at the same time as simplifying the Tax Code, lower the tax rates, that keeps even more money in people's pockets. It gives them more money to decide what to save, what to spend, and what to invest--money they can spend going out to dinner if they choose. They can invest it if they want, and save for the future. If they actually choose to spend the money by going out to dinner, that helps the economy around the community where they live. People at the restaurants have to hire additional servers, and they will then have money to pay their own bills. That is how an economy grows. That is how providing people with more money in their pockets[[Page S6168]]helps an economy become stronger and healthier.  There is another important part of tax relief we need to remember. We need to be sure we solve a big problem with the taxes that not just individuals pay but that businesses pay. The reason we need to do that is because many people think of businesses as big, faceless companies, but the simple fact is that these businesses actually don't pay the taxes personally. People have to pay the taxes. That is because businesses pay taxes with money they get from their customers.  If the government says it is going to put a big tax on some company, that basically gets passed on to the workers there and also to the people who buy that product. The Congressional Budget Office looked into this. Their office looked into it, and they found that more than 70 percent of the cost of corporate taxes actually comes from the people who work for these businesses. Nearly 3 out of every 4 dollars they spend in taxes would have ended up going back to the workers to have that money--workers who are either buying products or workers working within the company. Maybe it would have been higher wages or better benefits or some other way that people would have gotten a benefit from the money that otherwise just gets collected and sent to the government.  Obviously, a big chunk of the money is from the workers, and another big chunk is from the consumers. If a family buys something, part of the price they are paying is to cover the taxes that business has to pay. The higher taxes mean higher prices for people who go to buy something.  The third way that people pay these business taxes is when they get paid by the people who own a share of the business. If you take a look, there are a lot of people on the other side of the aisle who like to talk about taxing the rich who own stock in companies that are all across our country. The only problem is, most of the people who actually own shares in these companies are far from rich. More than half of Americans actually own stocks in corporations that are paying these high taxes. Maybe they have an IRA, a retirement plan, a 401(k) through their work. Whatever it is, Americans who are investing for their future are also being taxed.  Some of the biggest owners of these corporations are actually the pension funds of public employees. That includes teachers, it includes firefighters, it includes people in every community around Taxes take away money that could make these pensions worth more. When the government takes taxes away, there is less money in the pension plans for our teachers, for our firefighters, for our first responders. So it is a real problem that the corporate tax rates are so high because high taxes hold back the entire economy and hold back the entire country.  If you look at the most developed countries around the world, the United States has the highest corporate tax rate of all of them. The average tax rate of all of these major countries around the world--across the globe--is 24 percent. In the United States, it is 39 percent. We are 15 percent higher in tax rates than the average of the major countries around the world. So that is the top Federal rate, and when you include the average for State and local taxes, it gets you to 39 percent--24 percent versus 39 percent. That is how far out of the ordinary American taxes have become.  It is a huge disadvantage for American companies that are trying to compete on the world stage. Frankly, the reason we are at such a disadvantage is that other countries have been cutting their tax rates over the years. There was actually a time when the U.tax rates were fairly low, and other countries continued to cut theirs below ours. Now we are at a point that the average for developed countries around the world is at 24 percent, and the United States is at 39 percent. Places like Germany, Japan, and Canada have all cut their rates going back over the last 60, 70 years. We haven't done it here at all. Now it is time to do it.  It is one of the reasons our economy has been stuck with the slow growth rate that we had during the Obama administration. It is what we have seen over the last 8 years--a very sluggish economy with very little growth. If we can cut corporate tax rates, personal rates, that is going to really help stimulate the economy.  People pay taxes. It is the individuals who pay the taxes that in many ways run the government. Many people I talk to in Wyoming feel, rightly so, that the problem isn't that they are taxed too little; it is that the government takes too much.  We need to get the economy going, and we can do that by simplifying and lowering the tax rates. It is true that, with taxes, people actually struggle with trying to figure them out at the kitchen table. I have talked to those folks at home. It is continually a problem--the simplification, as well as how much money the government takes from them. Taxes raise prices. Taxes chip away at retirement savings that people have.  Tax relief and simplifying taxes makes sense for American families. It means more jobs. It means higher wages. It means a safer America and a stronger It is good for our economy, and it is good for all hard-working taxpayers and the families those taxpayers support.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

I thank you for your leadership on the natural disasters we are having, particularly in Puerto There are 3.4 million American citizens who are living in conditions that nobody in this country should have to tolerate. They are without fuel, they are without food, they are without water, they are without energy, and they are without electricity. Some reports have said it is going to be months before that electricity is repaired. We have to do everything we can in this body to make sure these American citizens are supported and that they can rebuild, and I know the Presiding Officer feels the same way. We have to work together to do this.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, that is not the reason I am coming to the floor today. I wanted to say a word about healthcare now that the decision has been made, apparently, to not even have a vote on this latest version of the repeal and replace bill. This was going to be, I think, the fourth time we had a vote to repeal the Affordable Care The House of Representatives, over the last 7 years, has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act somewhere on the order of 67 times or almost 70 times. They have gone back to their constituents year after year after year saying they voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act; that it was a Socialist takeover of the United States of America that they were trying to correct. They distorted what the Affordable Care Act actually was. I am not going to litigate that today.  It is clear, from my perspective in Colorado, whether people support the Affordable Care Act or whether they don't, it often turns on--not always--what party they are in or whether they supported President Obama or whether they didn't. I say not always because I get a lot of email and have people in my townhalls who aren't Democrats but who have preexisting conditions or whose children have preexisting conditions who have health insurance for the first time as a result of the Affordable Care  Having said all that, whether they support the Affordable Care Act or whether they don't, in my State--and I bet it is true all over the United States of America--people are deeply dissatisfied with the way they interact and their families interact and their small businesses interact with the American healthcare system. They should be because it doesn't work very well. I am not talking about the Affordable Care I am talking about the Affordable Care Act, plus our healthcare system. They are not the same thing, and we should be addressing that.  We should be addressing the costs in our system. We should be addressing the lack of transparency in our system. We should be making sure people in the richest country in the world have access to health insurance, but they also have to have access to quality care. In too many rural areas in Colorado--and it is true all over America--there are not enough primary care doctors, not enough primary care nurses. We are not delivering healthcare in those places very efficiently, and we are not delivering it well enough, especially when we know a lot of our veterans live in those communities, and we know increasingly there is a profound opioid addiction that needs to be dealt with.  After 7 years of saying repeal, repeal, repeal and then some years of saying repeal and replace, we have now wasted 7 months of the American people's time on an entirely partisan effort to try to pass two bills that could not have been more unresponsive to the critics of ObamaCare in Colorado, to say nothing of the supporters. So it is not a surprise to me that the last attempt failed, and it is not a surprise to me that people weren't even going to vote on this bill because it is such a terrible bill that they didn't want to vote on it. So they have withdrawn it, which is[[Page S6125]]good for the American people, except the people in Colorado are still facing challenges in healthcare, including challenges from the Affordable Care There, I said it. I voted for it.  There are things we should fix, and one of those things is a problem that is common--I heard both Members of the Republican Party on the Finance Committee and Democrats on the Finance Committee yesterday at the hearing talk about it--which is the problem that people have in the individual market affording insurance. They say to me, as somebody who voted for the Affordable Care Act: Hey, You have required us to buy something--insurance because of the individual mandate--that in my area is too expensive because there is not enough competition of insurers, and the deductible is so high it is of no use to me and my family. Why would you make me buy something like that?  I think that is a completely legitimate criticism of the bill. It is important to recognize that when we are talking about this group of people who are very important, it is 7 percent of the population that is covered in America--7 percent. Ninety three percent of the people are getting their insurance someplace else--from their employer, from Medicare, from This is 7 percent we are talking about.  By the way, the issue around that 7 percent--not the people--the issue around that 7 percent, that is what has consumed our politics for the last 7 years. It is not how to make it less expensive for 100 percent of the American people, not how to make it more transparent for 100 percent of the American people, more predictable for 100 percent of the American people but what are we going to do to cover 7 percent. Of those, the folks who aren't getting subsidies, are about 1 percent of people who are insured in I say that not to diminish those people at all because they are struggling--and I meet them all the time in my State--I say it to show just how small that set of issues is and how easily they could be resolved by the U.Congress if we could work together instead of having this pitched battle about healthcare, instead of calling each other names and Bolshevik takeover and all the rest.  Fortunately, there is a solution that is being worked on not in the Finance Committee but in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions The two leaders of that committee--Lamar Alexander, who is the Republican chair, and Patty Murray, who is the Democratic ranking member, are among two of the finest legislators in this body. Time after time after time, even when Washington has not worked, they have managed to lead that committee to what Lamar Alexander refers to as a result. It has come to the floor after going through a process in our committee, an amendment process. It has come to the floor for an amendment process, whether we were reforming the FDA or rewriting the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which used to be known as No Child Left That bill actually got a unanimous vote in our committee--a committee that has on it Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Rand Paul from That is quite an achievement.  So I have absolute confidence in their ability to deal with this set of issues related to this 7 percent of our population. And I hope that bipartisan process will then become a model or a foundation for the work we need to do on healthcare going forward. We have to turn the page on the last 7 years or 8 years of these repeal votes.  From my perspective, having failed to repeal, the answer can't be to say: We will not help you fix the Affordable Care Act because if we participate in the process to fix the Affordable Care Act, it somehow legitimizes the Affordable Care  You should not hold the position that if you fail to repeal, you can't fix it. If you are going to repeal it, repeal it. And I think we know where that has gone. If you are not going to repeal it, you better be part of fixing it, or you are going to own the problem.  There are a lot of people on this side who want to address that issue, and I believe there are a lot of Republicans who want to address that issue. We are now out of excuses for why we can't do it because Graham-Cassidy has been pulled, as it should have been because that bill, far from stabilizing our insurance system, would have actually made it worse, would have injected even more volatility.  Sometimes people say: Well, don't you think there is already volatility in the system? My answer to that is yes, I do. That is why we have to fix it. The last thing we need to do is make it more volatile. The last thing we need to do is make matters worse. We should stabilize it, based on the bipartisan testimony we have had in the HELP  The other thing it does--and the Senator from Minnesota is here, so I am going to stop--the other thing it does is it throws millions of people off of insurance. This is not a healthcare bill. It is not a healthcare bill; it is ``we are going to take your healthcare away'' bill. It couldn't be sustained in front of the American people. They wouldn't even vote on it because they knew how bad it was. We had no hearings before yesterday's Finance It is like watching ``Veep.'' It is not the way the government ought to work. So they have an excuse for a hearing. They decide to have the hearing. The Congressional Budget Office report, which we should have had months to look at, if not weeks, comes out in the middle of the hearing and tells us that millions of people are going to lose their health insurance as a result of this bill--flying completely in the face of President Trump's promises.  Let's get this short-term thing done, let's stabilize the individual market, which we need to do, and then let's address healthcare in a bipartisan way, and I will accept President Trump's goals for what it should look like. Let's make sure everybody is covered at a lower price, with higher quality. That is what he promised on the campaign trail, and we have the opportunity to deliver that if we are willing to work in a bipartisan way.  I know that is what people in Colorado want out of this place. They are so tired of the Affordable Care Act being litigated in this way, and it is clear that the repeal effort has failed. But that is not enough. We have to continue to fix the system. And I wish Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray all the best as we try to do this in the HELP Committee, and then I hope Democrats and Republicans will support that effort on this floor, and we can actually do something useful, after all of these years, for the American people and their families and their small businesses.

That was one of the things that came up over and over again in the Finance Committee hearing, was that in the name of federalism, we were basically imposing on all of the States the obligation to decide that they had to reinvent their healthcare system over the next 2 years whether that was something they wanted to do or not.

Swift passage of this legislation today would ensure that many programs that veterans, their caregivers, dependents, and survivors rely on continue. We must continue these programs.

The costs associated with them have been assumed in the House-passed appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018 and 2019 advance appropriation.  One program that has been extended for just 5 additional months, until January 6, 2018, is the assisted living pilot program for veterans with traumatic brain injury. That short extension would allow extra time for the VA to fully transition the veterans currently participating in that program into other existing programs more suitable for their ongoing support and rehabilitation.

302,topic-id,2086,"Mr.President, in the last 24 hours since I came to the floor to talk about Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, there has been progress but far less progress than is necessary at this critical time of humanitarian crisis, when the people of those islands literally face a chasm, a deepening canyon of needs and challenges.  Over the next 24 hours, over the next 24 days, over the next 24 months, this crisis must be met with a strategy, an overarching plan, a Marshall Plan for Puerto Rico that commits the resources unequivocally and unambiguously, making sure we match the depth of this crisis with a magnitude of resources and commitment that is needed and deserved. That kind of response, which has been lacking so far, is absolutely necessary for the hope of Puerto Rico because as the threats of disease and contaminated water increase, not to mention the lack of proper medicine, healthcare, roads, transportation and communication, food, water, medicine, basic necessities rise on that island, the people of Puerto Rico will lose trust and confidence in fellow Americans that must do more. We need to give them the hope they deserve, and that hope has to be more than rhetoric and more than patting ourselves on the back as the President has done. It has to be a real commitment.  In fact, there is no reason for back-patting. The response so far has been inadequate, lacking the full attention and commitment that is needed. It has been a story of inattention and inadequate strategy so far to meet this deepening humanitarian crisis.  The people of Texas, Florida, and throughout the gulf coast and the Southeast who have been affected by the storms have received the full commitment of It is what we owe our fellow That same commitment is owed to Puerto Rico and the Virgin We saw an immediate disaster response there that must also be devoted to Puerto The emergency aid and full funding made to the victims of those storms in the gulf coast and Florida must be given to Puerto Rico, and I am hopeful that a relief bill will be fashioned this week.  I am also hopeful that the financial control board that has responsibility for Puerto Rico's internal finances can be given the flexibility and that the Government of Puerto Rico will be given the flexibility that is needed to deal with this disaster--nothing less than a full court press, a full plan and strategy, and a plan that directly addresses the needs of Puerto Rico in so many areas.  On transportation, what is the plan to ensure that basic goods can move from one end of the island to another? Right now the roads are unusable. By[[Page S6176]]all accounts, getting things across the island by road is impossible. Radar and navigation systems at the airports are down. The transportation mechanism of the island is literally ripped apart. So potable water, food, and fuel are impossible to move where they need to go. That state of affairs is inadequate and unacceptable in America in 2017.  Electricity and power are disrupted across the island. What will be done to restore power and electricity throughout the island? What will be done to make sure that diesel is available there and in the Virgin Islands? Many of the machines essential for lifesaving at the hospitals cannot be powered by generators alone. That state of affairs is inadequate and unacceptable in America in 2017.  All five of the hospitals in Arecibo, one of Puerto Rico's largest cities, are without power. Many other hospitals are shuttered as well. Clinics are closed.  Mosquito-borne diseases are a real and present danger. Deadly ailments in contaminated food and water may cause serious and possibly deadly diseases. As these diseases spread, what is the plan to stop this kind of inadequacy? It is unacceptable in America in 2017.  As to communications, or the basic ability to talk to each other, to reassure each other, and to know what is going on with relatives and loved ones and friends--no wonder that angst and alarm are spreading beyond Puerto Rico to Connecticut, where those relatives and friends live now--this kind of lack of communication is unacceptable in America in 2017. What is the plan to correct it?  On public safety, looting and theft are becoming more prevalent. As the days drag on, law and order will deteriorate unless public safety is addressed more effectively.  There is another kind of challenge. A dam that is about to burst and could cause havoc in surrounding areas is a clear and present safety danger that illustrates again the weakness of Puerto Rico's infrastructure.  Towns throughout the island have suffered severe flooding. So housing and basic shelter are inadequate. What is the plan to rebuild?  Payment for medicines cannot be made unless cash is available, and the lack of electricity means that the ATM machines are not working. If there is no cash for residents to buy basic goods, including food and water, how does the administration plan to solve this problem? This kind of inadequacy is unacceptable in America in 2017.  Rebuilding will require a long-term commitment. It will require a plan and a strategy, not just over the next 24 hours or 24 days but 24 months and longer. It must deal with a financial situation that is a storm of its own.  As I described it yesterday, this storm is not a natural disaster. It is a manmade disaster, the result of healthcare and tax programs that are beyond any fault of the people of Puerto It is not of their doing.  Vast swaths of resources have been swept away in Puerto Rico, including many of the attractions important for Puerto Rico's tourist industry. The same is true, for example, on the island of John in the Virgin Tourism is a key component of Puerto Rico's economy. It may take years and possibly decades to restore. What is the long-term plan? What is the strategy for Puerto Rico and for the Virgin Islands? There needs to be a kind of Marshall Plan for rebuilding because the devastating damage done is no less than what Europe suffered as a result of World War We have an obligation--certainly, no less than rebuilding our European allies--to restore and rebuild Puerto  All of these natural disasters and the financial manmade storm come as Puerto Rico continues to endure the struggles of its internal financial commitments that are necessary for the lifeblood of the economy. Jobs and economic progress must be the end goal.  With so many questions about the President's plan or lack of plan, I am struck by the need for this body and this Congress to take the initiative. I think we will need to begin action, begin hearings, and begin a process of building a plan if the administration fails to present it.  I believe, too, that we share so much with the island of Puerto Rico in people who have come to Connecticut and other parts of the country that we will find a ready and enthusiastic audience and support for such an effort.  In the past 2 days, after silence through much of it about Puerto Rico, the President seemed to blame the island itself, its financial struggle, other storms, and even the size of the ocean. There should be no excuses. There must be a call to action.  I thank the Coast Guard, our military, the first responders, the rescuers, and relief organizations--from Americares to the Red Cross to Save the Children--that have devoted so much and given so much in these times of crisis. They have been stretched thin. They have performed with courage and generosity and so have the donors who have come forward in Connecticut and around the country. People are calling my office asking what they can do for the people of Florida and the gulf coast and Puerto Rico and the Virgin They are all fellow Americans, and we owe it to them to do more and do better to make sure that we keep faith with our fellow  I thank you, Mr.President, for the opportunity to talk about this subject.                         Nomination of Ajit Pai  Mr.President, I want to express as well my concern regarding the renomination of Ajit Pai to be Chairman of the Federal Communications I will oppose his nomination. As much as I respect his background and his achievements, his intelligence and ability, I believe that, during his tenure over the past year, he has taken one step after another that is contrary to the public interest. He has launched an attack on net neutrality, and he is working adamantly for undoing the open internet order.  The open internet order was established based on 10 years of evidence about how the internet has changed, and it was most recently fully upheld by the U.Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in June 2016. The most recent evidence shows that net neutrality has not inhibited network investment at all, in contrast to Chairman Pai's claim.  On broadband privacy, Chairman Pai forcefully advocated in support of efforts to rescind the FCC's broadband privacy rules, a blatant attack on consumer privacy rights--all the more striking in light of recent dramatic concerns about privacy. Signing up for the internet should not mean that you have to sign away your rights to privacy, and that is why it is so important to have baseline privacy and data security rules that our broadband providers subscribe to, observe, and follow.  Earlier this year, Senate Republicans gave broadband providers a green light to sell sensitive personal information to the highest bidder--a move that came with cheers of support from Chairman By supporting this measure, I think Chairman Pai raised severe doubts about his commitment to the average American consumer.  One of Chairman Pai's first actions after his designation as chairman was to direct the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau to overturn an order designating nine wireless companies to provide lifeline broadband service through the USF Lifeline Program, despite the assertion that his foremost goal was to close the internet and digital divide. I strongly criticized this decision and led a letter to Chairman Pai expressing that this action not only forfeits and affects these providers consumers' interests, but it may also have a chilling effect on other broadband providers that were interested in participating in the Lifeline broadband program. This action would limit choice and increase the cost of service for the lifeline participants.  Finally, as Chairman of the FCC, Mr.Pai has a duty to review whether Sinclair's proposal to acquire Tribune Media complies with the FCC's broadcast media ownership rules and serves the public interest by promoting localism and diversity. Rather than scrutinizing this deal as closely and carefully as I believe he should, Mr.Pai has focused his efforts on loosening restrictions to enable the deal. This transaction not only blatantly violates existing rules, but it also abridges existing FCC policy. Those policies were just recently scrapped under Mr.Pai's watch.  This action can only be explained by interest in prioritizing the demands of Sinclair over the public interest. It[[Page S6177]]also is no surprise that this decision happened just days before he had a meeting with the chairman of  Every market impacted by this megamerger would experience a reduction in responsive local news due to Sinclair's unresponsive, top-down approach--denigrating diversity, diminishing our already distorted civic discourse, and devaluing local voices of women and people of color. Today, I sent a letter to Chairman Pai to let him know that blessing a media behemoth such as Sinclair-Tribune would reflect an abject failure on his part to protect the public interest and to uphold the FCC's duty to promote localism and diversity. Localism needs responsiveness to local interests, local news, and local voices. That is a trust the FCC has by its own rules and as a matter of public interest.  Today we rely more than ever on the internet for so many facets of our everyday life: freedom of expression, education, healthcare, housing, entertainment, and more. Consumers need a champion that will be their voice at a time when so often the public interest is drowned by moneyed interests and special interests.  Chairman Pai, far from our champion, seems to be more a servant of those interests. American consumers deserve better. My hope is, the President will nominate someone who can better serve those interests.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

768,topic-id,1162,"Mr.President, I want to talk about the terrible humanitarian crisis faced by the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, as well as the gulf coast and the people of Florida, who have endured the fury and ferocity of Mother Nature at its worst.  All of the people who live in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are First and foremost, they are Americans who are going through one of the toughest periods of their lives, a time that no American wants to face alone.  My message to the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands: You are not alone. You are not alone in this humanitarian crisis. Congress will act. We will provide the kind of relief package--food, medicine, whatever supplies are necessary not only to endure and survive but to eventually thrive.  That is more than just rhetoric; that is a promise this Senate must make to our fellow These Americans citizens in Puerto Rico, for example, have lost their homes, their businesses, their livelihoods, and, some of them, loved ones.  I come to this floor on this issue that has preoccupied me and others because it is truly a story of two storms. It is a tale of two catastrophes--one of them resulting from nature's fury but the other manmade.  We know very visibly and dramatically about the storm that directly hit Puerto Rico, and it is called It was side-glanced by an earlier storm that missed it with its full fury, but Maria was a direct hit, leaving more than 60,000 American citizens without power, passing within miles of San Juan, home to 400,000 people. It was the strongest storm to hit the island in 80 years. The winds tore off the trees and dumped more than 2\1/2\ feet of rain on the island. It razed houses there and on the U.Virgin Islands, leaving a wasteland, crumpled structures, scarred concrete, shells of buildings, no electricity, and virtually no telecommunications for most people.  There are 3.4 million people in dire need of housing, food, water, medicine,[[Page S6121]]diesel, gasoline--the necessities of life. There is a humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico that requires an immediate and unconditional response from Congress--not from just the Senate but from the House and from the  One area where the President had made an announcement today concerns the potential matching amounts of money that Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands may have to provide. There should be no match. There should be no requirement that Puerto Rico or the U.Virgin Islands provide a share of the money needed for rebuilding and recovery, and the President should waive every bit of the required matching share. Every dime, every nickel should be waived.  That leads me to talk about the second storm that has hit Puerto It is less visible and less recent. It is the result of a continually building set of headwinds, a financial storm that had built over many years and has now reduced Puerto Rico to a state of near insolvency, virtual bankruptcy--$74 billion in debt that would have been a severe storm for the people of Puerto Rico--not of their making--even without the hurricane that directly hit the island.  We have an obligation as immediate and dire with respect to rebuilding and recovering from that second storm as we do for the first. That is the reason I have been involved over a period of many months in seeking to construct solutions, beginning with the PROMESA And I intend--and I commit that I will continue seeking that kind of solution, not just solutions to the buildings that have been collapsed but to an economy that will collapse if we do not act. That is an important obligation that we share to fellow Americans, because this storm is not due to their neglect or profligacy; it is due to the tax laws and healthcare laws that unfortunately failed to treat them fairly.  Delay in meeting the astronomic costs of Hurricane Maria would be unacceptable and unconscionable. We must act promptly. I am hopeful that it will be this week. I am talking to our leader, Senator Schumer, who has provided such strong vision and courage in this area. He has been a champion of Puerto Rico, and I hope he will help us craft a solution that is immediate, vigorous, and prompt.  The administration and Congress must ensure as well that the Federal Government plays a robust and responsible role in funding and financing these recovery efforts so that no additional damage is done to Puerto Rico's already fragile economy. It is time to forgo the miasma and bureaucratic rigmarole of Federal redtape and financing constraints, while flooding is still an acute risk to life and health and recovery efforts are just beginning.  The Puerto Rican Government must be granted direct and instant tools to bring electricity back to the people, to feed the hungry, to provide drinking water and shelter to lives that have been upended by this unforgiving storm. All arms of the Federal Government should be brought to bear to help our fellow citizens in Puerto  This morning, I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, whether he would be ready, willing, and able to help and provide additional assistance on behalf of the Department of Defense and the military that he commands, and his unequivocal response was yes. I commend and thank him for that willingness to help our fellow And he affirmed they are our fellow Americans, they serve in our military, and they give back to communities in this country.  I am proud to represent 300,000 fellow Americans who have come from Puerto Rico to Connecticut, and they, in turn, reflect families there. I have spoken to friends in Puerto Rico who described to me the dire images outside their window--similar to the images we have seen on national television.  Puerto Rico's debt troubles are no secret to anybody here today. We have discussed them, debated them, and failed to provide adequate assistance to meet them. We must work on two tracks--the immediate recovery effort in the face of this truly destructive hurricane but also the financial peril that continues to put Puerto Rico's economy at risk, jobs in jeopardy, and the island's precarious financial position as much at risk as its water and roads are.  Puerto Rico's infrastructure, energy, water, schools, hospitals, transportation, and other vital facilities necessary for a functioning economy must be rebuilt and made whole. That is our obligation. And the same is true of the Virgin Islands, where fellow Americans are equally at risk, their safety in jeopardy, and their economy potentially struggling.  We owe it to our fellow Americans and friends and families--there are people in Connecticut who have friends and family there--and all of us who share a love for these islands that are populated by patriotic Americans dedicated to our country.

Analogous but different, this category 4 Hurricane Maria caused consequences as devastating and destructive as any that man could do. It is a natural disaster, not manmade, but it is turning into a manmade disaster.  So far, the response from our government has been underwhelming. In fact, it has been inadequate and anemic. It has been shamefully slow and undersized and should be vastly upgraded and increased.  Just moments ago, I learned that Lieutenant General Buchanan has been appointed to head the military efforts in Puerto That appointment followed a call just an hour or so ago with all of the representatives, including FEMA, the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and the Red Cross, during which I urged our U.military to be mobilized, much as we would be in responding to a natural disaster in Connecticut or Texas or Florida or other places in this country on the mainland where we have seen the same kind of storm.  The 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico are almost exactly the same number as the population of I hope, and I believe, the response would be better in Connecticut if we were to face the same kind of natural disaster. Yet the manmade disaster is the failure to move food, fuel, medicine, water, other necessities, and communications equipment from the ports and the airports into the interior of the country, even into the major cities, where currently apparently a lack of drivers and passable roads make it all the more difficult. Whether the supplies of food and fuel and medicine and water are adequate on the island or need to be increased on an emergency basis and whether there are sufficient shipments and airlifts going into the island, the simple fact is that Puerto Rico faces a disaster--manmade after natural.  I commend the loyal and dedicated people of FEMA and all of the National Guard, including the National Guard of Connecticut, who have performed with such heroism and dedication in the face of the most difficult circumstances imaginable, but their efforts need to be matched by many others. There are 4,500 American military personnel now in Puerto Rather than 5,000, there should be 50,000 of our National Guard, not to occupy the island, not to enforce martial law but to make sure the logistics--the transportation, the means of delivery of the lifeblood of that island in food and fuel and medicine and water and other basic necessities--are sufficient to move those basic supplies to the places they are needed. The troops who are there now are performing heroic, Herculean work, and so are many volunteers, along with FEMA officials, the Coast Guard, and others, but they need more help.  Nearly a week after this storm, Maria, more than 90 percent of the island's residents are without power, 42 percent have no water, the vast majority of the country's 69 hospitals cannot function, and only 10 percent of the cell towers are working. If those conditions existed in Connecticut, I would be on the floor 24 hours a day. Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have no one here, and they have no elected Representatives in the House of They are voiceless or at least voteless in this body. We need to stand for them, speak out, and fight for them. That is why I am here for the third day in a row.  We need a plan and a strategy, which has been lacking from this administration. In that phone call earlier today with FEMA officials and the Department of Defense, I asked about a plan. They are working on it. The military, U.Northern Command, is working on a plan. They could not tell me when it will be ready or what it will say or what the total number of troops or other logistical supplies will be nor could they commit that there would be a waiver under FEMA regulations of the C through G conditions, which apply to permanent recovery.  The only decision that has been made is A to B, which provides for debris and other emergency responses over the next 180 days, and that is part of what the island needs--a longer term plan as well as an immediate one to make sure there is a road to recovery, that there is a path that will provide hope. Not only is the well-being and health of this island threatened but so is hope, which is so important for progress to be made.  The people of Puerto Rico have been met with, at best, ambivalence and ambiguity by the President of the United Earlier this week, he seemed more inclined to blame the island itself and the size of the ocean than in advocating for help. I hope we can come together on a bipartisan basis. With the kind of situation that is there now--the danger of epidemic as well as immediate health threats before disease takes hold--we must act before people die. We must come to the aid of Puerto They need medical care. They need access to food and safe drinking water, and, yes, they need greater security.  The 78 mayors of Puerto Rico, along with the Governor, are doing also heroic and Herculean work, but a whole of government response is necessary from this body and from the Federal Government at a much higher magnitude. In the long term, we must have a martial plan--a strategy for rebuilding the island's roads, bridges, rail, airports, ports, and VA facility, much as we do in this country, except that, there, the need is so much more dire and immediate. Hospitals, transportation, electricity, power, communications, safety, housing all have been destroyed, and the consequences will be deadly.  My hope is that Lieutenant General Buchanan will expedite that plan. So far, it has been lacking. It should be done today. It should be integrated with the FEMA approach, and I hope they will permit visits by Members of the Congress who, so far, have been prevented from going there.  The American people deserve to have elected Representatives there because Puerto Rico has none here. The extraordinary work done by the cable TV and reporters for the print media and others who are there have given us a picture--and often a picture is worth a thousand words--of the devastation that now continues from a manmade disaster that must be avoided before it takes lives and destroys hope.

Within 5 years, the business press was hailing the leadership of Chuck Knight, and it was appropriate to do so then, and for the full 27 years, he served as Emerson's Because he was so well regarded, he was sought out to serve on a number of corporate boards, including Anheuser-Busch, AT&T, IBM, Baxter International, BP, Caterpillar, Morgan Stanley, and the Olin  Between 1973 and 2000, Emerson grew from a dozen divisions generating total revenues of $1 billion to more than 60 businesses with revenues totaling over $15 billion. International sales grew from 12 percent of the total to almost 40 percent. Emerson's record of increased earnings per share and dividends for each year of Mr.Knight's tenure as CEO was among the longest in U.business.  Chuck was a passionate leader. In a 1989 cover story, Fortune wrote that his ``intensity level is about 327 on a scale of 1 to 10.'' His intensity, passion, and, most likely, his integrity, inspired commitment and loyalty from his management team, his employees, his competitors, and his friends.  Chuck's passion extended to his adopted hometown of Louis, He didn't just offer his support; Chuck provided his personal advocacy and leadership to many organizations, including the Matthews-Dickey Boys & Girls Club and the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center, serving children in the city of He led the major capital campaign for Washington University in Louis, and for decades, he worked closely with the Olin Business School, where he helped fund the Charles Knight Executive Education His efforts were always to make a real and lasting impact.

125,topic-id,276,"Mr.President, we are looking at an outline for tax reform that helps working families in ways that those families haven't seen for almost a decade now--a decade of buying power that didn't go up and obligations that did, with more government requirements and less take-home pay. So we are going to be here for the next few weeks talking about what we can do to reverse that situation so that the opportunity for those families is reversed and that eventually we also reverse our competitiveness so that we create better jobs.  There are two ways to get more take-home pay. One is for the government to take less out of it--and I am for that--and the other one is to do things in the Tax Code to make us more competitive so that there are better jobs with better pay to start with. If we combine those two things--better jobs and better pay--with the government taking less out of that higher paycheck, that is really where families would like to be. We are going to be here talking about this in a way that drives toward a result.  The Senator from West Virginia is here, and she is basically going to start that effort today, as we really now have enough specifics on what the Finance Committee is looking at in the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee in the House and what the White House is looking at. We can begin to explain to American working families why this is the right course for them and for our country.  I am pleased to be joined here by Senator  The PRESIDING The Senator from West  ",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgS6159-7.txt,1464,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3823, DISASTER TAX RELIEF AND",2017.0,27.0,September
127,topic-id,1491,"Mr.President, when the Senator from West Virginia talked about the 40 percent that can come out of your hard work, the 2 days a week of a regular 5-day workweek--and many families are wishing they could get back to a 5-day workweek because they have really been stagnant in terms of the opportunities for their families for a long time. It is a good way to think about how hard families work just so the government can get more of their money.  This is a discussion about how the government can take less of your money. For everybody listening who wonders, ``Well, if the government is going to take less money--I thought the government already had a deficit''--we need to work on that. One way to work on that and the best way to work on that is to have more taxpayers--not higher tax rates but more taxpayers. We are looking at some tax changes here that would allow more taxpayers to share the burden, hopefully paying taxes, as I said earlier this afternoon, on a bigger paycheck to start with. You can take less money out of that paycheck, and the government gets more money because we have more people paying those taxes and more growth.  The 70-year average on growth since World War II is 3.4 percent. Every year, the economy was that much bigger than the year before. That ought to be achievable. For 70 years, we achieved that. We should be able to get back to that again if we do the right things. But for the last 8 to 9 years, that growth has been less than 2 percent.  Our problem is with jobs that aren't growing as they should in terms of what they pay and the government is not having the money it needs to defend the country and do other things. A lot of that could be solved by an economy that is thriving again. There has been 10 years of not seeing that happen.  We combine good tax policy with good regulatory policy, which means the regulatory excesses of the last few years clearly are being brought back under control. The Federal Government is beginning to look at regulation and being sure it is commonsense regulation again. Consumer confidence is growing. Every single month we look at those numbers, and they generally have been better each month than the month before. They certainly have been better the last 7 months than they were in any previous 7-month period of time for some time now. When we have a good tax policy and a good competitive policy, then before you know it, things begin to happen.  On stagnant income, you can see a study here that says, well, maybe the income hasn't gone up, but because things are a little less expensive and inflation has been so low and so many of the things families need are less expensive, they really have more money than they used to have. Try to explain that to mothers and fathers who are trying to buy five pairs of tennis shoes for five kids. You as a parent are trying to do something for your family every week or so that is a little bit extraordinary. If you don't have extra money, you cannot do any of that.  Over 75 percent of full-time workers in America say, when asked, that they are living paycheck to paycheck. Over 20 percent of Americans say they have zero savings. A much higher number says they have less than $400 or $500 in savings. These are people whose parents and grandparents worked hard to save whatever they could and would like to see that ability happen again.  We need lower taxes. We need better jobs. New jobs are impacted in Missouri, where 97 percent of all our businesses are small businesses. Most new job creation is created by small businesses. We ought to be sure that no matter what we do in the Tax Code, we do it in a way that allows small business to compete with big business in an effective way.  As for competitiveness, in the last 15 years, I think we are not as competitive as we used to be. Our corporate taxes used to be right in the middle. With corporations competing around the world, we were right in the middle. The middle in 2003 was 30 percent; our tax rate was 35 percent. The middle in 2015 was 22 percent; our tax rate was 35 percent. If you are going to compete, if you are going to create jobs, you are going to have to be sure you know how to compete.  Mr.President, you and I were able to see--at least I was able to see--for the first time yesterday, not being on the Finance Committee, the page that is generally agreed to as our starting point. There were lower rates for families, in fact, doubling the individual exemption. Today, if you are a couple, you start paying taxes after the first $12,000 of income. Under this proposal that exemption doubles to $12,000 each, so you would start paying taxes only after you have made the first $24,000. It is sort of a new tax bracket here--the zero tax bracket. It is the tax bracket in which you don't pay income taxes on the first $24,000, and then you start paying in a simpler system after that.  People would like the tax system to be simpler. People would like to have that postcard filing opportunity, where you say: This is how much money I made, here is my W-2 form that proves it, here is my standard exemption, and here is whatever else I am going to be allowed to exempt--my contributions to church, other charities, my mortgage payment. Those appear to be exemptions that will be left in the Code, but everyone would understand those. Suddenly, you have about three lines, and maybe, by the time you get to those three lines, your tax obligation goes away.  The amount of money people pay to get their taxes figured out in America would be the gross national product of lots of countries. We need a system that is simpler than that.  The death tax--you know, if you are a family farm or a small business and someone has stayed on that farm with you from your family or stayed in that business with you from your family, it is very hard to figure out, when the mom or dad dies, who created what wealth as you work side by side to create the wealth. By the way, you don't[[Page S6173]]have any wealth that you haven't paid taxes on already. You don't have anything you have accumulated that you haven't paid taxes on multiple times. There is an opportunity here to say that we are no longer going to go through that after trying to tax family farms and small businesses. The death tax is exactly that, and it doesn't work.  We are going to work to make America more competitive, American jobs more competitive. Again, one way to create more take-home pay--the best way to create more take-home pay--is better jobs to start with. We can have those better jobs if we work hard to be focused on competition, on regulation that makes sense, on tax policy that not only is simple but that everybody believes is fair. We have the greatest compliance of any country, I believe, in the history of the world, but people are less likely to comply if they don't think that the tax policy is fair and easily understood and means the same to everyone else. You shouldn't have to have the greatest accountants in the world to figure out what your taxes are or, frankly, to figure out what somebody else's taxes likely are. Fairness is important here, simplicity is important here, and competition and better jobs are important here.  (The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the Chair.)  We need better jobs for working families. I think that should be the flag that flies highest as we begin to look at how we reduce the tax burden and increase the opportunity for more people to be paying taxes because we have more people with better jobs.  I know two of the leaders here. That guy who just left the Chair, the Senator from North Carolina, and the Senator from Georgia have been real advocates for what we are trying to do now and also advocates for getting it done. We not only need to have this debate; we need to get this done.  In my view, this needs to be done this year. It needs to be impacting our economy by the first quarter of next year. I would suggest that nobody in this body understands the importance of competition more than the Senator from Georgia, Mr. I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

385,topic-id,1057,"Mr.President, I appreciate the words from all the colleagues I have seen. It is great to see bipartisan sentiments about dealing with the most powerful hurricanes in recorded history. These hurricanes have left thousands of families homeless, destroying infrastructure, and leaving most people without power for the foreseeable future. There are thousands of individual stories of loss of life, of loss of possessions, of everything people own, devastated by this storm.  What is important to me now is that we turn these words into action. I am grateful for the leadership we are seeing from the State of Texas and the State of Florida, but I want to focus in on what is happening in Puerto Rico and the Virgin We know, right now, close to 31.5 million American citizens on these islands are on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, including the 3.4 million people who live in Puerto Rico and over 100,000 Americans on the U.Virgin The American citizens living in Puerto Rico are part of a population that is bigger than the States of Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, and Alaska combined, but they don't have eight Senators representing them in this body--working for them, fighting for them.  When Superstorm Sandy hit New Jersey, I know the constant work Senator Menendez, I, and my predecessor Senator Frank Lautenberg put into working on making sure our communities could recover. We don't have direct Senators representing this incredible population of They don't have folks here every single day who are pressing for the interests of these Americans, for their safety, their security, their lives. We have to--the 100 of us--step up to make sure that we are focusing on the interests of our fellow Americans after what has been one of the worst storms in recorded history.  The Americans in Puerto Rico pay taxes. They love this country. They serve in the military. In fact, they serve in the military at a rate almost twice as high as the general U.population. These are patriots. They are our brothers and our sisters. These Americans deserve action from this body and from the President of the United  Puerto Rico's Governor has spoken directly to this crisis, noting that just 40 percent of the residents of Puerto Rico have access to drinking water--meaning that 2 million American citizens right now in Puerto Rico do not have access to clean drinking water. This is a serious crisis.  More than this, we know the vast majority of Puerto Rican residents still don't have electricity. They are struggling to access food. They do not have basic means of communications on the island, even to family here. They can't access bank accounts. Their sanitation systems have come to a complete standstill. Access to basic medications--often urgently needed medication and healthcare--is under threat.  It is estimated that it is going to take months before power comes back, and recovery and rebuilding will take years for the islands. The next few weeks of recovery are critically important in the effort to save lives.  I saw in Superstorm Sandy how it wasn't just the hurricane itself that took lives; in fact, in my city, it was in the hours and days after that people lost lives. We know that right now in Puerto Rico, every minute, every hour, every day we wait to get critical aid--necessary aid--our failure to act could mean the difference between life and death or between grave suffering and relieving that suffering for hundreds of thousands of people in Puerto Rico, as well as the U.Virgin  We cannot afford to wait any longer to better mobilize support and resources and help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands right now. I hope that over time we are able to develop larger and more comprehensive aid packages, such as those being discussed for survivors of the hurricanes in Florida and The urgency we have in Puerto Rico right now, the urgency we have to provide vital security, energy, food, and health needs--we must answer that urgency with action.  Puerto Rico needs U.military, disaster, and humanitarian assistance to maintain order and provide security, water, food, and fuel. Puerto Rico needs additional first responders, and they need generators, emergency vehicles, and fuel. Also, Puerto Rico needs to see that its government--the U.Government--will respond the way we have for other disasters.  There cannot be a double standard when it comes to We are one country. We are one Whether it was Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York or Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that ravaged Texas and Florida, when our Nation sees a natural disaster destroy the homes of thousands, take lives, knock down power--when a challenge like that comes to the United States of America, we must be there for our citizens. Yet I have read so many heartbreaking stories. This shows the lack of urgency, the lack of being present, the lack of being there when we are needed.  The Washington Post reported that when journalists were looking to go and provide coverage--somehow journalists are making it there to report on the extent of the damage--they were in a remote area of Puerto Rico when local residents saw them. Their first response was simply to ask: Are you FEMA? Are you our government? Are you coming to address the crisis?  Right now Americans are suffering. Right now Americans are facing devastation and potentially death in these hours and these days.  I worry about this body now heading toward Thursday or How can we in good conscience go back to our homes this weekend, knowing that hundreds of thousands of American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands may be homeless, may not have shelter, may not have food, and may not have water?

773,topic-id,881,"Mr.President, I rise to mark an important occasion in my home State of Arkansas and our country.  In September of 1957, nine young African-American teens who were determined to receive the same education that had only been available to their White peers became the focus of an event that had repercussions throughout the  When the Supreme Court ruled that the racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional in its 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, it paved the way for integration of public schools across the country.  Although the highest Court in the land had spoken, the process of desegregating the public schools was complex and still faced incredible opposition. Civil rights groups worked with citizens to help them enroll students of color in traditionally all-White schools. The Little Rock Nine were beneficiaries of such assistance from Daisy Bates and the Arkansas NAACP, among others.  On the first day of class in the fall of 1957, Little Rock Central High School became ground zero in the movement for public school integration. Governor Orval Faubus called in the Arkansas National Guard amid threats from pro-segregationists to hold protests at Central High and prevent any African-American students from entering the school. Unfortunately, the Guard was initially deployed in order to help thwart the integration effort, and as a result, Arkansas and Central High became a flashpoint that represented just how difficult integration would be, especially across the Despite the hostility, there were forces within Little Rock that were working together to successfully achieve a peaceful public school desegregation, starting with Central  Eventually, President Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division of the[[Page S6089]]U.Army to Little Rock and federalized the Arkansas National Guard to protect the students and ensure public safety at a time when tensions were running very high throughout the city. President Eisenhower's actions helped make it possible for the Little Rock Nine to actually enter the school and attend class. Even though they were allowed to attend Central High, the African-American students were still subjected to a daunting amount of abuse and hostility. They told stories of being threatened and intimidated by fellow students and mistreated by the school's administration.  Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, Jefferson Thomas, Terrence Roberts, Carlotta Walls LaNier, Minnijean Brown, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Thelma Mothershed, and Melba Pattillo Beals each chose to confront injustice and inequality in a very visible and courageous way. These Arkansans are now icons of the civil rights movement. Their actions and willingness to step forward and face what they had to have known would have been an incredibly difficult and emotional experience deserves celebration and recognition. By resolving to carry out these actions at such a young age, the Little Rock Nine set an example for Americans of every age to follow. It takes courage to do the right thing in the face of overwhelming adversity. That lesson has not been forgotten.  Arkansas has come a long way since the integration of Central While there is still work left to be done, Arkansans are proud of the progress we have made. Today, leaders and citizens across our State come together to promote equality and celebrate our diversity.  The theme of the 60th anniversary celebration of Central High's integration is ``Reflections of Progress.'' This is so appropriate given that we have indeed made so much progress in the years that have followed the tumultuous start to integration.  In an effort to ensure that the legacy of the Little Rock Nine lives on, exhibits and items recognizing their contributions are on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, The museum itself is a moving experience that I highly recommend for every visitor to our Nation's For Arkansans, we have an added incentive to visit in order to see the displays that honor the brave actions and determination of these Little Rock teens. We are also grateful that these items are on view for the entire country to observe and reflect upon.  The integration of Central High School serves as a poignant reminder of where we have been as a country but also of where we are headed. I am eager to work with my fellow Arkansans and all Americans as we pursue a better future for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren.  I am proud to support legislation introduced by my fellow Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton, to extend the boundary of the Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site in order to preserve the surrounding buildings. It is inspiring to know that our State is taking the opportunity to appropriately mark this significant occasion.  I commend the city of Little Rock, the Little Rock School District, and the Central High Integration 60th Anniversary Committee for the hard work and preparation to properly honor and celebrate this historic milestone. I thank all who have been involved in the planning of this celebration. I know that it will provide many Arkansans the chance to remember and reflect upon the Central High integration and the Little Rock Nine and also to educate younger generations about the struggle for equal rights.

Forced arbitration is a tool that big corporations use to silence victims of corporate fraud and corporate abuse. These victims never get to tell their stories to a judge or a jury of their peers. Why? Because of the small print in these contracts. Victims are pushed into a secret process behind closed doors, where corporations win about 90 percent of the time.  Over the past couple of weeks, I have had an opportunity to hear from some of these victims. Let me tell you about George from Mentor, George's wife suffered physical and mental abuse in a nursing home, but George and his wife have been denied a day in court. He said the lawyers he reached out to for help turned him away because they didn't think he had a chance fighting against the forced arbitration clause in his family's nursing home admittance agreement.  Any family who has been through the transition of admitting a loved one into a nursing home will tell you it is a difficult time in the best of circumstances. Forcing these families to sign away their rights is not only wrong. It is dangerous. Typically, because of all the trauma of moving a family member into a nursing home, you are not even aware that you have signed away your rights.  After the Equifax breach, my office was flooded with calls from scared consumers seeking help. Let me tell you about another one. Bill is from Hamilton, OH, which is at the other end of the State from He and his wife are retired, and they worked hard to pay their bills on time. He has had excellent credit, and this is the story of millions of That was all put at risk when Equifax allowed his family's personal information to be stolen, along with that of 143 million other It is pretty much half of the country.  This breach was so huge and harmed so many people that the company's CEO, Richard Smith, retired suddenly today. Well, he will probably have a very comfortable retirement. His compensation was millions of dollars a year. The millions of people he has harmed will continue to struggle with the mess that he left behind.  That is bad enough, but Equifax was also demanding that Bill in Hamilton, OH, give up his right to hold the company accountable in court if Bill signed up for their credit monitoring service. Do you remember, after the story broke--I believe it was in July when the executives found out about the 143 million Americans breached, or the 140-[[Page S6107]]plus million Americans breached--that a couple of executives sold some of their stock. That is interesting. We will see what happens about that. Then it became public in So we know that.  Now, we also know that Equifax, then, to make it up to their customers, said that they would give them a free year of credit monitoring. A year ago, I believe it was, when there was another situation like that of a data breech, Congress voted to protect Federal employees and to give them free credit monitoring for 10 years. But Equifax, generously--I believe some used that word, but they probably didn't--gave the 1 year, but they had a forced arbitration clause. It was only because of a staff person on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, that Cory saw that they had that provision in these contracts--this free year of credit monitoring--and Equifax decided to back off of that.  These forced arbitration clauses are incredibly powerful. To understand them better, big companies use the small print not just against regular families back in Ohio but even against people who could afford top-notch legal teams.  Gretchen Carlson, a well-known news anchor, endured sexual harassment at FOX but was prevented from suing her employer by a forced arbitration clause. She didn't really know that or hadn't thought much about that when she signed her contract. She wrote of forced arbitration: It is ``often argued to be a quicker and cheaper method of dispute resolution for employees'' but, ``instead [it] has silenced millions of women who otherwise may have come forward.''  The power of forced arbitration clauses to silence victims has allowed potentially millions of people to be harmed by big banks and other financial institutions.  Let's take another one, Wells In 2013, Wells Fargo used a forced arbitration clause to silence a customer who had accused the company of opening fake accounts in his name. You will remember that Wells Fargo opened as many as 3.5 million fake accounts, meaning they opened an account that the Senator from Texas or that I or others had not given permission to do so. They opened accounts in people's names. Obviously, I am not saying that personally of the Senator from Texas and me, but they opened 3 million fake accounts of customers who didn't even know these accounts had been opened. They subjected their employees to harsh sales goals. They threatened to fire anyone who didn't keep up.  Think about how much damage could have been prevented if that customer was allowed to take Wells Fargo to open court 4 years ago, but they couldn't because of forced arbitration.  Well, Equifax pulled back its use of forced arbitration clauses after the public shaming of what they did, but Wells Fargo seems to have no shame in continuing to hide behind arbitration following scandal after scandal. You will remember what Warren Buffet, who is a major stockholder in Wells Fargo, said: You rarely find just one cockroach in the kitchen. Well, with Wells Fargo, there was one case after they said: This is it. Then, there was another, and they said: Well, this is it. Then, there was another one. We don't know what is next.  We know that many of the victims of Wells Fargo's scandal were servicemembers. In 2015, Santander Bank illegally repossessed cars from servicemembers and, then, used a forced arbitration clause to silence their claims. So they are willing to go against servicemembers, in the case of Wells Fargo is willing to do it against servicemembers. Wells Fargo is willing to do it against up to 3.5 million customers for whom they opened fake accounts.  Servicemembers and all Americans deserve to be protected from this shady legal fine print. That is what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done with its new rule on the issue of forced arbitration--a rule that some in this body want to overturn.  It is despicable that Congress is trying to cover for big corporations looking to cheat consumers and overturn this rule. Make no mistake. Voting to overturn the CFPB rule about forced arbitration is simply saying that we support corporations' ability and efforts to cheat their consumers. They simply don't have their day in court.  The American Legion adopted a resolution at its national conference last month opposing repeal of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule. They understand that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau did the right thing to protect servicemembers from forced arbitration.  John Kamin, assistant director of the American Legion's veterans employment and education division, said: ``Our membership has stated unequivocally that we will not accept a future where our military veterans' financial protections are chipped away to increase the margins of the financial sector.''  Let me say that again: ``We will not accept a future''--this is from the American Legion--``where our military veterans' financial protections are chipped away to increase the margins of the financial sector.''  The right to have your day in court is enshrined in the Constitution that our servicemembers fight to uphold. The least we can do is to protect this right for the women and the men who protect our country--to protect this right for the men and the women who protect our country.  How can Members of this body, when this vote approaches, if they support the CRA to overturn the rule of the CFPB, look those servicemen and servicewomen in the eyes and explain that they chose to stand with Wall Street over these people who served their country and over their families and over hard-working people all across America?  It is our job to protect the people we serve, not to protect Wall Street banks and corporations when they try to scam consumers. Big companies use small print to silence the hard-working Americans they have cheated.  When a resolution to repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule comes to this floor, I urge my colleagues to speak up for the people whom we serve.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Disaster Relief for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands  Mr.President, I want to take a moment for the millions of American citizens who are fighting for their lives in Puerto Rico, to never ever forget that the people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are, in fact, American citizens.  It has been 5 days since Hurricane Maria ripped through the island of Puerto People are without power, they are without communication, and in many cases with no end in sight.  My staff has checked to see the condition of the veterans hospitals, both in Puerto Rico and in the three American Virgin There has been a mixed response. Some of them are up and running with electricity and water. Some of them are running with a generator. Some of them have been simply suspended or closed for a period of time.  It is up to us to make sure--one of the first things we can do is make sure those hospitals are served and running, and there is obviously so much more we need to do.  Much of the island of Puerto Rico remains mostly cut off from San The government has dispatched runners on foot to try to maintain contact in towns outside the capital. Towns are blocked from rescuers. Patients are worried they will run out of medicine.  The Washington Post talked to a woman in a mountain town. Her mother has diabetes. They have no power. She worries they will run out of prescriptions or generator fuel to keep her insulin refrigerated. I repeat. These are citizens of the United States of She is worried her mother's ulcer will become infected. She fans her mother with a piece of cardboard to keep the flies away.  These are American citizens. We cannot ignore them. Puerto Rico's secretary of the Department of Agriculture estimated the storm wiped out 80 percent of the crop value on the island. Entire farms were wiped out. Entire plantations are destroyed. One farmer said there will be no food in Puerto Officials predict the storm will set the island back for decades.  Listen to Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's representative in Understand that Puerto Rico elects a Congressman or, in this case, a She comes here. She doesn't have voting rights on the floor of the House of Representatives so Puerto Rico has representation but not the kind of representation Oklahoma or Ohio has, but, again, they are citizens of the United States of  The Resident Commissioner said:       The devastation . . . has set us back 20 to 30 years. I      can't deny that the Puerto Rico of now is different from that      of a week ago. The destruction of properties, of flattened      structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere.      The island's greenery is gone.  Our country has been hit hard by hurricanes this year. I was proud of the way we came together in this body to support the people of Texas after Hurricane That seems almost like ancient history. We have seen bipartisan cooperation on getting aid to Florida following Hurricane Our job is far from done. There is more to do.  We must do the same thing for our brothers and sisters, our fellow American citizens in Puerto We need to provide relief to the people of Puerto Rico with all the resources we always provide to American citizens when Mother Nature deals us a devastating blow. We can't allow children and grandparents to die waiting for help in our own backyard.                 Tribute to Cathy Glenn and Dave Ahart  Mr.President, this building is full of people who work hard to make our government function. I am not really talking about I am talking about low-paid workers in our cafeteria, I am talking about people who keep the offices clean for our constituents, I am talking about the tour guides who give[[Page S6090]]Americans from all over the country a glimpse of the historic buildings, and I am talking about the clerks right here on the Senate floor. These people work so hard in the background. Too often they don't get the credit they deserve serving the American public. I want to honor two of them today.  This week, the Senate is losing two of the kindest, most cheerfully hard-working and imaginative people in this building, my dear friends Cathy Glenn and Dave  For nearly three decades, Cathy and Dave worked in the Senate recording studio, helping all of us do one of our most important jobs, talking with and listening to the people with whom we serve.  For a decade, I have spent my Thursday mornings--virtually every Thursday morning the Senate is in session--with Cathy and Every Thursday morning, I go to the radio studio to talk with radio stations across It is early. It is toward the end of the week so no one would blame them for being quiet or even being grumpy, but Dave and Cathy always bring joy to everyone around them.  Because of them and Ohio's great radio hosts, Thursday morning is among the highlights of my week here. We share friendship. We share baseball. They give me baseball trivia questions I can later then test on Senator McCain or Senator They do all right, I should say.  Anyone who knows me knows I am a Cleveland Indians fan. The Indians have won 29 out of the last 31--never equaled in Major League history, except in 1884, it is believed.  I am also a pretty big fan of baseball trivia, and that is something Dave, Cathy, and I share. About every week since 2007, I arrive at the radio studio to a new baseball trivia question before I do my radio interview. We lost the records from the first couple of years, but the first question we have on record is dated July 29, 2010: Name the only two Hall of Fame pitchers--at that time--with losing records.  Sometimes they give me hints, especially early in the morning.  They had hints. Hint 1: One pitcher was a starter and one was a reliever. Hint 2: One of the pitchers pitched in the big leagues from 1948 to 1965. Hint 3: One of them pitched for the Major Leagues from 1968 to 1985. The answer is--not to keep you in suspense--Satchel Paige, who played for the Indians and Louis Lifetime, he had 28 wins and 31 losses, but he was one of the greatest pitchers in the Negro He was born in the early 1900s, starting in the 1920s, when he was perhaps the single best pitcher in the Negro The Cleveland Indians, under the ownership of Bill Veeck, soon after they signed Larry Doby, the first Black player in the league, signed Satchel Paige, who helped to take the Indians to the World Series that year.  The other pitcher was Rollie Fingers of Steubenville, He played for the Oakland A's and San Diego He had 114 wins and 118 losses. He had more losses than he had wins because he was a closer or relief pitcher who finished off games, and typically they have more losses than they have wins. I don't want to go into those details on the Senate floor because many people who are listening probably don't really care, but I do, and so I am going to continue.  Dave and Cathy's dedication to America's game and to bringing joy to their jobs didn't end there. They made baseball dioramas, a word I did not even know until I came to the Senate and met them. Sometimes a baseball diorama is sort of a 3-D replication of a baseball stadium, complete with a nod to their favorite baseball-loving canine, my dog Franklin People who know me know that of course our dog is named after Franklin  They celebrated opening day every April--all of us having hope for the next year--with popcorn, peanuts, and crackerjacks in the radio studio. What always moved me wasn't just the love for baseball--that counted for a lot--but their incredible kindness, thoughtfulness, and joy of living. That is what makes them such good friends to each other, to Connie, Rachel, and me.  I can't think of anyone in this building who deserves a long, happy retirement more than Dave and I wish them years of time spent with friends and loved ones and with a husband and a wife watching a lot of baseball games. Selfishly, I wish Dave and Cathy wouldn't go. Your friendship has meant so much to me. Thursday mornings just will not be the same.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

86,topic-id,1310,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 533 provides for the consideration of two bills which were reported by the House Ways and Means  For the first bill, H.2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and The rule waives all points of order and makes in order no further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is afforded the customary motion to recommit.  For H.2824, the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, the rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided between the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Ways and The Rules Committee made in order four amendments to H.2824, one Republican amendment, two Democratic amendments, and one bipartisan amendment. Finally, the rule provides for the customary motion to recommit with or without instructions.  H.2792, the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, amends the Social Security Act to give the Social Security Administration the necessary tools to prevent Federal benefits and payments from being made to persons who are actually on the run from the law.  Many people might hear this and think: Why would the government ever continue to pay someone who is actively fleeing from law enforcement?  It is a legitimate question, and it has an unfortunate answer.  In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into law. One major provision of this reform bill was a restriction on the ability of fugitive felons and probation and parole violators from receiving Social Security benefits.                              {time}  1230  Similar provisions have been included in other Federal entitlement programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. This policy was expanded in 2004, with the passage of the Social Security Protection  However, subsequent to the passage of these commonsense reforms, several judges in cases from the mid-2000s ruled that the Social Security Administration's interpretation of these provisions was too broad and limited the Social Security Administration's ability to curtail payments to three narrow categories of fugitives, namely: escape, flight to avoid prosecution or confinement, and flight escape.  The bill before the House today, H.2792, would restore Congress' original intent to the reforms passed under both Presidents Clinton and George Specifically, H.2792 would prohibit an individual who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation from receiving monthly Social Security income payments. This applies only to felony charges or a crime carrying a minimum term of 1 year or more in prison.  This legislation would not punish individuals convicted of a misdemeanor, such as outstanding parking tickets. In fact, some people have falsely claimed that.  Individuals who have potentially committed a felony or a parole violation should not be able to use taxpayer dollars to evade capture. Providing the Social Security Administration with the tools in H.2792 is a commonsense way to show that the Federal Government is sincere in its commitment to being a good steward of Federal taxpayer dollars. The Social Security benefits can be restored once the individual resolves the outstanding issues related to his or her warrant or parole violation.  I want to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota, Kristi Noem, for her work on this legislation, and I urge Members of the House to support this worthy bill.  The second bill in today's rule, H.2824, the Increasing Opportunity Through Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, extends funding for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which is more commonly referred to as  The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program is an important program that provides low-income families with opportunities to receive home-visiting services to help support a child's first years. These services range from prenatal care to early childhood services and allow for children to grow up in healthy homes.  As not only a physician but a physician who specialized in obstetrics and gynecology, I did spend 25 years working with pregnant women and families to help ensure that all mothers could deliver and raise healthy children. As an OB/GYN, I know the best way to ensure that a child succeeds is to invest in long-term services and to ensure that the child receives access to appropriate care.  Because of the Nurse-Family Partnership's work, 90 percent of all babies who are supported by the organization are born full term, 95 percent of those babies receive all their immunizations by 24 months, and nearly 89 percent of those mothers breastfeed their newborns.  These are important milestones for newborn children that can have lasting impacts on their health for the rest of their lives, and it is important that we support initiatives that support vital, lifesaving programs like these.  Furthermore, the program succeeds by not only supporting the health and well-being of children, but by supporting pregnant women and mothers as well. In my home State of Texas, the reported incidence of maternal mortality has increased in recent years, in part, as the State has collected more comprehensive data on causes of death up to a year after childbirth.[[Page H7501]]  While no amount of maternal mortality is ever acceptable, the new data has shown us that the causes for maternal mortality in the State have shifted away from those traditional acute cases that I was familiar with during my residency back in the 1970s. There were illnesses such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, hemorrhage, and infection during pregnancy. Now it is different. We have cardiac disease, suicide, and opioid overdose, which oftentimes occurs in the months after childbirth.  By supporting children in their first years, MIECHV can not only help children live healthy lives, but help mothers live healthy lives as well, so that they can continue to be there for their children.  The MIECHV Program and organizations like the Nurse-Family Partnership succeed because they identify families in need that do not have readily available care and work to provide services in home settings.  Families cannot raise healthy children without access to care. When families cannot find providers in their area, MIECHV grant recipients are there to provide that support.  H.2824 builds upon the successes of the MIECHV Program by tailoring the program to ensure that it can continue to help families that truly need the help.  For example, H.2824 requires for States receiving MIECHV grants to conduct statewide needs assessments by 2020, in order to reaffirm which populations and communities should receive these services. The last time such an assessment was required was in 2010.  As the needs of populations of States have evolved over these past 10 years, so should the program as well. It is important to ensure that tax dollars continue to be invested efficiently, and this bill ensures that MIECHV can continue to do so.  Additionally, H.2824 provides additional opportunities for States to promote quality and enhanced outcomes. The bill updates the program by allowing for States to promote models that will have greater impact on multiple sites and locations, thus expanding the reach of grants and providing States with the opportunity to reimburse grant recipients based on the quality and outcomes associated with their programs.  I certainly want to thank members of the Ways and Means Committee for the work they have put into this bill. It is a smart bill that continues a Federal program for low-income families that actually has evidence of its effectiveness and, furthermore, links future funding to the assurance of greater cost-effectiveness.  This program serves as a model for Federal programs to help low-income families and children. I want to thank Chairman Smith and Chairman Brady for their efforts on this bill.  For these reasons, I encourage everyone in this body to support this rule and the underlying bill today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

115,topic-id,1860,"Mr.President, I rise to strongly oppose the nomination of Ajit Pai to serve a second term as Chairman of the  Since taking over the FCC leadership in January, Chairman Pai wasted no time moving the agency away from its key mission to promote the use and deployment of communications in the public interest. For example, he has been involved in dismantling the rules that preserve the diversity of content in media ownership, potentially negatively impacting forever the number and variety of voices in the media market.  In addition, his confirmation to this important position will also have a negative impact on one of the most important issues, I believe, of our time; that is, preserving net neutrality. A strong and open internet is key to an economy of the future--to promoting an environment for innovation and facilitating the creative jobs that are going to come along with an open internet architecture.  Chairman Pai is poised to undo the bedrock principles that are already in place to protect an open internet. Even in the face of evidence that these rules are important to an internet economy and millions of jobs, he is determined to try to rewrite them.  On Monday, the Senate will vote on whether to confirm Ajit Pai for another term as Chairman of the As I have said, I think his leadership has shown that on net neutrality, he believes the rules should be changed. As long as he continues to hold that position, I cannot support his nomination.  As the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, he has demonstrated disdain for the important public interest principles he is supposed to be upholding. He shows a disregard for the innovators in America that are striving to build the economy of the future. The public interest mission of the FCC is encoded in the agency's The law that created the FCC clearly states that the agency's mission includes promoting equal access to communications networks for all people around the United This means the FCC has the responsibility to promote the expansion of communications networks and to ensure they have the incentive and ability to compete fairly with one another in providing broadband services. The mission does not include letting a big telecom company or cable company run over small businesses or consumers and saying to them: Unless you pay me more, I am not going to give you essential services. Imagine if that happened to the telephone industry decades ago, if you couldn't get access because someone had decided, ``I'm going to let the highest bidder rule the roost.''  The President's nomination of Pai and his desire to have him continue as Chair continues to show a desire to undermine the internet and the internet economy. As soon as he was appointed, Chairman Pai announced his intention, as Chairman, to go against the demands of American consumers and reverse the rules that are already on the books to protect consumers. Chairman Pai wants to make it possible for those big telecom and cable companies to erect toll lanes that would further burden the nature of the internet and innovation that its economy supports. He plans to go against more than 10 million American consumers and innovators who have told him to keep the internet open and free.  Recent studies have shown that the internet economy is now over 7 percent of U.GDP, it employs 7 million people and is worth a trillion dollars. Our strong, robust internet rules, without question, have helped keep that economic growth. Our economy is in a massive technological transformation. It is in an information age, and in an information age, making sure you have an open internet is going to be key to continuing to grow business.  Every business plan of every startup relies on the ability of consumers to get equal access to content. Largely, as a result of the innovations, the open internet has created hundreds of thousands of tech jobs in the United The internet economy is almost a trillion dollars, and at 7 percent of GDP, it is growing faster and stronger than many other sectors, including construction, mining, utilities, agriculture, education, and entertainment.  It is disturbing to me that Chairman Pai has made it clear he wants to rewrite the rules that protect those businesses and create an artificial fast and slow lane and ``if you want out of the slow lane, you better pay me more money.'' We can't afford to do that for all the internet applications and all the small businesses that are continuing to work on growing our economy. We need to make sure that instead of shedding jobs in the United States, as we did in the last economic downturn, that we are creating jobs and creating power for consumers.  We have seen what has been termed the ``app economy,'' which consists of everybody who makes money has a job thanks to a mobile app that was also powered by the internet. Today, 1.7 million Americans have jobs because of that economy. Nearly 92,000 of them are in the State of Over the past 5 years, that app economy and those jobs have grown at an annual rate of 30 percent. The average growth rate for all other jobs is 1.6 percent. So, literally, Chairman Pai is trying to clog the arteries of one of the fastest growing economic opportunities in  By 2020, the app economy is estimated to grow to over $100 billion. This demonstrates that the internet economy is a dynamic, supercharged, job-creating engine, with economic growth that should not be artificially slowed down because some industries believe they have the right to do so.  These facts, and making sure we protect an open internet, are why we should not support Chairman  The slow lanes and the fast lanes are not like a highway where a consumer or business can take another route or plan another course. Here, you are creating barriers that are wedges between businesses and their consumers, between doctors and their patients, between industry solution providers and the customers they are trying to serve.  The growth of the internet platform for economic activity is something we do not want to see destroyed, and Chairman Pai's dismantling of that robust internet architecture and the support it gives to innovators is extremely troubling to me.  I think about all the internet applications that I have seen in my State, whether it is a business like McKinstry that provides building efficiencies to school districts all over our State and in Puget Let's pretend now that McKinstry, which is trying to tell North Shore School District that they are using too much power could reduce their costs by just doing three simple things--but now, all of a sudden, because the net neutrality rules go away, McKinstry has to charge that school district more if they want to get that information to them on time. A clogged artery will not get the information to that school district when it is needed in time to make an adjustment.  Let's talk about a doctor in a rural area who receives information about a patient who comes into their emergency room but wants a consult with a doctor in Seattle, and all of a sudden, now their connectivity is slowed down unless they pay more money.  I also think about this issue in the context of just some very everyday ways we experience the impact of an open internet. Like people going to get coffee. In my State, they will now preorder. They go online, and then they show up to get their coffee--all so they can avoid the long lines. But now, all of a sudden, if net neutrality goes away, is that going to mean another charge or, an extra toll, just to get consumers connected to the coffee shop so they can avoid a long line? Are cable companies and internet service providers going to say to the consumer: You have to pay more if you want a fast lane.  What Chairman Pai doesn't realize is that the internet is now a full-blown ecosystem with many attachments; that the internet is like the artery system that connects it all and connects it in so many ways beyond even our imagination. Yet he is proposing to clog those arteries, to hold us ransom if only we will tell a cable company it is OK to charge the American consumer more.[[Page S6164]]  We cannot afford to ruin the internet economy by doing this. We need to have an open internet architecture that allows everybody to access this information at the same time and the same rate so that we can continue to innovate.  There are ways to grow the internet and grow internet investment in the delivery system. In fact, during the time period of the open internet rules, we have seen just that--a continued investment. So we do not now have to rewrite these rules. We do not now have to throw a roadblock, a hurdle, a clogging of the arteries at the small business and internet economy that is growing so rapidly with all its devices.  God forbid that one of our colleagues would be on the other side of town and get a delayed message about when a vote started just because we in the Senate hadn't bought a higher, faster speed lane, and maybe they would miss a vote. It is hard to say what slowing down the internet artificially would do because it is so connected to everything we do today, and that is why we have to stop this from happening.  I would be happy to hear that Chairman Pai has decided to drop his insistence on trying to change the rules of an open internet. If he did that, I might think differently about his nomination. But until then I will continue to fight for my State's economy, which depends so greatly on net neutrality, and continue to fight for the millions of consumers around the United States who are trying to grow what are smarter, more intelligent, more cost-effective businesses.  Even the healthcare debate we just had is instructive on the issues of net neutrality--I believe in home healthcare. I believe we can implement it and drive down costs. But if you are telling a patient that they might not get the information back from their doctor for days because he can't afford a fast internet connection that the cable companies are charging, then I guarantee my colleagues we are not going to reduce our healthcare costs.  So, please, I say to my colleagues, you will not have another chance at this. You will hear from your constituents about this issue, and you will not be able to take back this vote. Please make sure you understand that Chairman Pai is marching ahead on a very different anti-consumer road, and because of that, I am not going to vote for someone who is going to slow down and clog the internet.  I urge my colleagues to vote no on Chairman Pai's nomination.  I thank the Presiding  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority whip.                               Tax Reform  ",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgS6159-7.txt,172,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,27.0,September
126,topic-id,1171,"Thank you, Mr.President, and thank you, Senator Blunt, for your leadership.  I am excited about what we are talking about today. I am excited for my State of West The main thing that people in West Virginia want is a good job. A good job, with more take-home pay and a higher wage, is exceedingly important to the families I represent, so tax reform and any other policies Congress could support will enhance growth and create more job opportunities around the country.  Let me focus on my State of West According to the Economic Innovation Group, more than 34 percent of West Virginians are living in distressed communities. Unfortunately, that number is the third highest of any State in the country. At the same time, only 3.4 percent of West Virginians are living in prosperous communities.  There are States that are prosperous and have done very well, but the vast majority of our States have really struggled. Only two in five communities have seen any job growth in the past 5 years during our so-called recovery. That is not the definition of a recovery. Since 2010, fully 50 percent of U.job growth has occurred in just 2 percent of our country's counties. Think about that. Economic growth has only occurred in 2 percent of the counties across this great country.  The truth is that most of our country has been mired in economic stagnation. We have been standing still. I saw Lou Holtz give a speech one time, and he said: If you are standing still, you are going backward. If you are not moving forward, you are going backward. There has been a slow recovery, but for many West Virginians, there has been no recovery at all.  But it isn't all doom and gloom in our State because we have an opportunity for change--the change we really need that helps our struggling, working-class families, that changes and revitalizes our distressed communities, changes that lead to economic growth and creates opportunity for future generations.  In fact, West Virginia, in the first quarter, grew by 3 percent. We were the second fastest in growth in the entire To be sure, one quarter of growth is not a trend, but it does demonstrate the potential that we have if we do it right here for our citizens. The potential of capital growth is there, but one of the biggest drags on our economy in recent years has been excessive regulations, which we have addressed quite a bit here in the first 9 months of President Trump's term. We have worked hard to bring reason into the regulatory environment and also our burdensome Tax  What can we do? We can reduce taxes that impede our growth. Let's think about our small businesses. In many States, they are the major economic driver of our economy. In my State of West Virginia, 95.6 percent of the businesses are small businesses. They employ nearly half of the West Virginia private sector workforce, so nearly half of West Virginians are working in what is defined as a small business. Yet they can face a tax rate as high as 39.6 percent. Think about that. If you own a bakery or an accounting firm, in a 5-day workweek, you have to work Monday and Tuesday just to pay the government. It is no wonder that small businesses have found it difficult to open, let alone succeed, in many parts of our country.  The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. A lot of people are asking, how does that influence me? It is influencing the working American because the working American is bearing the brunt of that tax. Because of our outdated Tax Code, real wages for most workers have barely increased over the years. West Virginians understand that, as hard as they work, the government is taking more money from them. It costs them more money every time they go to the grocery store, every time they buy clothing for their children, every time they try to buy a new car. It is just more expensive with no growth in their wages to be able to bear that expense. It feels impossible to get ahead.[[Page S6172]]  We see that all around our States and localities. We see people thinking, I can't get ahead, and I haven't been able to over the last 5 to 10 years. I am starting to think it is impossible.  But we can fix this. It is not impossible. We can create an environment in which there is more opportunity available and wages are higher by modifying our Tax We can have a simpler system with lower rates, and families can see relief from the complexity of our Tax I have seen it stacked up before. If you haven't, I am 5 feet 3 inches, and I think it is taller than I am when stacked up page to page.  Along with the complexities, people need to keep more of their hard-earned money. It will help our companies grow. When our companies grow, what happens? We have more jobs, fairer taxes, and best of all, besides more jobs, we have higher paychecks. With more earnings, companies can hire new workers, increase wages, and invest in new developments. These are changes that I think West Virginians are hungry for.  The time is now. The stagnation we have felt over the last decade has worn us down, has made us lose our optimism about being able to have a better life than our parents had or our children thinking they could have a better life than we had. You know, the American dream is sort of fading for a lot of people, so comprehensive tax reform can provide that kind of relief.  I am excited that we can create that environment of optimism, that environment of confidence in not just our companies and our ability to create more jobs and raise our paychecks, but that confidence that we need as a country that, yes, we can live in our communities in rural America, like West Virginia or North Carolina or Missouri, that we can live in those communities, have a great chance to move ahead, have a good retirement when we decide we are at the end of the line in terms of our working career, and also pass on to the next generation a competitive environment that can compete financially anywhere in the world.  We know we can compete anywhere in the world in a lot of different areas. Right now, we are on an uneven playing field. When we change this and when we fix this--because we can fix this--that will change the playing field for every single American who gets up in the morning or goes to work in the evening, to have the confidence that things are going to be better for them.  I thank the Senator from Missouri, and I look forward to talking about this over the next several weeks.

Countless West Virginians, Americans, and people all over the world have benefited and continue to benefit from the endeavors of Betty and her late husband, Alex  Betty received her degree in commerce from the Ohio State University in 1939; it was there that she met Alex, and the two would begin their lifelong proclivity toward helping the underprivileged.

23,topic-id,1522,"Mr.President, today I wish to voice my support for the eighth annual Climate Week NYC, which took place in New York City from September 18 to 24. The 2017 Climate Week brought together businesses, governments, academics, civil society, and other stakeholders to advance international action and cooperation to better understand the science and challenges of climate change and to plan and execute actions to address this ever-evolving crisis facing humanity. Climate Week traditionally occurs during the U.General Assembly in support of enhanced dialogue to advance international cooperation between nations and, since 2015, to ensure the success of the Paris agreement.  As the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I strongly believe climate diplomacy must be a top priority for U.foreign policy. Climate change poses an imminent and long-term threat to not only our national security and economic success, but also the long-lasting prosperity of this country. Addressing this crisis requires collective action and cooperation by local and national representatives, small and large businesses, and every one of us. If the U.is to maintain our status as the world's superpower, it is in our best interest to lead the global effort to address the serious challenges posed by climate change. When America leads, we not only protect and enhance our own interests, but we have the unique ability to bring others along and help forge consensus, but regardless of whether the U.continues to lead or if we retreat, as the President's decision to withdraw the U.from the Paris agreement suggests he is interested in doing, the rest of the world has made it quite clear that they plan to press ahead with or without us.  That is a sad day for America's global leadership. Moreover, it is foolish to believe that the collaborative policies and multilateral efforts around reducing global emissions will not affect the United States simply because we choose not to participate.  For example, the Trump administration refused to participate in the development of the G20's ``Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth,'' which outlines a global economic partnership plan for a clean energy future. This week, Canada, the EU, and China are hosting a climate ministerial meeting of 30 major and emerging economies in Montreal to develop multilateral actions to advance the implementation of the Paris agreement. Fortunately, the administration will be represented at this ministerial event, but not at the same levels of power as most other countries participating. Moreover, the U.is merely participating, when it would best serve of our interests to lead an engagement like this, where we could be steering the agenda, as opposed to ceding such leadership to  Increased global demand for clean energy and the incorporation of carbon accounting into world markets are clear signals that the global economy is on a low-carbon trajectory. If we stand on the sidelines as these changes in international economics take shape--with Syria and Nicaragua as the only other nations not party to the agreement--we will be the loser.  Denying the scientific and real world evidence of climate change is irresponsible, and it is equally irresponsible to deny or ignore the economic shifts occurring around the world as a result of international efforts to combat climate change.  Climate change is real. The science is indisputable. While hurricanes have always happened this time of year over the North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, changes in the global climate--because of increased carbon emissions into the atmosphere from human activity--have created warmer atmospheric and surface water conditions that are increasing the likelihood of intensely powerful hurricanes.  We have seen the destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and the devastating effects they have brought to millions of My thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected. First and foremost, our country must assist and provide relief to those affected. That includes our citizens and their neighbors in the  As we come together as a nation to help survivors in need now, we must also act to reduce future risks and protect more people from becoming victims in the future. That means acknowledging the reality of climate change and acting to reduce pollution that has been scientifically proven to be changing our environment and causing the increased intensity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires.  In addition to the rises in sea levels, record-breaking droughts are plaguing regions in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and East NASA's ongoing research on climate change shows the significance of human-induced climate change, threatening our national security and our socioeconomic and diplomatic ties across the world. Reviewing the evidence we are presented with, it is clear the only way we can tackle climate change is through global leadership and action based on science and based on the urgency of preserving our way of life.[[Page S6129]]  Here at home, every city and State bears some risk from the effects of climate change. Fortunately, many State and local and private sector leaders recognize this reality. Despite the absence of leadership from the Trump administration, these individuals and the States, localities, and businesses they represent across many sectors are taking a stand against the national security threats posed by climate change.  Even though the President's actions on the Paris agreement are demoralizing, this by no means equals defeat for our Nation and the rest of the world.  One way to show other nations we are indeed committed to this global cause is to join them by building on the progress we have made here in our own country from the local to national level. Domestic climate change and clean energy policy, including substantial investments in clean energy research, development, and production, have made the U.an incubator for investment and entrepreneurship. Creating a robust domestic market helps companies develop credible track records, skilled workforces, and scalable products to export around the world to a market hungry for clean energy solutions. This is where domestic action intersects with U ``climate diplomacy.''  We should look toward U.corporations that are shifting to cleaner technology as an illustration of our continued fight against climate change. U.political leadership in innovation and technology combined with increased global demand for clean energy technology can help create transformational job growth opportunities across the United Each day we dither on making the right political choices on clean energy is a day we lose global clout to China, India, and other nations who are racing to fill the void our current retreat has created.  As we look to be more resilient to climate change, our global partners have already started to combat the issues through innovation and adaptation. For example, Holland's recent shift to innovate against flooding is a good example of how other nations are actively working to adapt to climate change and create financial opportunities.  Holland's shift to high-tech water management systems will protect against future flooding and scarcity of freshwater sources. These are technologies that the Dutch will likely export to other nations and regions at risk of flooding, so the Dutch will profit from the investments they have made and the experiences they have gained taking prudent measures to protect themselves against the effects of sea level rise.  This strategic measure sets an example for how the U.should work collectively with businesses and local governments to set aside funding proactively for future climate change mitigation and adaptation. Taking this sort of action would not only benefit my home State of Maryland because of its low coastal geography, but also States like New York and South  According to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, Manhattan and the other boroughs have experienced a significant increase in flooding events, attributable to local sea levels having risen an average of 1.2 inches per decade since 1900, a trend that will only worsen without decisive action to stabilize Earth's climate. There is no doubt that adapting our infrastructure to withstand the effects of climate change will provide substantial benefits to our communities and our economy.  We are fortunate that some corporations such as the members of the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable, BIER, are stepping up to reduce carbon emissions. BIER's commitment to reduce energy consumption and better manage water resources are important examples of how U.industry is demonstrating leadership in advancing environmental sustainability and addressing environmental challenges.  More than 900 U.businesses support keeping the U.in the Paris agreement, including more than 20 Fortune 500 companies. American businesses need the U.Government at the negotiating table to represent their interests. Acting to prevent the worst effects of climate change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for Maryland and our Such an ambitious global goal can only be achieved through strategic action starting at the local level, supported by a Congress and President through policy and political courage.  Fighting climate change is essential to U.national security interests and to growing U.economic opportunities. Meanwhile, the world continues to look to us for leadership. I remain motivated to join my colleagues and people across the country to fight global climate change so that we can demonstrate our Nation's commitment to leading climate diplomacy and to maintain the American private sector's strength in a changing global economy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6128.txt,,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,26.0,September

884,topic-id,3910,"Mr.President, I rise in support of the bipartisan Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act of 2017, which I am introducing with Senators Blunt and Nelson today. This legislation seeks to make a real difference in the lives of Americans suffering from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.  Kidney disease is the 9th leading cause of death in the United States, and unfortunately, more than 1 in 10 Americans today suffer from some form of kidney disease. More than 661,000 Americans are living with kidney failure or end-stage renal disease, which is an irreversible condition that can be fatal without a kidney transplant or life-sustaining dialysis. Of these, 468,000 patients in our Country rely on life-sustaining dialysis care to survive and roughly 193,000 live with a functioning kidney transplant.  This legislation seeks to promote research, expand patient choice, and improve care coordination for these hundreds of thousands of patients. Specifically, it would identify payment disincentives that create barriers to kidney transplants. The bill would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit a comprehensive report on how and to what extent palliative care is utilized in treating individuals with advanced kidney disease and the effect of palliative care on the quality of life and treatment outcomes of individuals with It would also direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to evaluate and report on the biological, social, and behavioral factors related to kidney disease and efforts to slow the progression of disease in minority populations disproportionately affected by this disease.  This legislation would improve access to pre-dialysis kidney education programs to better manage patients' kidney disease and even prevent kidney failure in some cases. Nephrologists and other health professionals would be incentivized to work in underserved rural and urban areas, and current payment policies would be modified to encourage home dialysis, which is not incentivized under the current Medicare payment structure. Patients with acute kidney injury would also be allowed to receive treatments through dialysis providers, therefore reducing costs associated with care provided in the more expensive hospital outpatient setting. Perhaps most importantly, our legislation would guarantee access to Medigap policies to all ESRD Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of age. Currently, Medicare patients under 65, whether disabled or ESRD beneficiaries do not have access to Medigap plans, even though Medicare is their primary insurance.  Lastly, the bill would expand the options for patients by allowing individuals diagnosed with kidney failure to enroll in the Medicare Advantage program starting in plan year 2020 and reauthorizing on a permanent basis the Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plan for patients with kidney failure.  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Blunt and Senator Nelson in supporting the Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act of 2017, which will improve the care of patients who suffer from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                1890       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

1031,topic-id,853,"Mr.President, first, I want to compliment Senator Portman for his leadership on this issue of ending modern-day slavery and trafficking. The United States is taking the leadership globally in fighting trafficking.  We had the Trafficking in Persons Report that is looked upon as being the most authoritative document on how well every country is doing in fighting modern-day slavery and trafficking, but we must make sure we take care of issues here at home.  I applaud Senator Portman's efforts to make sure we do everything in this country we can to protect those victims who are being trafficked for sex or labor. We need to redouble our efforts. I compliment my colleague for his leadership in this area. I can tell him that all of us here want to work with him to make sure America continues to lead in our fight to end modern-day slavery.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, I would like to say one thing about the fellows who serve in our office. I know many of us are privileged to have fellows who get assigned to us. Arnold Solamillos has been assigned to my office and has helped us in so many different areas. His expertise from the Social Security Administration is a valuable service. I, personally, thank him for the contributions he has made not just to my Senate office but to the work we do in the U. Mr.President, I want to comment about the status of healthcare. We had expected that the majority leader might have brought up this week the Graham-Cassidy bill as part of budget reconciliation. I can tell you I am relieved he did not, but I hope this Chamber will consider healthcare legislation not 6 months from now, not a year from now, but there is important work we need to do now in regard to healthcare, and we need to work together, Democrats and  One of the urgent issues is to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, That program, as I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, expires in the next 2 days. We need to make sure there is predictability for our States to continue this extremely important program that protects the health of our children.  It was created as a bipartisan program, enjoyed bipartisan support. I certainly compliment Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden for their work together to reach an agreement on the reauthorization of this program. I hope we can consider that very shortly.  I also would like to point out that we have very important healthcare policies that have time limits on it and expire, and we need to pass what is known as extenders in health. Some of these policies expire in the next 2 days.  I am going to just mention one. There are many others I could mention, but I want to mention one that I have been involved with ever since Congress made the mistake of placing a limit known as the therapy cap on rehab services. This limit makes absolutely no sense. It made no sense 20 years ago when it was imposed. It was put in there to reach a budget number and reconciliation and had nothing to do with policy.  Today, those who have the most serious needs of therapy services are the ones who are the most at risk. So I would urge my colleagues that we need to take up these medical extenders, and we need to do it now. We need to do it quickly. We don't want to leave the uncertainty out there. Every day we leave the uncertainty, there is a question in the minds of individuals who need these services and those who are providing these services whether, in fact, Congress will extend the policies.  Let me talk a little bit about the broader issue of the Affordable Care We had, I thought, a very informative hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on the Graham-Cassidy amendment to the Reconciliation We had that hearing on Monday, and I thought it was a very informative hearing for the members of our committee and the American public. We had the opportunity to have one of the members of our committee on the panel of witnesses. Senator Cassidy was a witness at the witness table. During the questioning, I said to him that he had mentioned many examples of individuals who are facing very high premium increases or they don't have the ability to pay the premiums and the out-of-pocket costs. He was using those examples, as some of my other colleagues were using, as to why we have to deal with a change in the Affordable Care  I had the opportunity to question what individuals he was talking about. He identified the group. The group is those who are in the individual marketplace. These are not the families who have policies through their employers or in the group plans, these are individuals who have no other opportunity but to go into the individual market in order to buy their health insurance. Secondly, these are individuals who don't qualify for subsidies because their income is too high.  So I asked ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgS6205-2.txt,,DISASTER TAX RELIEF AND AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,September
756,topic-id,2201,"Mr.President, while the Senator from Massachusetts is still with us on the floor and in other ways as well, I just want to say a couple of things.  One, good for the He just said a mouthful, and he said what needs to be said. What he said is that there is not just one or two choices. Somebody said to me yesterday: Well, it is a choice between either a single-payer or Graham-Those are our choices.  Uh-uh. I think a far better choice for us to take is in the example of leadership set by Senators Alexander and Murray on the Committee of Health, Education, Labor, and As the Presiding Officer knows, in a span of 2 weeks, they held four bipartisan roundtables with Governors from all over the country, insurance commissioners from all over the country, healthcare providers, insurance, and health economists to ask: What should we do? What should we do right now in our being faced with the challenge and maybe the possibility of repealing the Affordable Care Act? What should we do?  They all said the same thing--stabilize the exchanges. Every State has a health insurance exchange, an individual marketplace. Stabilize them. They all basically said to do mainly three or four things to stabilize them:  1, make clear that these cost-sharing subsidies, which help lower income people in the exchanges with their copays and deductibles, are not going away. Make it clear that they are going to be around for at least a couple of years.  2, either give the States the ability to create their own reinsurance plans or create one for the Federal Government, by the Federal Government, involving the Federal  The third thing they said is, if we are not going to enforce the individual mandate--I, personally, think we should--then make sure there is something that is just as effective as the individual mandate in order to make sure that young people--millennials like my sons--are getting their healthcare. They are in the exchanges, and they are helping to make sure there is a healthy mix of people to insure.  Those were almost word by word, panel by panel, what we heard in four different hearings by the HELP Committee during four different bipartisan roundtables that preceded those hearings. They all said to fix the exchanges.  I have an old friend who is now deceased. He was a Methodist minister for many years in southern He used to give me this advice when I was Governor: Just remember this, Tom--the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.  That is what he said. The first time he said it, I didn't know what he was saying. It took me a while, but I finally figured it out. The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.  Right now, the thing that we can do and ought to be able to agree on is to stabilize the exchanges. Premiums do not have to go up in the exchanges by 30, 40 percent. If we would simply do one thing and make it clear that these cost-sharing subsidies are not going away and give that green light to the insurance companies, insurance commissioners across the country will reduce significantly the increases in the premiums.  I have been told by more than a few health insurance companies that if we would do that and make sure there is some kind of reinsurance program in place, in effect, and also make it clear that the individual mandate must continue to be enforced--and if it is not, then replace it with something that is just as good--if we would do those three things, we would see premiums go down anywhere from 30 to 35 percent in the exchanges across the country. Who mostly benefits from that? Who benefits from a 30- or 35-percent reduction in premiums in the exchanges? The folks who are getting their insurance in the exchanges benefit, but do you know who else probably benefits even more? Uncle The reason is that most of the people who get their coverage in the exchanges benefit from a sliding scale tax credit that buys down the cost of the premiums. If the premiums go down by 30 or 35 percent, that means that Uncle Sam, out of the U.Treasury, pays less money in the form of those tax credits. That is not a bad deal.  Our Republican friends like to talk about dynamic scoring. I am not sure I believe dynamic scoring is real, but I believe if we actually do help drive down the cost of premium increases, Uncle Sam is a big beneficiary of that.  The last two things I want to say are, 1, I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for the great bipartisan leadership they have shown. I had a chance to go to four bipartisan roundtables a couple of weeks ago. They welcomed people not on the HELP I am on the Finance Committee, as is the Presiding We have shared jurisdiction with the HELP But we have the opportunity in our committee to sort of follow the lead, if you will, of what they are doing on the HELP Committee and do bipartisan hearings and bipartisan roundtables of our own.  Why don't we sort of pick up where we were about a week and a half ago when the prospect of debating and voting on Graham-Cassidy came out of nowhere and led to yesterday's 5-hour hearing in the Finance Committee? Why don't we pick up where we left a week and a half ago and get to work again?  This is not something we ought to take weeks or months to do. Let's just do the main things; that is, stabilize the exchanges, and if we do nothing else in the next week or so, let's make it clear that these cost-sharing subsidies are not going to go away. We help people on the exchanges, the premium increases go down, and we actually help the That is not a bad deal.  The last thing I want to say is for those people who say that Democrats believe the Affordable Care Act is perfect and nothing needs to be changed. That is just nonsense. The Presiding Officer and I can sit down and tick off a number of things that ought to be addressed and fixed. He and I probably, as smart as we are, are not smart enough to figure out all of them. We need to have a good hearing and good conversation amongst ourselves and with a broad section of shareholders and stakeholders across the country. As a recovering Governor and former chair of the National Governors Association, I want to hear the voices of the I want to hear the voices of the insurance commissioners and a whole lot of other people who are affected by this.  Every President, I think, since Harry Truman has called for providing healthcare coverage for just about everyone in our country--every Along the way we made some advances with Medicaid and Medicare with Lyndon We made some[[Page S6114]]advances in the Clinton administration with Orrin Hatch and Ted Kennedy's legislation creating the CHIP Program, the Children's Health Insurance We are still a long way from where we ought to be for health insurance in this country.  Here is the trifecta of where we would like to go and where Presidents and leaders have said forever that we ought to go. 1, provide quality healthcare for people in this country; 2, do it in a cost-effective way; and 3, cover everybody. We are doing a lot better job of covering everyone. We have 20-some million people who don't have coverage. That is down from 50 million people years ago.  We still have people without coverage. We spend a lot more money in percentage of GDP in this country than most other advanced nations. We have to continue to get better results for less money and have a real focus on value.  There is a lot of encouraging work going on in my I know in Ohio there are places like the Cleveland There are places like Christiana Care in my There is a lot of encouraging work going on, and we ought to build on it and find out what works and do that.  Lastly, I want to give a shout out to Senator Gary Peters and Senators Duckworth, Stabenow, myself, and a couple of others who have been focused on a veterans' health motion to commit. I want to say a few words about healthcare as it pertains to veterans. This has been lost sometimes in the shuffle.  The Medicaid Program in our country covers about 25 percent of the people who get healthcare in this country. Medicare is about 15 percent. The majority of people who get healthcare coverage in this country get it through their large group plan. We have 6 percent or 7 percent who get coverage through the exchanges.  As a navy veteran, an ROTC guy, retired Navy Captain, we know that not every veteran actually gets their healthcare coverage from the A number of them aren't eligible for that. As it turns out, among the people who receive coverage under Medicaid today, a lot of them are old, a lot of them are like our parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. The reason they are eligible for Medicaid is they have spent down their resources and assets, and they are old. A bunch of them have dementia. Maybe the family is unable or unwilling to take care of them, and they end up in a nursing home, and Medicare picks up the tab.  I described it yesterday in our Finance Committee hearing. It is like a tsunami. My generation, the baby boomers, are moving into their retirement and moving into their seventies, eighties, and nineties, in some cases. A lot of them are old, and they have dementia. A couple million of them are veterans who get their healthcare coverage through  In Ohio and other places, and certainly in Delaware, we have huge problems with opioids and heroin. The biggest form of treatment, as the Presiding Officer knows, for people with drug addiction in this country is Those are some reasons we think it is important not to touch one hair on the head of Medicaid, if you will, but to try to figure out how to make changes in a smart and humane way.  Let me say a word or two about veterans' healthcare. My understanding is that the last version of the Republican healthcare proposal was pulled today, not to be voted on. It totally cut several hundreds of billions of dollars from I believe most everyone says that is true. Not every veteran has access to the VA for healthcare. Nearly 2 million veterans, as I mentioned earlier--that is 1 in 10 veterans in this country--rely on Medicaid for their healthcare, and that includes some 6,000 veterans who are living in my own State of  The Affordable Care Act provided healthcare coverage to some 340,000 veterans in the States that expanded For our veterans who rely on Medicaid, the most recent TrumpCare proposal would significantly scale back benefits or cause them to lose their benefits altogether. Veterans who rely on those benefits would see higher healthcare costs and lower quality care if they could access it at all. All the while, we know veterans are at high risk for serious and complex issues because of their service.  I want to close by saying in a heartfelt way that we all know veterans. We have an obligation to those who have served us to make sure we take care of them later in their lives. We do that in a variety of ways.  The VA system is much maligned in my It is not perfect, but I think they do a darn good job. We have one big hospital in Northern Delaware and two community-based outpatient clinics--one in Dover and Centerville and another one in the southern part of our They do a very good job.  We are about to open a brandnew, 10,000-square foot community outpatient clinic in Georgetown, DE, the county seat of our southernmost county. Having said that, not every veteran in Delaware can access those facilities. For them, Medicaid is useful, and in some cases it is critical to having any care at all. We should keep that in mind. The challenges of the focus that were created by the possible vote here on this floor are now averted on the Graham-Cassidy proposal. As we go forward in a bipartisan way, let's work together to fix the things in the Affordable Care Act that need to be fixed and preserve those that need to be preserved, and for the aspects that need to be dealt with or dropped, let's figure out how to do that in a smart and humane way. We need to also keep in mind that a couple million people who use Medicaid are veterans themselves.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6108-2.txt,179,WE MUST CONTINUE TO ROOT OUT RACISM,2017.0,26.0,September

Since then, PJM's work has been dedicated to ensuring that reliable electricity is available at a reasonable price.  In 1997, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved PJM as the Nation's first fully functioning independent system operator. ISOs operate but do not own transmission systems in order to provide open access to the grid for nonutility users.  Since that beginning of three utilities, PJM has grown to more than 1,000 members. Those members represent transmission owners, generation owners, consumers, and residential and commercial customers in each of its 13-state region.  PJM has three simple goals: keeping the lights on, administering the buying[[Page S5884]]and selling of electricity through wholesale electricity markets, and assessing and planning for the future needs of the electric grid. PJM has devoted itself to those goals as an industry technology innovator, operating similar to a stock exchange and developing electricity rates through a bidding process that aligns supply with demand. That PJM model is one that has been emulated not just across the country, but around the world.

I have the utmost confidence in our military leaders, and I trust Secretary Mattis when he says that our existing missile defense systems have what it takes to keep our country safe from the North Korean threat. The American people can feel safe and secure, knowing that our military is protecting them and that their Representatives in Congress, like myself, are ready to provide whatever funding is needed to support the development and deployment of missile defense technology, both now and in the future.  That being said, it is simply unacceptable to allow a leader like Kim Jong-un, who shows no regard for international norms or human rights, to gain valuable leverage and deterrent capability as a nuclear-armed state.  I was encouraged to hear our Commander in Chief speak out forcefully against the ``forces of destruction'' that are gathering power in our world in his address to the United Nations last week. President Trump has made it clear to North Korea that denuclearization is the only path forward, and he has successfully mobilized the international community to impose strong sanctions that will help deprive the Kim regime of the resources it needs to continue its rush to nuclear weapons.  This is a critical step forward, but make no mistake: the nuclear advancements that North Korea has been allowed to achieve in recent years pose a very serious threat to our Nation, our allies, and the international community overall. That is why we must stand firm now and be prepared to do whatever is necessary to protect our national security and that of our allies, including military action.  I am proud that Congress is doing its part to support the Trump administration's efforts to counter the North Korean threat, including passing sanctions legislation that was enacted into law in August; and the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act, which passed the House yesterday.  We must continue to stand united, both as a country and with our international partners, to send a clear message to North Korea that its hostile behavior must end and that it must never be allowed to threaten the world with nuclear weapons.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7493.txt,99999999999999,INCREASING OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS THROUGH,2017.0,26.0,September

151,topic-id,581,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.3229, a bipartisan, commonsense measure intended to protect the safety of federal judges and judicial employees.  The bill accomplishes this critical goal by extending the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact sensitive information contained in the financial disclosure reports filed by these individuals pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Specifically, H.3229 would extend this authority for 10 years, that is, until December 31, 2027.  I am an original cosponsor and strong supporter of this bill for several reasons.  To begin with, absent a further extension of this authority, the Judicial Conference's ability to redact sensitive personal information from the financial disclosure statements filed by judges and judicial employees would cease[[Page H7551]]and thereby create potentially serious security risks to these individuals.  Judges and judicial employees are often the subject of threats, harassment, and violence. Like probation officers, these individuals routinely interact with disgruntled litigants and convicted criminals who may hold grudges against them.  A resentful litigant seeking to take revenge for a judicial decision can learn of a federal judge's home address, his or her spouse's place of employment, or a child's school, among other types of sensitive information, by requesting a copy of the judge's financial disclosure report.  During 2016, for instance, a federal judge was shot in front of his home, a murder-for-hire plot against a federal judge was uncovered, and threatening letters were sent to other judges.  Fortunately, section 105 of the Ethics in Government Act grants the Judicial Conference the authority to redact certain limited information from financial disclosure reports when the release of such information could endanger a judge, a judicial employee, or a member of their family.  Congress has extended this redaction authority on 5 previous occasions, most recently on January 3, 2012.  Another reason why I support H.3229 is that the Judicial Conference has exercised its redaction authority with demonstrated restraint.  As required by the Ethics in Government Act, the Conference has promulgated regulations requiring a clear nexus between a security risk and the need to redact sensitive information.  In addition, the Act requires the Judicial Conference to report annually to Congress on the number and nature of redactions as well as the reasons for them.  Based on a review of these reports, it is clear that only a small percentage of the financial disclosure reports filed contain an approved redaction of some information in the report.  For example, less than 3 percent of financial reports contained an approved redaction of some information over the past 5 years.  Finally, the need to extend this redaction authority--which will expire in just over 3 months--is a time-sensitive security matter that requires prompt consideration of H.3229.  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support H.3229, which will simply extend the Judicial Conference's current redaction authority for an additional 10 years.  In closing, I want to commend Congressman Hakeem Jeffries for his leadership on this important legislation. We share his commitment to protecting the security of those public servants who serve in the federal judicial branch.  Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr.Issa) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.3229, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgH7549.txt,229,THE AMERICAN LEGION 100TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT,2017.0,27.0,September
121,topic-id,1422,"Madam President, yesterday we learned that, once again, my Republican colleagues do not have the votes to pass their latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, even though the budget reconciliation process we are currently under requires only 50 votes. There are not 50 votes.  Many of my colleagues have spoken on this floor about the challenges, the problems, or the issues with the latest iteration of the Graham-Cassidy bill. We have also heard as a body from many organizations all over the country that represent Americans in healthcare: the American Medical Association, which speaks for America's doctors; the American Hospital Association, which speaks for our hospitals; America's Health Insurance Plans; the American Cancer Society; many other patient advocacy groups; and the AARP, which advocates for seniors. All have weighed in about the challenges with this legislation.  But rather than continuing to bear down on that point, I would like to quote a colleague and hero of mine. Senator John McCain said on this floor:       We should not be content to pass healthcare legislation on      a party-line basis. . . . The issue is too important, and too      many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people      guessing from one election to the next whether and how they      will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires      a bipartisan approach.  Senator McCain also said:       I hope that in the months ahead, we can join with      colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a      compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and      serves the interests of Americans as best we can.  Senator McCain is right. Fixing and improving our healthcare system cannot be done on a partisan basis. When it has been attempted to turn big bills into law on a narrow party-line basis, the results are often not sustainable. That is why we have work to do together, because this issue of providing for America's healthcare is too complex, too big, and too important for us to do with only one wing or one party.  I was encouraged, as were many colleagues, Republican and Democratic, when Senators Alexander and Murray, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Health and Education Committee, held bipartisan hearings. They brought in Governors, insurance commissioners, healthcare experts, physicians, and hospital leaders from across the country to talk about what we need to do short term and long term to stabilize healthcare markets and to lay the foundation for improvements to our healthcare system.  So let's listen to Senator Let's give that bipartisan effort another chance. Let's work together and do this the right way.  I ride the train back and forth almost every day from Wilmington to Washington, and the Delawareans I hear from on that train or at home in the grocery store or around my State are simply tired of Congress fighting endless partisan battles with their healthcare. And it is not just frustrating to hear about on television; we[[Page S6169]]know for a fact that uncertainty in the healthcare markets is causing premiums to go up for Americans all over the country. The CEO of Highmark, which is the sole provider of individual market health insurance to the ACA market in Delaware now, conveyed to me that half of the rate increase for this coming year was due to uncertainty about whether the Trump administration would continue to enforce the individual mandate, to make the CSR payments, and other things that are part of the  So today, recognizing that the only way this gets fixed in such a closely divided and partisan Senate is if we work together, I would like to commit again to my constituents and colleagues that I am willing to work to find bipartisan solutions to our healthcare problems.  Let's sit down together, and let's bring in organizations like the AMA, the AARP, the American Cancer Society, the American Hospital Association, and let's listen. Let's listen to them, to healthcare leaders, and to patient advocates, and frankly I think we should listen to thousands of faith leaders from across the country as well. We have received letters--all of us as a body--from leaders of the Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Buddhist communities across our country. They jointly wrote a letter to Congress urging us to reject the Graham-Cassidy bill and to immediately address urgent matters that are right in front of us.  The next one is CHIP reauthorization. CHIP--the Children's Health Insurance Program--serves nearly 9 million American children, 17,000 in Delaware alone, and it is going to expire. There are a lot of Federal health programs that expire at the end of this week: the Children's Health Insurance Program, the Community Health Center Fund, which provides access to cost-effective primary and preventive care for 26 million patients throughout the country; the teaching health centers funding; the special diabetes program. There is a whole list of healthcare-related programs that expire at the end of this week. So I think we need a sense of urgency. We need a sense of urgency to finding ways to work together in the short term to stabilize the market, to extend these programs, such as CHIP, that have long enjoyed bipartisan support and to begin the steps needed to show flexibility and compromise by both parties.  First, as I said, we have to stabilize the individual ACA marketplace. Fortunately, we know how to do that. As I mentioned, there have already been hearings in which testimony was received from Governors, insurance commissioners, healthcare experts, and they said the 1 priority was funding the ACA cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSR payments. That is something the Trump administration can do today. The administration can simply announce that they will continue to meet the law and make those payments. At least in my State, that will reduce the rate of increase of individual insurance premiums by a significant percentage.  We can also work together to establish a reinsurance program, to support enrollment outreach activities, and to enforce the individual mandate. All of this would translate to lower premiums. As I said, the President is already authorized under the ACA to take a few of these steps and stabilize the marketplace.  From there, we are going to have to find bipartisan ways that we can make this a more workable system. I have introduced legislation in the past to make the ACA small business tax credits more appropriately sized for the small businesses I have heard from in Delaware, many of which can't afford the increased costs of the Affordable Care  There are ways we can work together to reduce the reporting requirements so they are less burdensome to employers. I introduced a bill on that in the last Congress and would welcome a chance to work with a Republican colleague to introduce and pass that legislation now.  We could also look at ways to make the tax credits--or the way that subsidies are provided through the ACA--both more affordable and more sustainable, so that families who qualify aren't caught in a situation where they qualify for tax credits, but they are nowhere near enough to afford comprehensive health insurance.  We also have to take a hard, bipartisan look at what is driving up healthcare costs across this country. We aren't just challenged with resolving issues around health insurance; we also have to find a bipartisan path toward addressing healthcare costs.  The bottom line to all of this is that we must work together to return to regular order and to give these programs the stability and certainty they need to serve patients across the country and our constituents at home.  In my view, the Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans live healthier, safer, more secure lives. Repealing it and replacing it with one of the proposals we have seen in recent months would have been very harmful to millions of But that doesn't mean the ACA is perfect. There is hard work to do. Compromise is needed on both sides. And I think the call that Senator McCain has issued to this Chamber is one we should hear.  So let's work together. Let's listen to our constituents. Let's listen to faith leaders. Let's listen to doctors and healthcare experts. Let's do the hard work and together improve, not tear down, our healthcare system.  Thank you.

116,topic-id,2177,"Mr.President, today I would like to talk about a topic that most of us don't want to discuss, and that is taxes, except today is different. This time, you don't have to groan over spreadsheets and calculations or worry about how much of your hard-earned pay you are going to have to send to Uncle Today, leaders in the House and in the Senate will unveil their core principles for tax reform. The President will travel with our colleague Senator Young to announce his support for these core principles.  Taxes can be confounding and complicated and painful to deliberate, but for folks back home, what I believe describes our tax principles is to say more take-home pay, and that works for everybody. In other words, you actually reduce your living costs because Uncle Sam takes less of your paycheck, meaning you get to keep more of it and take that home and spend it on things that you would prefer to spend it on. So more take-home pay is our bottom line.  I look forward to working with the chairman of the Finance Committee, on which I have the privilege of serving, and Speaker Ryan and Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee--another good Texan--on their ideas, which I know were born from many long hours and tough conversations.  But this is going to be a national conversation, starting with the President kicking this off this afternoon in He is going to invite the American people to express their views on what tax reform should look like.  For me, in addition to more take-home pay, I am looking for a tax code which is shorter, simpler, and which makes us more competitive in the global economy.  It is a great relief, believe me, to have a President who understands how taxes and the uncertainty they place on job creators stifles economic growth. The reason economic growth is so important is that when the economy grows, more jobs are created, and for the jobs that exist, the people who have them will actually earn more money and be able to pursue their dreams.  Just as importantly, though, this President understands that the job creator is not the enemy. A former colleague of ours, Gordon Smith from Oregon, once told me that the problem with some of our Democratic friends is that they claim to love the worker, but they hate the job creator. To me, that sort of summarized it pretty well. I know he didn't mean ``hate'' in the traditional sense, but he did mean Congress--and particularly our folks on the Democratic side--likes to implement additional burdens, such as higher taxes or more regulation, more obstacles in the way of our job creators, when we should be tearing down those walls, reducing that regulation, and lowering taxes so that they can be successful, and in the process, we can all succeed. Well, this President understands that our economy, too, is crucial but extremely fragile, and he joins all of us in wanting to do everything he can, and everything we can, to ensure that we continue to be the strongest economy in the world.  Here is why tax reform is so important in the first place. In the words of Arthur Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, the American Founders promised not just happiness but the pursuit of happiness. That is, of course, in the Declaration of I think Arthur is onto something. I think that is a good way of putting it. It means that all of us, based on our country's original vision, should be free to follow our dreams without government getting in our way or making our burdens heavy. We should be free to pursue happiness.  Average American citizens should not be numbed or stifled by mandatory participation in a system that depletes their energy and discourages them, and that is what our Tax Code does today. It exhausts people when it comes to fully complying with our arcane and convoluted and complex laws because they are so difficult. So many people simply outsource that by hiring some lawyer or some accountant to prepare their taxes because it is so complex. We can do better than that. We can make it simpler and fairer and flatter.  Today, many of the obstacles that exist prevent the average American from pursuing their dreams and reaching their full potential, which ought to be what joins us all together. One of those is an outdated and highly convoluted tax system that actually penalizes hard work, stymies ingenuity, and enriches the lawyers and accountants that people have to hire in order to just comply with all of its convoluted complexity--so-called compliance costs. Call this the terrible tedium of taxes. It zaps our energy rather than unleashing it. It erodes our work ethic, because if you work harder and harder only to see more and more money go to the Federal Government, what does that do to incentivize people to work harder? It erodes our work ethic, as we see less reason to labor for what ultimately gets taken from us.  The mission of the so-called Big 6 committee, which has been asked to put together a blueprint for reform, has been to protect American jobs and make the Tax Code simpler, fairer, and lower for average American families. In a sense, it is all about putting families first. Families build individuals, and families mold character. We have to give every opportunity to families who need to thrive. We have to keep the uninvited guest of government away from the front door, constantly begging for more money, more time, and more attention, and constantly throwing a wrench into their plans.  I also believe we should provide tax relief for small businesses because small businesses are literally the engine of our economy. It is not the Fortune 500 that creates the vast percentage of jobs in this country. It is small businesses, which often face an unyielding regulatory state. We should lower taxes for all American businesses so they can compete with foreign ones.  As the so-called Big 6 committee has said, the goal of any new plan should[[Page S6165]]be, first and foremost, to reduce tax rates as much as possible. Let's make sure this ``first cut is the deepest,'' as the song goes, but also to place a priority on permanence, to create a system that encourages American companies to bring jobs back from overseas, along with the profits they will not bring back because they will be taxed twice, and to put more money back in the pockets of all  As Ronald Reagan said, there is one simple fact you have to keep in mind when it comes to taxes: ``The problem is not that the people are taxed too little, the problem is that the Government spends too much.''  This is not just about sheer wealth we are after but about earned success--the ability of mothers, fathers, and families to work a long day and to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks to use as they please--to save it for their retirement, to spend it on their house, or even to dote on their children. When families get to keep more of the money they earn, they are more inclined to take advantage of or to create their own opportunities, including new businesses. Social mobility increases and so does room for charity.  The United States is the most charitable and generous country in the world. People don't just turn to government for help during times of need. We saw that in Hurricane Harvey and in Hurricane Irma and now in Hurricane Many, many Americans generously dip into their own resources to help provide for their fellow human beings in need during times of tragedy. It is our prosperity that comes from job creation--getting to keep more of what you earn and pay the government less--that makes that possible.  When Alexis de Tocqueville came to the United States, shortly after our country's founding, in his book ``Democracy in America,'' he pointed out that one of the unique things about America--certainly much different than Europe--was the organizing and voluntary associations. These often are charitable organizations--whether they are churches or synagogues or mosques or just community organizations--that as part of their good work provide charitable benefits for our fellow man and woman. We ought to encourage that.  Of course, none of us is an island. It is not that lower tax rates translate to everyone looking out exclusively for 1. Oftentimes, that is the way our friends across the aisle will depict lowering taxes. They say: You are lowering taxes for the rich.  We want to lower taxes for everybody--not because it benefits an individual but because it benefits the country and it benefits all It makes us more competitive globally. It creates more jobs and opportunities for Americans who are looking for those jobs and opportunities. It creates incentives for investment so that the entrepreneur can start a business, come up with a new idea, change the world, and create jobs and opportunities for other people at the same time.  We know that social obligations are still important. It is just that there are many ways of meeting them other than just cutting a big paycheck to the Federal Government every In fact, the higher taxes we pay, the easier it is for citizens to assume that, well, I have paid the Federal Government; so let the government take care of it.  That is not who we are. That is not who we have been. That is certainly not how we began. We began as a government that believed in the individuality and the importance of all individuals, and we all collectively benefit when each of us is free to pursue their dreams because that increases the prosperity and the opportunities for all.  We will never become, I hope and pray, a country that says: It is the government's job when it comes to taking care of a man or woman or a family in need. Yes, government has a role to play, but I hope we will always be the generous sort of country that we started out to be and that we still are today, with neighbors helping neighbors.  Middle-class Americans have experienced a decade of higher taxes, more regulation, and stagnant economic growth under the last administration. It is time to break out of that cycle, and this is our time to do that.  Every American knows we can do better. If you ask them: Are your taxes hard to prepare, is it complicated, are you confused, or do you feel like the Federal Government is getting a bigger bite out of your paycheck than it should, I think you would get near unanimity that the Tax Code is too complex, the Federal Government is too voracious when it comes to taking a bite out of your paycheck, and people would welcome the ability to keep more of what they earn.  It is time for us to show that we understand the plight of hard-working American families and people of all economic levels, that we are hearing them when they say they want to keep more of the paycheck they earn and they want us to lower their cost of living by lowering the tax bite out of the paycheck they do earn.  Americans are wondering what our tax reform policies will be. For me, here are some nonnegotiable items. The Tax Code must be simplified. Job creators must be incentivized to keep well-paying jobs here at home in the United American competitiveness in a global economy must be increased by lowering business tax rates.  The result should be a new, retooled system that will put more money in the pockets of middle-class families and reenergize our economy. It will benefit Americans in every State across the country. It will also make it possible for us to meet our other priorities, as the Federal Treasury also will benefit from more people working, earning better wages, and helping to support their government. It will make it possible for us to spend more money on our priorities, like national defense, which right now is underfunded, or medical research or other priorities that the American people may have.  By delivering on these principles, we can restore prosperity for this generation and many generations to come, and we can keep the promise of the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Ultimately, that is what we are talking about when we talk about tax reform. We shouldn't just be wearing green eyeshades, getting out our spreadsheets, and counting the numbers. This is about keeping the promise of the Declaration of Independence that we are endowed by our Creator with an unalienable right to pursue happiness.  I yield the floor.

184,topic-id,1447,"Mr.President, I am particularly glad to see you presiding today because I came here to report on what you and I saw together in Texas during this last long weekend. Unfortunately, it didn't feel quite like home--not when parts of Texas battered by Hurricane Harvey aren't what they used to be and not when so many cities, towns, and wornout faces don't look like they otherwise would.  As of this weekend, more than 8 million cubic yards of debris still needed to be cleared in Houston alone--the Presiding Officer's hometown and the city of my birth. More than 800,000 people have registered with FEMA for individual assistance. More than 24,000 hotel rooms are still occupied by victims of the flood. Fifty-two public and charter schools sustained ``catastrophic damage'' and are awaiting funding for repairs. Worst of all, 82 lives were lost as a result of this terrible storm.  One news story that stuck with me came from Port Arthur, where the mayor, Mr.Derrick Ford Freeman, a man of truly steel resolve, can't stop yawning. Well, he is exhausted. He has a good reason. He has been sleeping upstairs in his child's second floor bunkbed because, unlike some other residents, he hasn't had time to strip the first floors of his house that flooded to remove the Sheetrock, destroyed furniture, and all of his personal effects. He has been too busy worrying about others and trying to help pull the pieces back together.  Mayor Freeman spoke of the smell in his house at night. First, it is the flood. Then, it is the mold. Then, it is the mosquitoes. He spoke about the challenges his community faces, and he spoke about the more than 100 schoolteachers and 100 city employees in Port Arthur who still did not have homes ready to return to.  What Mayor Freeman was most worried about, though, is that people will forget. Now, as other natural disasters and news stories begin to occupy the[[Page S6108]]coverage on television and turn people's gaze away from Texas, to Florida and now to the devastation in Puerto Rico, the mayor's concern makes some sense.  But I want to assure Mayor Freeman--as I know the Presiding Officer would, and as we would to our friends in Florida and the east coast, who were hit by Hurricane Irma, or our friends in Puerto Rico, who were devastated by Hurricane Maria--that we will not forget and that we will stand together to make sure that the Federal Government plays its essential role in helping them recover and in helping them restore their lives.  But I also remember another civic leader, Mayor Becky Ames of Beaumont, and what she said to me right after the storm. Smiling, she declared:       We had a downpour; now we have an outpour. The outpour is      coming right into our city.  That is what we saw time and again. Yes, the Federal Government responded. Yes, the State responded, led by Governor Abbott and emergency operations. Yes, the mayors and the county judges responded. But the truth is neighbors helped neighbors. We talked again. I sort of chuckle when I think about the Cajun Navy, but our friends from around the country, including next door in Louisiana, came to help pluck people off the tops of their flooded houses and places of business, and of course many people have lent a helping hand.  I think it is best to combine Mayor Freeman's concerns with Mayor Ames's optimism. In other words, we need to make sure that outpour she was speaking about continues. I know the outpour hasn't dried up places like Friendswood, TX, where the Presiding Officer and I helped Team Rubicon clean up some of the houses that were trashed by Hurricane We joined the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan--and we are delighted he saw fit to come join us in this effort--as well as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and virtually the entire Houston congressional delegation.  We also know the outpour has not stopped in places like Aloe Elementary in Victoria, a school that was severely damaged by the storm. There I saw second graders get packages from their counterparts in West Lafayette, The school may have temporary walls. Certain classrooms and hallways had to be cordoned off as the building continues, but these ``Aloe-gators''--the school mascot--are permanently grateful for the help they are getting from children from Lafayette, LA, and Cumberland Elementary in  I think we owe it to these youngsters--and the many other Texans we met with in Victoria, Friendswood, and Houston--to explain what we here in Washington are doing to address the storm, which, let's not forget, rained down more water--34 trillion gallons--than any storm in U.history. I think they are wondering if we remember the sheer scale of the disaster zone--an area larger than West Virginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island combined. We want to assure them that the answer is yes.  We have been working hard trying to match the scale of the storm with an appropriate congressional response. Here are just a few of the ways in which the Federal Government has responded:  First, the President--and we thank him for his leadership and initiative--issued a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act, which is the trigger for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, or FEMA's, public assistance grants to be provided. This is, to be clear, not a handout. Each State is responsible for part of the cost. Secondly, the U.Army Corps of Engineers conducted infrastructure assessments and assisted with State debris management. Third, FEMA has coordinated with the American Red Cross and other local governments to find and provide temporary housing for the displaced.  As I said, these are just a few of the ways the administration has been responding. I realize they are just on the first step. That is why last week I led a bipartisan letter, along with my colleague in the Chair, calling upon the Department of Housing and Urban Development to speed up allocation of relief funds. We were able to appropriate, and the President signed into law, a $7.4 billion allocation for community development block grants, or CDBG funds, that Congress has decided are appropriate as a downpayment on the recovery from Hurricane These CDBG funds, community development block grant funds, will help Texas communities repair their infrastructure, rebuild schools, and reopen the businesses that are integral to recovery. I might add, given Texas's contribution to the national economy, it is really important not just to folks in Texas, this is important to the country that we get our businesses back on their own two feet, opening doors, and helping contribute to the economy while they continue to create jobs.  I am grateful to my colleagues for moving with such dispatch in appropriating the funds. I know Congress's quick action can quickly be undone by delays at the bureaucracy level. We need to make sure that doesn't happen. On the State level, Governor Abbott has announced the Commission to Rebuild Texas, which will be led ably by Texas A&M System Chancellor John I met with Chancellor Sharp last week in Texas, and he assured me the commission will be traveling around the State and working to prioritize projects to help restore roads, bridges, schools, government buildings, and impacted communities. The Texas delegation will be working with him as we focus on our response. I know we all look forward to working with the commission and Governor Abbott in the months to come. It will be months, if not years, before the recovery will be complete.  One additional way we can help victims is through targeted tax relief. I want to highlight in this regard a noncontroversial section of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that House Democrats blocked yesterday. It contained a number of disaster tax provisions, like those that were passed after Hurricane Katrina, that will help hurricane victims get back on their feet. It is unconscionable that the House minority leader held that relief hostage to cater to the most extreme elements of her own political party. If we were talking about earthquake victims in San Francisco instead of hurricane relief in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, surely she wouldn't be playing politics like she is now with this important hurricane relief package.  Spearheaded by Chairman Kevin Brady, the legislation would have helped victims keep more of their paycheck, deduct more of the cost of their property damage, and have more immediate access to their retirement savings without penalty. It would also have encouraged even more Americans to generously donate to hurricane relief.  It is imperative the House act a second time later this week to overcome the objection of ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6097-9.txt,1692,CONTROL UNLAWFUL FUGITIVE FELONS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,September

589,topic-id,629,"Mr.President, I would like to address a bill that was actually recommended to me by the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator I appreciate his bringing this matter to my attention. I will explain what it does in a moment.  Basically, it deals with the educational impact of hurricanes on our population, whether they be in Texas, whether they be in Florida, or whether they be in Puerto I think it is important, as the Presiding Officer knows in his having been to Puerto Rico recently, that we deal with all of these hurricanes and their aftermaths in a similar and combined and joint fashion.  This legislation is called the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017, and it has three vital hurricane relief-related purposes.  First, it provides the Secretary of Education with the authority to waive Federal matching requirements for two campus-based aid programs under the Higher Education First is the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Second is the Federal Work-Study Notably, in my State, 18 campuses of higher education will be eligible for the waiver of Federal matching requirements. If not passed before September 30, which is on Saturday, if I am not mistaken, these matching funds will no longer be available. So this is a rare window of opportunity for us. As I said, this waiver of authority and relief was also done following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Sandy, I believe.  2, the bill requires the Secretary to reallocate any remaining supplemental educational opportunity grant or Federal work study funds from the 2016 and 2017 award years to colleges and universities located in hurricane-impacted areas. Currently, this second amount totals $17.5 million, and if it is not used by the end of September, like these matching funds, it will no longer be available. These funds provide financial aid to students who have been harmed by the hurricanes at those schools.  Finally, the third thing this bill will do is restore the equitable distribution to all schools in the Project School Emergency Response to Violence  These grants go to schools to assist recovery following a crisis. They can be used for a wide variety of activities, including mental health assessments, emergency transportation needs, and increased costs for teacher overtime. My State alone can be expected to submit applications for this funding next week, and over 14,000 campuses would be eligible. Obviously, given the limited funds, not all of them will receive the maximum they could, but the point is, this is a widely needed and important source of funds for those 14,000 campuses in Texas alone. Previously, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut all received these funds after Katrina and  Colleagues, Congress needs to act or we will forgo our opportunity to use all three categories of these funds since, as I said, the time expires next  When so many people in my home State of Texas and States such as Louisiana and Florida and places such as Puerto Rico are dealing with the aftermath of devastating hurricanes, we cannot allow this opportunity to go to waste.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of 1866, introduced earlier today.  The PRESIDING The clerk will report the bill by title.  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       A bill (1866) to provide the Secretary of Education with      waiver authority for the reallocation rules and authority to      extend the deadline by which funds have to be reallocated in      the campus-based aid programs under the Higher Education Act      of 1965 due to Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and      Hurricane Maria, to provide equitable services to children      and teachers in private schools, and for other purposes.

1035,topic-id,1096,"Mr.President, it has been quite a few weeks now since Harvey hit and, then, Now Maria has devastated the island of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Of course, my gaze has been firmly on the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey back in my home State of Yet we are joined together with those who suffered under Irma and Maria, and we will remain steadfastly with them as we all work to recover from these terrible hurricanes.  Last week, I rode in a Black Hawk helicopter with Russ Poppe, as well as our Adjutant General, John Mr.Poppe is executive director of the Harris County Flood Control We were able to survey in the air things I had seen up close during several trips back home, the wreckage of the land and livelihoods.  It is an emotional thing for families and homeowners to basically take all of their worldly possessions out to the front of their house and put it in the front yard because it is completely ruined as a result of the water, along with things like the drywall, trying to attack the mold before it grows and makes the house uninhabitable.  We saw from about 10,000 feet in the air what we had previously seen from the ground, but from the air, you definitely get a different perspective on the waterlogged landscape. You see so much more. You see the levees, the reservoirs, the areas hit. You see the damaged goods and drywall that people have taken out of their homes as the first step toward recovery. It definitely has an impression on you, particularly with the size and scale of the affected area. It is really hard to believe until you see it from that perspective.  So when I took off my headset and sunglasses--and by the way, Speaker Paul Ryan joined us on that particular trip, and we all appreciate his being there. When we stepped off the chopper, what I thought about was not only what we have done so far but how much further we still had to go. It is not just about building materials, street and roof repairs, or even the temporary housing that people need, although all of those things are surely important. We need to remember that the remedies are not going to be one-size-fits-all. We need broad support, but we also need targeted and narrow support to help people get back on their feet. We need to keep each family in mind and what their own particular needs may be depending on their particular circumstances.  As I started out to say, it is not just Texas we are talking about anymore; it is Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands too. We all remember that those places were hit by Hurricanes Irma and Maria right after Texas was hit by  I want to make one thing clear, though: We in Texas stand together with our fellow Americans who suffered from Hurricanes Maria and Irma, as well as those who suffered from other natural disasters occurring in and around our country, and we will do everything we can to help the people who were harmed and damaged, even devastated by these terrible storms. We will help them fight to get back on their feet, to recover, and to return their lives to some form of normalcy.  One way we can work together and deliver relief to different people in different geographic areas is in providing temporary tax relief. Now, I know this sounds kind of like a small thing to do, but if you think about it, this is a thousand-year storm. Hurricane Harvey dropped 34 trillion gallons of water on the same area over a period of about 5 or so days. Many people were not in the hundred-year floodplain, which is typically where you would buy flood insurance, so many people suffered losses that were not covered by flood insurance. What many of these folks will have to do is dip into their retirement savings and other savings in order to help to get life back to normal. This relief will help folks get back on their feet as they rebuild their homes and businesses and neighborhoods in the wake of these hurricanes.  We recently passed--earlier this afternoon--a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization, but it also included the tax package I am talking about now that provides this targeted relief. These provisions will help hurricane victims in all of the devastated areas keep more of their paycheck, first and foremost, but be able to deduct the cost of their property damage on their tax return and encourage even more Americans to generously donate to hurricane relief to help their neighbors and employees.  I know this tax package is a small matter. It is not a panacea and certainly not a cure-all, and it is not supposed to fix every storm-related problem or absolve us from honoring our ongoing responsibilities in the days ahead. But as John Steinbeck once said, ``and now that you don't have to be perfect, you can just be good,'' and I think these are good reforms. They will complement other measures by the Federal Government, as well as other State and local actors.  Similar provisions were introduced in a noncontroversial section of the FAA reauthorization bill that unfortunately House Democrats, led by Leader Pelosi, tried to block earlier this week. Despite the delays, I am pleased that the House acted a second time earlier today to ensure that this relief is delivered to those who need it most--again, not just in Texas but in Florida, the Virgin Islands, and in Puerto Rico, which reportedly has been devastated. Now we in this Chamber seem to have finally gotten the message, too, by passing this relief just this very afternoon as part of the FAA bill.  Our colleague from Florida, Representative Carlos Curbelo, said[[Page S6213]]about the hurricane victims in his home State: ``They don't have time to wait. They certainly don't have time to play political games.'' He is right, and now we can say we have taken those words to heart.  So I remember what I saw from that helicopter. Now that the time for surveying the scene has ended, what is no longer up in the air is this: For many Texans, Floridians, and Puerto Ricans, targeted tax relief will serve to make a difficult year just a little easier.  So I salute the House for getting the job done, and I am glad we in this Chamber have quickly followed suit.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

823,topic-id,395,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about three issues that are very important to my district and the  First, I want to talk about the immigration policy or the lack of an immigration policy that we have in this country; a, in essence, broken immigration system.  For years I have been saying that we need to fix it, and we need to do that in a bipartisan way because it is the only way we are going to be successful. I supported bipartisan efforts in 2013, the legislation that came out of the Senate by a vote of 68-13. Prior to that, I supported President Bush's efforts and, more recently, President Obama's efforts; but, unfortunately, we have not been successful through these efforts.  That is why today I think we need to be focusing on at least one segment that would have been addressed if, in fact, we fix this broken immigration system. And that is those DREAMers, those young people covered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that was initiated by President Obama that is now going to expire.  These people came here at the average age of 6 years. Most of them don't know the country they came from. Most of them consider themselves, in essence, They are going to school. They are in our military service. They are serving in many different ways. They have jobs. They are part of families in which some are here legally and some are not. You are talking about breaking up families.  Yesterday I signed a discharge petition to bring to the House floor the bipartisan, bicameral Dream Act, which will permanently protect these DREAMers by offering them a path to earned citizenship, not amnesty.  I will continue to do everything in my power to bring the Dream Act to the House floor for a vote and to work then, after that, for comprehensive immigration reform, which is what we really need to do so that we don't keep up ending back here like a continued broken record.  I want our DREAMers to know that many of us in Washington and across the Nation stand with them. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that we ought to fix this. And I hope, before the end of this year, in a bipartisan fashion, we will do just that.

For over 250 years, California has been producing the best wine, I think, in the world. California is the fourth largest producer of wine. This is, in large part, due to a lot of hard work, innovation, and craftsmanship of the State's 4,700 vintners and almost 6,000 growers. They make a difference every day, and they do it not before its time.  Roughly 24 million people visit California's wine regions each year, making our State the most visited State for food- and wine-related activities. We are, after all, the number one agricultural State in the Nation, not only in wine production, but half of the Nation's fruits and vegetables, number one in citrus production, number one in milk production, number one in almonds and pistachios, and the list goes on and on and on.  So as we near the end of California Wine Month this year, I would like to take a moment to celebrate our vintners, growers, farm workers--without the farm workers, we couldn't make this wine possible--and all those who contribute to this industry that provides healthy food as a part of a healthy diet that we all deserve and enjoy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7495-2.txt,1774,1915,2017.0,26.0,September

Using that definition, the men in the white coats with large butterfly nets have plenty of wacky patients to catch in the Senate, where this week--tomorrow, in fact--the Republican leadership is once again, for over the 60th time, trying to jam through a so-called healthcare bill which will repeal the Affordable Care Act without a coherent replacement.  Once again, the Republican leadership will force a vote without analysis by the Congressional Budget Office of the Cassidy-Graham bill, no hearings at the healthcare committee; and in the face of a tidal wave of opposition from the healthcare world, patient groups, healthcare givers, and even Republican Governors have had one message over the last week, which is to vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, just to give you a small sample of some of the patient groups that have spoken out over the last week in opposition to this measure, they include the ALS Association, the American Cancer Society, The American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation, the Down Syndrome Caucus, the American Foundation for the Blind, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Amputee Coalition of America, the Autism Speaks group, the Coalition to Stop Opioid Overdose, and  These are mainstream, trusted organizations, which all of us have donated[[Page H7438]]to, done walkathons, done everything we can to help their missions, which is to help America's patients.

Incredibly, American provider groups, who at many times are at each other's throats in terms of different healthcare legislation, have also taken the same position: the American Medical Association; the American Nurses Association; the Association of American Medical Colleges; the American Hospital Association; the Catholic Health Association of the United States; and the American Health Care Association, which represents thousands of nursing homes like the one that just cared for that gentleman that we heard such kind words about a moment ago from  Again, incredibly, the National Association of Medicaid Directors from all 50 States--Republican States and Democratic States--issued an extraordinary letter last week. Again, these are folks who run the system. They are actually on the ground. They are in the real world, not in the political bubble of Washington, and they have unanimously begged the Senate to vote ``no,'' and to stop this rush to undermining and creating a catastrophic damage to America's healthcare system.  The RAND Corporation issued a report just a couple of days ago that talked about the impact of this measure on America's veterans. 1.75 million American veterans use the Medicaid program; many in nursing homes, maybe like Mr.Hunter, who we just heard about. The RAND Corporation has told us that passing this measure will undermine our promise to America's veterans, the people who wore the uniform of this country, that they would have access to coverage through the Medicaid program. That is what this bill does.  Mr.Speaker, in the real world, at the end of this week, the Children's Health Insurance Program, a bipartisan measure that passed a couple of decades ago, expires its authorization. The law that provides authorization for America's community health centers, that expires at the end of this week. The National Health Service Corps, which allows young Americans to get the opportunity for affordable medical education, that expires at the end of this week.  That is what we should be focused on; not another mindless rushed judgment to satisfy a political promise that the American people don't want and we know, from all the folks who are out there in the real world of America's healthcare system, won't work.

1159,topic-id,276,"Mr.President, today I have the honor of recognizing the administrators and volunteers of the Western Montana Area VI Agency on Aging Foster Grandparent Based in the small town of Polson, MT, the program covers six mainly rural western Montana counties and the area's lone Indian reservation. Every year, the lives of dozens of children across Montana are changed for the better by the Foster Grandparent program, and dozens of senior citizens are able to use their time and skills to make a difference in the life of a child.  Foster grandparents are able to volunteer in many different settings, including schools, afterschool programs, Head Start programs, teen mentorship programs, and correctional facilities. With many communities in western Montana facing high unemployment, as well as meth and opioid drug crises, the Foster Grandparent program has a particular focus on at-risk children. Foster grandparents support children who have been abused or neglected, provide mentorship to teens, and help children with disabilities.  This week, community members and the Western Montana Area VI Agency on Aging are gathering to honor foster grandparents. Included in that group is Navy veteran Karl Paddock, who is receiving a special award for his service to the program. Our communities need more people like Karl and all of the foster grandparents who are willing to step up and make a difference in the lives of our most precious resource: our children.  It is my hope that the Western Montana Area VI Agency on Aging Foster Grandparent Program will continue to grow in the years to come.

As well, we have got to get our job done on teaching hospitals. While we continue to debate the healthcare of this Nation, we have got areas like mine that have a lack of access. If you can't see a doctor today, you have no healthcare.  I think it is important that our Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program gets extended long term. We have a bill to do that. Just expanding it 3 months, if you are graduating from medical school right now, you want to be able to have the certainty that you are going to have a residency program long term.  I support this extension, but we have got to do a lot more. It is time for both Houses to come together. More importantly, it is time for both parties to come together to solve our issues for the FAA, for modernization, making sure that we actually have an aviation system that works.

320,topic-id,820,"Madam Chair, across our country, there are thousands of children, thousands of families, that have a really big stake in what happens with this bill.  I support evidence-based home visiting programs, and I support them not just by talking about them, but by providing them the resources they need to reach more children and make a difference in their lives.  This whole program, ``home visiting,'' is a little bit of a misnomer. This is not about going out to pay a social visit, to join a club or something. This is about skilled professionals working with young parents to help them be the parents they want to be. It is about family values. It is about strengthening and protecting families, particularly disadvantaged families.  Our home visiting programs give these families the tools that they need. I have seen how successful they have been in San Antonio, in San Marcos, in Austin, and across  A story was shared with me recently when I met with Alaska and Jimmy Martinez from San During their first year in college, Alaska became pregnant. She felt she was going to have to drop out of school, and then they met with Susan, with the Nurse-Family Partnership there in San Antonio, and she gave them some referrals and some assistance. They were able to learn more about the development of their child and how they could prepare their family for that child's arrival.  Now, Alaska is about to finish her associate's degree. Jimmy is pursuing his business degree, and they are happy to have a beautiful 2-year-old son.  That is the way this program is supposed to work so people don't sink into poverty. They are lifted up and so are their children. This is just one of thousands of success stories from across the country--the family that unexpectedly finds they have a child with severe disabilities, or maybe just the more common experience of the family that has a baby who cries all night long, and they don't know what to do about it.  Too often, that is the kind of thing that ends up in a slap here, a slap there, and child abuse. Too often, it ends up with that child just being put in front of the television set instead of working with the child to deal with these real-life problems.  Some reforms were mentioned, alleged reforms, in this bill. I have served on this subcommittee through a number of terms of We have had some excellent witnesses, Republican and Democratic, and I have yet to hear a single witness call for a single one of the changes that they are proposing to impose on this program as obstacles to its success.  We haven't had an academic expert. We haven't had a stakeholder. We haven't had a single witness come forward and say: Please change this program so it cannot achieve the success that it is having today.  This is an evidence-based program. What does that mean? It means it is based on fact, not just on hope or good intention, as a number of our programs are. It means there is peer-reviewed data showing that this program works to reduce child abuse and to solve other problems.  The chairman, the advocate for this bill, tells me that they recognize this in the great Republican blueprint, and they want to do more of this. Well, if they want to do more of this, why are they creating one obstacle after another and causing one group after another to oppose those changes?  What about the resources to get the job done? As so many of the Republican witnesses before our subcommittee have acknowledged, we are helping a fraction of the children who are eligible for these kind of services.  I think you could call this bill the Republican 6 percent solution, because about 94 percent of eligible families in America don't get a penny of assistance out of this program. This program[[Page H7509]]that they say is so good, they want to praise it as an evidence-based program--and well they should, and well they have in the course of the several years I have served on the committee--this program is frozen at the same amount of funds that it had 5 years ago.  Though the need has grown, though the fraction of children who are served is minuscule compared with the need, they refuse to provide the resources to help other families like Alaska and Jimmy's.  It is clear, we can't just throw money at this problem or any other, but sometimes the only substitute that I hear from my Republican colleagues is to throw words at the problem like we have heard today: caring, soothing, empathetic words, but words that are no substitute for meaningful action.  Indeed, it is great to hear about support for an evidence-based program. Where is the evidence for these changes?  The The time of the gentleman has expired.

926,topic-id,599,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is all about Republicans refusing to pay for an important public service that they know works. It is about their meager 6 percent solution, where they decline to extend services that empower families, that support young children and their parents, to extend that to the other 94 percent of eligible Americans, despite the fact that there is evidence-based indication that these services perform so well, and in one area, helped to prevent child abuse. It is about their refusal to respond in a fiscally responsible manner to support this program, despite what their own experts say about the effectiveness of the program.  So, instead of providing a reliable source of necessary funding for public services, Republicans insist upon being willing to remove life-sustaining resources from some of our country's most vulnerable citizens. It is really a punitive, mean-spirited effort to demonize the poor.  Let's look at who will be hurt by this retread proposal, because they tried this a few years ago and it was rejected.  SSI, or Supplemental Security Income, is an initiative to help some of our most disadvantaged The SSI program pays modest cash benefits that can be obtained only by, essentially, showing that you have got nothing--well, not exactly nothing. You can have total assets other than your home of $2,000. You can't have more than $735 a month in income. If you are younger than 65, you must be disabled, perhaps a victim of cancer, chronic heart failure, or blindness.[[Page H7597]]There is strict enforcement of these standards, with over 70 percent of those who apply being denied.  What kind of person will they finance this child abuse prevention program from? Well, the 50-year-old man who had an arrest warrant--this is a true case--that had been issued when he failed to show up for court.  Why did he do that? Shouldn't he be punished?  Well, it turns out he was in a coma at the time that the arrest warrant was issued. He was unable to breathe without a long plastic tube surgically inserted in his throat and connected to an oxygen tank on his wheelchair. By the time his case was resolved before a judge, the medical supply company was taking away the breathing equipment.  Or Rosa Martinez, who got confused with another Rosa Martinez, and she had to go to court even though she wasn't the person being accused.  Each of these people and so many others, like those suffering from dementia in a nursing home and who may never have been convicted of anything, are the type of people from whom they will take resources in order to fund a necessary program.  Republicans on our committee are so motivated by their rigid ideology that they would not even permit a discussion with our staff of how to move forward on this initiative unless we committed to funding every dollar by taking it away from some other vital social service program within our committee's jurisdiction.  It ought not be necessary to rob Paula in order to provide valuable services to little Even when they know how much is at stake, such as child abuse and disadvantaged children, and even when we have a way to address those problems and prevent that abuse, they won't add a single dollar of additional revenue.

104,topic-id,466,"Mr.President, textbook costs are one of the most overlooked barriers to college affordability and access, and they are continuing to get more expensive.  Over the last decade, 2006 to 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index shows that consumer prices for college textbooks increased almost 90 percent. It means students have to spend more every year. In 2016 to 2017, the College Board recommended that students budget an average of $1,250 for their books.  A survey released by the Student Public Interest Research Group reported that 65 percent of students decided not to buy a textbook because of the cost, and 94 percent of those students worried it would hurt their grade.  This week, I joined with Senators Al Franken and Angus King and Representatives Jared Polis and Kyrsten Sinema to reintroduce the Affordable College Textbook This bill would establish a grant program to encourage the creation and use of high-quality open textbooks which are free to use. Greater access to and widespread use of these open textbooks can save each student who uses one hundreds of dollars, and, long term, it puts pressure on the traditional college textbook market to come up with affordable alternatives.  My home State of Illinois provides an example of how this bill would work. The University of Illinois used $150,000 in Federal money to pilot an open textbook project at its main campus. The university, working With faculty, developed an open textbook, ``Sustainability: A Comprehensive Foundation.'' This textbook was published electronically for free and open use. You can go online today and find it.  Instead of a student having to shell out $150 or more for his or her introductory environmental sustainability class, he or she can use this free online book. That is a direct savings to a student every time a professor assigns this text in place of a traditional textbook. Today it is saving students money in Illinois, but also across the country at other colleges and universities where it has been adopted by faculty into their curriculum.  I would again like to thank my colleagues, Senators Al Franken and Angus King, for joining me in this effort I would also like to thank the wide variety of organizations that support this bill, including the U.PIRG, SPARC, National Association of Big Ten Students, National Association of College Stores, American Association of Community Colleges, United Negro College Fund, and others.  Mr.President, I hope that my colleagues in Congress will join us in supporting this bill to create a program at the Federal level to encourage the creation and adoption of these materials. In the meantime, I hope students across the country will reach out to their professors and have this conversation with them.

171,topic-id,3951,"Mr.President, over the last few days, three Republican Senators have publicly stated that they[[Page S6098]]will vote against the healthcare repeal bill that may come to the Senate this week.  In announcing his opposition, one Republican Senator, John McCain of Arizona, issued the following statement: ``As I have repeatedly stressed, healthcare reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate.''  Last night, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine stated: ``This is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue.''  She went on to say: ``The fact that a new version of this bill was released the very week we are supposed to vote compounds the problem.''  This should be the end of the Graham-Cassidy repeal debate. Republican leadership should finally scrap this one-sided effort to literally change the healthcare system for  There was a hearing yesterday--the only hearing on the bill we are about to vote on. It was a lengthy hearing, but it, frankly, did not entertain all of the witnesses or any amendment process so that Members could really have input into the bill we are going to face.  The Congressional Budget Office is supposed to tell us what this critical legislation will do for It issued a preliminary finding yesterday that millions of Americans would lose their health insurance and that those with preexisting conditions, as well as their families, if they could buy insurance, would find it very, very expensive.  At the end of this week, funding for our Nation's community healthcare centers will run out, as will funding for the Children's Health Insurance Shouldn't we be focused on reauthorizing those programs appropriately in a timely way? Let's allow the HELP Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction when it comes to healthcare, to do its work. I have faith in two Senators--one Republican and one Democrat--to do the right thing on this. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, have proven before that they can take complex issues such as Federal funding for education and find a bipartisan compromise.  What would America say if we announced at the end of next week or even this week that we have a bipartisan compromise to make healthcare stronger in the United States, that it is going to pass the Senate, that we are going to send to it the House, and that we are going to get something done this year in the Senate?  First, most Americans would be amazed and skeptical, as they should be, but if we can prove that we are going to do it, they would applaud us for finally reaching a point at which we do something on a bipartisan basis.  That was the process that was underway until last week. Senator Alexander was given orders by the leadership: Step back. Let's vote on Graham-Don't do anything more on a bipartisan basis.  Well, this is the week for that vote, and I hope it is the week in which that vote ends in the basic defeat of the approach and a return to bipartisan compromise and bipartisan negotiation.  I don't know what it will take for the Republicans in the Senate and the House to end this never-ending crusade against so-called They have voted 50, 60, 70 times. We know how they feel about it, but the American people have said to them: It is not enough to oppose ObamaCare; give us a better alternative. And that is where they have stumbled each time.  Over the weekend, rather than making improvements to fix what is wrong with their bill, many Republicans doubled down in secret meetings, negotiations, and with incentives that were built into the newest version of the bill.  The latest Graham-Cassidy repeal measure would slash funding to the States, decimate the Medicaid Program, eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions, and basically throw our entire healthcare system into chaos. A few special changes were made for special States, but the changes that have come to Graham-Cassidy in the closing days have not really changed the fundamental problem with the bill in that it diminishes Medicaid coverage.  Medicaid is the health insurance program about which most people say: Well, that is for the poor people of To some extent, that is true, but it has reached far beyond that. Two out of three senior citizens in nursing homes and other institutional settings rely on Medicaid for basic healthcare. If the cutbacks in Medicaid take place that Graham-Cassidy calls for, what will these seniors do? What will you do for Mom, for your grandmother, or for your grandfather when it reaches a point at which they cannot any longer count on Medicaid to help them pay their medical bills? Will American families have to step up with their own savings? Will they have to look for alternative settings to those in which their parents and grandparents are today? That is the stark choice Graham-Cassidy will create for many families across  No one has had time to properly review this latest proposal, in large part because it was drafted behind closed doors--no input from experts, no support from the medical community. You would think, after saying it over and over again, that the Republicans would challenge the following statement: There is no medical advocacy group in the United States of America who supports the Graham-Cassidy bill. That is the case in my The Illinois Hospital Association, doctors, nurses, surgeons, pediatricians, and community health are all opposed to this bill, every single one of them, as they were to the previous versions. It says something when the bill to change America's healthcare system is opposed by the people who provide healthcare to All of them oppose it. It is that bad.  Republican leaders want to force a vote this week. If that is what it takes, then we have to move to that vote, but I wish they would save some time. I wish they would move to this bipartisan negotiation I referred to earlier.  The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that is supposed to measure the impact of legislation so that, before we vote on it, we know if it is good or bad for the Nation and for the people we represent. Here is what it told us last night in a preliminary review, but it has not had time to review this bill in detail.  In a preliminary review, the CBO told us: ``The number of people with comprehensive health insurance . . . would be reduced by millions each year.''  How in the world can we as Senators make a proposal for the United States of America which we know will take health insurance coverage away from millions of Americans--exactly the opposite of what our goal should be?  The CBO went on to write: ``Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by about $1 trillion.''  There are some Republicans, fiscal conservatives who say that we have to stop the growth of this program, but none of them--not one of them--can address the fundamental issue: Who will then take care in paying for the delivery of babies to low-income families? Half of the children who are born in my State of Illinois are paid for by Their moms are taken care of by Medicaid until the moment of birth. What will you replace that with if you eliminate Medicaid funding?  What about the disabled who count on Medicaid as their health insurance? If you are blind or face a serious disability, Medicaid is the answer for basic health insurance for you. If you are going to cut $1 trillion out of Medicaid, what will you say to those disabled Americans who want the same peace of mind that we all want in having health insurance?  School districts all over Illinois and all over the Nation receive Medicaid funds to care for special ed students--counselors, transportation, even feeding tubes. If you take the money out of Medicaid, what will we do for those school districts that are trying their best to give kids a fighting chance, even those with serious disabilities? That is the reality.  The CBO went on to write: ``Coverage for people with preexisting conditions would be much more expensive . . . and could become unavailable for many more people.''  This Republican proposal takes us back to that moment in history when health insurance was so expensive and so hard to find--almost impossible for those with preexisting conditions. Why would we ever want to go back to that? There is hardly a family in America[[Page S6099]]who does not have someone they love, who is part of the family, who has a preexisting condition.  Let me remind those who do not have that circumstance that you are one accident or one diagnosis away from being part of this class of Americans who wants health insurance even though the health of those Americans has not been perfect.  In sum, this bill does not do what its authors say it will. They like to tell the American public that States will magically be able to cover the same number of people and provide the same level of benefits with billions of dollars less in funding. The Governors--Democrats and Republicans--have stepped up and said: This is ridiculous. We cannot be asked to accept the burden of health insurance for generations to come, while the Federal Government continues to cut the money that is necessary to provide that protection.  The CBO rejected the claims that are the basis for this Republican bill. Since the Republicans refuse to wait for the CBO to complete its full analysis, we have asked outside health experts what they think the impact would be of this legislation which is before us this week.  Here is what they say: Within a few years, this bill would likely rip health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million people in the State of In a State of 12\1/2\ million people, which I represent, 1 million people would lose health insurance because of this Republican proposal that is before us this week.  The average 60-year-old person in Illinois would see his health insurance premiums increase by $11,700 a year. Almost by $1,000 a month his health insurance would go up. Why? Because they change a basic formula. In the Affordable Care Act, we see that the disparity in premiums charged between the highest and lowest will be no more than 3 to 1. They change the ratio in their Republican bill to 5 to 1. It means that those over the age of 50 and under 65 are going to see premium increases estimated to be almost $1,000 a month.  By 2026, Illinois would see its healthcare funding slashed by $8 billion. By 2036, this number would soar to $153 billion.  Medicaid, which covers half of all children in Illinois and two out of three seniors in nursing homes, would be decimated. Also, the Medicaid expansion in Illinois, which helps us to combat the opioid epidemic, provide coverage for 650,000 Illinoisans, and bring stability to our hospitals all across the State, would be shut down.  Here is what the Illinois Hospital Association said about this bill:       Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens and      would be forced to reduce eligibility, covered services, and      payments to providers. The magnitude of these cuts and      changes to Medicaid is staggering.  Let's also review what this does to people with preexisting conditions. The Republicans say that this is all about giving flexibility to We hear that over and over again. It sure sounds nice until you realize that it is a code word for there being massive funding cuts and the elimination of basic health protection.  In the name of ``State flexibility,'' this bill would allow insurers to charge those with preexisting conditions sky-high premiums the moment they get sick.  Under this bill, ``State flexibility'' means reimposing annual and lifetime limits on patients, including infants who are born with serious medical problems.  Under TrumpCare, ``State flexibility'' means charging Americans over the age of 50 up to five times more than younger people. That is exactly why the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has steadfastly opposed these Republican changes.  To my Republican friends, ``State flexibility'' means tossing out essential health benefits, which is the guarantee that your insurance will cover the basic services your family may need--prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment.  I spoke to one of my Republican colleagues the other day and asked: What are you driving at here? Are you saying that we can reduce the cost of health insurance if we give people the option of saying that they will not buy coverage for mental illness and substance abuse treatment?  He said: Yes, that is one thing they can do.  I said: Then what happens next month when you discover that your daughter, a sophomore in high school, is now taking opioids and may move to heroin next? You want to intervene. You want to do it, but now you have to pay out of pocket because you didn't buy the essential coverage of mental illness and substance abuse treatment.  It is a shortsighted game to reduce premiums and give up basic essential benefits, but that is what Republicans propose. That is why this measure is opposed by every major medical provider and patient organization nationwide: AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, nurses, disability groups, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the Alzheimer's Association--the list goes on and on. But guess who also came out in opposition to this bill? Insurance commissioners and Medicaid directors. These are the officials who would actually have to implement these cuts. They agree with the Congressional Budget Office that you can't slash the healthcare budget by 20 to 30 percent and expect that States will have ``flexibility'' to make up the difference. The bipartisan association representing every Medicaid director in the country--every one of them--stated that Medicaid cuts would ``constitute the largest transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country's history.''  Show me a State that can cover as many people with the same benefits if one-third of the money is taken away. That is what the Republican bill does.  Here is what Governor Sandoval, a Republican Governor in Nevada, said:       Flexibility with reduced funding is a false choice. . . . I      will not pit seniors, children, families, the mentally ill,      hospitals, care providers, or any other Nevadan against each      other because of cuts to Nevada's health system proposed by      Graham- This is a Governor speaking in the same clear terms as Governors of both political parties about the impossible dilemma that would be created by this bill.  Enough is enough. The law that we passed, the Affordable Care Act, helped 20 million people get health coverage. People with preexisting conditions were finally protected. Women are no longer discriminated against when it comes to health insurance. Americans get free preventive healthcare, such as cancer screenings. Is it a perfect law? Not by any means, but at 3 percent of the individual market, we need to do better, and we can. We need to improve that market.  First, the Trump administration must do its best to help us, not hurt healthcare in If they are setting out to sabotage this healthcare system, they can do it, but I hope they will not. The President will not suffer if they do, but a lot of innocent American families will. It will make it harder for people to enroll in insurance groups. It will slash funding for outreach. It will actively discourage insurers to offer health plans to individuals.  Mr.President, I am going to yield the floor to the Democratic leader.  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that the September 22, 2017, article in the New Yorker by Atul Gawande be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New Yorker, 22, 2017]If the U.Adopts the G.O.P.'s Health-Care Bill, It Would Be an Act of                               Mass Suicide                           (By Atul Gawande)       The fundamental thing to understand about Senate      Republicans' latest attempt to repeal Obamacare is that the      bill under consideration would not just undo the Affordable      Care Act--it would also end Medicaid as we know it and our      federal government's half-century commitment to closing the      country's yawning gaps in health coverage. And it would do so      without putting in place any credible resources or policies      to replace the system it is overturning. If our country      enacts this bill, it would be an act of mass suicide.       In my surgery practice in Boston, I see primarily cancer      patients. When I started out, in 2003, at least one in ten of      my patients was uninsured. Others, who had insurance, would      discover in the course of their treatment that their policies      had annual or lifetime caps that wouldn't cover their costs,      or that[[Page S6100]]     they would face unaffordable premiums going forward because      they now had a pre-existing condition. When he was governor      of Massachusetts, it was Mitt Romney, a conservative, who      brought Republicans and Democrats together to make a viable      state system of near-universal coverage. That system then      served as a model for the A.C.The results have been clear:      increases in coverage have markedly improved people's access      to care and their health. For the last four years, health-     care costs in Massachusetts have risen more slowly than the      national average--while the national numbers themselves have      been at historic lows. I have not seen a single uninsured      patient--zero--in a decade. And now comes an utterly reckless      piece of legislation that would destroy these gains.       To review how we got to this point: last spring, the House      passed a health-care-reform bill that proposed to hollow out      the A.C.A.'s funding, insurance mandates, and protections for      people with pre-existing conditions. It was immensely      unpopular with the public. The problem was not just that      twenty-three million Americans would lose their health      insurance if the bill becomes law but also the Republicans'      vision of a health system where insurance with deductibles of      five thousand dollars and more, and little or no primary-care      coverage, would become the norm.       This summer, Senate Republicans failed to secure enough      votes to pass a modified version of the House bill. Later, in      a dramatic late-night session, the Senate also rejected, by a      single vote, a ``skinny'' repeal bill. That bill would have      repealed only the parts of the A.C.that required large      businesses to insure their workers and all Americans to carry      coverage. It would have resulted in a mere sixteen million      more uninsured people, according to estimates.       The Republican bill currently being rushed to a vote was      put forward by a group of senators led by Lindsey Graham, of      South Carolina, and Bill Cassidy, of As has become      the apparent rule for Republican health-care bills, there      have been no hearings or committee reviews of the Graham-     Cassidy bill. And, this time, lawmakers and the public do not      even have a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the      effects the bill would have on the budget, insurance costs,      or the uninsured rate.       This is unprecedented: senators are moving ahead with a      vote on a bill that would alter the health care of every      American family and the condition of a sixth of our entire      economy, without waiting to hear any official, independent      estimates of the consequences. The irresponsibility is as      blithe as it is breathtaking. Before becoming a senator,      Cassidy spent twenty-five years working as a physician in      hospitals devoted to the uninsured. I find it baffling that a      person with his experience would not recognize the danger of      this bill. But here we are.       The Graham-Cassidy bill goes even further than the bill      passed by the It would bring to a virtually immediate      end not only the individual and employer mandates but also      the whole edifice of the Medicaid expansion, insurance      exchanges, and income-based coverage subsidies set up under      the A.C.Graham-Cassidy expects all fifty states to then      pass, and implement, alternative health systems for tens of      millions of people within two years--with drastically less      money, in most states, than the current law provides. This is      not just impossible. It is delusional.       Like the House bill, Graham-Cassidy would cut Medicaid      payments for traditional enrollees--the elderly in nursing      homes, pregnant women in poverty, disabled children, etc.--by      a third by 2026. A portion of the money saved would go into a      short-term fund for states to use for health-care costs. The      rationale is that this would give states ``flexibility'' to      design coverage for their residents as they see fit. But the      amount of funding provided is, by multiple estimates,      hundreds of billions of dollars below what the A.C.     provides.       The bill also nakedly shifts funds from Democratic-leaning      states that expanded Medicaid under the A.C.to Republican-     leaning states that didn't. Analyses indicate that states      like California, Massachusetts, and New York will receive      block-grant funding anywhere from thirty-five to almost sixty      per cent below the health-care funding their residents would      receive under current law. Much of those missing funds would      be transferred to states like Texas, Mississippi, and      And special deals to make further shifts from blue      states to red states such as Alaska are being negotiated to      win votes.       As for what states can do with the funds they do receive,      they would not be allowed to use them to enroll people in      Medicaid, or able to establish a single-payer system. And      states would not be receiving enough to continue Obamacare on      their own. The only options for spending are for commercial      coverage. States will be permitted to let insurers bring back      higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions and to      reinstate annual and lifetime limits on coverage. And then,      starting in 2026, the funding turns out to only be temporary.      Under the bill's provisions, unless further action is taken      then, four trillion dollars will be removed from health-care      systems over twenty years.       With these massive sums being flung around, it is easy to      forget that this is about our health as human beings. The      evidence is that health-care programs like the A.C.save      lives. The way they do so is by increasing the number of      people who have affordable access to a regular source of care      and needed medications. Such coverage has been shown to      produce a substantial and increasing reduction in mortality--     especially among those with chronic illnesses, such as heart      disease, cancer, or H.I.V.--in as little as five years.       Virtually all of us, as we age, will develop serious health      conditions. A critical test of any health reform, therefore,      is whether it improves or reduces our prospects of having the      continuous care and medicines we need when we come to have a      chronic illness. The Graham-Cassidy bill fails this test. It      will terminate Medicaid coverage and insurance subsidies for      some twenty million people. The entire individual-insurance      market will be thrown into a tailspin. Federal protections      for insurance coverage will be gone.       Every major group representing patients, health-care      professionals, health-care institutions, and insurers has      come out vociferously against this plan. Governors from      Alaska to Ohio to Virginia have opposed the bill. In a highly      unusual, bipartisan statement, the national association      representing the Medicaid directors of all fifty states has      also opposed the bill. The top health official in Louisiana,      Cassidy's home state, has opposed the new plan. There is not      a single metric of health or health care that the Graham-     Cassidy plan makes better.

The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill is even more damaging      than the previous Senate and House repeal proposals. Not only      will it result in the loss of healthcare coverage for up to      one million Illinoisans, but it will erode key protections      for patients and consumers and will cut federal healthcare      resources to Illinois by more than $150       IHA also opposes changing Medicaid to a capped funding      model. Illinois already ranks 50th in the country in federal      funding support per Medicaid beneficiary. Capped funding      would lock Illinois into low, insufficient federal funding      levels and shift costs to the state.       Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens that      would be imposed on the state and would be forced to reduce      eligibility, covered services, and payments to providers. The      magnitude of these cuts and changes to Medicaid is      staggering.       We were encouraged by recent bi-partisan negotiations to      stabilize the individual marketplace. The Graham-Cassidy-     Heller-Johnson bill will do nothing in the short or long term      to create marketplace stability.       We urge the Senate to reject this proposal, and we implore      the members of the Illinois House Delegation to oppose the      bill if it passes the There is a great deal at stake      for the health and well-being of the people of  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6097-9.txt,326,BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIP ACT OF 2017,2017.0,26.0,September
173,topic-id,566,"Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the statement by the National Association of Medicaid Directors, to which I referred, be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the National Association of Medicaid Directors, 21, 2017]                    NAMD Statement on Graham-Cassidy       The Board of Directors of the National Association of      Medicaid Directors (NAMD) urges Congress to carefully      consider the significant challenges posed by the Graham-     Cassidy legislation. State Medicaid Directors are strong      proponents of state innovation in the drive towards health      care system transformation. Our members are committed to      ensuring that the programs we operate improve health outcomes      while also being fiscally responsible to state and federal      taxpayers. In order to succeed, however, these efforts must      be undertaken in a thoughtful, deliberative, and responsible      way. We are concerned that this legislation would undermine      these efforts in many states and fail to deliver on our      collective goal of an improved health care system.       1. Graham-Cassidy would completely restructure the Medicaid      program's financing, which by itself is three percent of the      nation's Gross Domestic Product and 25 percent of the average      state budget. Like BCRA, the legislation would convert the      traditional Medicaid program into a per-capita cap financing      system. All states will be impacted by this change,      regardless of their decisions to leverage the Medicaid      expansion option under the It would also incorporate[[Page S6101]]     Medicaid expansion funding and other ACA health funds into a      block grant, made available to all states. How these block      grants will be utilized, what programs they may fund, and the      overall impact they will have on state budgets, operations,      and citizens are all uncertain. Taken together, the per-     capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute      the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from      the federal government to the states in our country's      history. While the block grant portion is intended to create      maximum flexibility, the legislation does not provide clear      and powerful statutory reforms within the underlying Medicaid      program commensurate with proposed funding reductions of the      per capita cap.       2. The Graham-Cassidy legislation would require states to      operationalize the block grant component by January 1, 2020.      The scope of this work, and the resources required to support      state planning and implementation activities, cannot be      overstated. States will need to develop overall strategies,      invest in infrastructure development, systems changes,      provider and managed care plan contracting, and perform a      host of other activities. The vast majority of states will      not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned      here, especially considering the apparent lack of federal      funding in the bill to support these critical activities.       3. Any effort of this magnitude needs thorough discussion,      examination and analysis, and should not be rushed through      without proper deliberation. The legislative proposal would      not even have a full CBO score until after its scheduled      passage, which should be the bare minimum required for      beginning consideration. With only a few legislative days      left for the entire process to conclude, there clearly is not      sufficient time for policymakers, Governors, Medicaid      Directors, or other critical stakeholders to engage in the      thoughtful deliberation necessary to ensure successful long-     term reforms.       For these reasons, we encourage Congress to revisit the      topic of comprehensive Medicaid reform when it can be      addressed with the careful consideration merited by such a      complex undertaking--as we articulated in our June 26      statement on  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6097-9.txt,326,LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,26.0,September

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable College Textbook      Act''.     2.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a      barrier for many students in achieving higher education.       (2) According to the College Board, during the 2016-2017      academic year, the average student budget for college books      and supplies at 4-year public institutions of higher      education was $1,250.       (3) The Government Accountability Office found that new      textbook prices increased 82 percent between 2002 and 2012      and that although Federal efforts to increase price      transparency have provided students and families with more      and better information, more must be done to address rising      costs.       (4) The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and      sharing of digital content, including open educational      resources that can be freely used by students, teachers, and      members of the public.       (5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded use of open      educational resources has the potential to save students more      than a billion dollars annually.       (6) Federal investment in expanding the use of open      educational resources could significantly lower college      textbook costs and reduce financial barriers to higher      education, while making efficient use of taxpayer funds.     3.       In this Act:       (1) Educational resource.--The term ``educational      resource'' means an educational material that can be used in      postsecondary instruction, including textbooks and other      written or audiovisual works.       (2) Institution of higher education.--The term      ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the      term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20      U.S.1001).       (3) Open educational resource.--The term ``open educational      resource'' means an educational resource that either resides      in the public domain or has been released under an      intellectual property license that permits its free use,      reuse, modification, and sharing with others.       (4) Open textbook.--The term ``open textbook'' means an      open educational resource or set of open educational      resources that either is a textbook or can be used in place      of a textbook for a postsecondary course at an institution of      higher education.       (5) Relevant faculty.--The term ``relevant faculty'' means      both tenure track and contingent faculty members who may be      involved in the creation of open educational resources or the      use of open educational resources created as part of the      grant application.       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of     4. GRANT       (a) Grants Authorized.--From the amounts appropriated under      subsection (i), the Secretary shall make grants, on a      competitive basis, to eligible entities to support projects      that expand the use of open textbooks in order to achieve      savings for students while maintaining or improving      instruction and student learning outcomes.

Since the launch of this plan, the United States has promoted efforts to enhance the physical and economic security of women around the world. We have sought to break through the barriers that have stopped women from being full participants in peace processes.  This bill would make these policies permanent. It would build on the Obama administration's achievements, making sure State Department, USAID, and Pentagon personnel fully understand just how important it is to get women involved in conflict prevention and resolution. It would also require annual reporting so Congress can stay apprised of these efforts.  Now, we have been working a few years to get this legislation across the finish line, and, frankly, I don't think we can wait another moment.

Diplomacy and development efforts help to build stability. They defuse crises, they prevent conflicts, they help lay the groundwork for a more secure and more prosperous world.  History and research have shown us that when women are involved in these processes, they work even better. So it is smart policy. It is not a matter of being condescending. It is a matter of smart policy.  Think about the alternatives, about when we don't have diplomacy to help spread peace. Conflicts grow into wars--sometimes wars that American men and women will be required to fight. Populations are driven from their homes, triggering humanitarian crises. And the cost of dealing with these problems down the road is far higher than the cost of investing in diplomacy and development right now.  So this legislation is a piece of that puzzle. It isn't the whole thing, but it is an important piece. It is an important part of making sure American diplomacy can succeed, and I am glad to support it.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.

We all know that football, baseball, and many of our sports have been a level playing field where many people of different races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds come together and cheer for a particular team from their hometown or their region.  Instead of concentrating on bringing healthcare to millions of Americans or retreating on failed attempts to repeal and replace ObamaCare, the President chose to engage in another activity: tweeting that insulted Americans across the country.  Instead of engaging in a real, substantive discussion about the Dream Act and DACA recipients, looking at the provisions of the bipartisan legislation that has been put forward and cosponsored by close to 200 Members of[[Page H7523]]this House, led by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from Florida, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat from California, instead of going through the provisions of that bill that could bring relief for 800,000 young people who otherwise would be potentially deported--they are larger than any of the congressional districts that any one of us may represent in this Instead of looking at the provisions of that, rolling up our sleeves and coming here this week to discuss how we bring relief to 800,000 young people who are working, going to school, and are members of our Armed Forces, he chose to engage in distraction.  Instead of looking at a real humanitarian crisis about to ensue in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and some of our neighboring countries of Barbuda, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean, as well as the challenges of Florida and Houston, instead of taking a look at a potential humanitarian crisis that may ensue in Puerto Rico and bringing about relief for those 3.5 million Americans, he chose to look the other way.  We remember how a President hovered in his airplane over New Orleans and Louisiana as people drowned and died without getting the help they needed. This could be our modern-day Katrina, and yet our President chose to look the other way.                              {time}  1645  He could have engaged in bringing about results. Today, I join Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Adam Smith in signing on to a letter asking the Department of Defense to step it up in Puerto  We ask for a senior general to be appointed to work with FEMA to manage the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands the same way it was done for We ask for Department of Defense engineers and aviation assets to be deployed to Puerto Rico, as many of the municipalities up in the mountains are still cut off from the general population and have not been heard of for nearly a week.  We ask for technicians and experts to bring restoration of power and to work with telecommunications on the island because people are still disconnected from government, from hospitals, from the police department. There is no cell service; there is no energy on the island; and we ask for that as well.  We ask, in this letter, for the USNS Comfort, an offshore medical treatment facility, to be deployed to the island of Puerto Puerto Rico only has two hospitals that have been able to restore power, yet the President looked this weekend the other way.  For three major pieces and issues that confront the American people: healthcare, as it pertains to close to maybe 30 million people that may lose their services if this failed attempt to repeal and replace ObamaCare goes through; DACA, impacting over close to a million young people who go to school, who work, who are part of our future economic recovery, who are members of the Armed Forces; and the humanitarian crisis, a new-day Katrina that is about to ensue in Puerto Rico--for those three issues of great importance to America, our President looked the other way.

The worst was dished out by nature and high winds. The best was the spirit of the Texans who rose to the challenge. It was neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger.  I live in Corpus It is a relatively large community of almost 400,000 in the metropolitan area. We were spared the brunt of It missed us by about 20 miles. But just across the bay, communities like Port Aransas, Aransas Pass, Ingleside, Rockport, Refugio, Tivoli, and many more took horrible winds. Ninety-some-odd percent of the homes in the resort town of Port Aransas are uninhabitable right now. The brand new school in Refugio they just turned the keys over had the roof blown off and was severely water damaged, and it will be weeks before they are fully operational again in that school.  Rockport, with their beautiful oak trees, had limbs and branches strewn all over the streets, and houses' second stories are gone. They looked great from the front, but then you would look in the back, and there would be no back.  In Port Aransas, boats having risen and moved inland, an oil drilling platform loose in the ship channel, completely changing the skyline of the city.  But rather than sitting around and moping and crying, Texans came together, helped each other clear the debris, and are slowly but surely getting on with their lives.  The recovery period is going to be tough, though. There is just so much debris. They are picking it up and stacking it at transfer stations, but it will be months before the process is finished. It is tough driving down the streets of the places you love seeing debris stacked, smelling the rotting mold. But you know it is going to come back.  We are struggling right now to find homes for people, places for them to stay. People have been staying with friends and relatives. FEMA has been helping out with hotels. I have to say, I am really impressed with the way local, State, and Federal folks are working hard to give people a hand up. We have had leaders from President Trump down to Members of Congress and all throughout the country come to see what is going on, and all have pledged their help. And it is going to be a Herculean effort to come back, but come back we will.  I suspect in a year, certainly in 2 years, towns like Rockport and Port Aransas, where many folks vacation, are going to have their doors open again and inviting people to come visit. In fact, the goal is to be ready by spring break of this year, and I suspect it is going to be worth visiting.  You need to help the businesses out, need to help the people out by not forgetting us, by keeping us in your prayers, and by supporting us here in Congress as we give the people the help they need to rebuild their lives.

298,topic-id,1708,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the Republican healthcare bill known as Graham-You would expect that Republicans' fourth attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act would be better than the previous three. In fact, the opposite is true. This bill is the worst of the four bills.  This is especially personal for me because the bill hurts California more than any other Before I get to this attack on my home State, I would like to list just a few of the many ways this bill harms millions of Americans and puts countless lives at risk.  This bill boots at least 32 million Americans off healthcare. There is no sugarcoating it; Graham-Cassidy cuts health insurance subsidies and slashes Medicaid funding. That will mean fewer people with healthcare, plain and simple.  The bill ends guaranteed protections for those with preexisting conditions. Anyone who says otherwise is not telling the truth. This bill says that States can allow insurance companies to charge those with preexisting conditions whatever they want. That means an end to guaranteed coverage because people with health conditions would be charged so much they wouldn't be able to afford coverage. Arguments to the contrary are just wrong.  This bill not only eliminates the Medicaid expansion, it ends Medicaid as we have known it since 1965. The Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act has meant 15 million more vulnerable Americans have gained insurance. With those funds gone, they lose coverage. By radically changing traditional Medicaid, States would have to either cover hundreds of billions in additional costs or kick people off Again, fewer people with coverage, more lives at risk--these are facts, and they are indisputable.  This bill is also devastating for women's health. It ends the guarantee that maternity care, contraception, and other critical services women need will be covered and bars women on Medicaid from accessing Planned Parenthood, which is the primary healthcare provider for millions of American women. We hear so much from the other side about the importance of being able to choose your doctor. This bill says that, if you have chosen a doctor at Planned Parenthood, too bad. It doesn't matter how much you like that doctor; you need to find someone else.  The bill also takes us back to the days of junk plans, when you could faithfully pay your premium and then discover you weren't covered when you got sick. The Affordable Care Act required all insurance companies to cover essential health benefits like cancer treatment, maternity care, prescriptions, and mental health. Graham-Cassidy says States can waive that protection.  Those items I described affect all Americans, but as I said, this bill is also a direct attack on California and other Democratic When the Supreme Court ruled that the Affordable Care Act couldn't require States to expand Medicaid to cover more families, some Republican States used that as a way to attack President Obama's legacy. Never mind that they were risking their own constituents' lives, it was a political win for them.  Now, Graham-Cassidy proposes taking Federal funds away from those States that did expand Medicaid and give it to those that refused. In California alone, 4 million have health insurance today because my State decided to accept the Federal Government's 90 percent contribution for a small 10 percent buy-in. Graham-Cassidy would end that, pulling the rug out from under those To say this is unconscionable is an understatement.  What is worse, the bill's authors openly admit this is their strategy--to redirect money from States like California and New York to Republican Senator Cassidy said he is just trying to create ``parity,'' but the reason there isn't parity is because Republican Governors and legislatures chose to put politics over people's health. States can choose at any time to opt-in and receive the 90 percent match for Medicaid expansion. Candidly, it is a revolting way to get a bill passed  The one part of this bill that is the same as past versions is the dire cuts to This needs to be repeated: The only thing congressional Republicans have agreed on throughout this entire process is that children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and seniors in nursing homes get too much healthcare.  For any of my colleagues who don't realize the full extent of what Medicaid does for this country, allow me to explain. Gutting Medicaid would devastate care for children, particularly those with disabilities and complex healthcare needs. If anything in Washington were untouchable, I would think it would be providing healthcare to sick children, but apparently not.  Each Republican healthcare bill in the House and Senate goes far beyond just repealing the Affordable Care It essentially ends Medicaid as we have known it since 1965, the year President Lyndon Johnson created the program. Today, Medicaid covers 36 million children, including 5 million in That is nearly half of all children in this country. The program has always been a partnership between the States and the Federal The Federal Government has paid a fixed share of all healthcare costs for Medicaid beneficiaries.  Republicans want to end that partnership. Their plan would place strict limits on Federal payments, with States responsible for all costs above that limit. We don't have a full CBO score of this bill, so we don't have the exact numbers, but outside estimates of the total cuts in this bill show States losing over $4 trillion over the next two decades. Let me repeat that figure: over $4 trillion of cuts to Medicaid and health insurance subsidies within a generation.  California alone would be required to pay $139 billion more between 2020 and 2027, and over the next 20 years, it would cost my State $800 billion. These cuts would be backbreaking and force many States to make extremely hard choices. If California couldn't come up with tens of billions of dollars more each year, millions of residents could lose their Medicaid coverage. California's Medicaid director said, ``Nothing is safe--no population, no services.''  In July, I visited UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San I met with three mothers--Kristin, Sally, and Their children--Maggie, Megan, and Drew--have struggled with extraordinary healthcare needs including cerebral palsy, a congenital heart defect, and VATER syndrome, which is a set of complex birth defects. If it weren't for the first-class care they received at Benioff, they wouldn't have survived.  These mothers are heroes. They have dedicated their lives to their children, doing all they can to ensure they lead full, happy lives in the face of such significant adversity. When I asked them how they and their children cope, Nina told me that you simply do your best to live the life you have.  All three of these families are middle class. They are covered by employer-sponsored private insurance, but Medicaid fills the significant gaps in coverage. It covers in-home nurses to provide around-the-clock care, as well as first-rate medical equipment--services that private insurance doesn't cover. Without in-home care, their children would have been placed in institutions to ensure access to critical around-the-clock care.  If the Senate passes a bill that guts Medicaid, mothers like these may not be able to keep their children at home.[[Page S6128]]That is a stunning indictment of a party that proclaims its commitment to ``family values.'' One of the first areas where these cuts could show themselves would be our country's 220 top-rate children's hospitals. On average, 60 percent of patients at these hospitals are covered by In some facilities, that number is as high as 80 percent. Those hospitals would inevitably need to reduce services and consolidate locations. Their ability to stay open would be threatened.  You don't need to take my word on this point. The doctors and healthcare professionals who run children's hospitals have made this point crystal clear. Michael Anderson, CEO of Benioff Children's says, ``Graham-Cassidy will be devastating to sick children and their families. If Graham-Cassidy is implemented, children with complex illnesses will be more likely to have less funding available to them than what they actually need.''  Paul Viviano, CEO of Children's Hospital Los Angeles--one of the country's top 10 children's hospitals--said previously that the cuts like this to the Medicaid Program would ``threaten'' their programs and ``put at risk life-saving services.'' The reach of these cuts would extend far beyond patients who rely on the Medicaid That is because the research and training of specialists at children's hospitals improves care for children nationwide. If specialists aren't available or are never trained, that hurts all children. Todd Suntrapak, CEO of Valley Children's in Madera, CA, told me that gutting Medicaid ``threatens the very viability of pediatric health care in this country.''  Gutting Medicaid also threatens the wide range of supplemental services like speech and physical therapy that allow children with disabilities to thrive. Many of the letters and calls I have received in opposition to the bill have been from mothers advocating on behalf of their children with disabilities because they know these cuts would hurt their families.  Beth from Davis, CA, has a son named Patrick with Down syndrome. Patrick also battled leukemia as a child. Despite the challenges he has faced, Patrick will soon graduate from high school. His mom expects him to secure a job and live independently because of the support he receives through California's regional center programs.  Medicaid provides the vast majority of the $2.5 billion in Federal funding that our 21 regional center programs receive to facilitate job-training, physical therapy, and other supports for those with disabilities. Beth wrote to me that her family has ``every reason to believe that Patrick will be a tax-paying Californian and we can't wait!'' Gutting Medicaid puts the services that have allowed Patrick to be in a position to graduate from high school on the chopping block.  I would like to close by reminding my Republican colleagues that, if they pass this bill, they are effectively abandoning families during the most painful and difficult times in their lives--telling them they are on their own. I don't believe that is the type of country we are, and it is up to Senate Republicans to prove it.

908,topic-id,440,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce a resolution to recognize September as Workforce Development  As technological advances reshape traditional fields and fuel the emergence of new industries, it is imperative that our workforce development system remain agile and flexible in order to educate and train the next generation of workers and those needing additional on-the-job training skills to stay competitive.  In addition, it is vital that we recognize the importance of all career pathways and professional development whether an individual pursues a 4-year degree or seeks to further their education at a community college, through an industry recognized certificate program, or as an apprentice.  In an effort to face this challenge head on, Congress passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in 2014 with overwhelming bipartisan support. WIOA was signed into law by President Obama and has helped streamline the workforce development system while increasing and strengthening partnerships between regional businesses, workforce development boards, and educational institutions.  In fact, it is these partnerships that have proven to be key to regional success at addressing the workforce needs of businesses. By working together, local businesses and educators can ensure that not only do businesses have access to the talent they need to grow but that those seeking work can find it.  Nationwide, the more than 550 workforce development boards and 2,500 American Job Centers have become a driving force behind growing regional economies by providing training, resources, and assistance to workers aiming to compete in the 21st century economy.  These workforce development boards and American Job Centers work with job seekers and employers across industries ranging from healthcare and information technology to manufacturing and construction.  There are currently nearly half a million registered apprentices across the country, including nearly fifty thousand in California alone.  Bipartisan support for earn-and-learn approaches such as apprenticeships and paid internships is critical for helping future workers gain the skills and experience they need while being able to provide for themselves and their families.  In recognition of workforce development month, Congress reaffirms its support for a comprehensive approach to workforce development, encourages partnerships between industry leaders and educators, and emphasizes the importance of all career pathways in pursuit of economic prosperity.  In closing, during this month it is essential that we acknowledge and commend the professionals who work every day to make these efforts a reality. America's workforce is the backbone of our economy and it is the expertise, dedication, and knowledge of these professionals that has helped develop such a robust system.[[Page S5889]]  Mr.President, I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution and encouraging the continued growth of our workforce development system.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-25-pt1-PgS5888.txt,1332,REMOVE TAX-EXEMPT STATUS OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS LEAGUES,2017.0,25.0,September

181,topic-id,1037,"Mr.President, the Democrats talked this morning about the Affordable Care Act and what the reform efforts are trying to do and what they are not trying to do. I want to associate myself with the comments made by my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, earlier today.  A lot of talk has been thrown around about how the new effort would cut Medicaid spending. As my colleague from Nebraska mentioned, here in Washington a cut is not a cut anywhere else. But if you deal with the rate of growth, if you raise spending only by the Consumer Price Index rather than the medical Consumer Price Index--5[[Page S6106]]percent rather than 6 percent, for example--then you are somehow cutting the program.  We know that the program as it currently stands is unsustainable. I think we all recognize that. So any efforts to deal with and to allow Governors and others at the local level to have more of a say on how these funds are spent and to gain efficiencies that way are frowned upon. It is said that we simply can't do that because it would be cutting That simply isn't the case.  Arizona, for example, has a version of Medicaid called It is done far more efficiently than some of the other States do it. That is because at the local level they have been able to do what local governments do best. The government that is closer to the people generally spends money more wisely and finds efficiencies that the Federal Government simply can't find.  Let me mention that on the exchange, the Affordable Care Act dealt with a couple of different things. It is a so-called exchange where people who can't get insurance otherwise or don't get it through their employers will buy it on either a Federal exchange or a State exchange. Then you have the Medicaid side. Let me speak for a minute on the exchange side.  Arizona has been ground zero for the failure of the ObamaCare exchange. We have 15 counties in In all 15 counties, if you are a family of four and you are buying on the exchange, you are paying more on average for your healthcare premiums than you are for your mortgage. Think about that for a minute. You are paying more for your healthcare premiums than you are for your mortgage in every county in In some counties in Arizona you are paying double. In every county it is more, in some counties significantly more, and in a couple of counties you are paying double for your healthcare premiums--much more than what you are paying for your mortgage.  I spoke yesterday with an elected official from Arizona from one of the rural counties. He told me that his healthcare premium, which he simply can't afford anymore for his family of four children, would have been $2,800 a month. That is what it has gone up to. It has doubled virtually every year. In some counties in Arizona, we saw increases of 116 percent. He owned insurance prior to ObamaCare, was paying a reasonable amount for a premium, and had copays and deductibles that were reasonable as well. But when the Affordable Care Act came in, the promise that you could keep your doctor or keep your plan simply wasn't the case. His premiums have gone up, up, and up until now; he has a premium of $2,800 monthly for his family of four children.  Keep in mind, as well, that there are the deductibles on top of that. Were he to use that insurance, by the time he satisfies the family deductible, which is about $12,000, he has paid--or he will pay if he has any medical issues--between premiums and deductibles, more than $40,000 before the first insurance dollar kicks in.  So when we hear from the other side of the aisle that there is no problem with ObamaCare, that the only thing we have to worry about is, for some people who have gained insurance, to make sure they keep that--I agree we have to make sure those with preexisting conditions have access to affordable care. But when you have people on the exchange who simply can't find affordable care and if they do have a policy they can't afford to use it because deductibles and copays are so high, we have a problem.  The latest figures tell us that 155,000 Arizonans woke up this morning without any insurance. Most of them had insurance prior to the Affordable Care Act, but then insurance was priced out of their reach. So 155,000 people are paying a fine to the Federal Government because of their inability to find affordable insurance. They pay that fine, and they still have no insurance. Tell me that is not something we have to fix. We have to fix that. That is what we are responding to here.  This notion that it is all hunky-dory--keep with the plan--belies the fact that 155,000 Arizonans woke up this morning and said: We are paying a fine to the Federal Government because we can't find affordable care, and still we have no care, and we are somehow supposed to be OK with that. Somehow we are supposed to wait until we can find a solution for it all before we address that specific situation.  I submit that we have to fix this. People in Arizona and elsewhere are hurting. Let's stop with the rhetoric that this is somehow a cut and people will be left on the streets. We heard that back in 1996 with welfare reform. It was said that the Governors or others at the local level couldn't participate, couldn't be in charge of this program because people would be dying on the streets. Guess what. Within a couple of years, the welfare rolls had been cut in half. We are doing better, and the Federal Government's obligation in that regard has been sustainable, unlike the current situation we have with the so-called Affordable Care  I hope we can stop the outrageous rhetoric on this and actually fix the problem. Let's fix the problem for Arizonans who are hurting right now.  With that, I yield back.

1169,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I cannot believe what I just heard on this floor.  Kneeling as a sign of respect?  I don't recall my Democratic colleagues kneeling when former President Obama would come to address this body. They stood as a sign of respect. That is what we do in this country, Republicans and Democrats, for our flag, for our anthem.  That is why I joined so many Americans in anger and disgust when I saw NFL players, multimillionaires, kneeling during the national anthem, and it is such an overgeneralized indictment. If people have a problem with police brutality or the criminal justice system, there are venues for discussion, even for protest that highlight and isolate those issues for an adult in a responsible discussion.  When people kneel during our national anthem, they don't simply indict the issue with which they take some particular grievance. They indict our country, our servicemembers, our first responders, our Founding Fathers, and the principles that made this country great.  But, see, this freedom that we enjoy also includes the freedom of speech, the right of our citizens to express themselves even when we find that expression offensive. It is a fundamental constitutional right, yet nowhere in the Constitution does it say that hardworking Americans have to subsidize or create special carve-outs and exemptions for conduct that they find unpatriotic.  Unfortunately, today, the Tax Code gives special breaks to sports leagues. Some swamp creature of yesteryear cleverly defined sports leagues as tax-exempt trade organizations.  The public pays 70 percent of the cost of NFL stadiums. Tax-exempt sports leagues generate $2 billion in revenue, yet the Tax Code gives them special treatment, gives them a special break that small businesses in my district don't get. That is unfair.  It is outrageous that we take money away from hardworking Americans to subsidize professional sports at all. The return on investment is negative. I have heard these arguments in my home State of Florida: Oh, these sports clubs create jobs and revenue and economic activity.  Look, every economic analysis showed that this is a negative return on investment, a loser for taxpayers, and corporate welfare at its worst.  The Internal Revenue Code must be amended to remove the tax-exempt status for professional sports leagues permanently. I am glad that the NFL voluntarily gave up their status, but we should make this change permanent and we should make it the law.  In the coming days and weeks, we will be discussing tax relief to lift up the middle class. I support whole-scale, bold, conservative tax reform; but we have an opportunity in this tax bill to send an even more profound message: In America, if you want to play sports, you are free to do so. You are also free to protest. You are welcome to do both, but you should do it on your own time and on your own dime.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7495.txt,99999999999999,1545,2017.0,26.0,September

963,topic-id,893,"Mr.Speaker, is Donald Trump running a Cabinet or a country club?  Because every day it is getting harder to tell. Not only is the President spending vast sums to ferry himself to and from his various golf courses, but now it turns out that top leaders in his administration have developed a special fondness for traveling by private jet.  The Treasury Secretary used a taxpayer-funded plane to hop down to Fort Knox to see the eclipse, for example, and he has also asked to use one for his honeymoon in  Trump's EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, spent another $58,000 on private jets. But the worst offender is HHS Secretary Price, who, in his brief time in office, has already chalked up an astonishing 400 grand in flights on private aircraft. He flew down to Tennessee for all of 6 hours, much of which was spent having lunch with his son. That is nice. He also jetted off to an island off the coast of Georgia for a trip that apparently featured far more recreation than government business. Clearly, when it comes to travel on the taxpayers' dime, the price does not matter to Tom Ethics and personal responsibility doesn't matter to Tom Doing what is right doesn't matter to Tom Price, and that is why he needs to resign immediately.                              {time}  1245  Now, don't take my word for it. Here is what President George Bush's top ethics official, Richard Painter, said about Price's travel habits: ``To use a charter flight on something that combines personal and government business, I think, is highly unprofessional and really inappropriate.'' Those are strong words.  But, Mr.Speaker, you know who summed up best how terrible it is for someone to use private jets? Tom Price, himself. Let's see what Tom Price said. In 2009, he described government officials taking private planes as ``just another example of fiscal irresponsibility run amok.'' I couldn't agree more, Mr. Price spent nearly $25,000 to fly from D.to Philadelphia and back for one single day. He could have spent, at last minute, $725 to get there on United Airlines, or $133 to get there on Amtrak.[[Page H7622]]  Mr.Speaker, I just checked, on my phone, that an Uber to Philly right now, back and forth, would have cost Mr.Price about $450 round trip. That means that, for the price of his private jet, he could have ordered individual cars for himself and his 54 staff members. Every American who works and pays taxes should find this totally appalling.  Amtrak was good enough for the Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, but, somehow, it is beneath the Treasury Secretary and HHS Secretary to ride the train. Riding the train is apparently even beneath the EPA  Here is a good rule of thumb, Mr.Speaker: If you are spending more on private jets than most American families make in 1 year, you are spending too much on private jets.  Tom Price has plenty of time to go jetting around the country, but not enough time, for example, to ensure that millions of kids won't lose their coverage when CHIP expires soon.  There is apparently plenty of money at HHS for private jets, but very little to help people sign up for health insurance. That is completely unacceptable.  Secretary Price says he needs to fly around on his jet to connect with ordinary citizens. I am not kidding. His press secretary told reporters that these outrageous junkets were about ``getting outside of D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people.''  Mr.Speaker, here is how you really connect with your fellow Americans: don't take a private plane; fly a middle seat in coach.  Of course, we should have seen this coming. News reports earlier this year revealed that, when he was a Member of Congress, Price was guilty of introducing legislation to benefit his own personal investments. Even more egregious, he traded more than $300,000 in healthcare industry stocks based on insider information.  There is no question Secretary Price needs to resign right now, and, if he doesn't, President Trump needs to fire him.  Donald Trump claims that he loves firing people. He once said: I love doing it if someone really, really, really deserves it.  Mr.Speaker, Secretary Price really, really, really deserves it.  Then again, we all know Trump won't actually do anything. We are all familiar with the Trump way of doing business with its bad deals and bankruptcies.  Here's the Trump way of doing government.  Number one, hire people proven to be corrupt.  Number two, create an environment in which corruption and bad behavior are encouraged.  Number three, do absolutely nothing when the corruption and bad behavior is exposed.  This administration talks about putting America first. This administration talks about draining the swamp, but its Cabinet officials are more interested in traveling first class.  This administration talks about making America great again, but they are really only concerned about never ever having to wait at another airport gate again.  This administration talks about fighting for working families, but its top leaders are only concerned about lining their own pockets with taxpayers' hard-earned money.

The United States has been hit with three major hurricanes. In Houston, they say was a 500-year storm. The Florida Keys, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, disasters beyond, in many cases, human understanding. We have never seen 50 inches of rain in a matter of days.  We have seen storms in the Caribbean that have been vicious. I don't believe we have ever seen one that completely wiped out an island, leaving 3.5 million people without water and power, islands in the Florida Keys flattened, and floods throughout most of  These are natural disasters.  We look to our neighbors in the south, and we see Mexico City, that great capital, once again, lay bare with an earthquake. Further south and west of that, another community. Yet, just yesterday and the day before, another earthquake.  These are natural disasters.  As Members of Congress representing 350-plus million Americans, we have an obligation. You heard a couple of our colleagues speak to this.  I went to bed last night with visions and pictures of Puerto Rico on the television screen. I woke up this morning,[[Page H7522]]turned the television on, and it was all about the President calling a couple of athletes a name that I should not repeat on the floor.                              {time}  1630  What is going on here? How could it be that, 2 days after the devastation of Puerto Rico, our President would decide that the appropriate thing for him to do is to call out African-American athletes who are protesting the death of African Americans at the hands of police?  All of that was followed in just a few moments by experts who were saying that we are closer to nuclear war today than we have been since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the sixties.  What in the world is going on here? What is happening? Why are we in this situation? Why is it that we are not debating here on the floor of the House how to provide relief to Houston, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands--our own citizens?  Is there a debate going on in the House of Representatives in any hearing? No, there isn't.  Is there a debate on the floor about the necessity to rebuild, to find the money to put back the lives of people who are seriously at risk today?  What are we doing?  Well, here is what we are doing. We have got a President that is in a third grade brawl with a world leader. You may as well be in a classroom or on the school grounds with a bunch of third graders calling out each other about their mother. That is what our President did over the weekend.  How did that promote our humanity, our empathy? Not a bit.  How did it promote our division? Oh, it did a very good job of that. We see fans in the NFL stadiums booing the athletes.  We see more division in our country. We see natural disasters. And our response? Let's pass a bill that will create a humanitarian crisis for 30 million Americans who will lose their healthcare over the next decade. That is what the Senate did over these last few days, a replication of what happened here on the floor of the House of Representatives months ago.  I think Americans thought those days were over when we would see the Senate and the House purposely harm people, purposely set out with legislation to physically harm people by denying them the health insurance that they have been provided over the last few years.  How can it be? How can it be that we would allow this to happen? But it is happening.  Thankfully, four Senators stood up to the President, stood up to the Republican leadership in the Senate and said: I am not going to set out on a vote that is going to harm people.  I thank them. They had courage.  Where were the others? Where were my Republican colleagues here on this floor who voted to do exactly the same thing months ago? Millions of Americans purposely denied their health insurance.  Where is the outrage?  It is out there. Take a look at the polling. Take a look at the disabled men and women who were in the Senate Chamber yesterday who were physically dragged out of there--a fine testament to America's democracy.  Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage that there is not a bill on the floor this week to take care of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands--American citizens? I guess there is something more important to do.  Where is our President? What is his tweet today? His tweet today is who knows what. I guess he is going to Puerto Rico next week, thankfully. Maybe there will be some humanity expressed and he will put in motion the great power of this administration to bring relief and to ask the Congress to appropriate the money that is going to be necessary.  Maybe it will be another tweet about a leader who has the fourth largest army in the world. You have third graders on the school ground bullying and demeaning, and you expect somehow to go anywhere except into a brawl?  There is a road that we could take, but it begins with reducing the rhetoric. There is a road we can take with North It is called negotiation.  Don't say it is not possible. It is far more possible and would have a far better outcome than all the bombast, all the rhetoric, all the threats.  All of us have been in the third grade. We know what happens when two boys start fighting on the school ground.  These boys have awesome weapons. We have 25,000 U.military on the DMZ border. They are ready to fight. We have an awesome military. It should only be used with wisdom. It should not be put at risk unnecessarily. There are tens of thousands of American servicemembers, spouses, and children nearby, and millions of South Koreans and North  It is time for our President to speak softly. We know we have a big stick. Speak softly. Tone it down. Move toward the negotiations. It would be far more fruitful. We can do this.  I go back home, as I did this weekend, and I do my community events. People come up to me and say: I am scared; I am frightened. What is our President doing? Why is he acting this way? Why is Kim Jong-un acting this way?  We don't need another crisis. We have got to deal with this. We have got to do it with wisdom, plenty of strength, and determination. God help us if we get in a war on the Korean Peninsula again.  Consider for a moment that the 1953 Korean war never ended. It was an armistice. It is time for a peace treaty. It is time to recognize that there are two countries. It is time to settle this down. It is time for this Congress to turn its attention to the reality of the crisis that faces Americans--yet we don't.  Instead, we have had more than 2 weeks of attention on legislation that would purposely harm millions upon millions of Americans by taking away their health insurance. We have got to put that behind us. We have got to find ways to improve the Affordable Care We must do this. People are hurting.

While we are doing that, let us use the normal, natural empathy that resides in each one of us to reach out to those in Puerto Rico, Florida, Houston, and the Virgin Islands and use our innate compassion to provide the resources for them to rebuild.  Then, let's take it a step further. Instead of calling out Mexico, instead of getting into a verbal and perhaps economic conflict with Mexico, let us work with Reach out to Mexico City now.

201,topic-id,3382,"Mr.Speaker, this has been a day that answered a lot of our prayers seeing our good friend Steve Scalise here, and it brings to mind part of the story of that tragic morning that I haven't heard told anywhere else.  One of our Members, Georgia Congressman Barry Loudermilk, was there, and he was--the shooter started from behind the third base dugout and hit Steve Scalise right away. It was so deeply touching to hear Steve's words today. It is just rather emotional seeing so many of our prayers answered, seeing Steve return to the  That morning, Barry was saying that he was behind a little closet area, and as the shooter was moving toward the first base side continuing to shoot, Matt Mika had already been shot and was down, and Barry realized that he had no place to go. He looked for places to run, and there was no place to run.  The shooting had been going on for a while, perhaps 9 or 10 minutes at that point. Capitol Police Officer Griner was there. She and David Bailey, the other Capitol Police officer, were using their suburban for cover and shooting at the shooter--the hate-filled leftist who felt like it was a good idea to kill as many Republicans in Congress as he could.  It was gratifying to hear that admission from our friend from Maryland, former majority leader Hoyer, that it was hateful. He was full of hate. He was a leftist who had supported Bernie It is not Bernie's Sanders' fault. You don't hear Republicans blaming a party or a candidate that a hate-filled person supported, but he was going to kill people. He was doing what he could.  Barry had no place to go, and he was working his way to where he was about--Barry was going to be in the open and could see there was no place to go, and he said a prayer. He saw that Officer Griner had been shot in the ankle, and she was trying to return fire but under tremendous amount of pain.  Just when it looked hopeless, David Bailey stepped out, completely uncovering himself. He had no cover at that point, and yelled twice: ``Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon.'' And as he said those words, the shooter fired twice at him. And as soon as he finished saying, ``Drop your weapon'' the second time, he fired twice and took the shooter down. Incredible courage.  When I saw David Bailey out at the hospital a few days after the shooting, I said: ``Barry Loudermilk said that when it looked pretty hopeless for him, you stepped out from behind the suburban completely uncovered, that you made yourself a target taking all the attention toward yourself. Did you do that?''  And David Bailey, a hero in every sense of the word, with his normal casual way of speaking, just said: ``It hit me all of a sudden. I had to make it him or me. I had to make it him or me. That is when I stepped out. And, fortunately, it was him.''  That kind of courage--when a shooter is about to get to a position to take out a bunch of defenseless people, some lying on the ground in the dugout, if he had made it just a little further, there would have been a lot of people killed that day.  Crystal Griner shooting as she could and David Bailey stepping away from any cover, and he just instinctively knew, ``I have to make it him or me,'' thank God and thank David Bailey he is still here today and the hate-filled shooter is not  So it was touch and go. The hate that filled this leftist shooter almost did in a couple of people who day. But by the grace of God, the great work of the doctors--but as the doctor said out there that night after the shooting, telling me, the President, Melania, and my staff member Andrew Keyes, it was--he said he would be on pins and needles that night because he just didn't know.  To see Steve Scalise, our dear friend, standing right here earlier today, is just an answer to prayer, and I can't wait to cook ribs again for my friend Steve Scalise very soon.  It is also a good day for America, despite the House passing a bill that would have helped Americans by at least repealing part of ObamaCare, as we had promised, and despite the immense suffering by millions around this country who actually became victims of the lie that if you like your insurance, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep him or her--well, it turns out those were lies when they were spoken, and the people who spoke them knew they were lies when they spoke them. It was discussed that that would not be the case, they wouldn't be able to keep their insurance, and people haven't.  It is a bit disingenuous when some of the alt-left media boasts that so many millions of people have gotten insurance that didn't have it, because there are an awful lot of people in my district that had insurance and, because of ObamaCare, they lost it, and then they were put on Medicaid--not even Medicare, but So they lost their doctor, they lost the hospital that was no longer in the network for Medicaid that they had before. ObamaCare took their insurance.  The people who have talked to me in east Texas and as I go around in other parts of the country, they were desperate. They have been desperate. They are still desperate. They say: Please, you got to give us some help.  It is tragic when you have some millionaires in the Senate who can get whatever healthcare they want, turning a cold shoulder to those suffering around the country because the countless promises they made to repeal ObamaCare are being broken every day we are in session and the Senate does not pass at least some kind of repeal of  I mean, what kind of person promises over and over, ``You elect me, I will repeal ObamaCare, I will get it repealed,'' knowing that there will be a[[Page H7629]]smug and proud vote against any effort to repeal, even partially repeal ObamaCare?  You make promises like that knowing that, without those promises, you would not get elected. People count on your promises because they really are hurting, they need the medicine that they are not getting under the new Medicaid, they don't have the doctor that was providing so much help under their insurance before ObamaCare took it away. And an almost cheerful breaking of those promises, it really is tragic. It is simply tragic.  It is really unfortunate that they don't have the millions, like some Senators, to get whatever healthcare they want, that they make--they could suffer less, perhaps be cured if Republican Senators all kept their promises.                              {time}  1400  It is just tragic. But despite that, this has been a week where the House has done what we can under reconciliation. We sent a bill to the They didn't have to pass that bill, just something so that we could have a conference bill to give Americans the help they needed.  We have done what we can there, so we are taking up tax reform. And if we do the right thing by Americans, they will have more money in their pockets. If we pass the bill that has just been proposed--I don't have all the details--the framework certainly looks like something we can really work with that will put a lot more money in middle class pockets.  It is interesting. I hear some people, especially at the other end of the hall in the opposite party, opposing party, who make efforts to tax the poor in order to reward Republican rich friends. We saw back in 2008, there were apparently a whole lot more rich people on Wall Street that supported Barack Obama than supported the unfortunate losing candidate of the Republican Party that year.  Yeah, the rich people on Wall Street, more of them supported Barack That kind of goes against what is thought to be conventional wisdom that the Republicans are rich and the Democrats are poor when the reports we have to file annually indicate that some of us came here without anything and we sacrificed virtually everything we had to run, to try to make a difference in this country, and we haven't become rich by being here; whereas, there are an awful lot of millionaire Democrats here in the House and in the  But if you look at what has been proposed, the lowest tax rate in America right now is 10 percent. And it appears, we are told, it should be everybody paying 10 percent right now should end up paying no tax. Well, personally, I would rather see us have everybody pay something in the way of income tax, pay something, the lowest rate possible--whether it is 6, 7, or 8 percent, maybe 7 percent, something--so that every single American pays an income tax so they understand how important it is to have a frugal government and not just constantly be handing out welfare, especially in cases that involve fraud.  I had a lady that was telling me there in Tyler, Texas, that she used to, every spring, work for H&R Block in helping people prepare their tax returns. She said she finally had to give it up. People would come in and they wouldn't have Social Security numbers. They would have tax ID numbers.  Now, why would they have tax ID numbers? Well, even though the law says that you are not supposed to be filing tax returns because you are not supposed to be working if you don't have a Social Security number, the IRS assumed--and we know what that means, they assumed--that, gee, if we give people a tax ID number, then they will pay income tax, and that will bring in more money to the coffers.  But, according to this lady, the reason she couldn't do it anymore was she was becoming a nervous wreck because so many people were coming in with tax identification numbers, not Social Security numbers, and they would have a list of things that they would want her to put in their tax return. And they always had, she said, a number of children listed that they wanted to claim that would ensure that they got more money back from an earned income tax credit than they even paid in.  Since she was a senior citizen on a fixed income, the little extra help that she made helping people prepare tax returns, she gave it up. It was driving her a bit crazy to help people get back more money than they paid in over and over and over again when she understood the law. That is not supposed to be what happened.  So a lot of people say, hey, folks that are illegally in the country--and we are not talking about any particular place, just people illegally here from wherever they are--when they file a tax return and get more back than they paid in, then that is not quite as some represent, oh, gee, they pay so much money in income tax, they are good for the country.  Well, we know an awful lot of hard workers who we have seen--illegal aliens. I hear contractors say: I found out one of my best workers is not here legally.  But it brings us back to the point: Why are such hardworking people especially coming from south of the border into the United States? Well, obviously, for those type of folks--they came in and they are hardworking--they came to get jobs.  But that begs the question: Why are they having to come to the United States to get jobs? They are hardworking. Why wouldn't they find jobs in Mexico or El Salvador or Guatemala? Why wouldn't they find jobs in these other Central American countries or Mexico? The answer is obviously very clear: it is because of all of the corruption.  Even though I understand the President of Mexico recently claimed there were no drug cartel murders going on at the very time when there were an enormous number that happened within the few days of him saying that, we know there is murder, there is corruption, and it is from the drug cartels.  And the gangs and the coyotes that bring people into the United States illegally, they answer to the drug cartels. It is the Border Patrol that told me over and over, every inch of the U.S.-Mexico border is spoken for by some drug cartel; and if you cross into the United States without paying an appropriate price or dues to that drug cartel, then you are not going to last very long because they feel they have to make an example of you.  I saw one estimate of $70 billion or $80 billion, somewhere around there, estimated to have gone from the United States into Mexico, to the drug cartels, for illegal drugs. Well, if we build a wall where it is appropriate and we totally secure our border 100 percent, then that $70 billion, $80 billion that is used for the drug cartels in their corruption of the Mexican cities and federal government and state government, that dries up to nothing. And if we could help dry up the $70 billion to $80 billion to $70,000 or $80,000 for illegal drugs, then, finally, we would help Mexico--as the best neighbor Mexico could ever dream of having--to become one of the very top economies in the world.  They ought to be one of the top 10 economies now, maybe top 5. All the massive natural resources that Mexico has, they are actually in a better location for trade than the United They are between two continents, North and South They are between two oceans like we are, the Pacific and the Atlantic, with, of course, the Gulf of Mexico in between. They ought to be a top 10 economy, but they are not because of corruption from the drug money that illegally crosses the U.border into We cut that off.  And then you have all these hardworking people who just want to help their families. They don't want to have to flee the country they love to find a job. The jobs would be abounding all over Isn't that what a friendly, caring neighbor would do for a neighbor? Shouldn't we want to help Mexico stop the corruption? Of course.  And any Mexican-elected official who says that there is no corruption, that there is no drug cartel influence, or that there is nobody being killed by the drug cartels, well, a statement by a Mexican-elected official that those things are not going on is an indication that that elected official is either completely ignorant of what is going on in his or her country or they are, as one would suspect, under the finger of the drug cartels themselves.  So I am hopeful we are going to be able to get a wall where we need it. President Trump and Attorney General[[Page H7630]]Sessions are both doing everything they can to help secure the border. We need a Secretary of Homeland Security, and I am sure that will be coming quickly. The Democrats will probably try to block whoever it is for as long as they can, but we need a Secretary of Homeland Security; and we need our border secured not merely to help us, but as being the best possible thing we could do as a caring neighbor of  Our Republican Conference we had in the House yesterday seemed very productive. We had a good discussion about the proposed tax reform, and, as I was mentioning earlier, you will have people who have been paying 10 percent will go to paying nothing. Some that are paying much higher taxes will be cut down to 12 percent, and brackets indicating that there is going to be an awful lot more money in the pockets of people who are working, that will be fantastic, because when we leave more money in the pockets of those who have actually earned it, it gets the economy going.  People, whom I have immense respect for, like Arthur Laffer, Stephen Moore, Larry Kudlow, it is very clear to them, when they run the numbers, we could never adequately tax our way out of bankruptcy the direction we are headed. We couldn't. We cannot tax enough. If you put on too much tax, then people quit working.  But the way to make Social Security solvent and to make Medicare solvent is if we get the economy growing not at the 1.8 percent--I believe that was the average for the Obama administration--but for the good of everybody. People keep the money in their pockets. That allows them to spend it, and it causes the economy to grow.  I know, during the Obama administration, they saw 3 percent growth in the economy as just being virtually impossible; and I can understand, because their idea was tax, tax, tax, and that kills an economy. Whereas, if you allow people to have more of their own money, they spend more of their money. That allows more jobs to be created, and there are more people paying taxes. They begin making more, so they are paying higher taxes, even though it is at a lower rate. That helps stimulate the economy.                              {time}  1415  I was really hoping that President Trump's number of 15 percent corporate tax would work out to be our number for corporate tax. I was hoping that would be for regular C corporations, as well as a pass-through subchapter S corporation, because President Trump and I and others know that if it is a 15 percent corporate tax, then we would get back most of the manufacturing jobs, which fled America because of our massive 35 percent tax. Actually, by the time you add in all the others, it is well over 40 to 50 percent tax on corporations.  The reason some of us say the corporate tax is one of the most insidious taxes there is is because the government defrauds Americans into thinking they are not paying the corporate tax. These evil, rich corporations are paying those taxes. They are saying: ``We are not paying them. Make the evil corporations.'' Whereas, anybody that is going to really be honest about it would have to say: ``Well, the truth is, yeah, it is actually a pass-through from the customer, because if the corporation doesn't pass on that massive tax they are paying, they go out of business.''  So it is actually an additional tax on the little guy. So the middle class, lower-income folks are paying the big corporate tax. It is not the wealthy. It is the customers that are paying all that extra corporate tax.  So if you got the tax rate for corporations down to 15 percent, those companies start coming back, the manufacturing jobs come back.  As I mentioned to the President one time: ``Mr.President, you understand it because of your great business acumen, and I understand it from studying history, but any major nation that cannot manufacture what they need in a time of war will not be a major nation after the next war.''  The President wants those jobs back. It is not 15 percent being proposed. It is 20 percent. But that will bring back jobs. Not as many as if we had a 15 percent corporate tax, but it will bring back jobs.  I know there are those who say: Oh, we have evolved in We are more of a service economy. We don't want to be a manufacturing economy with those dirty jobs.  Yes, we do. We need to have those manufacturing jobs. Those are good jobs. We have requirements that you have to be concerned about the health of And by doing that, we bring back the jobs, we help our economy, and we actually save Social Security and  I see my friend, Harris, is here.

597,topic-id,1048,"Mr.President, I come to the floor because I am very disturbed about some actions coming out of EPA affecting biofuels and contrary to what the President promised. In other words, I think people working for the President aren't following the President's direction.  As my colleagues know well, I have championed renewable fuels and other energies for a long period of time. I have worked hard to enact policies to encourage the growth of renewable electricity from sources such as wind and solar. The same is true for biofuels. I have pursued policies to grow our country's production of renewable fuels, such as conventional corn ethanol, biodiesel, and cellulosic ethanol. I support renewable energy because it is good for the economy. It is good for our national security. It is good for our balance of trade. It is good for the rural economies, and it is good for energy independence.  I was pleased that in the most recent Presidential election, then Candidate Trump--now our President--made clear his support for ethanol and the renewable fuels standard. He said clearly: ``We are going to protect the Renewable Fuels Standard.''  On another occasion, Candidate Trump recognized the benefits of the industry when he said this at an ethanol biorefinery:       Amazing what you've been able to do--amazing. And it's      great for the country and[[Page S6158]]     the investment is great. Beyond even the product, the      investment and the jobs and everything else are great for the      country.  Finally, at a summit focusing on renewable fuels in Iowa, as a candidate in January of 2016, Mr.Trump said this:       The RFS, which is Renewable Fuel Standard, is an important      tool in the mission to achieve energy independence to the      United I will do all that is in my power as President      to achieve that goal. . . . As President, I will encourage      Congress to be cautious in attempting to charge and change      any part of the . . . Energy independence is a      requirement of America to become great again.  Candidate Trump continued:       My theme is `Make America Great Again.' It's an important      part of it. The EPA should ensure that biofuel RVOs, or blend      levels, match the statutory level set by Congress under the       These are, in fact, very strong words and went over well with farmers and alternative energy people in my State and throughout the country, and I am glad he said them. After years of delay and uncertainty from the previous administration, Iowans are very grateful to hear such determination and conviction from Candidate Trump, now President  I was somewhat cautious early on when the President named a few members of his Cabinet who were from oil-producing Fearful of Big Oil's opposition to biofuels and then concerned about whether the President would keep his promise, I, along with a number of my Senate colleagues, held a meeting in my office with the nominees for Director of EPA and Secretary of Energy, among others. We expressed to those nominees our support for biofuels and renewable energy and the benefits of strong biofuels policies. One by one, these nominees assured us of their support because they were made well aware of President Trump's support by the President himself. They told us that they knew who was boss, and they knew the President supported the Renewable Fuel  About a month ago, the President called me. I was traveling to Northwest Iowa for my town meetings. He called me. We talked on the cellphone for maybe a couple of minutes. He was somewhat worried--although he didn't say why he was worried--that people might be questioning whether he still supported ethanol and other biofuels. He made very clear to me that he supports renewable fuels and that he will keep his word on the Renewable Fuel He said he wanted me to tell that to the people of  There are a lot of ways you can tell the people of Iowa, but one of the ways I did what he asked is I tweeted it to the 140,000 people who are on my Twitter feed. I have done what he asked me to do.  Here we are today. You can imagine my surprise this very day when I saw that President Trump's EPA has released a proposal out of the blue to reduce the volume requirements for biodiesel for 2018 and 2019 under the Renewable Fuel That is the  This action today has come out of nowhere. The EPA just released a proposal in July to set blending levels for biodiesel. It did not touch the 2018 level, which was already finalized at 2.1 billion gallons. The July proposal would keep the 2019 levels steady at 2.1 billion gallons.  This is what happened today, which I have already referred to. Today's announcement proposes to reduce both levels, contrary to what the President had said that he was supporting. It is outrageous that the EPA would change course and propose a reduction in renewable fuel volumes in this particular way. This seems like a bait and switch from the EPA's prior proposal and from assurances from President Trump himself and from those Cabinet Secretaries who came to my office to assure us of their support for the  Reducing volumes as the EPA proposes would undermine renewable fuel production. That is contrary to the worthwhile goal of America first. It will undermine U.workers and harm the U.economy, particularly in rural It is contrary to the goal of meeting the country's fuel needs through domestic production, which is critical to job creation and economic growth.  This all gives me a strong suspicion that big oil companies and big oil refineries are prevailing once again in this Trump EPA, as they did in the Obama administration, despite assurances to the contrary that I have received from this administration.  You can bet that I plan to press the administration to drop this terrible plan. I hope the officials working for the President will keep the President's word, so I will make sure that EPA hears loud and clear the impact the EPA's proposal will have on Iowa's corn and soybean farmers and the biofuel producers in my State and all the jobs connected with it. That is not a way to make America strong once again.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6157.txt,457,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,26.0,September

1097,topic-id,764,"No, Mr.President, Puerto Rico is not doing well. We don't need to be reminded of the debt. We should remind ourselves of our responsibility to the 3.4 million people of the island nation of Puerto They are suffering greatly. Mr.Speaker, the people of Puerto Rico need our immediate and sustained help.  We all know that flooding, destruction, and complete elimination of the power grid for the whole island are among the consequences of Hurricane Maria, but this is no ordinary hurricane, and it hit at no ordinary time. Mr.Speaker, we need all hands on deck to make sure rescuing Puerto Rico becomes our number one priority.  Immediate needs must be met--fresh water, food, medicine, shelter, and fuel--but we need sustained investment and cooperation with the island's government and its people to make Puerto Rico livable again. Like a lot of Americans, I have watched with increasing horror and panic as the Governor of Puerto Rico, the mayor of San Juan, and ordinary Puerto Ricans have pleaded for more help.  The work of first responders and our military has been heroic, but the island needs more. One-third of the doctors--over 5,000--have left the island of Puerto Rico in the last 10 years. Hospitals have no doctors in some cases. Nurses, fuel, and medicine are running out at the hospitals that remain open. This is a public health crisis and should be declared a health emergency by the Federal  Puerto Rico has been in an economic crisis for years. Five thousand people flee Puerto Rico every month--before two hurricanes hit--leaving behind many old, many young, the very poor, the very sick, and the very vulnerable. There is no food in supermarkets.  We need an airlift. We need an effort the scale of We know the U.is capable. We can invade foreign countries with hundreds of thousands of troops, flawless communications, food, and security. We need the same effort now. We need the Federal Government to go all in to rescue Puerto Rico from a humanitarian crisis which is developing.  Welcome other nations if they want to help, Mr.President, like Cuba, that has offered doctors and other emergency assistance. But what I fear is[[Page H7492]]that the Federal Government is not stepping up as fully and as quickly as we must.  I remember, in this body, when the legislation to take over the Puerto Rican government and put in place a junta or control board was working its way through Congress--the PROMESA bill. What was the main selling point for the bill? Vote for PROMESA because it will not cost us a penny. So that is where this Congress and the Federal Government start from: not wanting to spend what needs to be spent or do what needs to be done.  We need to waive cost sharing that could charge--would charge--Puerto Rico for a percentage of the relief and rescue help they are receiving today. Puerto Rico is broke, and they cannot borrow because the government--our Federal Government--has said it cannot. This Congress has said it cannot. So they can't set their own budget and spending priorities, which have all been taken away from them.  So the U.Government should start by waiving those cost-sharing requirements and suspend the Jones Act permanently or for a substantial period--at least a decade--to help in the recovery. Since it was imposed on Puerto Rico, the Jones Act has cost the Puerto Rican consumers more than all the money owed to Wall Street and the debt, yet the President reminds us of the debt.  Let the ships flow as quickly and as cheaply from wherever they may come because this is an emergency. Let's be clear: with or without hurricanes, the electrical grid, the roads, ports, public safety, and public health system are close to collapsing. So this emergency can not just be treated by Congress, the President, FEMA, and other agencies as just another storm.  Mr.Speaker, I have asked the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader to form a delegation and send Members to Puerto Rico so they can see for themselves how dire things are. I am leaving on Friday to go there, and I am hoping other Members will join me. I have family who needs help, so I am headed there to do what I can do. But, most importantly, I am committed to shining a spotlight on the people of Puerto Rico so that they are neither out of sight nor out of our minds. We need to make them the priority in this moment of great need and in this moment of national disaster.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7491-2.txt,478,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,26.0,September
1064,topic-id,3548,"Mr.Speaker, the gentleman from Texas is absolutely right. An important thing happened this week. We announced that the American public is going to get a tax cut.  As I go around my district, as I am sure Members when they go around their districts, one thing they rarely hear is: You know, Washington spends their money very efficiently. They do everything just right. So why don't you tax me a little bit more?  We don't hear that.  What we hear is that hardworking Americans want to keep more of their paycheck. They look at what the Federal Government takes out of their paycheck. They don't think they are getting their money's worth. Honestly, Mr.Speaker, once you are around here a while, you realize they are probably not getting their money's worth.  So what we are going to do is we are going to follow the President's lead. The President has said that what he wants is a tax reform bill that cuts taxes in America so that businesses come back to America, that our job creators get tax relief, and that hardworking middle class American families can keep more of their paychecks. And that is exactly what the tax reform outline has laid out for the American public this week.  Now, from the naysayers, you will hear the same old lines: tax cuts for the rich, blah, blah, blah.  The bottom line is that we are going to relieve the tax burden on American businesses that will bring jobs back to this country.  Mr.Speaker, if you look over the past 35 years of what has happened, from 1980 to 2015, the corporate tax rates, back in 1980, the top line of this graph is the U.tax rate, marginal corporate tax rate, which was around 50 percent at the time. It was just about the same as what the worldwide average was.  In the 1980s, the last time we had major tax reform under the leadership of President Reagan, we dropped the corporate tax rate to under 40 percent, and at that time, it was right in the middle of where the corporate taxes were worldwide. So the companies had no advantage to take their businesses and move it overseas in order to save taxes.  But something very interested happened. If you look at the top line here, since then, our corporate tax rate has stayed at right about 40 percent. It is now 39.6 when you add in both the Federal taxes and the State corporate taxes, but the worldwide averages have fallen.  Mr.Speaker, other countries around the world have figured out that businesses will go to countries and they will create jobs in those areas where the taxes are lower.  So what has happened?  So if you look at what the corporate taxes look like now and what the corporate tax rates are around the world, these are the 35 leading nations, our competitors in the world. The United States now has the highest corporate tax rate at 38.9 percent combined. Again, the Federal plus the State tax rate. France and Belgium, 34 percent. Germany, 30 percent.  But if you look at where we are losing our business to, it turns out that very small countries like Ireland, way down at the bottom, years ago lowered their corporate tax rate to 12\1/2\ percent.  And what happened?  We moved businesses to  When I worked in the operating room--and still do a few days a year--I would pick up what is called an endotracheal tube. It is a tube we use when[[Page H7631]]we breathe for a patient. It goes into their windpipe and they breathe through it. I would pick it up--and this happened 15 years ago--look at it and say: ``Wait a minute. This is made in How in the world are medical items like this made in Ireland?'' And I would look at other items in the operating room, and they were made in  I didn't know at the time that the reason was that Ireland lowered its corporate tax rate, and literally many things that used to be made in the United States, like those endotracheal tubes, like other medical devices, were now made in Ireland; not by Americans, but by people in We lost those jobs over there, and it was as a result of our corporate tax rate.  So our other competitors, you know, we look at car manufacturers, Korea, 24 percent corporate tax rate. Again, ours is at 38.9 percent. We look at other places around the world. The United Kingdom, Britain, one of our largest trading partners and one that certainly competes with us for businesses, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry or whether it is other businesses, they are at 19 percent. We are at 38.9 percent.  So what does this tax plan do?  This tax plan says that for those corporations that are moving businesses around the world based on a tax rate, we can't have the highest tax rate in the world, because what we have seen is the emptying of American manufacturing to places around the world where the tax rate is lower.  Mr.Speaker, I would offer that if you or I invented something today and we looked to manufacture it somewhere, where would we go? Would we stay in the United States with a 38.9 percent combined corporate tax rate? Or would we go to Ireland, where it is 12\1/2\ percent, where, for every item we make, our company can make more money, invest that back in the company and take profits from it?  Of course we would go to  So what do we have to do?  We have to address that. The President has said this is one of his top priorities, because this will bring back the jobs that have bled from the United  When we looked at what is called a corporate inversion, where a company looks to buy an American company, move its headquarters overseas, it is doing it for tax purposes.  Why should that happen? Why shouldn't we be attracting these companies to the United States? How do we do it?  We do it by lowering the corporate tax rate. The plan, the outline that we have put forward to the American people this week lowers the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Again, from 35 percent, which is the Federal rate, to 20 percent. It lowers it to the lowest among our competitive countries. Now, not as low as I would like to see it go, not as low as the President would like to see it go. The President thinks we need to be way down at the bottom of that chart. That is how we need to attract businesses back.  Mr.Speaker, to be honest, if we lower the tax rate just to be competitive, we are not competitive anymore. Companies will bring their business back to the United States for the reasons that a lot of businesses originally were in the United States: we have a highly trained workforce, we have the rule of law, we have a lot of benefits for businesses to do business here.  Now, if Congress agrees, if we can come up with this reform plan, we are going to be seeing businesses fighting each other to come back into the United States because they realize this is the place they can do business best.  Mr.Speaker, only a minority of jobs are actually produced by those large corporations, what we call C corporations, the ones that paid the ``corporate income tax.''  So the President said he also wanted to emphasize that what we need to do is lower the tax rate on our small businesses because, as you know, almost two-thirds of the jobs created in this country are created by small businesses.  So the Unified Tax Reform Framework, our tax plan, limits the maximum tax rate for small and family-owned businesses to 25 percent. Mr.Speaker, today that tax rate is 39.6 percent. Again, this will allow these small businesses and our family-owned businesses to take the money, invest it; and then when their businesses make money, when they hire workers and they make money, they are allowed to keep more to put back in those businesses, to hire more workers. This is how we get our economy going again.  If you talk to, again, these small businesses and these family-owned businesses, or the larger businesses, there are two things that these businesses say they need in order to succeed. One is they need a regulatory environment that is reasonable.  Mr.Speaker, the last administration was strangling American businesses through overregulation. So the first thing the President did when he came into office, to his credit, is say: We have to have only reasonable regulations. We can't overregulate our businesses. We are stifling them.  Mr.Speaker, it is amazing that over the past 100 years, the average growth in what we call the GDP--the gross domestic product--in the United States, the average growth in GDP is 3.3 percent over 100 years.  Now, over the last administration, of course, you know it has the dubious honor of being the first administration where there was never a year of 3 percent growth. In fact, the average growth was under 2 percent. The mood was so bad in American business and the American business climate that the economists who would predict how the economy was going to operate have actually lowered their expectations of GDP growth to under 2 percent per year for the near future. That is not the America we know.  The America we know leads the world. When we see 6, 7, and 8 percent growth in China, why would we be satisfied with under 2 percent growth?  There is no need to be satisfied with that.  So we have to go to, again, our small businesses and our other businesses and ask them: What do you need to grow and produce jobs, to bring jobs back to this country, to put Americans back to work?  And the answer is: One, relieve us of the regulatory burden.  And from day one, that is what the President has done.                              {time}  1430  But there is another thing they say. We need relief from our tax rate. Again, the tax rate was the highest in the industrialized world. Our tax rate, the highest in the industrialized world. Our tax rate on small businesses was even higher. 39.6 percent was the highest marginal rate. That is not an environment where businesses thrive.  The President is taking care, to a large extent, of relieving the regulatory burden, the over-regulatory burden, that exists for American businesses.  Now Congress needs to turn its attention to the second leg on that stool, which is the tax problems. So the reform framework does that, and it does it exactly the right way. It says we agree with the  Americans are waiting for these jobs to come back. They don't want to see the back end of the moving van leaving American companies and bringing them overseas anymore. They don't like that. I can't blame them. There is no reason why more things can't be made here, more businesses can't thrive here.  So we need to take those steps, but that is only one part of this plan. The President said the other thing we need to do is return more dollars into the pockets of hardworking middle class taxpayers. That is exactly what this plan does. It does it by simplifying the Tax Code, by doubling the standard deduction and lowering all the rates.  The naysayers will say: Well, you know, if you lower the rates, you are going to increase our debt and our deficit. In fact, if you turn on the TV right now, that is what all the talking heads are complaining about. How could those Republicans suggest a plan that will increase our deficit?  Well, Mr.Speaker, if you ask some people over at the Congressional Budget Office what happens to revenues if you increase the tax rate to 200 percent of income, they will say: Oh, it goes up 200 percent.  Well, that is ridiculous. At some point, overtaxation suppresses economic activity, and revenues go down.  Conversely, both with the tax cuts under President Kennedy in the 1960s[[Page H7632]]and the tax cuts with President Reagan in the 1980s, what we saw when we lowered rates was, in fact, the rejuvenation of the American economy, a stimulation of our GDP, a stimulation of our economy, leading to, in fact, increased revenue in both of those instances.  But in both of those instances, the naysayers said: You can't do this. If you are going to cut your taxes, your deficits will go up. That just plain doesn't happen.  So, yes, if you assume, all else being equal, that if we lower tax rates that revenue will go down, that would be true. But we know what happens when the American people feel the economy is going well, when they are fully employed, when we bring good-paying jobs back to this country and we lower the tax burden directly on hardworking middle class We know what happens. The economy grows.  With more money in their pockets, people make the decision to buy a car, to buy a house, to buy the new washing machine, to spend money on things that they have been afraid to spend money on because of the stagnant economy over the past 8 years.  We will unleash growth like we haven't seen since the 1980s, when, in response to the Reagan tax cuts, we had GDP growth not of 3 percent, not of 4 percent, but of 5 and 6 percent after that tax cut. So, in fact, tax cuts stimulate the economy, which lifts all boats, and it increases revenues.  So, Mr.Speaker, we have to tackle this challenge.  Now, we know there are a lot of special interests there because, when you simplify the Tax Code, what happens? All the lobbyists come knocking on our doors, and they want to maintain their little piece of this Tax  And the Tax Code runs to thousands and thousands of pages. Very knowledgeable people can't even fill out their tax returns anymore, they are so complicated. Or they are worried they filled it out wrong.  Or, Mr.Speaker, the best thing--or the worst thing--the funniest thing that I hear is that, if you have a tax question and you can't figure out exactly how to do it and you call the IRS, if you call two or three times, you are likely to get two or three different answers about how to fill out that form and how much tax you have to pay.  Well, when you get to that situation, you have gone way too far, and, Mr.Speaker, that is where we are. We are at that situation that a reasonable American can't even fill out their own taxes it has become so complicated.  So, as part of this framework, if we can simplify it the way this framework says, 90 percent of Americans will literally be able to fill out their taxes on something the size of a postcard. That is what we need to get back to, that kind of simplification.  But again, the road won't be easy because we will have all the special interests here in this town, and we know there are a lot of them. We will have all of those special interests knocking on our doors, saying: Please preserve our little carve-out.  But every little carve-out makes the Tax Code more complicated. Every complication means that hardworking Americans don't get to keep as much in their pockets, and that is what we have to solve. We have to solve this problem. It has been getting worse now.  Again, the last time we dealt with the Tax Code in a comprehensive way was 30 years ago. To its credit, at the time, we reduced rates, we stimulated the economy, but we really didn't simplify the Tax Code as much as we would like to at this point.  So it is going to be hard, it is going to take months, and it is going to take a lot of people looking past the naysayers, past the people who say this can't be done, past the people who say the sky is falling, because we have heard this all before.  I am old enough to have heard it in the 1980s. That is when I started working. That is when I started bringing home a paycheck. That is the time when I started realizing what Federal taxation was.  I always tell the story of my oldest daughter, who trained to become a nurse, and she went and got hired. The first time she brought her paycheck--a real paycheck, a full-time job paycheck from the hospital--home, she said: Dad, what is going on here? I thought I was making this amount of money, and this is the amount I bring home.  We all know what happened. You saw all those lines: The Federal tax taken out; the State tax taken out; the local tax taken out; the Social Security tax taken out; the You saw all the taxes that were taken out.  So what we have to do is we have to simplify the Code, bring those tax rates down, put more of that money in the pockets of hardworking middle class We owe them that. Part of that is simplifying that Tax Now, once we do this and we stimulate the economy, we get the economy going again, our deficits will come down.  Look, we have to control spending. There is no question about it. Spending in this town is out of control. There is no question about it. Our deficit will exceed $700 billion a year.  To put that in perspective, that is 20 times the size of my State's entire budget, and that is the amount that we are going to borrow this year.  When people say that we need money for this and we need money for that, every time we ask that question, you know, can we afford it, we have to ask: Can we afford passing this debt on to future generations?  I have five children, now, six grandchildren. My children will never pay off this debt. Those listening at home, if they don't believe me, go and look at the Federal Budget website and look at the projection of Federal debt. It never goes to zero. It never, ever goes to zero--ever--not in my children's lives, not in my grandchildren's lives, not in my great-grandchildren's lives. That is just not the way we ought to run a government.  So once we tackle this tax reform, once we get our economy booming again with businesses vying to come into this country--not to go to some other country, but to come into America to do business--then we have to turn our attention to securing the future for future generations, to making certain that our Social Security system, which our seniors depend on, will not only be here for the seniors now, but for when my children and grandchildren reach their old age; that the Medicare system, which is scheduled now to be bankrupt in 10 years, that the Medicare system that our seniors depend on will not be there just for my generation, not just for my children's generation, but for my grandchildren.  We have to make sure that this country remains the strongest, most powerful country on Earth, a force for good and freedom throughout the world. We have to restore our defense budget. This President, to his credit, has called for that.  But as we restore our defense budget, we do have to redefine our spending priorities, because we don't--or, I guess, maybe we do, print money here, but it is not the right thing to do. We shouldn't be borrowing from future generations to take care of these priorities.  We have to get our economy going, make sure our revenues increase, and then turn our attention to making sure those revenues are spent wisely and that we define the future for our children and grandchildren, a future that they can be proud of in a country that remains, as Majority Whip Scalise said on this floor today, standing at this podium, a country that the world can look toward for leadership, the country that, for now over a century, the world has looked toward for leadership to be the beacon of freedom, to be what President Reagan called the ``shining city on the hill.'' Mr.Speaker, we do that by restoring the health of our economy.  We took a big step toward that this week with our tax reform framework. We are setting the country up for an economic rejuvenation, for a restoration, for those companies that have gone overseas to come back home. Let our great American workers make their products. Come back home to the greatest country this world has ever known.  Mr.Speaker, that was a big step, but it is only the first step. We have weeks and months of work to get that done, a big job, an important job, but the first step was taken this week.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgH7630.txt,2026,"ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2017",2017.0,28.0,September
1037,topic-id,767,"Mr.President, I, too, rise today to oppose the renomination of Ajit Pai to serve as Chairman of the Federal Communications I will start my remarks by acknowledging my friend, the Senator from Hawaii, and echoing his sentiments about the respect I have for Chairman Pai's ability, his skill, his intelligence, his dedication, and commitment, but I, too, as a member of the Commerce Committee, have sat through testimony from Mr.Pai and watched a number of things unfold with regard to policy that is critically important to people of New Hampshire and our country. I find that I, too, am in a position of being unable to support this nomination.  The FCC plays a critical role in overseeing our communications networks, protecting consumers, and ensuring that our Nation's businesses can compete on a level playing field. Unfortunately, throughout his tenure at the FCC, and particularly during his time as Chairman, Mr.Pai has not demonstrated a commitment to those goals. To start, I have real concerns with the Chairman's actions to undermine net neutrality and the impact that would have on people in New Hampshire and throughout our country.  A free and open internet is essential to consumers, essential to entrepreneurs and innovative small businesses that are the foundation of our economic success. Net neutrality is the concept that internet service providers should provide equal access to applications and content online, and they should not be able to discriminate against content and content providers by making certain web pages, applications, or videos load faster or slower than others. Put simply, net neutrality ensures that even the smallest voices and businesses can be heard and can thrive. People and businesses in New Hampshire know this. Granite Staters have called and written to my office in support of net neutrality, and the FCC has received a recordbreaking number of public comments, reaching tens of millions, from people looking to make their voices heard on this topic.  Chairman Pai is not addressing the concerns of Americans who are speaking out. Instead, he is listening to big cable companies and internet service providers and taking direct aim at net neutrality protections. That is unacceptable. Protecting net neutrality is essential, but with Chairman Pai at the FCC, these critical rules are in danger.  I also oppose this nomination because Chairman Pai is putting rural broadband advancements at stake. Recently, Chairman Pai and the FCC released a notice of inquiry that raises questions about its goals, suggesting it will consider mobile broadband as an adequate replacement for fixed broadband, which would allow speeds that are two-thirds slower. For many parts of New Hampshire, mobile is not dependable enough or fast enough to meet our economy's needs, promote innovation, and connect young students with their homework. We must address the challenges that rural communities face in getting access to broadband. But by focusing instead on mobile broadband, the Chairman would have us leave rural America without a reliable connection.  Finally, I have concerns about Chairman Pai's ability to adequately evaluate the pending Sinclair-Tribune merger that sits before the For decades, our Nation has maintained a policy that limits the number of broadcast stations that one company can own nationwide. This policy has protected Americans by allowing them to receive robust and fair news content about their communities and has provided a diversity of voices in the broadcast news media marketplace.[[Page S6215]]  This merger would result in Sinclair's ability to reach over 70 percent of Americans across our country, far exceeding the Commission's ownership caps and threatening the diversity in broadcast news that Americans deserve and expect.  Since Chairman Pai took the lead of the FCC, the Commission has worked to loosen regulations regarding media ownership, and, in turn, Sinclair benefited. As this proposed merger is still under consideration, we need someone at the helm of the FCC who will thoroughly vet the implications and ensure that it is in the public interest. There is too much at stake with this merger, and Chairman Pai's actions raise doubts that he can evaluate it impartially.  We need an FCC that is focused on putting consumers first and ensuring that all Americans have the opportunity to thrive in the 21st century economy. There are simply too many concerns about Chairman Pai's record, his ability to express impartiality on key decisions, and his goals for Federal Communications Commission priorities. I will vote against Chairman Pai's renomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

204,topic-id,2438,"Mr.President, I rise today to return to the topic of antitrust. When I last spoke on this matter, the debate was already simmering, albeit mostly on the left. In the time since, controversy in both our markets and our politics has kept it at the fore.  Handled prudently, that can be a good thing. I say we have this discussion. I think it is important. Heavens, I will even try to do my part to make it a little more fun. But I do have my concerns that the topic of antitrust policy is still more enthusiastically invoked than deliberately considered.  I am concerned that it is still undermined by the same old easy retreats to the right and to the left. That may be typical of issues here in Washington, but on no issue can we afford it less. You see, especially in antitrust policy, it is critical that the center hold. It is critical that we secure that delicate middle ground--hard won over the years and easily lost in a moment of fervor--whereon economic liberty thrives.  I have come to the floor, once again, to speak and, to the growing discussion, to contribute.  Permit me to say a few words about holding the center. When I took to this floor last month, I argued that on the fundamental question of economic management, America has courageously defied the historical norm. Rather than acquiescing to the central planning, we fully embraced free enterprise. Thus, ours is a market economy and the most prosperous one of our times.  Markets are messy. They are chaotic and, from the individual perspective, impossibly complex. Perhaps, most counterintuitively, they are, in a sense, disorganized.  For all their productivity, for all the wonders they work, there is no single actor or entity in control. The miracle arises all on its own, through an order[[Page S5876]]spontaneously coordinated by price and balanced by the efforts of millions. Little surprise then that in America's free enterprise tradition, no less than in its larger political tradition, we deeply distrust concentrated power. We distrust the intervention of the State, to be sure.  Our system is largely defined by limited government but so, too, do we cast a wary eye upon powerful private entities. We have little tolerance for the monopolist which secures its market position anticompetitively, and we offer no quarter to the naked cartel. In other words, we no sooner trust concentrated private power than concentrated public power to dictate the direction of our economy.  That, right there, is why we turn to antitrust. That is the middle ground--between intrusive public management and corrosive private conduct, which antitrust is charged with seizing and protecting, for we know our markets will never fulfill their promise unless they remain free and competitive, and we know they will not long remain free or competitive without a sound competition policy holding that center ground.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, events of late seem determined to keep antitrust at the forefront of the public debate. We are witnessing innovation and disruption at a dizzying pace. Markets are concentrating, powerful players are staking out valuable ground, and accusations of anticompetitive behavior--some bona fide and many not--are mounting. Across the board, an anxiety seems to be settling in.  Therefore, I want to be very clear, especially to my friends on the left: I see it. I understand it. That the challenges here are real, there can be no real doubt. That an update in the doctrine may well be necessary, there should be no dispute. Where, perhaps, I differ is that I don't quite see the need for the panic. I think American antitrust is up to this challenge.  The story of capitalism has always been a story of change, and if we are doing things right, that change does not come according to anyone's plan or script. Just when society grows comfortable in habits of law and commerce--just as each part of the economy learns to play its part--the ground again shifts beneath our feet. It can be a bit disorienting but not to worry. That is where our old, trusted friend, the consumer welfare standard, comes back in.  As I emphasized in my last address on the floor and as I will continue to emphasize here, it is a proven way of directing us aright. As new innovation fundamentally alters the landscape, as entrepreneurs press beyond current frontiers and into the unknown, the consumer welfare standard is like a compass with a bearing set toward that critical middle ground which antitrust is charged with protecting. True north is not what is best for market competitors, not what is most convenient for market regulators, but what most furthers market competition itself, the better to ward off the dangers of collectivism, the surer to escape the stagnation of monopoly.  Now, I know--I understand--that this hardly settles things. Identifying the principle by which we orient ourselves is the start of the discussion, not the conclusion. The consumer welfare standard is, like I have said, a compass; it is not a map. It guides our journey without fixing a precise course through the changing terrain. Adjustments are to be expected. After all, much of antitrust doctrine, as it is received today, was built upon the familiar economic process of resource extraction, manufacture, distribution, and retail.  That the digital age would present commercial arrangements to defy those traditional classifications is not, altogether, surprising. Fortunately, antitrust is a common law exercise and leaves plenty of room for improvement. Our conventional categories of anticompetitive conduct can be tweaked, refashioned, or even expanded in light of technological advancement and market evolution. That process will become all the easier as our tools for taking the measure of the land improve.  Current analysis does well in taking account of price. It may do better still in taking account of quality. Reams of data never before thought obtainable and new econometric methods only recently deemed practical entice us with a chance to plot curves, which until recently were confined to the theoretical. Our basic and time-honored foundational models are increasingly nudged and bounded by contributions from the behavioral sciences, and game theory is continuously opening new horizons in market analysis.  I am happy to have that discussion. Again, we keep our markets fresh by keeping our doctrine current, but I would--as an old Republican must--urge caution, especially to some of the more zealous advocates for reform, hipster or otherwise. I will gladly sample the avocado toast--I really will--but nobody should get the idea that we have moved on from the meat and potatoes. It is easy, with the benefit of hindsight, to critique past precedent formed in the familiar image of the mass industrial process. It is far more difficult to refashion doctrine for a new age that is still evolving in surprising ways.  As we trek into the unknown, let's take note of where we have been and appreciate the hazards of the route. Let's recall that whatever the changes at the surface of the market, basic economic principles persist through the ages. Network effects in our digital infrastructure may feel very new today, but as I emphasized in my last address, the concept is actually very old. It structured the telephone market long before we could even conceive of an online search market. Let's recall also that the foresight of regulators and thus the wisdom of their regulation is inevitably limited.  We talk a lot about platform economics today and worry about the bottlenecks of digital traffic as if the future has finally and permanently arrived, but with the rate of innovation these days, there is no telling whether the essential facilities of today will prove all that essential tomorrow. We can do little more than guess at what form exclusive dealing or foreclosure may take in markets yet unseen. Let's recall that markets often correct themselves. As more than a few formally invincible corporate titans can attest, free enterprise offers few opportunities for eternal life, and when regulators do step in, doctrine still tends to lag behind the market. Thus, the powers we grant government now will likely survive into a future that is not yet defined.  Finally, before we rush to grant enforcement officials a broad mandate with an ill-defined objective to do something, let's recall that regulation can hurt as much as it can help. As we have seen in some attempts at rate regulation, a regime meant to restrain the biggest players may very well, with the passage of time, become the preferred tool for excluding new entrants. Merger analysis sometimes does more for rivals than for consumers, and as we have learned in nearly every form of intervention, a medicine which creates too much unpredictability and upsets too many investment-backed expectations may well prove worse than the disease itself.  In the end, like I said, I think we are up to this challenge. With compassion in hand, an open mind, and appreciation for what our journey thus far has taught, antitrust will continue the work of securing that middle ground whereon markets thrive. When all is said and done--after all of the controversy and high emotion have subsided--we may just find that all we needed was a small course adjustment. Perhaps this needn't be a reckoning when just a little reform will do. We can set about correcting market failures and readjusting system incentives without going after some industry or bringing this or that firm to heel.  When I first sounded the alarm on Microsoft--years ago really--it was not merely because it was deemed too powerful or because a new class of high-tech barons risked undermining democratic norms; it was because of well-founded concerns of concrete, competitive harm to developing markets.  The question in antitrust was not then--and we must not allow it to become today--whether any of our companies are too big or too profitable or too dominant; the question is whether they engage in identifiable anticompetitive conduct or if a merger is likely to facilitate it.  The question is whether it can be shown, as far as the imperfect tools of economics allow and an evolving doctrine can bear, that the conduct at issue or the merger proposed does more to fortify the firm than serve the consumers of America.[[Page S5877]]  Of course, that kind of analysis may not make headlines, and it may not satisfy our deep-seated yearning to identify heroes and villains, but it is the best way to handle antitrust. If we are going to get this right, we are going to need to keep cool heads.  Antitrust already asked some of the hardest questions, like why we allow the market to put scarce resources to their highest uses when our social and political valuations do not match that of prevailing prices. Antitrust already forces some of the hardest choices, like how to trade the losses of some industries and some actors for the gains of the economy as a whole.  There is no need to make things harder still by turning antitrust into a political cudgel, as the left is wont to do, or by dismissing it as yet another example of government overreach, as the right is often guilty.  So let us let all of us on all sides tone down the political rhetoric. Should this debate do no more than feed our appetite for political gamesmanship, antitrust will not be the better for having it. Do you know what? I do not think I am alone here. My colleagues in the Senate seem to be rising to the occasion. My friends on the other side of the aisle introduced legislation that, however flawed in my view, reflects the seriousness with which they take these issues.  I am happy to see there is finally movement again on the nomination of Makan He is an exceptional antitrust attorney and just the person we are going to need as we sort this thing all out. I will not shy from discussing his qualifications here, and I would not fault my colleagues for using his nomination as an opportunity for a wider discussion on antitrust, but now it is time to put him to work. I am pleased to see we are almost there.  At the same time, this debate is not going to be confined to the floor of the At the agencies, in the courtroom, from the lecture hall to the opinion pages, there are going to be a lot of voices weighing in. Most, we can hope, will be helpful. All, we can resolve, will be heard, I hope.  I want to applaud those on the left for jumping into this debate, and I wish the best of luck to the new Open Markets I had a little fun with the hipsters the last time around, and they took it in good stride. I am now told some prefer the title New Brandeis I think that is fitting. Justice Brandeis was a bit of a hipster in his time. I should know, as I was basically a contemporary of his.  Further, I acknowledge the efforts of private litigants and policy advocates pressing their cases in courts here and in They have been working tirelessly to make a data-driven case that speaks directly to consumer harm. They play an important role, and the doctrine is better for their efforts, however their cases turn out.  Finally, I want to implore my fellow conservatives, continue joining in on this debate, keep investing in antitrust, embrace it as an area of the law in which we speak to the power of the markets by speaking to the importance of sound regulation. Make the case that, like property or contract or commercial law, antitrust is that rare species of government regulation which opens doors rather than slamming them shut.  As I have been arguing for decades now, should our doctrine grow stagnant, markets may well concentrate beyond what is politically acceptable, calls for excessive government intervention will only increase, and the yoke of the regulator could soon be our portion.  With that, Mr.President, I will close right where I began. As this debate proceeds, it falls to all of us to do our part in getting this right. The challenges presented by our evolving markets are real, but we are not the first to break new ground, and will we be the last to worry that the new ground broken sits far removed from the competition's precious center? One way or another, we have made it before. I trust we can make it again.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

I commend the President for having picked him.[[Page S6179]]  All of us, Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, are going to make sure that our markets remain free and competitive. Cheap talking points are not going to cut it; only serious debate will.

754,topic-id,933,"Mr.President, after the rushed and secretive effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed earlier this year, I had hoped that we could finally turn the corner and move forward in a bipartisan fashion to find some real solutions to our Nation's remaining healthcare challenges.  I still believe that most of us here in the Senate--including Senators Alexander and Murray in the HELP Committee--are willing to work across party lines to find consensus on pragmatic improvements. That is why I was so appalled that President Trump and Republican leadership are reviving a last-ditch effort to pass a disastrous bill that would upend our healthcare system and take away insurance coverage from millions of  Worse yet and even harder to believe, the bill that Republican leadership is rushing to the floor for a vote this week potentially is actually worse than any previous versions of this legislation. The so-called Graham-Cassidy bill they are hoping to vote on would mean higher premiums for worse coverage and millions of Americans losing their health insurance. It will permanently gut Let me say that again. It will permanently gut And despite promises to the contrary that Republicans have long made, it would end key protections for people with preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. In short, it would throw our entire[[Page S6112]]healthcare system into chaos. That is just awful policy any way you look at it.  How did we get here? For over 7 years, Republicans in Washington have cheered shortcomings in our healthcare system and blamed the Affordable Care Act for every single problem, under the premise that they would do better if we only put them in charge. The trouble has been that their opposition to the ACA has been more rooted in bumper sticker politics than it ever was about actual policy or plans to do better for the American people. The long-lasting effort on display throughout this year in the Senate is only further evidence that President Trump and Republicans in Congress don't have any real solutions to improve our Nation's healthcare system.  After months of negotiations behind closed doors, when Senate Republicans released their secret TrumpCare bill in July, its contents proved too harmful for passage, even in their own caucus. Now they are hoping for one more last-ditch vote before the end of September to pass something, anything to follow through on their reckless mission.  One consequence of this legislation that is so important to my home State of New Mexico is that if we pass this bill, it will spell the end to any progress we have made in fighting our Nation's opioid and heroin epidemic. It is nothing short of hypocrisy for President Trump to say they are taking this major public health crisis seriously when they are supporting this bill.  Ironically, the bill before us actually does less to combat opioids than the bill that was too draconian and damaging to pass last time. It is not just the behavioral health system and opioid treatment that will be upended if we dismantle the Medicaid Program; Medicaid pays for seniors in nursing homes, for school nurses who care for our kids, and for Americans with disabilities, and Medicaid has been a financial lifeline for hospitals and health clinics in rural communities across this I know this because I have heard it directly from our rural health providers in New If we pass these drastic cuts to Medicaid, some of our rural health providers in New Mexico may very well have to close up shop.  This is not some partisan assessment; this is what will happen according to many experts and people in the healthcare field who have nothing political at stake in this debate. The Medicaid directors for all 50 States and the Republican and Democratic Governors alike have come out against this bill.  Look, I am not outraged about all of this because I am a Democrat or because of what I think of President Donald Trump; I am outraged about this bill because of what it will do to New Mexico families and to the communities I represent.  If we can halt this mad rush, we could all--Democrats and Republicans--get to work on the problems with healthcare that we all agree need attention. There is work to be done, no doubt about it. There is still time to do what is right for the American families who elected us to work together and make their lives better. The Graham-Cassidy bill simply does not do that. There is still time to change course--to go through regular order, to hold hearings--plural--and to build a consensus on fixes and improvements to the healthcare system. As Senator McCain told us all earlier this year, ``We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.'' Well said.  There is a better way forward. I am confident that most of us would welcome a bipartisan, regular order approach. We need to remember that there are real people's lives that hang in the balance in this debate. I have heard so many New Mexicans talk about what health coverage means to them and their families. I don't know about you, but that is whose interests I am looking out for.  Real, bipartisan solutions to the challenges in our healthcare system are within reach if President Trump and the Republican leadership would just be willing to let us work together to find them.

Being nominated to a seat on the U.circuit court of appeals is an honor and a privilege, virtually unmatched in the legal profession.  After reviewing Judge Erickson's record and talking to his colleagues and the people who have worked with[[Page S6197]]him and appeared before him back in North Dakota, I am very proud to come to the floor this morning and offer my strong support for his nomination to the Eighth When Judge Erickson was nominated and confirmed to his current seat on the U.District Court for North Dakota, it was with the support of our two great former Senators and my good friends, Byron Dorgan and Kent Judge Erickson has certainly upheld their faith and trust in his abilities as a district court judge, and I am confident he will uphold my faith and my trust in his ability as he moves to the Eighth  Judge Erickson has a long history of commitment to the legal profession and the State of North Dakota, first through his service on the State court and, since 2003, as a judge on the U.District Court for the District of North Very few lawyers can make such a long-term commitment to public service, and his record certainly reflects his belief that when a lawyer is called to serve for the greater good, they should answer that call. I hope Judge Erickson is able to instill this sense of commitment to public service in aspiring young lawyers whom he will come to meet and whom he will be able to influence through his example.  A nominee for the North Dakota seat on the Eighth Circuit must have experience in working with Indian Country, given the number of Tribes and the Indian land that are contained within the jurisdiction of the Eighth During his career and at his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Erickson has shown an in-depth understanding of Tribal sovereignty issues and a recognition of the challenges and disparities in the treatment of Native Americans under the law when they are arrested and charged for crimes in Indian  Judge Erickson has been an advocate for equal treatment of Native Americans under the law. He also serves as the chair of the U.Sentencing Commission's Tribal Issues Advisory I have no doubt that Judge Erickson will bring this knowledge and understanding of Tribal issues, sovereignty, and treaties with him to the Eighth  The best judges always have been people who can truly understand and bring to the bench a sense of empathy. Judge Erickson has used some of his own struggles and challenges during the course of his life to inform his own views and to give counsel to those who come before him as he uses his own personal struggles as an example. It takes a really big person to recognize and learn from their failings and to use them to help others. I admire him greatly for that.  During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge Erickson showed an openness and frankness in responding to questions and discussing his past struggles. That was refreshing, illuminating, and honestly all too rare here. I believe he impressed my colleagues on that committee greatly with his willingness to be so forthcoming and so honest. That is why they unanimously reported his nomination out of the committee.  It is a tremendous honor to be on the floor of the U.Senate before Judge Erickson's confirmation vote. I am here today to give my highest recommendation in support of his nomination to the U.Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth I, again, urge all of my colleagues' thoughtful consideration and evaluation and favorable endorsement of his confirmation.

761,topic-id,2313,"Thank you, Mr. To my great colleague and one of the nicest people here, Senator Udall, who always leads with his brain, we know that his heart isn't far behind, and he has been a tremendous leader, a tremendous advocate, and a tremendous collaborator on this all-important issue.  I think first that we have to acknowledge how grateful and thankful we are that the Republican bill, known as Graham-Cassidy, will not be advanced this week. I don't think it is the last that we have heard of it, but it is critically important that now we have time to talk about the impacts and we have time to talk about why it is that we found this bill so objectionable, and we have an opportunity to raise the issues that may have been forgotten. I think one of those issues is the unique challenges that Native American people have in receiving and affording quality healthcare in  All of the Tribes in my State have a treaty right to healthcare. It is kind of like when they say that, under the Affordable Care Act, you have access to care, but if the care is low quality, if the care is unavailable, if the care is not something you can afford or that will actually provide the kinds of services that you need, it is really not fulfillment of the treaty obligation.  One of the things we know is that many of the programs within the Affordable Care Act have gone a long way toward meeting the Federal Government's treaty responsibility to provide healthcare to Native American people. We talk about how Graham-Cassidy would hurt seniors, children with disabilities, individuals with preexisting conditions like asthma or cancer, those receiving treatment for opioid abuse, and many more. But too often in those statistics, which would encompass many Native American people who unfortunately have high rates of chronic conditions, the specific and unique needs of Native populations are forgotten during debates in the It happened when Republicans tried to pass their initial healthcare bill over the summer, and it nearly happened again.  Here we are on the Senate floor to make sure that Native communities are not left behind during these discussions in the future. We will be watching to make sure that communities in our State, unique and discreet, and, in fact, treaty Tribes, which are entitled to healthcare by contract, by treaty with the U.Government--that their interests are heard and that their voices are heard.  In July, when the Senate was discussing the last Republican healthcare bill that would have taken healthcare away from North Dakota families, I worked with Senator Udall, vice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, to hold a discussion on Tribal healthcare. The purpose was to hear directly from Tribal leaders, including the chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians from North Dakota, about how bad that bill would have been for Indian  During that discussion in July, we lamented--those of us who are on the committee, especially the minority members--that what happens in the Indian Affairs Committee all too often stays in the Indian Affairs What do I mean by that? I think the stories we hear and the challenges we hear about Native people, which we respond to many times with great empathy, are never taken out of that committee room. They are never understood broadly by Senators in this We vowed that day that we are never going to leave those challenges in that committee room. We are going to take those challenges to this forum and to this floor. We want to share our concern about the lack of Tribal consultation in the healthcare debates so far.  Unfortunately, the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill still does not remotely or adequately protect Native people. Just look at the opposition to the bill from the National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Health Board, and the National Council of Urban Indian This bill is just as bad as, if not worse than, the previous bill. To push it through without adequate consultation in ways that would fundamentally change our healthcare system is in no way putting the healthcare needs of people first; it is putting politics first. It is irresponsible and unconscionable.  Those of us on the Indian Affairs Committee know undoubtedly that the Indian Health Service is severely underfunded and, some of us would argue, inappropriately managed. It has been that way since I have been here. We have experienced those challenges of lack of leadership, lack of funding, and, really, an attitude that this is the way we have always done it. It has resulted in very many of our institutions losing their CMS certification. That is unacceptable.  The stories are unacceptable, but we also cannot just pin it on Indian health. We have to recognize and understand that this is also a funding problem. So it is essential that we find resources to fill those gaps and enter the Affordable Care Act, where we not only have traditional Medicaid eligibility, but we also have expanded Medicaid, which now has given extra hope to Indian healthcare providers that this resource can be made available without constantly having to beg for additional resources for Indian health. So it is particularly because of these severe challenges at the Indian Health Service that traditional Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, and private health insurance access have been critical for Indian Country, making sure Native Americans can access quality, affordable care to keep them and their families healthy.  Thanks to the increase of third-party payments, we are no longer limited to life and limb care at Tribal and IHS facilities in the Great Plains IHS service area. But the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill would undo all of that progress. It would slash Medicaid expansion and cap the Federal contributions to traditional Medicaid, pushing those remaining costs onto States and counties that can ill afford it.  Medicaid expansion has significant impact on IHS services at Turtle Mountain, increasing the funding and[[Page S6117]]resources available to its patient population by increasing healthcare services, increasing Purchased/Referred Care, or PRC, services, and increasing revenue generation.  Here are just some of the statistics that show how Turtle Mountain's IHS hospital has been impacted by the Medicaid expansion: a 13-percent decrease in uninsured patients; a 30-percent increase in Medicaid coverage; a 13-percent increase in traditional Medicare coverage; a 57-percent increase in private insurance coverage; a 9-percent increase in the number of individuals served; a 43-percent increase in revenue generation, i.e., collections; and a 32-percent increase in Purchased/Referred Care referrals. That may sound as if it is good for the institution, but when it is good for the institution--the healthcare provider--it is good for the families who get their services there.  Third-party billing revenue has also allowed the hospital to make renovations to emergency rooms and clinics, purchase new medical equipment, including neonatal monitors, recruit and hire additional staff, including licensed professionals, increase staff training and education, provide Wi-Fi throughout the hospital, and expand its all-important behavioral healthcare facility to serve more patients.  But the Republican healthcare bill would have eliminated these cost-sharing payments that make private health insurance affordable and accessible to American Indian families and North Dakota Indian families for the first time. All through the country you hear this over and over again, in pockets of poverty in this country. For the first time in people's lives, they have an insurance card, and that is a ticket to a future. Without an insurance card, many times people are left behind. This is an issue I have spoken about multiple times because it is so important.  In North Dakota, the Republican bill would have caused an estimate of almost 1,000 Native Americans to lose their cost-sharing reduction payments. The Republican healthcare bill would also jeopardize all-important mental health services for Native youth and could remove a trauma-informed approach to students' education. The Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara Nation from my State is working to set up a mental health pilot program in their schools by next year in this partnership with Nexus and PATH in North Dakota, which will bring social workers and a satellite clinic to school campus. This pilot program will be paid for by  The Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill would cut $5.5 billion from traditional Medicaid in North Dakota by 2036, affecting 36,000 low-income--not people--but low-income children. The Tribe and the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction are relying on those Medicaid dollars to keep this mental health program possible, which will keep kids in the classroom and in the communities while they are provided services. Quite honestly, keeping children with their families is a longstanding challenge, as we see the history of childhood trauma beginning at the time of not only the westward movement of families, like my ancestors, but the trauma that was experienced when children were ripped out of their homes and taken to boarding schools--a trauma from which many Native American communities have not yet recovered.  Sadly, this plan would take a significant step backward in healthcare for all Americans and certainly fall short on our promises and our treaty obligations to Native With so much at stake in our healthcare system, it is critical that we take a thoughtful and inclusive approach to healthcare--in fact, healthcare reform that considers the needs of all Americans, including, in my case, the first Americans, Native  Republicans need to work with I was saddened when I heard last night during the debate a discussion about how there isn't any opportunity for bipartisanship. I, like 30 of my other colleagues, attended meetings held by the HELP Committee before their hearings. Think about this. Thirty U.Senators, at 8 in the morning, without a mandate, with no obligation to be there, completely voluntary, came together during three mornings to talk about how we can work together as a bipartisan group on healthcare. So when people say it is not happening, it clearly is happening. It is happening, and we can, in fact, get to yes on many of the challenges that we have in healthcare. But we can't get to a lasting system if it is something that is done in a back room in the dead of night without consultation, not just with other Members of this body but without consultation for groups like Native American Tribes and Native American people.  Over the past 4\1/2\ years, I have offered reasonable reforms that should be bipartisan to make the current healthcare system work better for Dakotans and better for those citizens and my constituents in Indian Over the past few months and years, I have met with a group of Republican and Democratic Senators to talk about reasonable reforms that would make healthcare work better if we just focus for a minute on what unites us and what we can do if we just set aside partisanship, if we simply believe that we can, in fact, bury partisan hatchets and begin the work of working together.  I want to mention one last discussion item. Many times, when you hear people talk about treaty obligations for healthcare or education, it is usually people on this side of the aisle who are talking about Tribal sovereignty, Tribal treaty rights. Well, I was gladdened to hear my colleague from South Dakota talk about a treaty right that Tribes in his State have to healthcare. The solution there was to ask the Federal Government--if, in fact, the citizen of that State were Native American enrolled--to say that really is a Federal treaty right. So the Federal Government should pay 100 percent of that, even though your State match would be 50-50. That makes sense. I can buy that. But do you know what? That does nothing to expand healthcare to Native people--nothing. What that does is say that 50 percent that you are currently paying is because these are citizens of your State, not some kind of nonresidents. These are residents of your State, citizens of your State, whom you pay that additional 50 percent for. If the argument had been that we are going to take that additional 50 percent, the Federal Government is going to pay it, and we are going to augment what we do in healthcare for this population, then we are actually getting somewhere. Then we are actually accomplishing something for Native American people and Native American children.  I want you to understand that this is a population that suffers diabetes at record rates--hypertension, behavioral and mental health, including serious addictions, with record and epidemic suicides among young people all through Indian Country, record and epic amounts of opioid and meth addiction, children being born addicted.  We need interventions now. We do not need to see a reduction in support to healthcare--both behavioral and mental healthcare--right now, at this time. It is a crisis, and we need to do everything we can to consult with the Tribes, to consult with Indian healthcare leaders, to consult with the people who do this work for a living, and fashion a system that will expand and grow access to healthcare. It is critically important.  Make no mistake, these are the first Americans, and way too often, the ``asterisk Americans.'' What do I mean by that? They are not large enough to have a demographic category, so their challenges are not tracked, whether it is human trafficking, whether it is addiction. If we do not begin to focus on this, we will fail in our treaty obligations.  The United States of America signed a treaty with Indian people. Let's keep our word. Let's work together. Let's work in collaboration with many of the people in my State who are struggling to make ends meet. Let's not reduce services and resources. Let's not take a step backward.  Thank you.

473,topic-id,619,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, it is so obvious to all as we have looked in horror on our television screens to see the devastation of Harvey, Irma, and There have been lots of tragic stories, harrowing tales of survival.  I have been to I have met with a number of the victims. Mr.Speaker, let me tell you about one tragic story. One tragic story is that there are people who are living in homes that repeatedly flood five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, even twenty times.  Something is fundamentally wrong in America and something is fundamentally dangerous in America when people are living in harm's way. Many of these people are ready to move.  Mr.Speaker, last week I made a comment about these repeatedly flooded properties that was clearly inartful. It was not meant to be taken literally, but it was. I regret the comment because it diverted from a very important point that needs to be made, and the point is this: if we care about our fellow citizens, if we wish to be compassionate, then Federal aid and Federal policy will help move these people to safer ground.  It is time to either help mitigate these homes or to help move these homes. For this small set of properties, we must help. Otherwise, I fear that the fatalities and the economic carnage will continue.  If we simply rebuild the same properties in the same manner, in the same place, and expect a different result, we are not helping our fellow citizens, we are not helping our first responders, and we are certainly not helping the taxpayer.  Mr.Speaker, another tragedy of these storms is how many people needed flood insurance but didn't have it. Many of them had no idea that they actually needed it. In Houston, by some reports, 80 percent of the damaged homes didn't have flood insurance.  Why?  One of the reasons, Mr.Speaker, is because we have a government monopoly in flood insurance. Many people don't understand that flood is not included in their typical homeowner's insurance policy. Many people, unfortunately, took false security from living outside the government-designated 100-year flood plain. Many have seen no options.  But help is on the way. Bipartisan help is on the way with the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, known as the Ross-Castor bill. It is a critical piece of legislation to give more people more affordable options for flood insurance.  In the small part of the national market where we have competition, particularly in Pennsylvania and in Florida, people are saving hundreds of dollars, if not thousands of dollars, in many cases on their flood insurance premiums.  The very respected firm of Millman, which studies insurance matters, said that half of policy owners in Florida, two-thirds in Louisiana, and 75 percent in Texas--my native State--could all save with private flood insurance.  Think about it, Mr.If we had a real competitive market with multiple companies advertising and selling multiple policies, more people would become educated about the need for flood insurance and have that rolled into their normal homeowner's policy. This is vital.  Mr.Speaker, last year this bill passed this House 419-0. You can't get any more bipartisan. It recently passed the Financial Services Committee 58-0.  If there is one thing that we need to do--and it is urgent that we do it now, with the National Flood Insurance Program, which is in debt, facing another bailout and an uncertain future, which we must remedy--as folks begin to rebuild, let's get them more affordable flood insurance policies.  I appreciate the bill included in this package, and for the sake of all the victims of the hurricanes, I urge its adoption.

Many people think they were safe because they were 3 feet outside of the government designated 100-year floodplain. Many thought that somehow this was simply rolled into their homeowners' insurance policy, but it wasn't.  So, Mr.Speaker, we have an opportunity to make sure that people have more affordable options for flood insurance.  Wouldn't it be wonderful that for every time you saw a life insurance commercial or an auto insurance commercial, you saw something about flood insurance to help educate the American people about the need for this basic insurance policy?  We could see the savings occur as people rolled this into their homeowners' policy.  In the very small portion of the market, Mr.Speaker, where there is competition, people are saving not just hundreds of dollars, but thousands of dollars.  We have heard from the Megoulas family in Pennsylvania: ``NFIP insurance would have cost me $2,700 a year, but I was able to find private coverage for only $718. . . . ''  We heard from the Cyr family, also of Pennsylvania: ``I have benefited from switching to private market flood insurance from I save about $1,000 per year.''  So, Mr.Speaker, there is a piece of legislation known as the Flood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act, also known as Ross-I want to thank my colleague from Florida (Mr.Ross) for his leadership on this issue. It is very simple. It simply clarifies congressional intent that people ought to have more options.  In particular, Mr.Speaker, as people begin to rebuild after these hurricanes, they need better options for flood insurance, particularly with the NFIP $30 billion in debt, facing another bailout, and facing an uncertain future. Now we need to take care of that.  That is why I have proposed, along with Chairman Duffy, a 5-year, long-term reauthorization. We are currently operating under a temporary 90-day authorization. But as we do, let's work on something that we can all agree on. The last time this bill came up in the House, Mr.Speaker, 419-0. It has recently come out of the Financial Services Committee 58-0.  I am not sure you can get that kind of vote tally for a Mother's Day resolution. It is bipartisan. It is the very definition of bipartisan.  So let's take one important step today to help the victims of Harvey, Irma, and Maria as they begin to rebuild their homes, to have more flood insurance options, more affordable insurance options. As we work through what we might disagree on in the NFIP authorization, let's pass today what we can agree on and help the victims today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

843,topic-id,2345,"Thank you,  Let me associate myself with Connie Morella's remarks. Your leadership of FMC has been exemplary, and your report today is a tribute to our great energy and commitment. On behalf of our Association, thank you very much,  I want to thank Speaker Ryan for what he said today about coming to visit us, but also talking about our being ambassadors to the I think we are, not only the Nation, but worldwide, about the Congress and how proud we are of the Congress and the democracy that we have here, and even with our great differences in today's world, how we carry on and represent the people and commend the Congress for doing so.  I am tremendously pleased to share with our colleagues an update on our charitable golf tournament. As Cliff mentioned, I, along with Ken Kramer, co-chair the event, which is now in its 11th year.  Back in 2006, we had low attendance. It was just a competitive match that we had between Republicans and Democrats out at Andrews Air Force Base and very private. We were dwindling in our attendance, and we thought maybe we could change this and make it into something effective for the community.  We were able to transform it into something that was fun but also, more importantly, inspirational, where the focus was not just on your golfing ability. I am the example. I am not a golfer. I have co-chaired this for 10 years with Ken now, but I am the worst duffer you could have out there, yet the Democrats still won even with me on their team this year.  It has become successful. As of today, the tournament has raised almost $1.3 million to help veterans and their families deal with injuries sustained during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.  The two beneficiaries of the money raised, Warfighters Sports, a division of Disabled Sports USA who helps with 120 different sports for their members across this Nation who have been injured in defending our country, and Tee it Up for the Troops, are two outstanding organizations that use adaptive sports as a way for severely wounded veterans to reengage with their families and communities and get a bit of their prewar activity back into their lives. These guys go skiing, they go mountain climbing, horseback riding. You name it, they do it. We are so proud of the men and women and what they have accomplished.  We are proud that for the last 3 years, we have shared this honor of co-chairing the tournament with Congressman Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee, who I am sorry to see is retiring now--he has just been an excellent chairman and a great friend to all of us all these years--and Congressman Gene Green of Texas, who has just been an outstanding leader and is going to continue with us, I hope. He is just so enthusiastic in getting Members out there.  They are the ones who recruit the current Members of Congress, and they bug them and hassle them every week to get them out to our tournament. We have had more people, more Members at our tournament than other golf tournaments. There are so many different tournaments here in Washington that have Members play, but we have had the greatest turnout over the years.  It is unlike any other golf tournament. There is still a little friendly competition. As I said, the Democrats won this year. I can't say that enough, because we lost for the past 7 years prior. And, you know, Republicans belong to more country clubs than Democrats, anyway. I think they have more experience.  More importantly, we have had over 30 wounded veterans play this last year, and every year in our tournament, so many wounded veterans, and it is just inspirational.  I played with a veteran from Michigan, a young man who had been in Afghanistan 2 weeks on the Army police force there, and lost his leg in a bomb explosion. And he was out there playing golf. Just an outstanding golfer, outstanding American, and to share that day with him has just been an honor for all of us.  So we are already working now on the tournament for next year. It will be April of next year. We hope we get more former Members out. As I have said, we have done really well with current Members of Congress, but what we need is to get more former Members out. It doesn't matter our age or our ability. Even if you can just come out for the day and spend it with the veterans, you know, watching the match and having lunch and dinner and breakfast with the Members and, more importantly, the veterans, that is really worthwhile. If you bring your family out there too for a while, that is fine too. It is always at the Army and Navy Club, so it is convenient.  We finish early. We start early. We start at 8 and we finish about 4 in the afternoon, so we leave before the rush hour traffic so the Members can get back here for a vote. So we would love to have you come out even for a few hours if you have the time.  Ken Kramer, Pete Weichlein and I back in 2006 wondered whether we could change our existing tournament to something more meaningful, and decided to transform the golf event from a highly competitive Members only tournament to a fun and inspirational fundraiser, where the focus was not on your golfing ability, but rather on coming together, on a bipartisan basis, former and current Members alike, for a great cause. I think I can speak for Ken and Pete when I say that we have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. As of today the tournament has raised almost $1.3 million to help veterans and their families deal with injuries sustained during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The two beneficiaries of the money raised, Warfighters Sports, a division of Disabled Sports USA, and Tee it Up for the Troops are two outstanding organizations that use adaptive sports as a way for severely wounded warriors to re-engage with their families and communities and get a bit of their pre-war activity back into their lives.  Both Ken Kramer and I have had the honor to be cochair of this tournament for the past 10 years, and we are proud that the last three years we have shared this honor with Congressman Jimmy Duncan of Tennessee and Congressman Gene Green of Jimmy and Gene are instrumental in recruiting current Members to the tournament. This tournament is unlike any other golf tournament. Although there still is a little friendly competition with the Speakers Cup, which the Democrats won this year after several years of losing to the Republicans, the day is all about the vets. Over 30 wounded veterans played in the tournament. It is quite amazing to see a wounded warrior, for example, someone who has lost a leg, drive the ball like a pro, out-shooting everyone in the foursome, or be inspired with stories of the courage you hear while playing a round of golf with a warrior suffering from traumatic brain injury. The tournament we hosted earlier this year was our most successful yet, with the greatest number of players and the largest dollar amount raised, and we already are working on the next tournament in April 2018.  Before I yield the floor back to Cliff, let me thank him and Martin Frost for their incredible leadership on our annual gala event, the Statesmanship Awards Cliff is FMC's president and Martin is the event's chairman. They work tirelessly on making the dinner a signature event here in D.C., and, more importantly, a huge successful evening for all of us.  As you all know, we do not receive any funding from Congress, as Cliff pointed out again this morning. Not a single taxpayer dollar is earmarked for any of our programs, which, in my opinion, is exactly the way it should be. We are independent, we raise our own money, and our former Members donate their time pro bono for all the different programs that we have. As Cliff went over, we had former Members donate to us an astounding 6,500 hours of pro bono public service, even without the need to cover an honorarium. Running all of our outstanding programs does cost a lot of money and staff time. Therefore, in addition to[[Page H7583]]foundation grants, the Statesmanship Awards Dinner is an incredibly important piece of FMC's budgetary puzzle.  Over the years, I have heard so many of our former Members talk about how much they appreciate our staff and how wonderful our staff is and how they accomplish what would take ten-fold another staff to do. We think it is the best staff in That is saying a lot, considering all the other competitive nonprofits that are successful here in  So the way that we can show our appreciation for the staff and what they have accomplished and what they are doing for us and what they are doing for our country is this dinner. That is the one thing that we can all demonstrate our support at, because it pays their salaries. So if you appreciate what they do and you think they deserve a bonus, the best way to help them and to improve our Association is to help us sell tickets for this dinner.  Under Martin Frost's chairmanship this last year, our 20th annual dinner, we had the most successful event ever. It was getting to be kind of the same old thing, and Pete Weichlein, our executive director who spearheaded this effort, said let's change it up, let's move it to the Mellon Auditorium, which has been a tremendous, majestic setting, and let's have some outside awardees that we honor too. Let's not just have a boring program where we have people get up and receive an award and give a thank-you speech and then take pictures. Let's have a panel discussion instead so we can involve the audience and take some questions and we all stay awake and people don't sneak out early, because it is interesting to hear that panel discussion.  That is what Pete Weichlein has created now, and I think it is those two decisions that we now have the signature event here in We have something that we are proud of where we see more and more people come, more and more active Members come, people from the administration, past Members come. The Speaker has been supportive, the majority leader, minority leaders have been supportive in so many ways. I just think it is a way that we get to talk about what we do to a broader audience, and for them actually to say thank you to us by coming to that dinner.  We now have a dinner that has become a signature event here in D.C., a classy and substantive evening of which all of us can be very proud. The only thing missing is to make it a black-tie evening, and maybe that is something we can consider for the future. It is that sophisticated an event.  So Martin and Cliff have already put things in place to make the 2018 dinner even more outstanding. They should be commended for their efforts. I, along with the other former Members serving on the event's steering committee, are committed to helping them. I hope all the former Members here today will take a closer look at the dinner and decide to become more involved.  We are recognizing via this dinner the tremendous power of bipartisanship, something that Speaker Ryan talked about that is so important to all of us, and it really is exemplified in that dinner every year by the awards that we give, by the discussion we have, and by the people that attend.  So this year we are going to be honoring as honorees Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, along with House Members Diana DeGette and, my good friend, Fred Upton from We will host a conversation of our honorees on stage again so that those in attendance can hear about their success reaching across the political aisle and working together for the good of the country. They are able to tell stories about exactly how they accomplish things and what they did and the kind of personal relationships that they have and why that makes a difference, the kind of thing that we know about, that we want to reach the larger world so that they understand that things are done by individuals working together, and not by speeches and by fundraising alone, but by Members of Congress being effective and caring about moving the ball forward.  The 21st Annual Statesmanship Awards Dinner is one of the most impressive in town. You will not regret becoming involved. You will see more of your former colleagues from both the House and the Senate, as well as ambassadors. Connie Morella has brought more ambassadors to that dinner and more administration officials and former officials than ever before.  I am thinking of Speaker A lot of us served with his former boss, Jack Jack Kemp was in the Reagan administration and was such a leader. It just flows down from people who have served before carrying that torch forward, and I think Speaker Ryan is a great example of that. So the dinner exemplifies that, and it has become an increasingly impressive event, showcasing our  I hope all of you will join Martin and all the hard work he is doing. He will push us. He is really good at pushing us. He did that when he did it for the He is a fundraiser. Now he does it, very importantly, for our We would like that muscle to be used in a bipartisan way now.  Cliff's leadership is outstanding across the board and tireless. So thank you very much. We are looking forward to a great dinner in 2018.

450,topic-id,625,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering 327 today, the Fair Access to Investment Research  This is the Senate companion to my bill, H.910, that I had the pleasure of working on with my friend from Illinois (Mr.Foster) in this Congress and our colleague in the last Congress, now Governor Carney of  Mr.Speaker, occasionally on this floor, we don't compliment our colleagues in the upper Chamber at the other end of the building, but we have to say today ``thank you'' to Senator Crapo and Senator Brown for advancing a number of securities-related bills in the last few days which we appreciate seeing coming back to the House, including 327.                              {time}  1630  This bill contains the same language as H.910, which passed the House in May with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 405-2.  327 also includes some Senate amendments that add some additional clarifications to the bill:  First, it clarifies the conflict of interest provision by precluding dealers from issuing research on affiliated exchange-traded funds.  Second, it carves out closed-end funds, including business development companies.  Finally, it includes a specific definition of ``affiliated person,'' which matches the definition of an ``affiliated person'' in section 2(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Since starting an investment firm back in the late 1990s, I have watched exchange-traded funds grow amazingly. ETFs have grown from about 100 funds, in the late 1990s, with over $100 billion in assets, to now over 1,700 funds with over $3 trillion in assets. Exchange-traded funds can average 30 percent of the trading volumes by value on any given day on our markets.  Yet, despite their growing popularity and increasing importance to retail investors, most broker-dealers do not[[Page H7549]]publish research on This is due to anomalies in our securities laws and regulations. 327 tackles those anomalies.  Given the importance of ETFs to investors, and particularly retail investors, steps to facilitate research on exchange-traded funds are long overdue.  The Fair Access to Investment Research Act is simple. It directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered offers under section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. This allows ETF research to be issued just like stock research on a corporate issuer.  This commonsense proposal, which mirrors other research safe harbors implemented by the SEC, would clarify the law and allow broker-dealers to publish exchange-traded fund research, thereby allowing investors to access that very useful and needed information in this rapidly growing and occasionally complex market of choices.  This bill also holds the SEC accountable to follow Congress' direction. The bill requires the SEC to finalize the rules within 270 days, and if the deadline is not met, an interim safe harbor rule will take effect until the SEC's rule is finalized.  Mr.Speaker, this issue is not unfamiliar to the Commission, as this proposal has been raised both by the Commission and by industry many times over the last two decades. With close to 6 million U.households holding ETFs, investors need access to this important research.  Having worked in the banking and investment industry for the past three decades, I appreciate Chairman Hensarling and the Congress' efforts to promote capital formation, reduce unnecessary burdens, and grow jobs and the economy. 327 is another step in that process.  I also want to thank my friend, Mr.Foster of Illinois, for working on this legislation, and our colleague in the Senate, Senator Heller of Nevada, for working with me on this bipartisan, commonsense fix that we worked on together for over 2 years.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1114,topic-id,921,"Mr.President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Makan Delrahim to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department of Justice's Antitrust While I voted in favor of that nomination, I would like to explain my expectations for Mr.Delrahim and express my deep concerns about the Trump administration's approach to antitrust policy, such as it is, as he assumes that important position.  As a former antitrust lawyer myself, I know these are complex issues that benefit from a rigorous and nonpolitical assessment, which is best done by the talented career professionals at the Department of Justice, but I am also concerned that, in what has become a much politicized Department of Justice, such an independent review may not be respected and the recommendations of career lawyers and economists can be overridden.  At every turn, the Trump administration has catered to the interests of big business over those of the American consumer, and I am very concerned about what their approach to antitrust enforcement will be. In the past, the President has made remarks about supporting or opposing particular mergers that are deeply troubling and highly political. I am particularly concerned about this haphazard approach from the President because there are a number of major proposed and rumored mergers that will be coming before the Antitrust Division in the coming months and years, particularly in the telecommunications industry, and they will require very careful and professional review independent of politics. I am also deeply concerned about the possibility that this administration will use antitrust laws as a weapon against companies it perceives as somehow unfair to it.  For example, Sinclair Broadcast Group's proposed merger with the Tribune Media Company would give Sinclair control of stations in 42 cities, expanding its reach to a total of 108 communities. In the past, Sinclair has drawn criticism for programming that benefitted then Republican Presidential candidates Donald Trump and George Given reports of the President's continued attacks on the press, including reports of his threats to jail journalists, it is imperative that consumers retain access to a diversity of news sources. The Department of Justice, through its Antitrust Division, must ensure that their review of this merger is free of political considerations.  However, despite those concerns, I believe Mr.Delrahim has the qualifications necessary to lead the Antitrust Division, which does the important work of preventing unlawful anticompetitive conduct and upholding our Nation's antitrust laws. Mr.Delrahim has served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the division he would now lead, as well as chief counsel and staff director for the Judiciary Committee under then-Chairman Hatch, and as an attorney in private practice working on complicated antitrust cases. He has a remarkable personal story and has received the support of many of his peers, both Democrats and  During his nomination hearing on May 10, Mr.Delrahim promised to protect competitive markets and consumers, vigorously enforce the antitrust laws, and to cooperate with the Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan manner. I will hold him to these promises. Importantly, he told the committee that he would follow the law and his ethical responsibilities to recuse himself in cases involving his former clients. I support his nomination with the expectation that he will honor these commitments.  Mr.Delrahim also made a number of assurances in response to written questions for the record that I submitted after his hearing, questions that were based on my concerns about the anticompetitive impact of corporate mergers, as well as about actions taken by President  In response to my question about President Trump holding private meetings with the CEO of AT&T, which is planning on merging with Time Warner, and the CEOs of Bayer and Monsanto, which are planning on merging, Mr.Delrahim promised that he would conduct antitrust investigations ``in a fair, professional, and impartial manner, without regard to political considerations.'' He promised to comply with[[Page S6219]]Department of Justice policies intended to ensure only appropriate communications with the White  This concern is particularly pressing because during his campaign, President Trump singled out the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger, promising to block it. The President has also repeatedly attacked CNN, which is owned by Time Warner, and it was even reported that White House advisers have discussed the proposed merger as a ``potential point of leverage'' over the network. Mr.Delrahim specifically stated that he had no preordained outcome in mind for that merger investigation. He can be certain that the Department of Justice will receive particular scrutiny in its treatment of this merger. Leveraging antitrust laws to coerce or intimidate a media company goes against the foundational protections for a free press.  While Mr.Delrahim expressed that he shared my concerns about consolidation in the media and agricultural sectors, I regret that he refused to address my specific concerns about the proposed merger of Sinclair Broadcast Group with the Tribune Media Company and the effect of the proposed Bayer-Monsanto merger on prices for Hawaii farmers. I would have welcomed his comments about these types of mergers and I expect him, as head of the Antitrust Division, to give concerns about the impact of these types of mergers the attention they deserve.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I will continue to exercise oversight of the Department of Justice, and of the Antitrust Division in particular, to ensure that it is meeting the commitments Mr.Delrahim made during his nomination, especially as to his independence and his ability to be a fair, active, and nonpartisan ally of consumers and competitive markets. With this in mind, I supported his confirmation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgS6218-4.txt,1844,DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS EXPIRING AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,28.0,September

1075,topic-id,849,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that an overwhelming number of Americans--75 percent, in fact--not only support but demand of this body. The issue is term limits. The time is now.  It has become more and more transparent to Hoosiers back home that this city, and even sometimes this building, no longer reflects the ideals, the morals, and the values that they share in their communities. The people demanded representation that truly represents their interests. They are tired of elected officials being seduced by the trappings of their office, forgetting the reason they were sent to this hallowed Ultimately, the American people have seen that many Members vote in consideration of sometimes interests that are divergent from theirs back home.  Since I first entered public life, I have been a vocal proponent of term limits. I believe that in order for this body to truly serve the people back home, the hardworking Hoosiers every day trying to make ends meet, that they need to be responsive to those people, they need to listen to those people, and, ultimately, they need to relate to those people.  Yet, the American people are not the only ones calling for term limits. As we all can remember, President Trump crisscrossed this great Nation, sharing his vision on how he could make America great again. He agreed with the chorus of American voices that were calling for term limit legislation for the United States I support President Trump's agenda in term limits.  Mr.Speaker, I have heard the voices of Hoosiers back home who desperately wish to see this legislation passed, who desperately want to see their Representatives representing their interests and their values. That is why, as one of my first actions as a Member of this body, I wrote legislation that would sponsor a constitutional amendment levying term limits on Members of  Additionally, I have cosponsored every piece of term limits legislation that reflects actual term limits that is available in this body.  Furthermore, I so strongly believe in this issue that I went door to door during the course of my campaign handing out term limits pledges that I would sign personally at the over 15,000 doors that I have knocked on during the course of my elected official office. I have continued to sign those term limits, talking to each one about how we can ensure that their interests and their values are fully represented here.  Now, the positions that we hold here in this Chamber are not bequeathed to us by status, by lineage, or by heritage, but, rather, the positions we hold--every single one of us--are based on the ideas that we presented to the American public and based on the values that the American public said they wanted represented.  I want to make sure that we continue year in and year out to be responsive to those ideas and to be responsive to those values. Too frequently, I hear in my district that they feel like Washington, D.C., has values that are inconsistent with theirs. That the toxic environment they sometimes believe that exists in Washington, D.C., hasn't gotten them the results that they have demanded election after election.  Now, I am an old business guy, a manufacturing guy by trade, so I always think about how the process of creating policy could be better, not just fixing the policies at the end of the line, because no one would run a manufacturing business where you have a process and then you just fix the widgets at the end of the line. But, instead, they would focus on how we manufacture policy in a better way.  The American people and Hoosiers back home have said how they think we could manufacture policy in a better way. They have said that they want to see terms limits legislation passed so that the manufacturers of policy will reflect their values, will reflect their concerns, and will reflect what they live, breathe, and feel every single day.  What I hear, when I go back home and travel my district every single weekend, is that Washington, D.C., has become flooded with self-interests--self-interests that drive the boat forward instead of American interests propelling us forward into better and better policy.  I think the quickest way to correct that failure here in D.is to consider and pass term limits. When 74 percent of Americans agree--that is not 74 percent of one side of the aisle or 74 percent of the other side of the aisle, but that is 74 percent of Americans agree on something--then I think in a democracy that something should get done.  The Framers of our Constitution did not intend for Members of this body to remain seated for 20, 30, 40, or even 50 years, but rather they fundamentally believe that government should be designed, one of the people and for the people, to experience regular turnover. Ultimately, the greatness of this country has always rooted in the American people themselves, and I want to get more of those American people up here serving in elected office.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7496.txt,99999999999999,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,26.0,September

The strength of Jennifer--I watched Madison and Harrison spend their entire summer in that hospital for their father, and for him to be able to walk back here as soon as he did and the excitement in his face when he was able to cast that vote, I know Steve is going to continue to get stronger as he goes, and he thanks everybody for the help they provided.[[Page H7616]]  We should not forget the spirit that this floor had today.

I thank him for his interest, and it is true, the gentleman and I were hopefully trying to go down to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Key West to look at some of the damage, and, right now, the Coast Guard tells us, with the rescue attempts that are ongoing, that we probably would be taking some equipment away from doing that work, and we do not want to do any of that. We will be able to go a little later when the time is right.  We will continue to work with the administration. When you think what this country has gone through with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, I do want to give thanks to the work of the administration. I have seen some coordination like I have not seen in the past.  We know these are islands. The damage of the two hurricanes they have to go through, I have been keeping in constant contact, and just speaking with FEMA just recently, they are currently coordinating and establishing seven temporary hospitals. That was one of my concerns with dialysis and others, but there is so much more to do to be able to move through, and I will work with the gentleman, as we have in the past, to make sure whatever they need will be able to get there.                              {time}  1200  And I do want to thank Congressman Carlos Curbelo for his amendment to the bill that we just voted on, adding a little more resources there to make sure, knowing the tax code of Puerto Rico is a little different than the one we had voted on as we go through, to give them greater assistance, and the Virgin  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgH7615-3.txt,566,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,28.0,September
525,topic-id,989,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Clearly, this is not a partisan issue when an American or a group of Americans or a large number--in this case, over 3.5 million people, all of them at dire risk. We want to act together, we want to act quickly, and we do not want to fail to deploy any resource that is necessary to help our fellow  Secondly, Mr.Speaker, I would like to bring up an act, which although not the crisis that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in particular, confront us with, as did Harvey and Irma in Texas and in Florida, but, Mr.Speaker, I notice that the Dream Act is not a part of next week's schedule.  The leader and I have discussed the Dream Act, along with Speaker I know that the President has said, if we pass the Dream Act, he has said publicly that he would sign the Dream He is obviously concerned with security at the borders. We share that concern about security at the borders. But this is an item that, now, one-sixth of the time that was available has run, and we have 5 months left to go.  I will tell the majority leader that I am very hopeful. I know the majority leader and the Speaker have formed some task forces to look at this issue, but I am very hopeful, Mr.Speaker--and I ask the majority leader to perhaps comment on this--that before the end of this work period--there are another 14 days left after this week in this work period--that we might be able to bring the Dream Act to the floor.  A discharge petition has been filed. I would hope that the discharge petition not be necessary for either the rule or for the Dream Act itself. The discharge petition on the Dream Act itself will be mature as of October 5, and I expect a discharge petition to be filed on that, as well. But I am hopeful, Mr.Speaker, that that will not be necessary.[[Page H7617]]  Given the fact that the President has said that he thinks DACA was issued beyond the authority of President Obama, we disagree with that conclusion. But whether that conclusion is correct or not, the President observed that we need to fix this legislatively.  So my question to the majority leader is: How soon does he believe that we could address this issue in regular order?  We continue to pursue a discharge petition, as we did, frankly, for the Ex-Im Bank, which, when it was called to the floor, had over 300 votes in favor of it, including the majority of the majority party voted for that bill.  We believe, Mr.Speaker, strongly, that if the Dream Act is brought to the floor, which over 8 in 10 Americans agree with, frankly, we believe large numbers on both sides of the aisle agree that these young people are not to be sent home.  Lastly, let me just quote Senator Orrin Hatch, who is a senior Member in the United States Senate and the chairman of the Finance He said: ``I've urged the President not to rescind . . .''  He did, and gave us 6 months to solve this, legislatively.  Senator Hatch observed that if DACA were rescinded, it would be ``an action that would further complicate a system in serious need of a permanent, legislative solution.''  He was referring then, Mr.Speaker, to a comprehensive immigration reform.  ``Like the President, I've long advocated for tougher enforcement of our existing immigration laws. But we also need a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here. That solution must come from Congress.''  And I agree that that decision must come from  Rush Limbaugh said--and I don't usually agree with statements that Mr.Limbaugh makes: ``Nobody's gonna win anything by deporting a bunch of kids that we let in, whoever did, Obama, whatever. If we can get the strict enforcement of existing immigration law . . . then the DREAMer thing may be an acceptable payoff,'' he went on to say.  I don't think this is a payoff. This is responding. And that is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support the Dream As I say, over 8 out of 10  So I ask the majority--and I know that was a relatively long statement. This is a critical issue, however, as I have expressed in private to the majority leader, because we have but 5 months left to go.  Hopefully, we could do this in this work period to allay the fears that these young people have, who are making such a positive contribution to America, to their communities, and to their families. So I am hopeful that we could resolve this issue as soon as possible.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  I first want to applaud Speaker Ryan for forming a working group on this important issue. The gentleman and I have met numerous times on this, and I have talked to the President about it, as well. He has been very clear, and I agree with the President's position, courts have shown that the past was unconstitutional, and that just means the House has to do their job and the The one thing I would hate to happen here is that we only do the job halfway, and then we have this problem come back to us.  The President has asked us about border security, as well. I believe we can find a solution here, together. I look forward to working with Mr. The President has challenged this Congress to find a solution, and I believe we can. We are going to work to make sure we get it done. I would like to do it sooner than the timeframe the President has given us.

526,topic-id,424,"Mr.Speaker, I welcome the majority leader's thought that he wants to do it sooner rather than later. I will support him, of course, in that effort.  I would say on his comment, Mr.Speaker, with reference to a comprehensive solution, we are for a comprehensive solution. We would like to see that because that is the only way we will stop this from coming back.  The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill 3 years ago. We have not seen that on the floor as of yet. Again, we think that that would have a substantial vote and, perhaps, I think, a majority vote. I am not as confident of that as I am with the Dream Act, which I think clearly would enjoy the majority of the House's support.  But I am glad that he wants to move this quickly. We will work with him to get that, I would hope, as I said, by the end of the work period, to allay the great fears and anxiety.  Very frankly, we have had some young people thinking of going back to a land they do not know, a language they do not necessarily speak, and a culture they have, as adults, never been exposed to and don't know.  This, for all intents and purposes, in anything other than having the paper that says so, is their country. They have gone to school here, they work here, and they have been positive citizens here. And, hopefully--as the President said, he loved these children--we could relieve their fears and, in effect, redeem the American Dream for them.  There are other issues, obviously, with which we have to deal, and I would urge the majority leader, as well, at some point in time, to make a path forward for comprehensive immigration reform, because it is a system we all agree is broken and needs to be fixed and is part of the problem.  Two more issues, Mr.The majority leader mentioned the budget would be coming to the floor. This is the 2018 budget. This is obviously late, but, nevertheless, it is being brought to the floor, and we will be able to consider it.  Can the gentleman tell me: Will this include reconciliation instructions and, if so, what those reconciliation instructions will deal with?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I expect reconciliation in this budget. I leave it up to the Rules Committee and the Budget Committee when they produce it, but on this floor, I believe there will be reconciliation.

We know the harm that ObamaCare has brought to many The lack of insurance, when you look at the number of counties, 40 percent of all of the counties in America only have one provider, some have none.

528,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the majority leader for that observation.  Obviously, we disagree, as he knows, on the success or failure of the As a matter of fact, every health organization in America, every major health organization in America opposed the repeal, a bill that came to the floor.  Senator McCain, I thought, gave a very powerful exhortation to all of us when he said, on July 25, we ought to do this in a bipartisan way.  We found, now, three efforts to repeal by the majority party, who control all three--the Senate, the House, and the Presidency--an inability to do that.  Mr.Speaker, I believe--and I would hope the majority leader would pursue efforts, and we would do the same on our side. We believe the ACA has been working.  We believe that 20-plus million more people are insured under the ACA than were insured before the  We believe people with preexisting conditions were able to get insurance. We believe seniors saved substantial money in purchasing prescription drugs as a result of that.  We believe that people did not have--we know they did not have the specter of being canceled because their expenses in any one year were above a limit and that their lifetime limits[[Page H7618]]would not be imposed when they get a serious critical illness.  So we think it worked.  The majority has tried to repeal it. They have not succeeded at this point in time, but they have created, Mr.Speaker, great anxiety and uncertainty in the marketplace.  And to the extent, for instance, that premiums have risen in our State, the head of Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the largest insurer in our State, said the reason for at least 50 percent was the uncertainty that had been created by the administration and by the debates that have occurred in this House and the proposals that have occurred in this House, which have undermined the market.  I talked to him the other day, and he said, in fact, if there were stability, he believes rates would come down significantly because insurance companies, providers, would have an opportunity to have a stable environment in which they could assess the cost of health insurance.  Did the majority leader want to say anything?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, the only thing I want to say, and I know we have debated this many times--we can always put an endorsement somewhere and we can always go back and forth, but I will just tell you for my own district--I don't know why anybody would ever say they are making a decision based on something when our bill carries it out another 2 years even, so I don't believe that to be true.  But I know what is true. Currently, 30 percent of the people who are on the exchange in my district just had somebody pull out; and they had that health insurance, Anthem, so now they don't. They have to go find something else. They had doctors who they loved, and they were promised that they were going to be able to keep them. Well, they couldn't.  I just look at numbers; and I take Republican, Democrat, I take whatever name is across from it. Almost twice as many people pay the penalty or take a waiver as actually make a payment for                              {time}  1215  So, yes, this will continue not because you and I have a disagreement, but because people are hurting, premiums are going up, deductibles are going up, and people are losing their providers. And the providers are not leaving because it is staying the same way for another 2 years, they are leaving because it is staying there.  So, yes, I look forward to continuing this conversation because we cannot allow this harm to continue to go through this country.

Mr.Speaker, we could go on, I presume, all day, and our friends who want to do a 1-minute or a Special Order would not be happy with us, and they are maybe not happy now, but the fact of the matter is that this is a critically important issue to our country. When he talks about providers, the providers said they didn't like any of these bills.  We have had three opportunities: one that was offered but not put on the floor; then one that came to the floor and passed this House and then went to the Senate, and the majority of the Senate has not agreed with any of the three alternatives; plus the alternative that Senator Graham brought forward along with the Senator from  The majority in the Senate has not agreed, and, Mr.Speaker, what that has done is provided the insurance industry, providers, doctors, medical authorities with total lack of confidence on what is going to happen tomorrow. Nobody in business believes that you can have proper pricing if you do not know the context in which you are pricing your product. So, yes, there has been a disruption.  What we ought to do, as Senator McCain said, is come together and make sure a system works. We believe the ACA is working--not working as well as it should right now, it is not working as much for the small market or people on the exchanges as it should. It can.  Almost every medical provider and the majority of the American people over these last 8 months has changed from not liking the ACA and not thinking it is good for them, to where the majority of the American people now support it, and 7 out of 10-plus want the ACA fixed, not repealed.  So in that context, it seems to me it is both good politics and good policy for us to come together and to create a system that works for the American people. We believe that is by fixing the ACA, and to that extent, we reflect the majority of the American people.  Secondly, Mr.Speaker, the last issue I want to bring up are two items that were not included in the FAA bill, but which are important programs. One is the Perkins Loan Program for students. We know that the cost of education has skyrocketed and that we need to extend that act. That bill, by the way, Mr.Speaker, has 226 cosponsors, so it is not as if there is not a majority of the House that already supports that extension.  The second thing that needs to be done: we need to deal with a comprehensive health system in our communities, the Community Health We need to deal with the teaching hospitals. We need to deal with the disproportionate share of hospitals.  So there are many things that we did not include in the bill that we passed today that need to be addressed and need to be addressed immediately. They are not on the schedule for next week.  Can my friend give me some idea when we might consider those, which, of course, expire on September 30?  So September 30 will come and go before we start next week's schedule.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  You raised a couple issues there. When it comes to teaching hospitals, that was in the bill you just voted against twice this week on the floor. So that has been taken care of.  When you are talking about SCHIP and the extension of that, Chairman Walden actually postponed a markup not because he wanted to, but because it was requested by the So he postponed the markup this week in continuing bipartisan negotiations.  This is something I would like to get done. I know Chairman Walden has now scheduled a markup for next week, so I am very hopeful that we will get this done very soon. I am a big supporter of SCHIP and a lot of the work that they do and what it moves forward for our healthcare in the future, especially for the health clinics out there.

I think that when I see you and we say ``hello'' to one another, it is in a different context in which we meet as people who have participated in a very important and historic way, have worked together, have respected the institution, have respected the process of the institution, and have differed, obviously, but, nevertheless, were able to come to a place where we agreed to disagree and to at least act on that on which we could agree.  I think that was very important for our country. As I have said before, and as you know, I continue to be very concerned about what we project to the country. The Congress now has single-digit approval. They don't believe the board of directors of the United States of America is working, and I think that is of great concern to all of us as citizens, as Americans, that we can't be successful as a nation if we have so little respect from the people who we represent, or confidence that we are doing the work that they want done.  I try to convey to them, and I want to tell you, as you know, the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy from California, and I get along well. We don't always agree, obviously. Roy Blunt, who is one of my best friends, as I think some of you know, is now a Senator from Missouri but was the minority whip, and was the acting minority leader and minority whip for a period of time. He likes to say, ``Connie, Steny and I always agree when there are at least 420 other people voting the same way,'' which is to say unanimous consent essentially we agree.  Roy and I didn't agree, but when we agreed, we made things happen in a bipartisan way. Kevin McCarthy and I do the same--not as often because we are more polarized than when most of you served in this When you served in this Congress, you remember, there were real confrontations. Some of us served in the Gingrich years, and they were pretty tough years, but even in those times when you served, there was an ability, I think, to work more closely together than now exists.  John Boehner is not in the Congress because he wanted to work together, and we did on some very significant things. And John finally said: Look, if I can't get 218 on my side, I am not sure I want to be He wasn't pushed out. People who say John Boehner was pushed out are wrong. John Boehner decided to leave. He wasn't pushed out. He would have had the majority of support on his side of the aisle all the time. There was no doubt about that.[[Page H7585]]  But I think John just got frustrated about his inability to galvanize a majority. I think Mitch McConnell probably empathizes a lot with John Boehner right now. Probably all of you think so as well.

People talk about: Every 2 years, you really ought to change that. I am not sure that we ought to change it. The Founding Fathers were undoubtedly right, in my opinion. Does it cause us problems? Yes, it does. I tell my colleagues on my side: You cannot solve America's problems in 24-month cycles. What I mean by that, of course, is if all we have is thinking that goes from election to election, we won't be able to solve America's problems because they are not just subject to a 24-month solution.

881,topic-id,2401,"Mr.President, first of all, let me say to the Senator from Oregon that help is on its way. It is a very difficult thing because we don't have any idea how long this is going to last. When you stop to think about a land that is in the tropics not having electricity, it is something that is hard to imagination and to get arms around the devastation that takes place. I appreciate the fact that he has brought that up.                       Work of the Administration  Mr.President, when I watch the news, I can't help but see that the media is showing a kind of picture of Washington that really doesn't exist. The news would have the public believe that there is a lot of dysfunction in the administration, and nothing is getting done. But I can share some examples of how the government has been working to get America back in business.  In my former life, I participated for some 20 years or longer in a free enterprise business. I was making money. I was losing money. I was hiring people, doing what I thought Americans were supposed to be doing. All that time, the major problem I had was the obstruction of the Federal One of the reasons I actually ran in the first place was to try to save the free enterprise system. I never dreamed that we would end up with an administration--as well-meaning as the Obama administration was--that would be putting people out of business.  During the last administration, the Obama administration, new rules were created that had no purpose but to hinder economic growth. In fact, President Obama is the first President since Hoover not to hit a 3-percent GDP growth in any year of his  With every industry coming under scrutiny from every regulatory agency, President Obama added more regulations to the Federal Register than any other President in history. Businesses are complying with regulations, costing in the neighborhood of $2 trillion. You have to keep in mind that when you hear the businesses and corporations are paying this, it is not the businesses that are paying it. It is the public--the people who are out there, and they, through increased costs of goods and services or through taxes, are paying it.  I heard an alarming figure the other day that some 65 percent of the people in America--this is a poll that is about a week old--are opposed to any stopping of regulations in corporations. Yet they are the very ones who are paying for this fun they are having.  This administration has tried to do something about all the overregulation, all the rules that the previous administration had put in place. There are two ways you can do this. One is through Executive orders. People know what those are; that is, the President coming along and giving an Executive order that will undo damage that was done by a previous Executive order imposing a new rule on That has been taking place.  At the same time, the other way of doing it is through a CRA resolution. Not many people know what a CRA resolution is. A CRA resolution is a Congressional Review Act resolution. It started about 20 years ago and has never been used until this administration. What it does is say that if you have up to 30 Members of the Senate, you can get a CRA resolution against a rule that some administration has put in place in a certain time period. It is the way people who are elected to office, accountable to the people, can get things done and be answerable to the people, as opposed to an unelected bureaucrat who is out there imposing hardships and rules on the public.  Actually, this administration came in, and they passed 14 Congressional Review Act resolutions; that is, 14 in the first few weeks, actually. The savings from repeal of these 14 regulations were estimated to be $3.7 billion in costs and 4.2 million hours of paperwork, the most expensive of which--this is kind of interesting because I introduced a CRA resolution. It happens to be that mine was the first one to pass. So I had the first signing ceremony with our new President Trump during the initial days of his administration.  The rule was imposed by the Obama administration. It was one that would force domestic oil and gas companies to release all of the information they had in formulating their estimates and their bids in competition with maybe China or other countries, and it was putting our domestic oil and gas companies at a competitive disadvantage. This was all part of the Obama war on fossil fuels. Everyone knows that fossil fuels are oil, coal, and gas, and this was an effort to do that. We introduced a resolution repealing that. It was a CRA resolution, and it was successful. We[[Page S6183]]had our signing ceremony, and that was history.  That is 1 of 45--some Executive orders--and 1 of 14 successful CRA resolutions. In addition to the CRA resolutions, President Trump has signed 45 Executive orders with the goal of reducing redtape and cutting back on harmful administrative redtape.  Thanks to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for changing the Senate rules because, with their help, President Trump and a Republican-led Senate have been able to confirm one of the most conservative Cabinets in history, and they have been working to implement the President's pro-business, pro-jobs, pro-economic growth policy.  If you want to see the effect that this administration is having, you need only to look at the energy industry. Of course, that is to say nothing about the fact that we now have a great conservative judge. But when you look at the energy industry, it has been under attack for 8 years.  Within weeks after taking office, the Army Corps of Engineers under the Trump administration approved an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline that had been withheld by the Obama administration because of nothing more than political pressure from the far left.  The next month, the State Department issued a crossborder permit for the Keystone Again, the permit had been withheld purely for political far-left reasons.  Later the same month, the Department of the Interior lifted the coal leasing ban that the Obama administration had placed on Federal land. Federal lands have about 40 percent of the coal production in the United States, so that was just devastating to that industry. It was a killer.  Another notable win for energy came just last week out of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; that is, FERC was without a forum from February until mid-August, creating a backlog and delaying $50 million of energy infrastructure projects from moving forward. The new forum has quickly gone to work to address that backlog, improving pipelines and power agreements.  However, a decision made last week has clearly sent a message that America's energy sector is open for business again. For years, New York State had been delaying consideration of water certifications that are required for FERC approval to allow construction of several federally approved pipelines.  The Millennium Pipeline, in particular, would take natural gas 9 miles from one pipeline to a natural gas-fired electric plant, providing clean, cheap, natural gas power in New York It was delayed and denied certification simply because, again, the radical left doesn't want it.  Last week, FERC took the authority granted to them under the Clean Water Act to override New York State's denial of certification because New York had waived their authority under the law.  Section 401 of the Clean Water Act says that if a State ``refuses to act on a request for a certification within a reasonable time period (which shall not exceed 1 year) after the receipt of such request, the certification requirements . . . shall be waived with respect to such Federal application.''  With environmentalists increasingly urging States like New York, New Jersey, and Virginia to block pipelines by delaying or withholding otherwise valid certifications, these States are interfering with interstate commerce, a role that is clearly within the purview of the Federal  I applaud the administration for the progress they have made and the independent agencies for taking a stand against the gamesmanship of the radical left, environmentalist groups, and those who do their bidding by using loopholes and their official authority to block valid, compliant energy projects from safely transporting cheaper and cleaner energy across State lines.  When the government works with industry, not against it, we start to see companies unleash investments across the country. In fact, the economy has picked up since Trump and his administration have come into office with the economy growing 3 percent in just the second quarter, which is the first full quarter under the administration, and the fastest pace of growth in 2 years, according to the website called CNN  Each nomination, confirmation, or policy directive of President Trump and the Republican-led Congress signals to the business community and American workers that America is open for business again.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to address our energy industry's needs so that private investors can be utilized to deliver American products to American consumers around the world. Just this week, I introduced a bill to address the known bottleneck issues that add unnecessary delays in the FERC permitting process by identifying participating agencies early in the process and providing contract reviews and providing transparency. This is something that is just common sense.  I thank very much Senator King and his staff for working with me and my staff on this legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join us in getting these reforms into law.  I bring this up only because you would never know that this is progress that is being made in the economy through the Trump administration. Somehow that report has yet to get through.                         Tribute to David Boren  Mr.President, I have another thing in mind. A lot of people who have been around in this Senate for a while remember the name of David David Boren is from my State of He was a Senator here for quite some period of time. He went on to be the president of Oklahoma  I am kind of excited about recognizing him, especially because David Boren and I, in 1967--before any of you guys were born--were elected to the State legislature in the State of This is kind of funny because, at that time, people thought of Oklahoma as being a red Let me tell you, it wasn't a red State then. We had a House of Representatives of 100 people, and only 7 of us were Republicans; the rest were  The way it is set up in the House of Representatives in Oklahoma--it is still true today, I believe--you have two members per desk. They would have two Democrats at one desk, two Republicans at one desk. Well, it came out uneven, so the only integrated desk was ours, that of David Boren, who was a Democrat, and I, who was a  It is kind of interesting also that the first thing we did--keep in mind, this was right after we took office in January of 1967. We came to We thought we were really important at that time. We were going to testify before a committee. That committee was called the Environment and Public Works I don't remember his name, but he was a very popular Democrat from West He was, I think, the chairman of that committee.  I remember standing up and testifying before that as a junior Senator from the State of I really thought I was something. I will tell my colleagues what I was testifying about. It was right after the Johnson administration, and I was protesting Lady Bird's Highway Beautification Act of 1965--taking private property away from people and all that.  It is interesting because David Boren and I were testifying before that committee way back in January of 1967, and I ended up chairing that same committee just a few years later. So that was the beginning.  Anyway, it was kind of interesting because David Boren being a Democrat and myself being a Republican and coming from a very strong, almost entirely Democratic State, we had an individual who is the--I can't remember his name--he was secretary of the treasury for the State of So we started introducing the reforms. All the reforms in that decade were the product of David Boren, Democrat, and Republican Jim None of them ever passed, but we introduced all of these things.  So we put together a plan. We had a Governor at that time--it is not necessary to mention his name. He was a corrupt Governor, and he ended up in the penitentiary. We put together a plan of how to get him out of office. I would run for Governor as a Republican, I would win my nomination, and he would run for Governor as a Democrat, and of course he most likely[[Page S6184]]would lose--he was running against a very popular Anyway, as it turned out, he won. Coming from a solid Democratic State, I can remember calling him up and saying: What do we do now? I think I was best advised to just go out of town until the campaign was over.  Anyway, we spent time together, and we had a great time. David did a great job as the University of Oklahoma's president. He would actually teach classes. He always put students first. So he did a great job.  I would say that it is fitting that he announced his retirement this year because this is his 50th year of public service, and he leaves a legacy of dedication and hard work and public service. His influence has shaped Oklahoma more than I think he ever thought he could. His daddy was Lyle Boren, who was a very popular Democratic House Member for a long period of time, and we all at that time became very close friends.  I don't think there has been a man who loved Oklahoma more and served our State more faithfully than David  God bless you, David Enjoy your retirement.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

143,topic-id,312,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As chairman of the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet Subcommittee, I recognize the importance of judicial security needs.  Federal judges hear cases involving hardened criminals on a regular basis. Although not everyone threatens a Federal judge and not everyone is a gang member, many are. Federal judges and their families should not be at risk for simply doing their jobs.  Congress provides funding for a variety of judicial security needs by building secure court houses, staffing metal detectors at entrances, and so on, but there is a simple way to address security needs without extending taxpayer dollars. One method is to redact specific information from judicial financial disclosure reports done by the judges and other key employees. If they are to be targeted, we cannot have a judge's home address or other information that allows tracking by a criminal to, in fact, be a source of their demise.  The redaction authority has been in place since Congress began, in 1998, to allow for this, and it has been extended and expanded, in a number of cases, to include family members. The redaction process requires input and agreement from the U.Marshals  The legislation that my colleague from New York (Mr.Jeffries) and I introduced would extend the redaction authority for an additional 10 years, until December 31, 2027. There is no financial impact from this, and it serves to put judges and their families in a position they have historically been in since 1998: less at risk by this information being disclosed.  I not only urge the House to support this legislation, but after careful consideration and research, we find that this authority has not been abused, it has been properly used, and the Federal judges have earned the absolute right to this limited redaction.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.3229, which will extend for 10 years the soon expiring authority for Federal judges and judicial officers to redact from financial disclosure forms sensitive personal information that, if revealed, could compromise their safety and security.  An independent judiciary that is free of coercion is fundamental to our constitutional democracy, fundamental to[[Page H7550]]the principle of liberty and justice for all, and fundamental to the principle of equal protection under the law. Unfortunately, in this country, there are some who seek to compromise the integrity of the judicial branch through threats, harm, and harassment.  According to the U.Marshals Service, in fiscal year 2017, there has been an increase in every major recorded statistical category regarding the targeting of members of the Federal bench and judiciary employees. Failure to extend this authority will create grave security risks to judges, judiciary employees, and their families.  Each year, only a very small percentage of the financial disclosure reports filed contain an approved redaction of information. Redaction only occurs if there is a clear nexus between a security risk and the information for which redaction is sought.  Federal judges and other employees of the judicial branch routinely interact with disgruntled litigants or dangerous defendants and others who may seek to do them harm.  For example, in 2016, a disgruntled defendant was convicted of a diabolical plot to kidnap, torture, and murder U.District Judge Andrew Guilford, who presided over that defendant's wire fraud conviction.  In March of this year, the FBI reported that U.District Judge Derek Watson, who issued a temporary retaining order against the President's travel ban, has subsequently been the target of repeated violent threats.

It was in this context that athletes like Colin Kaepernick bravely chose to kneel down so that others may have the courage to stand up.  There are some who have criticized these athletes as unpatriotic, but their actions are uniquely Liberty and justice for all is an American value. Equal protection under the law is an American value. Freedom of speech and expression as embedded in the First Amendment is an American value.  Yet there is criticism coming even from folks in the White I find this ironic because this is the same group of people at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue who regularly refuse to criticize Vladimir Putin and defend Russia's interference with our election, undermining American democracy for the first time in our Nation's history.  How dare you lecture us about what is patriotic.  So I just came to the House floor to make it clear to all of the athletes across this great country who have chosen to stand up and confront injustice in our society that there are Members of the United States Congress who have your back.  Steph Curry, we have your back.  LeBron James, we have your back.  Coach Mike Tomlin, we have your back.  You stand on the shoulders of giants like Joe Louis, Wilma Rudolph, Jackie Robinson, Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, and so many others who throughout the annals of time chose to confront injustice in America to make us a better place.  Now you have taken the baton, and, thankfully, you are doing the same exact thing. We should be grateful.  God bless you, and God bless the United States of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-25-pt1-PgH7439.txt,2149,DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS EXPIRING AUTHORITIES ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,September

735,topic-id,2019,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the disasters of ObamaCare and a possible solution. It is a powerful first step--not perfect but a step that would take us off the path toward a single-payer system and put us on a path toward federalism, with greater State control but, in many respects, greater freedom for the American public.  During the last healthcare discussion and debate, I spoke with a couple, Sherry and Vern Colby from River Falls, They had a real problem: They had preexisting conditions. They were quite pleased when ObamaCare passed because their preexisting conditions, they believed, would be covered. So they signed up for ObamaCare in 2014, paid the premiums, sent in their paycheck stubs to make sure their income levels qualified for the subsidies. Then a funny thing happened when they got their tax returns in March of 2015: They had to pay back more than $15,000 in subsidies because they made $59,000. They had to cash in pretty much all of their 401(k). They had to sell their house so they wouldn't lose it in foreclosure.  I spoke with Sherry Colby today because, as we have debated the possibility of passage of Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson, we have heard a lot of demagoguery. We have heard a lot of false charges. I would like to refute a couple of those.  One of the claims of ObamaCare is it guaranteed that if you have a preexisting condition, you are free from worry, you will be covered. Well, in Sherry and Vern Colby's case, that is simply not true.  I spoke with Sherry just this afternoon. Again, they had to sell their house, and they had to cash in their 401(k). Their nightmare didn't end at that point in time because President Obama, as he left office, took short-term, limited-duration plans--that duration from 264 days down to 90 days. Now Sherry and Vern Colby are forced to buy these short-term, limited-duration plans that only last for 90 days. When I say ``forced,'' the problem they have is that they work. Vern drives milk trucks 60 hours a week. Sherry works in a florist's shop 30 hours a week. They make too much to be subsidized under They don't make enough to be able to afford the premium of $14,000 per year with a $12,500 deductible. So right now they are paying $5,500 a year, and they have a $5,000 deductible per quarter and a 70/30 copay for a short-term, limited-duration plan that can and did exclude their preexisting conditions.  Shortly after they signed up with IHC, Vern had a condition that required a hospital stay. The problem is, his preexisting condition wasn't covered under their insurance. The bill for that hospital stay was $45,000. To add insult to injury, because their short-term, limited-duration plan is not ObamaCare compliant, they are also paying the penalty. They are purchasing insurance, paying $5,500 per year, $20,000 in deductibles, a $45,000 hospital bill, and they are still penalized by the American Government under  Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson maintains the provision of the guaranteed issue, covering people with preexisting conditions. There are all kinds of charges that somehow ObamaCare has guaranteed coverage for those individuals and Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson would not.  Personally, I believe Governors, State legislators, and the people in the State of Wisconsin will be far more concerned about Sherry and Vern Colby and will have innovative solutions, such as Wisconsin's high-risk pool or Maine's invisible high-risk pool, to actually bring down premiums so the Colbys can actually afford insurance without having to quit their jobs.  But that is not the main reason I came to the floor today. While sitting in that chair or watching TV over the weekend, listening to people's speeches, I have heard repeatedly from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talking about Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson that it is going to destroy Medicaid as we know it, that it will be slashing spending in Medicaid--massive, deep cuts.  Let me go to a couple of charts.  This first chart really has nothing to do with healthcare--except it has everything to do with healthcare. What this chart shows is the CBO projection of deficits over the next 30 years by decade. CBO made the projections as a percentage of the Nobody understands percentages--we don't buy hamburgers with percentages--so we converted those percentages of GDP into dollars. According to our best calculations, CBO projects almost a $10 trillion deficit over the next 10 years; the second decade, $37 trillion; the third decade, $82 trillion, for a whopping total of a $129 trillion deficit over the next 30 years. That would be added to our $20 trillion worth of debt.  There are a number of ways of describing this deficit. I am putting up two right now. What is it composed of? Well, if you take a look at revenue versus outlays, the deficit is composed of about an $18 trillion deficit in Social Security alone. In other words, Social Security over the next 30 years will pay out $18 trillion more in benefits than it brings to the payroll tax; Medicare, $39 trillion. Interest on the debt over that same 30 years will be $65 trillion for a whopping total of $122 trillion of deficits over the next 30 years. That explains 95 percent of the deficit.  Another way of looking at that deficit is this: Over the next 30 years, our revenue will equal almost $200 trillion--$199 trillion. Outlays for Social Security will be $69 trillion; Medicare, $55 trillion; Medicaid and ObamaCare $32 trillion, for a subtotal of $156 trillion. If you add $65 trillion interest on the debt, we are already exceeding our revenue.  You will notice that there is no money at all for any agencies, for national defense, for any other welfare programs. All the money is consumed by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare, and interest on the debt. This is clearly unsustainable.  Let's talk about cuts. What would a cut really look like? Well, this is the[[Page S5879]]truth in terms of what we are projected to spend on Medicare, Medicaid, ObamaCare, and what we would spend under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-If you go back to the year 2009, we were spending slightly more than $200 billion for Medicaid alone. This last year, we were spending about $438 billion. We have basically doubled spending in just the last 9 years. According to projections, by the end of this time period, we will be spending over $700 billion per year on ObamaCare and Medicaid combined. Graham-Cassidy would spend a little less than that--not much less.  Let me take a look at what a real cut would be. There are no cuts; you will notice spending never declines year over year--not once. It continues to grow year over year, not that far from the projections.  This is what a real cut looks like. Many of my colleagues have talked about and campaigned on something they call the penny plan--a way to rein in out-of-control Federal spending by doing something that seems pretty reasonable, which is to take any government program and just reduce a dollar's worth of spending by just a penny. It would be a 1-percent cut per year. If we were to do that to ObamaCare and Medicaid, you would see what a real cut looks like--a pretty minor cut, the type of cut many people have suggested under the penny plan, but that is what a real cut looks like. What Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson does is not a cut; it is just a slight reduction in the rate of growth and spending.  Again, oftentimes colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about drastic cuts. Well, let me detail what I would consider to be a possibly drastic cut. Let's say, rather than just 1 percent a year, we reduce spending by 5 percent a year or 10 percent a year. You know, I would agree with folks on the other side; if we were proposing those types of cuts, I would say that is slashing spending. I would say that would be a massive or draconian cut. But, again, that is not what we are doing. We are just slightly reducing spending over the next 10 years.  Let's look at this a little bit differently. Let's take a look at cumulative spending. If you just take cumulative spending year over year and add it up--our current projection on ObamaCare and Medicaid--we would spend $5,688 billion; that is, $5.67 trillion. The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposed spending is the green line, $5.44 trillion or a reduction of $226 billion over 10 years, a 3.99 percent decrease--not draconian, not massive, not slashing. It is a small, slight reduction in the growth of spending.  Let's take a look at what would happen if we just adhered to the penny plan in terms of cumulative spending. Again, this would be a real cut--1 percent per year. We would take the current law at $5.67 trillion. The penny plan would actually reduce that to $4.2 trillion, and you would save $1.5 trillion for about 26 percent in savings. That would be a real cut that would constrain the growth of entitlements so we can further reduce the mortgage of our children by just a little bit.  Why is this important? Again, to put things in perspective, over the next 10 years--this is blown up from our first chart--the projected deficit, according to CBO is close to $10 trillion--$9.6 trillion. What we are proposing under Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson is a $226 billion reduction in the rate of growth of spending on Medicare or on Medicaid and ObamaCare--a 2.4-percent reduction in relationship to the $9.6 trillion projected deficit. Is that massive? Is that draconian? I don't believe so.  The types of controls we need to start enacting, if we are ever going to stop mortgaging our children's future, would be more like the penny plan, but even there, you can see how inadequate that is, based on the problem. The penny plan would reduce spending by $1.48 trillion--about a 15.4-percent reduction to our $9.6 trillion deficit.  Let me conclude by talking about the fact that here in Washington, DC, here in Congress, we are not very good at solving problems, partly because not very many Members or their staffs have ever served in the private sector. They don't really understand people like Vern or Sherry Colby, who, as President Bill Clinton said, ``are out there busting it,'' working 60 to 70 hours a week. Their premiums have doubled and, in many cases, tripled. Their coverage is cut in half. They can't afford They don't understand how businesses are struggling to pay the premiums when they provide healthcare. They don't understand it, and what they certainly don't understand is the problem-solving process: admitting you have a problem, defining that problem, gathering the information, doing the root cause analysis, and then, based on that careful analysis, based on the information, setting achievable goals and designing legislation, then designing the solution.  We haven't been honest with ourselves in this body. We haven't come to grips with why premiums have doubled and, in many cases, tripled. It was because of the faulty design of ObamaCare--the fact that we are asking 5 to 6 percent of the American population to shoulder the full burden of covering people with preexisting, high-cost conditions. There is a way of addressing this, but we have to be honest. We have to set aside the rhetoric. We have to set aside the demagoguery.  We have to take that first step of loosening the ties of this one-size-fits-all model here in Washington, DC, letting the States innovate--like Wisconsin, like Maine's invisible high-risk pool--to actually bring down premiums. In Maine, when they enacted invisible high-risk pools, premiums for young people were cut to one-third of what they had been under guaranteed issue. For older folks, they were cut in half. It is possible to do this if we are honest and if we are courageous.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

179,topic-id,3568,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the debate this week over the Graham-Cassidy proposal with respect to healthcare that is being considered by the body. I have high regard for both of these colleagues. I serve with each of them on different committees. I oppose the bill and want to talk a little bit about why I do but more specifically about an aspect of the bill that I find puzzling.  It is no surprise to me that there are many in this body who would like to repeal and replace the Affordable Care When the Democrats were in the majority for my first 2 years in the Senate, I often sat in the chair where the Presiding Officer sits. I heard a lot of people giving speeches on the floor. I was in the Chair during an all-night sort of filibuster by the Senator from Texas about the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care I get that there are arguments about it. While I support the Affordable Care Act--I strongly did in 2010 and still do--I do want to work with my colleagues to find solutions to improve healthcare. There are differences of opinion about it.  One thing I never heard during all of the speeches that I heard, either as a presider or paying attention on the floor, was Members getting up and saying they wanted to dramatically cut That is not anything that anybody has filibustered about. That is not anything that people speak about.  When President Trump campaigned, he said: I am unique on the forum right now of all these candidates in that I will not cut the Medicaid When the Senate started to consider versions of the ObamaCare repeal and replacement over the summer, after the House acted, what interested me was not the portions of the bill that attempted to replace the Affordable Care Act but the significant changes to the Medicaid Program that were never advertised. There was never this discussion: We are going to repeal ObamaCare, and we want to cut It was always about  I am puzzled, standing here today, considering a Graham-Cassidy proposal that not only would be a fundamental change of repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act but also contains a very significant revision of Medicaid that would hurt my State and would hurt a lot of people I care about. That never seems to be acknowledged, and I am puzzled about why.  As to the Graham-Cassidy proposal, again, I respect my colleagues, and I think they are putting it on the table because they think it would be preferable to the current system. I don't question their motives. I was a Governor, and the notion of block grants and discretion and dollars back to the State can be a good thing. Quickly, before I get to the Medicaid piece, the problem is if you take the Graham-Cassidy proposal, it takes the dollars that are currently being delivered to the States through the Affordable Care Act, shrinks them by about $240 billion over 10 years, and then eliminates them. Even with the shuffling of the deck on a block grant that might benefit one State over another, you can't take $240 billion out of the system, in my view, without making people's premiums go up.  The money that is being delivered to States is largely delivered to help people either get a tax credit premium or pay out-of-pocket costs. If you take that much out of the system over 10 years, people's premiums are going to go up. That breaks a promise of President Trump's, who said that nobody is[[Page S6104]]going to lose coverage and nobody is going to pay more. People will pay more, if Graham-Cassidy passes, in the short term, over the next 10 years. Then, when all of the money expires after 10 years, they will pay a lot more. I oppose that.  Second, I also oppose the way this bill treats preexisting conditions. By allowing States to waive essential health benefits, it might be technically true to say that you could get a policy even if you had a preexisting condition, but the insurance company could say to you: I will write you a policy, but you are a diabetic; so the policy will not cover insulin. Or I will write you a policy, but you are a woman of childbearing age; the policy will not cover maternity care.  If the policy doesn't cover your preexisting condition, then preexisting conditions are not protected. To my read of the 141-page bill--which has been revised a little bit, or so I hear, since I got the most recent version Friday to read it over the weekend--that is exactly what States can do. Because 43 of 50 States did not protect people with preexisting conditions before the Affordable Care Act, handing this power back to the States and allowing them to waive these benefits, I think, would jeopardize the tens of millions of Americans who do have preexisting conditions.  Finally, I don't like the fact that the current bill, as I understand it, ends funding for Planned Planned Parenthood doesn't have a line item in the budget. To the extent that Planned Parenthood gets funding, it gets funding for this reason: It provides primary medical care to women who are Medicaid-eligible, and they get services at Planned Parenthood that are Medicaid-eligible to be reimbursed.  Since Federal funding cannot be used for abortion services, the defunding of Planned Parenthood basically says that if you serve a woman who chooses to go to you for her primary healthcare and she is Medicaid eligible, we will not pay you for that service. That seems, to me, to be wrong. If women are choosing to go to Planned Parenthood, and they think that is the best place to go for primary care, why would we disable them and force them to go elsewhere by disabling Planned Parenthood from reimbursement?  All right. Those are some challenges I have, but I want to get to the real guts of my concern, which is the effort to go after  The Graham-Cassidy bill--and it is similar to the skinny repeal bill and other bills that were on the table that the Senate considered--goes into the Medicaid Program that was passed in 1965, which was long before the Affordable Care Act--long before it--and it puts caps on the program to restrict the growth of Medicaid spending. The estimate is that over the next 10 years, it will take $1.2 billion out of Yet no description of Graham-Cassidy that I have ever heard a sponsor mention and no description of any of the bills that have been pending on the Senate floor say we are going to repeal ObamaCare and that we want to go into the Medicaid Act of 1965 and dramatically cut  Why is that never made plain as it is a core feature of these bills? I would argue, it is sort of the core within the Trojan horse of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act to go in and change Yet it is never advertised that way, and it is never explained. You could have put a bill on the table to repeal the Affordable Care Act and could have left Medicaid alone. You would have touched the Medicaid expansion that was part of the Affordable Care Act, certainly, but you could have left the core Medicaid Program alone. Why was there an effort to both repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid but not to say we are cutting Medicaid?  Maybe it is because, if you were to say that, you would directly counter a promise the President made, ``I am not going to cut Medicaid.'' Maybe there is a concern about, boy, we are taking $1.2 billion out of Medicaid, and we are about to come up with a big tax proposal that might give tax breaks for the wealthiest. We do not want to take money away from a program that is for the poor, elderly, disabled, or children and then immediately turn right around and increase the deficit by a tax cut.  I find this to be the big mystery of this entire debate, in that every proposal that is on the floor makes massive cuts to the core Medicaid Program even though it has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Nobody ever acknowledges it, and nobody ever explains it, but I am here to both say it is real and to challenge it.  Who are Medicaid recipients? I think there tends to be a little bit of a misconception about who gets Medicaid in this country.  In Virginia, 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are children. The proposal, under Graham-Cassidy, calls for a $1.2 billion cut in Medicaid in Virginia over the next 10 years and a $120 billion cut in Medicaid nationally. In Virginia, 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are kids. One in three births in Virginia--one in three births every year--is compensated by Two in three nursing home residents are supported by There are a lot of people with disabilities in Virginia who are supported by The home and community-based waiver programs, under the core Medicaid bill, support nearly 50,000 Virginians in community settings of their own choosing. Medicaid is also the primary payer for behavioral health services--mental health treatment, substance abuse prevention treatment.  That is what this bill goes after even though that Medicaid funding has nothing to do with ObamaCare, nothing to do with the Affordable Care So reducing Medicaid spending by the $120 billion-plus over 10 years or more in the out-years would not hand more power to No, it would dramatically limit the States' ability to provide the kinds of services that are needed by our most vulnerable--kids, seniors in nursing homes, and people with disabilities.  Later today, I am going to have a meeting in my office with folks who have communicated with me over the course of this debate--really since January when I was added to the HELP They are coming in to tell me how frightened they are about what will happen if Graham-Cassidy passes.  Samantha and Justin McGovern are parents. They have a girl, Josephine, who is 1\1/2\ years old. They are from Springfield, which is right here in Northern Josephine is about 18 months old, and she was very premature--24 weeks gestation. She was 1 pound 12 ounces when she was born. That is the size of six sticks of butter. That is how tiny this little girl was. She was hospitalized, after her premature birth, for 407 days, across three units, in two hospitals, in two She is home and thriving now, but she is supported by a ventilator 24/7 via a tracheostomy, and she is fed primarily through a gastrointestinal tube.  Her mother Samantha writes:       We are fortunate that we get to focus on her health rather      than medical crippling bills. We estimate that her hospital      stay would have exceeded $4 million, and the cost for her      monthly medical expenses (baseline . . . not sick) is about      $26,000 a month (if we didn't have insurance or Medicaid      coverage).  Here is what she writes:       We are fortunate we have amazing private insurance through      our employer. However, if it were legal to have annual or      lifetime caps, I don't know what would happen to us. Part of      our Medicaid covers private duty nursing so that we can sleep      and go to work. Without nursing, one of us would have to      leave their job, and there would be no way we could continue      to live in our house [or pay our insurance]. If there are      caps and we lost our insurance, we would depend on Medicaid      even more than we do now, and we would have less coverage      than we currently have, making it virtually impossible for      Josephine to continue to be followed by the doctors who saved      her life.       Basically, if [this bill] passes, life as we know it could      fall apart. I don't know how we would be able to support our      daughter, how we could keep her home and not in an      institution. She deserves to be home. She deserves to have      every opportunity to thrive.  I met Rebecca Wood at a forum in She has a 5-year-old daughter, I met them in  Charlie's mom says:       Charlie . . . is five-years-old and loves playing outdoors,      live music, things with numbers, and anything with animals.      Charlie was born more than three months early and, as a      result, is developmentally delayed. Currently, Charlie      requires physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT),      and speech therapy. She has a . . . (feeding tube) and wears      orthotics. Affordable care is the difference between      independence as an adult or a permanent disability. Due to      a three month NICU stay [when she was born], Charlie would      have exceeded her lifetime cap before she ever came home      for the first time.[[Page S6105]]     Then, she would have been uninsurable due to her birth      being a preexisting condition. Also, Institutional      Medicaid paid for a large portion of her NICU stay. Upon      discharge, a Medicaid waiver helps with out of pocket      costs and provides services that [our private] insurance      doesn't cover. She would not be where she is without any      of these things. The changes in the proposed healthcare      bill would cause Charlie to drastically lose access to      these services. Receiving healthcare services is her      chance to leave a life-limiting disability behind.  The last story I will tell is of Eric Young, from Norfolk, on behalf of his son,  Eric has major concerns about Graham-His son, Ethan, has what is called heterotaxy syndrome, which is an incredibly complex congenital heart defect. There are seven defects that are combined in this brave and thriving youngster. Eric said that Ethan has had two open heart surgeries and is having his third in  Eric writes:       I anticipate his healthcare charges to surpass the $1M mark      before the end of the year. It's not an ``if'' for Ethan--     it's when. ``He'' will have spent more on healthcare in his      first 2 years of life than most people will during their      entire lives. He's the outlier. But he's exactly the type of      kid that needs protecting.       Dealing with such a critical issue when your baby is first      born is overwhelming--having to worry about whether or not      your decisions to save your child will affect whether he . .      . [can] even obtain health insurance when he gets to be an      adult is just wrong.  Eric writes about the ACA, as Eric works in the healthcare industry:       The ACA is not perfect--it needs to be changed. I work in      healthcare--so I have the perspective of seeing it from my      job and as a parent. But, we need a real bill that is well      thought out, not something just for the sake of passing.  I wanted to come and really just talk about these youngsters. One out of every three children born in Virginia is able to be born in a hospital because of Medicaid, and 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are kids. If you were a child and you needed a wheelchair, your private insurance likely would not cover it. If you get a wheelchair, it is usually Medicaid that pays for it. If you go to school and then you get an individualized education plan and your public school system provides you some services, it is Medicaid that is usually paying the school system to reimburse it for the services that are provided.  My wife used to be a juvenile court judge, and this was the situation she would face all the time with kids in the court. It would be a heartbreaking situation, but there was an answer. You would have teenagers who were working so hard to be successful--not in court because of violating the law, not in court because of trouble but in court because their families were so dysfunctional nobody could take care of them. As a judge, my wife would have to grapple with this: Where is this child going to live? Who is going to help this child get to school? This kid is trying to succeed. Do I have to put the child in a group home or institutionalize the child because there is no family support there?  What my wife could do as a juvenile court judge--and this happens all over Virginia every day and all over the country every day--is say: The child is capable of success, but the family is dysfunctional. May I send a counselor to the home? May I find an aunt or uncle, and maybe with some support of counseling, provide some stability so this child does not have to be institutionalized and can be successful? When my wife would order that, it was Medicaid that was paying for it.  Medicaid pays for your birth, Medicaid pays for your wheelchair, and Medicaid pays for the services a local school system will provide so you can have a life of independence. If your whole world is falling apart around you and you are doing everything you can to succeed, Medicaid can actually pay for counseling so you can keep it together and graduate from high school and go on and go to college and be successful.  Medicaid is advancing these challenged kids toward lives of independence and success. Yet the bill that is on the floor before us would cut, by the most recent estimate, $120 billion out of Medicaid over the next 10 years and more beyond. Why? Why is that not acknowledged? Why would you use the bill to cut Medicaid when all of the rhetoric about it is that we have to repeal the Affordable Care Act?  I think the right answer to this question is just staring us in the face, and it was what we gave Senator McCain a standing ovation for in July when he came back after getting his tough diagnosis. He came back, and he said: Look, healthcare is just too important. It is just too important. It is the most important expenditure anybody ever makes. It is the biggest sector of the American economy. It is the kind of thing that keeps parents up at night, worrying about what is going to happen to their children tomorrow or in 20 years, when the parents are deceased, and they want to know the children can have independent lives.  We just cannot afford to get this wrong, and the answer about getting it right is staring us right in the face. Let the HELP Committee, on which I serve--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--and let the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid and Medicare, take up everybody's ideas: the Graham-Cassidy bill and Bernie Sanders' bill. I have a bill about reinsurance, but it is so wonky it is never going to be on a bumper sticker. I think it would be a good bill, but I have not been able to have a hearing on it.  Let the committees that are of a Republican majority but with Democrats who know some things about healthcare take up these bills, hear from the parents, hear from the hospitals, hear from the doctors, and come up with a bipartisan set of solutions that will make healthcare better, not worse.  We were on the verge of doing that in the HELP We had 4 hearings with about 20 witnesses. We not only had committee members involved, but Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray did a good thing--they opened up a coffee before every hearing and said: Hey, if you are not on the committee but you want to meet these witnesses and hear what they have to say, come and talk and ask them questions. We had over 50 Senators participate. We were working on a bipartisan bill and basically had a handshake deal last week to stabilize the individual insurance market for a couple of years. In a deliberate way, in a careful way, we considered Republican and Democratic ideas for improving health insurance.  Then, last Wednesday, the President tweeted out, in working with the Speaker and the majority leader, that they did not want the bipartisan effort to go forward. We have to push the Graham-Cassidy bill--the bill that is about the repeal of ObamaCare but that also has within the Trojan horse these massive cuts to Medicaid that will hurt kids.  I don't know why we had to set aside the bipartisan effort. I don't know why we had to submarine the good-faith work of the committee under the leadership of a great chair and a great ranking member. It is my hope that at the end of the week, we will have defeated the Graham-Cassidy bill and that we will go back to being the Senate we should be.  I will just say what I have said a couple of times on this floor. This is one we cannot afford to get wrong. The parents of these kids already have enough to worry about. Why would we make it harder on them? We do not have to. We can be better than that. That is what I ask we do.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cruz). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6097-9.txt,2176,REMEMBERING CHARLES F. KNIGHT,2017.0,26.0,September
165,topic-id,3286,"Mr.Speaker, during the August recess, I organized a district field hearing to hear firsthand accounts from America's workers, my constituents, on NAFTA's disastrous job impacts. These voices must be heard and listened to as our Nation renegotiates These real stories are the people who live the impacts of Washington's agreements.  I thank the Local United Auto Workers Chapter 1250 for graciously hosting us, a region that lost over 14,500 jobs after NAFTA's passage to Mexico and to Latin  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the testimony of Amy Hanauer of Policy Matters Ohio, Donnie Blatt of the United Steelworkers, and Mark Payne of the United Auto                    Amy Hanauer, Policy Matters Ohio       Representative Kaptur and others, thank you for the      opportunity to testify today alongside these strong community      leaders. I'm Amy Hanauer and I run Policy Matters Ohio, a      policy research institute dedicated to creating a more      vibrant equitable, sustainable, and inclusive Find us      online at www.policymattersohio.org.       Trade and jobs in Ohio: Key principles to improve outcomes      for workers       NAFTA and other trade agreements have eliminated jobs in      Ohio and the United Manufacturing remains an      essential part of Ohio's economy, despite its downturn. Smart      policy can strengthen Ohio manufacturing while making our      economy greener and stronger Some key recommendations      include:       Invest in infrastructure, particularly clean energy       Invest in solar panels and wind turbines       Structure these projects carefully, prioritizing good jobs      and diverse workers       Support American manufacturing through proven programs       Support manufacturing extension programs       Buy American when spending public dollars       Support smart worker training       Improve trade agreements       Increase worker protections       Improve environmental standards       Eliminate special courts       As we have long documented at Policy Matter, the North      American Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements have      not accomplished what they were supposed to in Our      current trade rules favor multi-national corporations and      their investor over workers and citizens. As a result, these      policies have reduced the quantity and quality of domestic      jobs, thereby exacerbating wealth inequality. Many      multinational corporations that once employed people here      have instead located in places with lower wages, fewer      environmental regulations, and weaker labor regulations.      NAFTTA rules made that shift easier.       One reason these deals have been so destructive is that      they transfer power away from citizens and to international      investors. They bar nations, states, and cities from enacting      labor and environmental policies that protect the public.      They block local governments from using policy to boost      demand for domestic products, such as local sourcing.       NAFTA was promoted as being broadly helpful to Americans      and our trading partners. But the economist Susan Helper      recently testified that NAFTA slowed wage growth in U.     industries and regions. This hurt not just manufacturing      workers, but also service employees, as displaced      manufacturing workers sought jobs in restaurants and retail      and as laid-off workers had less to[[Page H7519]]     spend in the economy. In Mexico as well, wages stayed mostly      flat even though productivity increased. Mexican      manufacturing wages remain well under 20% of U.     manufacturing wages.       The Economic Policy Institute found that NAFTA cost the      U.683,000 jobs from 1994 to 2010. Manufacturing, as a      sector, lost the most, 60.8 percent. Geographically, Midwest      states like Ohio took the hardest hit. NAFTA also displaced      Mexican small farmers and business owners, and did not raise      wages relative the U.Despite that, the treaty became a      model for the World Trade Organization, China trade      normalization, and other deals As a result of all of these,      economist Jeff Faux estimates an additional net loss of 2.7      million U.jobs and economist Josh Bivens found that the      typical American with just high school degree loses $1,800 a      year.       Manufacturing has declined, but remains an essential part      of Ohio's economy. One in eight Ohio employees works in      manufacturing. We had 687,000 manufacturing workers in 2015:      only California and Texas have more. Average wages of $1,119      a week were 24.9 percent higher than in other sectors. Ohio      manufacturers contributed $108 billion to the economy in      2015, 17.8 percent of the total for the state. So that sector      is responsible for one in every six dollars and one in every      eight jobs in The typical worker with a high school      diploma and no college earns $2.99 more per hour in      manufacturing.       While the sector has generally lost employment over the      past several decades and in the most recent recession, some      signs point to a partial recovery. Good policy, including      trade policy, can make this more likely. There are clear      things we can do to improve policy so that workers and the      environment on all sides of the border are better protected.       At Policy Matters, we recommend three large policy      priorities to address these issues:       Invest in infrastructure, especially energy: America's      infrastructure is crumbling around us and we are completely      underinvested in infrastructure that would reduce energy use      and address other environmental problems. We should get to      work now, upgrading, maintain, and building infrastructure      that would strengthen our communities and make our planet      more sustainable, and we should make sure that American      products are used throughout these projects. To name a few      priorities:       We should install solar panels on every public building in      the United States, buying from American companies and having      unionized tradespeople do the installation. Right here in      Cleveland there are entrepreneurs selling solar panels and      they argue that even here in snowy Cleveland, many      residential solar installations now pay for themselves in      less than a decade and commercial systems will pay for      themselve in less than six years. Representative Kaptur is a      longtime champion of this approach, and Toledo, with its      extensive glass-making history, has a strong supply chain      that could play a key role in this work.       We should be installing wind turbines wherever appropriate,      using Ohio's substantial supply chain to produce component      parts for these turbines. Here in Cleveland, we continue to      want to see the Lake Erie Economic Development Company      project build the first fresh water wind farm in the country      on Lake We got some great news just this week that this      project cleared another hurdle and is moving forward--but      movement has been much slower than needed because public      policy at the federal and state level just down no      incentivize this kind of job-creating energy-generating      investment.       These projects should be structured carefully. There are      sound principles at the website millionsofjobs.org that I      encourage you to look at, but some of the elements we support      include supporting direct public investment, not tax      giveaways for corporate subsidies and making sure that these      projects are union-built, have inclusive workforces that      represent the diversity of the communities in which they're      being done, and have worker and environmental protections. SA      mentioned, all of these projects should pay decent wages,      should source from U.made products, and should prioritize      the needs of disadvantaged communities--both urban and rural.      Finally, these projects should be paid for through fair,      progressive taxes so that the wealthiest Americans and giant      corporations who reap the greatest economic benefit from      public goods pay their fair share.       Support American manufacturing through proven programs:       Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEPs) help      manufacturers work together to solve problems and find      solutions to assist their sector. They assist with research      and development, commercialization, joint marketing and      branding, worker training, identifying new technology, share      investments like makerspaces, and reshoring. The federal      government should deepen investments in Instead      President Trump's budget proposal threatens to entirely      eliminate this modest but successful program. Similarly, the      manufacturing innovation institutes that have been so      successful, including one in Youngstown, face 70% cuts in the      Trump budget.       Buy American: We should Buy America provisions for all      public spending at all levels of government. Senators Rob      Portman and Sherrod Brown have both voiced support for these      important provisions and I would urge you to join in that      support. The Trump Administration should apply Buy America to      all federally-funded infrastructure projects. President      Trump's intent in this area is not entirely clear and we      should encourage him to make good on promise he has made to      support American products. While Buy America rules apply to      some federal infrastructure programs, many taxpayer-funded      projects still lack rules requiring the use of American-made      projects. Brown's proposed legislation would ensure Buy      America rules apply to all federally-assisted projects.       Invest in worker training: The Workforce Investment and      Opportunity Act, WIOA, trains and educates workers, focusing      on career pathways and apprenticeships. By incorporating a      strong understanding of the labor market, WIOA is      transforming the workforce system for those who face      significant barriers to employment. The act pushes the public      sector to better serve low-skilled, low-income adults so they      can achieve not just self-sufficiency, but real economic      mobility. Ohio trains have been working hard to take      advantage of these new approaches. For Ohio workers who      face barriers to employment and tough job markets, it's      essential that we all deliver. Yet, this program too is on      the chopping block under the Trump The      Trump budget calls for cuts of approximately $1 billion      from the WIOA program. The cuts represent about a 40      percent reduction from current funding levels and would      have devastating impacts on states and local communities      seeking to address the kill needs of businesses and      jobseekers. Instead of cutting WIOA, we should be      enhancing it.       Improve trade agreements. This encompasses three primary      provisions.       Increase worker protections. NAFTA has reduced bargaining      power for workers in both the U.and Workers and      their representatives have little ability to object to      sweatshop conditions or labor law violations. At most they      can call for consultations that have no enforcement      mechanisms. Investors have much more power to object and much      stronger mechanisms to do so. Worker representatives from all      countries in an agreement should be brought in to propose      standards. I encourage this committee to consul the AFL-CIO      (2017) and the Roosevelt Institute (Tucker, 2017) about how      best to remedy this in renegotiation.       Improve environmental protection. Environmental protections      in NAFTA are relegated to side agreements with no enforcement      provisions. This is why we've seen more use of polluting      fossil fuels, less protection of greenspace and forests, and      more deeply problematic mining since Other testimony      today provides more detail on how best to address      environmental concerns, but minimally, those who breathe the      air, drink the water, and suffer from global warming should      have as much power as multination corporations to raise their      issues. (350.org et. Al, 2017)       Eliminate special courts for investors. NAFTA established      special courts where firms can challenge government policies      that affect their investments. These ``investor-state dispute      settlement'' (ISDS) mechanisms undermine democracy and      national sovereignty. This system should be eliminated so      that citizens again have the ability to advocate for the laws      they think will best protect their communities.       In sum, there is much that federal policy can do to create      fair trade, to promote American manufacturing, and to improve      job quality and availability. We decide the kind of economy      we want to have and we can choose one that does more for our      families, communities, and planet. We appreciate your      interest in exploring and further those policies.                                  ____Donnie Blatt, Assistant to the Director, United Steelworkers--District                                    1       I would like to thank the sponsors for holding this event,      UAW Local 1250 and its officers and of course our great      Congresswoman Marcy Congresswoman Kaptur has been a      great public servant for many years and has been a great      friend to the United Steelworkers, not only in her      Congressional District but all over Ohio and our I      want to thank her personally for her role in the re-     negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement      (NAFTA). The United Steelworkers have been involved in the      trade debate since NAFTA was incepted in 1994 and we are      happy for include our voice going forward to again try to      make trade competitive and fair for all workers, not just in      the United States, but for the workers of our trading      partners as well.       As an International Union that represents workers in a wide      range of sectors, not just steel but aluminum, tire and      rubber, glass, paper, auto parts, fabrication, public sector      and many more. We have a wide range of knowledge on trade and      how trade affects not only the U.workers, but also the      communities where they live. The biggest problem with NAFTA      and similar trade agreements is that it allowed for multi-     national corporations to shift jobs wherever workers can be      exploited and environmental regulations are the weakest. Even      with the promises of great economic growth for all the U.     Labor Department certified nearly 1 million manufacturing      jobs has been lost just with the NAFTA agreement alone.       With NAFTA and other NAFTA-style trade policies such as      Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China (PNTR), the      Central[[Page H7520]]     America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and the Korea-U.Free      Trade Agreement (KORUS), the United States has closed roughly      60,000 manufacturing facilities here at home. To put things      into perspective, this represents 3 times the number of      people that live here in Brook Park, If you would go      around Brook Park today, every man you would see would be      equal to 3 manufacturing facilities closed, for every woman      you would see would be equal to 3 manufacturing facilities      closed and for every child you would see would be equal to 3      manufacturing facilities closed. The 60,000 closed facilities      equates to around 5 million lost manufacturing jobs. This      number represents the entire population of the states of      Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota      combined. It's not just about manufacturing jobs, the U.     has also experienced job loss in the sectors of computer      programming, call centers, engineering and service sector      jobs as well and many other employment sectors. In Ohio      alone, since NAFTA, we have lost over 300,000 manufacturing      jobs which is more than every man woman and child that lives      in the city of       Along with the jobs that are lost directly in      manufacturing, there are effects to the local community.      First, because manufacturing jobs typically pay more than      other jobs in the area, when they are lost there is a natural      downward pressure that is put on wages and benefits to      remaining jobs in the immediate area. Secondly, the      combination of the lost manufacturing jobs and the downward      pressure on the remaining jobs means less money for the      community tax base, which affects the schools, police and      fire departments, roads and bridges and other public      services. This means the public sector workers are left      struggling to maintain a decent standard of living for their      families. Donald Trump has been right to highlight NAFTA and      the impact it has had on our trade deficit. Yet his      administration has failed to propose the bold changes needed      to properly replace NAFTA, reduce our trade deficit, and      create more manufacturing jobs that would raise wages for      workers at home and abroad, as was promised.       There are conditions needed in future trade agreements that      the Trump Administration has not committed to, to make trade      fair and a level playing field. First, we a strong and      enforceable labor and environmental standard that will not      only lift wages and protect jobs here at home, but will lift      working conditions abroad. So far the Trump Administration      only seeks to use the weak and unenforceable standards from      previous agreements. Second, we ned to end investor state      protections that make it easier for multi-national      corporations to shift jobs overseas and end investor state      dispute settlements that allow corporations to sue the United      States taxpayers because of a law that may protect its      citizens yet may increase corporate production costs. Third,      we need stronger rules of origin laws and close the back door      that allows parts made in China and Vietnam and assembled in      the United States and labeled made in the USA in order to get      tariff relief protection. Tariff deduction should not be      granted unless the majority of the product is made here at      home. Lastly, we need to end the NAFTA ban on ``Buy America''      so tax dollars can be used as much as possible to create jobs      that local communities desperately need. The White House plan      to renegotiate NAFTA is vague on these four points. If the      NAFTA renegotiations process is going to benefit American      workers we have to hold the White House more accountable for      these promised changes and more.       Finally, the NAFTA renegotiations cannot be done behind      closed doors with corporate advisors dictating the terms of      the This creates too many conflicts of interests.      They must be transparent and exposed to public scrutiny. The      United Steelworkers stand ready to lend their voice and      resources to ensure these points are part of any NAFTA      renegotiations. Thank You Congressman Kaptur for your work      and your consideration.                                  ____                       NAFTA Hearing, Mark Payne       I am here to talk about manufacturing in Cleveland and the      effect NAFTA has had on our At one time our Site had      over 14,000 workers. Our Aluminum Plant phased out 2005 and      the equipment was loaded up and sent to Cifunza,       Our Casting Plant phased out in 2010 and its work was sent      to Mexico and Tupy, Engine Plant 2 Phased out in 2012      and is now sitting idle. This Plant won the Shingo Award for      best quality!       What is the common denominator here? Bad Trade      Agreements!!!!       We battled against the EPA Restrictions in the Casting      We fought against low wages from other countries.       How do you compete against poverty wages? Against lax EPA      standards from other countries? Against a lack of investment      in America?       Across from our Union Hall once stood our Casting Plant, it      is now just an open field . . . Was it dirty work, yes, but      it was our work!!!       Our workers know the effects of a bad Trade Agreement!       But, we did not have a Level Playing field!       Trade Agreements seeks to drive down our wages in a race to      the bottom. The current Mexican auto worker wage has even      fallen under NAFTA, from $3.95 an hour to $2.93 an hour.       With fair competition we have proven that we will excel in      the global marketplace. But we must have a living wage for a      fair day of work. We must invest in       The problem is our Trade agreements ``perception'' of      progress, without making any. The problem is our trade      agreements reward Companies that take work out of       Are the Trade agreements unlocking the opportunities for      America or are we just widening the lane for our jobs to      leave America?       Trades Agreements has cost Ohio over 323,000 manufacturing      jobs. Under NAFTA the trade imbalance in the auto sector has      grown from $3.5 billon in 1993 to $45.1 billion in 2016.       Ford will say that they were only following their ``Way      Forward'' For Cleveland NAFTA has been a job      killing strategy.       No one can tell me that low wages mixed with lax EPA      standards was not a part of Ford's ``Way Forward'' decision      to relocate our work.       Nothing stings worse than having your jobs moved to another      country produce the product you used to make, and have that      same product brought back into this Country for us to buy.       In Cleveland, we are slowly coming back, we produce the 3.5      and 3.7 V-6 Ecoboost engines and we were able to accomplish a      ``reverse NAFTA', bring work from Spain to Cleveland when we      launched a new 4 cyl engine. We are also slated to produce      the engine from the New Ranger/Bronco vehicles coming out in      2019.       Work coming back to Cleveland is like Lebron James coming      back to the They should have never left! Ohio is a      great place for work to come to . . . no social unrest, just      hard working men and women from a blue collar town, building      quality engines.       In closing, I want to thank Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur for      fighting the good fight and for supporting good paying jobs      in America once again. Congresswoman, Spread our message!

The latest version of TrumpCare is an admission that the wealthiest Nation on Earth will not, by choice, care for all its citizens; that a child in Texas or Massachusetts with pediatric cancer deserves treatment, but not both; that a grandmother in Maine or Oklahoma deserves long-term care, but not both; that a young man in Georgia or West Virginia suffering from substance use disorder can be treated, but not both.  This version of TrumpCare, worse than those before it, pits State against State, American against  It is up to every single one of us here today to say: Not this--not in my country, not on our watch.

605,topic-id,948,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Chinese General Sun Li-jen. He was known as the ever-victorious general, and fought with valor against Axis forces in Burma during World War  General Sun's strategies on the battlefield were a combination of traditional Chinese military theory and American military training. He was an important ally for the United States and a popular figure among his people.  He was born in Anhui, China, and was the son of a Confucian scholar. He moved to the United States to attend Purdue University on a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, and graduated with a degree in civil engineering.  As China fell deeper into political upheaval and war, General Sun believed he could be more useful as a soldier than as an engineer. He went on to attend the Virginia Military Institute, where he faced prejudice from other cadets.  When he returned to China, he advanced to the rank of colonel. In one of his earliest battles in World War II, he led troops to the defense of Shanghai and was wounded while leading his own men to safety.  After recovering from his injuries, he established a military training camp in southern The men at the camp were trained in both Eastern and Western military strategy.  General Sun is internationally renowned for his extraordinary service during the Battle of Yenangyaung in 1942. He saved the British First Burma Division by leading a regiment in a flanking maneuver. His bravery protected Allied forces from encirclement by the Imperial Japanese  During this battle, General Sun was also given command of a small group from the British Second Royal Tanks, making him the first Chinese officer to command British troops.  In recognition of his victory in Burma, he was knighted by the United Kingdom and awarded the Legion of Merit by Franklin Delano He was a friend of American Generals MacArthur and  In the report that recommended General Sun for the Legion of Merit, the U.War Department wrote the following: ``For exceptionally meritorious[[Page H7621]]conduct in the performance of outstanding service during the Burma operations in 1942. Under most trying conditions, General Sun displayed high qualities of leadership. The First Burma Division of the British Force at Yenangyaung was extricated by the attack of the 38th Division and saved from annihilation. General Sun held his unit together at all times during the retreat and brought it ready for combat to His example of courage and leadership reflect great credit on Allied Arms.''

606,topic-id,335,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to read very briefly from that letter from the Virginia Military Institute, which recognized General Sun for his leadership in the China-Burma-India theater, and recognize that his story has inspired many other Virginia Military Institute graduates since then.  General Sun's legacy lives on through his family, including California Assemblyman Kansen I am pleased to recognize Assemblyman Kansen Chu and his wife, Daisy Chu, who have joined us here today with his family and our honored guests in the House gallery.  The district that Assemblyman Chu and I represent are some of the most ethnically diverse areas in our country. General Sun valued diversity. He found greater strength as a leader by combining Eastern and Western ideas. He led soldiers with different ethnicities and religions. His accomplishments demonstrate that we are better when we embrace diversity.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage Congress to remember the contributions and legacy of General Sun and their importance to the people of the United States, of China, and those of Chinese-American ancestry.  I want to end on this note. Several of us went a few days ago to the Library of Congress where Graham Allison was speaking. Graham Allison has this theory of the Thucydides Trap, which argues that two powers--when one power is rising and another power is established--often are likely to face conflict and war. He said that Xi Jinping in China is familiar with Thucydides  I would submit that General Sun's story is a reminder for why the United States and China can be allies and not adversaries. We often forget that China was critical in the United States' efforts in winning World War II, and General Sun's story is a reminder of that and an inspiration for us in this new century in finding common ground between the United States and China to help create a more peaceful world.

215,topic-id,196,"Mr.Speaker, here we are 9 months into the year, and the Republican-led Congress has zero major legislative accomplishments to show for it. While Democrats continue to offer an agenda that gives Americans a better deal, really a better life, Republicans are continually obsessed with their Republican healthcare bill, this repeal and replace.  Recently, they have had to pull back again from their Graham-Cassidy approach to this. Why? Because it means less care, less coverage, higher premiums, higher copays. It is bad policy. We ought to be focusing on what we need to do to make it right to fix the problems we see in healthcare, not this obsession to check a political box and repeal healthcare for the American people.  Meanwhile, there is no infrastructure plan. America's roads and bridges are falling apart. There is nothing on the floor of the House to address that--something the American people all agree we need to do.

109,topic-id,371,"Mr.President, today we remember the life of Alan Hutchinson, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 70. As a beloved family man, veteran, author, and tireless environmental advocate, Alan dedicated his life to preserving Maine's most precious land, water, and wildlife. Future generations of Americans will enjoy all that the Maine outdoors has to offer thanks in part to Alan's dedication to conservation.  Originally from Rhode Island, Alan first came to Maine as a student at the University of Maine at Orono, where he earned his bachelor and master's degrees in wildlife management. During the Vietnam war, he served his country as a biological research aid at Walter Reed Medical Hospital in Washington, Upon returning to Maine, he began an illustrious career in environmental conservation, as a civil servant and leader of one of the largest land trusts of the United States, the Forest Society of  In his career as a civil servant, he led the acquisition and conservation of 250 coastal islands and headed Maine's newly formed Endangered Species With leadership, patience, and perseverance, he worked with diverse partners to protect our coast and wildlife. In 1997, Alan became the first executive director of the Forest Society of Maine, During his tenure, the FSM grew from a one-person operation into a national leader in forestland conservation, helping to conserve over 1 million acres of forestland. Just as he did leading the Endangered Species Group, Alan achieved this success by bringing together diverse groups under a common purpose of protecting our forests. His notable conservation achievements include the 20,000-acre Nicatous Lake easement, protecting 6 miles of the beautiful Moosehead Lake shore, the 329,000-acre West Branch Project, and the unprecedented 360,000-acre Moosehead Region conservation easement.  In addition to his conservation work, Alan also authored two books, ``Just Loons: A Wildlife Watcher's Guide,'' 1998, and ``Just Eagles: A Wildlife Watchers Guide,'' 2000. These books reflect his passion for Maine's outdoors that embodied his life's work. Alan will be remembered for his thoughtful leadership, dedication, and passion. Above all that, nothing exceeded his deep love for his family and his devotion to his friends. Alan will be sorely missed by all, and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6129.txt,1724,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2824, INCREASING OPPORTUNITY AND",2017.0,26.0,September
113,topic-id,1919,"Mr.President, first I want to join the Democratic leader in his comments about the devastation of these hurricanes. This has been truly a malign visitation on our country over the last several weeks. Florida, Texas, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico have really suffered and are suffering. I know that the administration is working hard on this, and I commend them for the efforts that they have made.  I think that now much of our attention is turning to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in order to mitigate what is really a humanitarian disaster. One difference between those islands and Florida and Texas is the fact that they are islands. It is harder to get there. It is harder to get aid there. I understand that just this morning the San Juan airport was open for the first time, and it has opened in a limited way.  So this is clearly a responsibility that we have as Senators, as Members of Congress, and as Americans to reach out to our neighbors in a situation such as this. When a crisis hits, it often calls forth the best of America, and I believe that is happening right now.                            Opioid Epidemic  Mr.President, I want to talk about a different kind of hurricane, a slow-motion hurricane. It is a slow-motion hurricane that is sweeping our entire country, not just the It is sweeping through our small towns, our cities, our families, and our schools. It is taking lives on a scale that is unprecedented and almost unthinkable.  I am talking about the hurricane epidemic of opioid abuse and overdose deaths. Many of us this week are watching with rapt attention Ken Burns' magnificent study of the Vietnam war. We are losing more people per year to overdose deaths than were lost in the entire Vietnam war. That is one way to think about the magnitude of this catastrophe that is striking our country. The problem is that it strikes[[Page S6162]]here and there. It strikes a family here and a family there, a community here and a community there, but it doesn't strike all in one place. So it is not so apparent.  If we were losing a small city in America of 63,000 people once a year, we would be turning ourselves inside out to solve the problem that was causing those deaths, and 63,000 people were killed last year through overdose deaths. It was almost 400 in my State of That is more than one a day. All indications are that it is increasing--one a day. Now, 63,000 is about 7 people an hour--24 hours a day, 365 days a year--who are succumbing to this plague. That is the right term for it. It is a medieval plague that is afflicting people all over our country.  Lives are lost, families torn apart, and our communities compromised. It is a huge cost. I hesitate to talk about things like dollars when you are also talking about lives, but it is a cost in both ways. Not only are lives being lost and families being torn apart, but the estimates are that it costs our society something over $400 billion a year in everything from medical costs and criminal justice costs to lost economic and lost productivity in our society and our economy.  But I am here today because all hope is not lost. Contrary to what some people hear--and you hear sometimes that this is hopeless and that there isn't anything we can do about it--there is ample evidence that treatment can work. This is not a death sentence. Opioid abuse is terrible, and from talking to people who have suffered from it, it literally changes your brain, and it becomes almost impossible to escape. But it can be escaped. The reason we know that is that there is data from across the country, but the reason I know that is because of my friends in Maine--Andrew, Matt, and  These are people whom I know, with whom I have interacted, and with whom I have sat down. Andrew is a guy who is at the University of Southern He was trapped in the throes of addiction. He went through treatment, and now he is in recovery. Indeed, there are 25 million people in this country who are in recovery, and they will tell you that they will always be in recovery because they can never shake this disease, whether it is alcohol or the really destructive one that we are focusing on right now, which is opioids.  Andrew has made a new life. He is at school. He is at the University of Southern He has helped form a student-centered community to help people who are in recovery or who are working on getting there.  Matthew is a young man who, in 2009, again was trapped by this horrible scourge. Now he is hoping to go to medical school.  Chris is a guy who sat in my office. He worked in the White He was in it up to his neck and above. He had criminal justice problems. He was in jail. He was convicted. But now he is a member of the Maine State Bar He got himself through school, and he got himself through law school.  There was an important moment that I think all of us should think about when we think about people who are in this situation. When he went to apply to law school, the people at the law school said: Well, we don't know if we can take you because you have this record.  His question, which was brilliant and indicates to me that he is going to be a pretty good lawyer, was this: What was my sentence when I was convicted? The response was 3 years. He said: You are putting me in for life. If you don't let me move forward with my life, you are making that a life sentence, not a 3-year sentence. He was accepted to law school. He graduated, and this year he passed and was accepted in the Maine State Bar He is making a contribution to his community.  Treatment can work. It doesn't always work the first time. Anybody that has been through this, whether it is alcohol or even quitting smoking or anything else, will tell you that it doesn't work the first time necessarily. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it will take multiple trips through the recovery and treatment process, but it can work. We know it can work. I have 25 million reasons to tell you that it can work and 3 that I know.  I am going to be introducing a resolution later today--I hope the Senate can take it up and pass it--designating next month as National Recovery Month, honoring and recognizing the people who are in recovery. So if it works, what is the problem? Why is this hurricane still sweeping our country? Why does 2017 look like it is going to be worse than 2016?  Well, the sad truth is that, out of all of those millions of people who are addicted, who are stuck, who are trapped, only 1 in 10 has access to treatment--only 1 in 10. Now, what do we have to do to deal with this problem? Of course, it is like most other problems. There is no single answer. It involves law enforcement. It involves interdiction, and let me pause for a moment on interdiction. The Presiding Officer and I are both on the Armed Services Committee, and we have heard testimony in our committee that we only have the Coast Guard and Navy resources to interdict one-fourth of the drug shipments that we know of coming up from South and Central America by sea. In other words, we have intelligence where we know of 100 boats, and we can only stop 25. There is no excuse for that. So, yes, law enforcement, at the source or along the way in our States, is an absolutely essential part of this process, but it is not the whole answer. We also have to work on prevention.  Frankly, I have been talking to groups around Maine and around the country on this. We are all still trying to figure out how to make prevention work. What will work? I haven't yet heard a really strong answer to that question. I guess it varies from person to person, but prevention has to be part of it. Treatment can work, but if only 1 in 10 people have treatment available to them or have access to treatment, that means 9 are sentenced to life and maybe to death.  Last year, a year and a half ago, we passed CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery It is a great bill, with lots of good things in it, but no money. That is like sending the fire department to the fire and saying: Fight that fire, but we are not going to give you any water. We know this costs money, and it is something we have to commit to. It has to be part of it.  Whatever we do around here about healthcare and about budgets, we have to realize we are losing our people, and these aren't bad people. These aren't people over there. I sat at a roundtable in a small town in South Paris, Next to me was a deputy sheriff. He lost his daughter. These aren't strangers. These are often middle-class people. These are people whose kids or sometimes parents--this is not age specific--are caught up in this scourge.  I guess I want to leave us today with two points. One is, treatment works. The second is, we need more of it. If we know something works, but only 1 in 10 people have access to it, shame on us for not remedying that situation. To me, the most tragic case--and I have talked to people in Maine about this--the saddest moment, the most tragic case is when someone who is in the throes of opioid abuse is ready to ask for help and they have to be put on a waiting list. That is tragic and inexcusable. It is hard to get to that point. It is hard to admit that you are trapped and that you are no longer in control of your life. Once you are willing to do that and say, ``I need help,'' then it is up to us to be sure the help is there. That is what we are talking about today.  So this is a different kind of hurricane, but it is a hurricane, nonetheless, that is destroying our families, destroying our communities, and wrecking the lives of our friends, but it is no act of We can't stop the winds of Maria or Irma, but we can mitigate the effects, ameliorate the effects, soften the effects. That is exactly what we need to do for those who are victims of the hurricane of opioids that is sweeping our country.  I hope and believe we will respond to this challenge as we have at other times in our history, and, indeed, as we are this week to the hurricanes of the I want to respond also to the hurricane that is sweeping America that we can, indeed, ameliorate, mitigate, and soften.

291,topic-id,1345,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss my resolution, 268, calling on the Senate to formally recognize September 26 as National Voter Registration  National Voter Registration Day is a celebration of our democracy and our Nation's most fundamental right--the right to vote.  Today, thousands of volunteers and organizations in all 50 States are hitting the streets to register voters. Their goal is to create awareness about the registration process and register people who may not register on their own or don't have the time or don't know how to do it. It is really to reach out to people way ahead of an election. Last year, their hard work paid off, and more than 750,000 Americans registered to vote on National Voter Registration  These volunteers understand that voting is a fundamental right, but not everyone agrees. There are still people who seem to see it as a privilege that not all eligible voters should enjoy. That is not the way we should see this.  The right to vote is clearly under attack in the United We have seen discriminatory voting laws spring up across the country, and those who want to prevent people from voting are making it harder and harder for people to get to the polls.  I do not see this as a partisan issue. My State last year had the highest voting rate in the country. And we have seen a number of States that do things like have same-day registration, mail-in ballots, things like that, and they tend to have higher voting rates. They are not just Democratic States or Republican States; they are Independent And when you look at the list, it doesn't necessarily mean that a certain party is going to win. We had Independent Governor Jesse Ventura win in our State; Governor Tim But what our States share is a higher voter turnout. What does that mean? Well, it means that people have some trust in their government when they participate. Even when their candidate doesn't win and the other candidate wins, at least they know they had a say and that it mattered and that they went to the voting booth.  That is what I am talking about today because in some States, we have seen discriminatory voting laws spring up, and they have literally made it harder for people to vote. We have heard reports of problems with equipment. We had 3-hour lines in We had 100 miles to the nearest polling station in Nevada and Utah, photo ID requirements in Wisconsin, where we now know it can really be hard to get an ID in the first place. In North Carolina, a Federal court found that the State's laws to prevent voter access--and this is a more conservative court, the Fifth Circuit--they said the voter laws had been crafted with ``surgical precision'' to discriminate against minorities.  Now we have an administration that is abandoning efforts to uphold voting rights. In many States, this is a truly bipartisan effort. The Commission on ``Election Integrity'' looks to be making it harder, rather than easier, to vote. States are reporting that some Americans are actually unregistering to vote because of the Commission's request for personal data from across the country. We have had Democratic and Republican secretaries of state band together to say this is something they don't want to do.  Taken together, these efforts to suppress the vote represent a concerted strategy to ensure that fewer people make it to the polls. This is not about one party or the other party; this is about our democracy. Our very freedoms are built upon the freedom to vote.  So what else do we see? Well, we see attacks from without on our election. I remember the Presiding Officer had an excellent quote on this matter when he said: One election, it will be one candidate in one party; and the next election, it could be the other candidate from the other party. That is why, when we look at interference from foreign governments, we must also protect the sacred right to vote, and that means everything from the amendment I have with Senator Lindsey Graham, which is now a bill, to make sure our cyber security is strengthened as we head into the 2018 election and make sure that our States have the ability to protect their own voting equipment. The reports now--I just found out that in my own State, an attempt had been made to hack it. In 21 States, we have seen attempts at hacking.  All our bill does is say: Let's help the States to shore up their equipment, to make sure they have backup paper ballots and other commonsense measures.  This bill in the House--the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act--was carried by Mark Meadows, the head of the Freedom That is right. It is a bipartisan amendment across both the House and the Senate to protect our State election equipment. Our country is stronger when everyone participates, and that is why we must protect the election equipment.  We must make it easier to vote. I have one idea: Why don't we just automatically register eligible voters when they turn 18, maybe when they get their driver's license or Social Security number. Our States have that data. They also have a way to crosscheck with criminal records and other things to make sure these are eligible voters. Wouldn't that be easier than going out and trying to get everyone to vote? It doesn't mean you have to vote, but you automatically get registered to vote, just like you get your Social Security number.  There is momentum for this idea at the State level. Last month, Illinois[[Page S6139]]became the 10th State to pass automatic voter registration. Experts project that it will result in 1 million people being added to the registration list. Estimates show that as many as 50 million eligible voters would be registered if we moved to automatic registration.  Another thing we can do to increase turnout is to allow same-day voting. In February, I introduced the Same Day Voter Registration Act, a bill that will allow people to register to vote on election day. This reduces the burden of voting and ensures that anyone who forgets to register can go up there to prove who they are and they can get registered. Fifteen States have this--not just blue States, but red States and blue And they always tend to be up at the top in the number of people who vote.  We need to restore Americans' confidence in our election process and our democracy, and we do that by welcoming people to vote.  A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to go with Congressman Lewis on his yearly pilgrimage--his trip where he takes people to the site of the march to The weekend I got to go was actually the moment 48 years to the weekend later. The White police chief of Montgomery handed his badge to Congressman Lewis and gave him that badge and apologized. He apologized because their police department at that time, 48 years before, had not protected the African-American marchers and those other citizens who were there marching with them.  It took 48 years, but it happened. It was an emotional trip, and it made you think about those marchers and everything they had done just to get the right to vote. You see it in other countries where people will wait in line for a day just to be able to have their say in their own government. That is really what this is about.

21,topic-id,636,"Mr.President, in the year 2017, when some people live in extravagant homes with half a dozen or a dozen bathrooms with marble floors and the latest fixtures, an estimated 2.5 billion people live in squalor with no access to modern sanitation. One billion people have no access to latrines and defecate in the open, like our ancestors did thousands of years ago.  The United States spends about $400 million a year on water supply and sanitation programs worldwide, pursuant to the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005. One of our late colleague's many public policy contributions was his focus on pressing issues such as the growing scarcity of clean water sources--even in our own country--and the preventable suffering that comes from poor sanitation. His book, ``Tapped Out,'' is another contribution he made to greater understanding of these challenges. The law named for him requires the Secretary of State, in consultation with the U.Agency for International Development and other U.Government agencies, to develop and implement a strategy to provide affordable and equitable access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries.  For the past several years, the Congress has directed that $14 million of those funds be used specifically to design and build safe, public latrines in Africa and Our purpose has been to help reduce the risk to woman and girls, particularly in rural areas in these countries, who are often assaulted at night or subjected to humiliation and harassment, due to the lack of safe and accessible latrines.  Unfortunately, USAID has not utilized these funds as effectively as we intended, and the fiscal year 2018 Department of State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported unanimously by the Senate Appropriations Committee on September 7, specifies that not less than $15 million shall be made available ``to support initiatives by local communities in Africa and Asia to build and maintain safe, public latrines.''  What we intend is not rocket science. Today communities in Africa and Asia, often with the assistance of small local or U.nongovernmental organizations like the Advocacy Project, are building low-cost, easy to maintain, public latrines. Something as basic as a latrine can transform a community, particularly for women and girls. Not only does it reduce their vulnerability to assault, it reduces the obvious health problems caused by open defecation. It also increases girls' access to education, if there are latrines for girls at schools. The cost of such projects can be as little as a few hundred dollars, particularly when members of the community volunteer their labor. Just as important as the design and construction is a plan for community members to regularly maintain the latrines and to educate the local population--men, women, and children--on their use.  Access to water and sanitation are fundamental to social and economic development. The lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation, coupled with poor hygiene, are leading causes of sickness and death worldwide. Nearly 1,000 children under age 5 die each day from diarrhea caused by contaminated water and from poor sanitation and hygiene. There are few ways to[[Page S6185]]safeguard a person's health and improve their dignity more basic than by providing them access to sanitation facilities for safely disposing of human waste.  There should be no confusion about what we intend for these $15 million. We want USAID missions in countries where women and girls in rural areas lack access to safe, public latrines to identify communities for pilot projects, where local leaders want to address this problem and where a small investment can make a significant difference. Working with those leaders and utilizing the technical expertise of local or U.S.-based NGOs, we can help set an example for other communities to replicate.

739,topic-id,445,"Mr.President, one of the most pernicious threats to the right of employees and consumers to access our judicial system has been the rise of forced arbitration. This practice unfairly eliminates access to our courts for millions of When used by employers, forced arbitration serves to shield corporations from the[[Page S5881]]consequences of harmful behavior, such as discrimination or sexual harassment. Today, the Senate is considering a nominee for the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, who has advocated in favor of forced arbitration in the employment context. Mr.Emanuel's support for stripping American workers of their rights is an important reason why I am opposing his nomination.  The shadow justice system brought about by forced arbitration results in real harm to employees while serving only to protect powerful corporate employers. In a high-profile example from last year, former FOX News host Gretchen Carlson was barred from speaking publicly about her allegations of sexual harassment against the company's former chairman, Roger Had she not spoken out and instead complied with the private arbitration clause in her contract, her case would have been hidden from public view, denying other victims of harassment the knowledge that they were not alone.  In another disturbing case reported earlier this year, hundreds of current and former employees of Sterling Jewelers, a company that earns $6 billion in annual revenue, have for years alleged that the company is engaged in pervasive gender discrimination and has fostered a culture that condones sexual harassment. According to reports, this shocking behavior dates as far back as the early 1990s. Despite decades of allegations from women at the company, these claims were hidden behind closed doors because of private arbitration. The full details are still unknown today.  These are just two examples that highlight the serious harm forced arbitration can cause employees. During the Obama administration, the NLRB found that the use of forced arbitration by employers to limit employees' rights to enter into class or collective actions violated the National Labor Relations Mr.Emanuel participated in key cases related to this decision. I am concerned that his history of advocacy on this issue could lead to his prejudging the outcomes of subsequent cases that come before the  Unfortunately, Mr.Emanuel declined during his confirmation hearing to recuse himself from decisions related to forced arbitration should he become a member of the His other answers on this issue did not sufficiently allay my concern that he would work to undermine the rights of employees to access our judicial system.

753,topic-id,3006,"Mr.President, it was 6 years ago that Tropical Storm Irene tore through my home State of Vermont, and I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember going around the State the next day in a helicopter with the head of our National Guard and reviewing the damage. We are still trying to recover.  In the days after the storm, I came to this Chamber, and I asked for the support that Vermont needed to recover and rebuild. I remember with gratitude that Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate, from across the country, stood with the people of I remember how much the calls of support from Republican and Democratic colleagues meant to me.  Today, we have to do the same for the people of Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin More than 3\1/2\ million Americans--remember, these are Americans--have seen their homes and communities destroyed by the double blow of Hurricanes Irma and The destruction is catastrophic. The details are still coming in.  The vast majority of Puerto Rico is without power and remains in the dark. At least 44 percent--almost half of its people--are without potable water, and some estimates put it even higher. The vast majority of hospitals in Puerto Rico are without power. The food supply is dwindling. Cell phone sites are down, crippling communication on the island. People can't find out what has happened to their families.

These resources should be put to work in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands as well. But it is not going to last for long. This money will run out within a couple of weeks.

The Appropriations Committee is ready to move on it, but the Congress--the House and Senate--should act very quickly. We have to stand by each other in times of disaster. When there is a storm, one of us braces for it, and the others have to help pick up the pieces. That is who we are. That is why we act. That is why we are We are the United States of America--all of us. Now we must make sure that we respond not just in Texas, as we should, not just in Florida, as we should, but in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin They are part of our country.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, the Senate finds itself today in a familiar situation: Deeply partisan efforts to repeal and replace the landmark Affordable Care Act have hit a wall. By their own admission, the Senate majority has, with their backs against a wall and a looming deadline to advance legislation by a simple majority vote, put forward one last-gasp effort to roll back access to healthcare for millions of Americans--not because it is sound policy, but in an effort to meet a campaign promise, regardless of its harm to millions of It is as irresponsible as it is dangerous. These efforts put lives at risk. This zombie project should be abandoned, and we should get back to the constructive and promising bipartisan work toward strengthening troubled insurance markets.  Instead of working on a responsible budget, or disaster relief for Puerto Rico, Florida, and Texas, or on any of the many pressing issues facing our country, we began this week in a situation virtually identical to where we were in In fact, it reflects the state of the Senate for much of this year, where policymaking has been replaced by partisanship and politics.  When we considered a healthcare reconciliation bill in July, in spite of multiple drafts and a go-it-alone, hyperpartisan philosophy, the majority leader was still unable to garner enough support within his own Caucus to pass a sweeping healthcare bill. I joined with many Democrats to offer motions to get the Senate back to regular order and have the appropriate committees study the effects of these policies on Medicaid beneficiaries and those with disabilities, on women and children, on seniors, and the most vulnerable, but Republicans voted down those efforts and plowed ahead, seemingly unaware or willingly blind to the real-life impacts of what they were trying to do. During July's debate, the Senate also considered multiple amendments to rewrite the Affordable Care Each of these amendments would have caused tens of millions of Americans to lose insurance and would have made it harder for those with preexisting conditions to obtain coverage. When those amendments failed, the Republican leadership attempted to fully repeal the Affordable Care That did not work either.  Instead of learning from that painful process, the Republican leadership emerged from the August recess with a new plan. Released just last week and revised several times since, the proposal of Senators Graham, Cassidy, Heller, and Johnson was intended to revive the healthcare reconciliation bill the Senate already defeated. Unfortunately, their bill contains all of the problems of previous versions and includes new, troubling provisions that would fundamentally change healthcare in this country for the worse.  This Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill--just the latest version of TrumpCare--would make dangerous changes to our healthcare system resulting in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage, including In fact, based on previous estimates, a provision in this bill would cause 15 million Americans to lose insurance and premiums to increase by an average of 20 percent on day 1.  This hasty proposal would allow insurance companies to charge seniors, those with disabilities, those with preexisting conditions, and women more for coverage. These are all discriminatory policies that the Affordable Care Act changed.  Like previous versions of TrumpCare, this bill would end Medicaid as we know it by capping spending in the program and forcing States to cut eligibility, benefits, or both. What is worse, this new version of the bill would fully repeal the tax credits and subsidies created under the ACA and instead give States inadequately funded block grants with no requirement that the funding goes to those in need.  States like Vermont have done the right thing. Because of Vermont's Medicaid expansion, thousands of Vermonters now have access to lifesaving health insurance and care. That is never been more critical than now as we continue to grapple with the opioid crisis.  This latest Republican proposal would hurt States like Vermont, simply for doing the right thing and expanding coverage. In the latest version of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal, there seems to be no consistency to how block grant funds are divvied between States, leaving some to conclude the formula is merely a ham-fisted attempt to appease some reluctant Republican Senators to support this measure. By 2027, all States lose under this proposal as the block grant funding created under this proposal runs out. You cannot consider legislation of this magnitude, with such far-reaching truly life-and-death consequences, with no debate and no meaningful consideration. This is not the way the Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, should conduct such expansive and impactful policies. This is not the Senate that I know and respect.  Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee held the only hearing in the Senate on We heard how devastating this bill would be for millions of Americans who depend on subsidies to purchase health insurance. We heard how reduced funding would force States to choose what services to cover for children, pregnant women, and those with disabilities who depend on Benefits like maternity coverage or homecare will be at risk as States choose to relax the insurance requirements under the Remarkably, experts disagreed with the authors as to what this amendment would mean for those with preexisting conditions.  One thing the hearing made abundantly clear is that this sweeping policy needs further examination. The Congressional Budget Office says it needs at least a couple of weeks to fully examine this proposal. How many will lose insurance? How much will premiums increase? How many will lose access to health care? These are fundamental questions to which we do not and will not have answers before the majority's arbitrary timeline is up. The preliminary estimate released late Monday by the CBO says that ``millions'' of Americans would be uninsured as a result of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal. What is more, I have not heard from a single health-related group that supports this measure.  So why does the majority insist on pushing forward? It seems they are so intent on voting on anything that they would have us consider an unexamined, hastily cobbled together bill solely to repeal the ACA--for the express purposes of fulfilling a crassly partisan campaign promise. This would be nothing more than legislative malpractice. Their desire to undo any of the success of the Obama administration, at any cost, would have them push forward a proposal that would devastate our health insurance markets, cause millions to lose insurance, and fundamentally change the Medicaid Program, and the best reason the Republicans can come up with for supporting this new attempt is ``because we said we would.''  In Vermont, the effects of TrumpCare would be disastrous. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Vermont has made exceptional progress to cut the rate of uninsured Vermonters by half. The number of uninsured Vermonters is now below 4 percent. Because of the Medicaid Program and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as Dynasaur in Vermont, 99 percent of children have health insurance in our TrumpCare, in any version, places Vermont's progress at risk.  Vermont has also worked on new and innovative ways of delivering healthcare, which has brought down[[Page S6111]]costs and increased coordination of care. One of the most significant ways Vermont has done this is through existing flexibility in It is through the Medicaid Program that Vermont has offered comprehensive treatment and counseling services for those suffering with opioid addition. In Vermont, 68 percent of those receiving medication assisted treatment for opioid addiction are Medicaid recipients. If hundreds of billions of dollars are cut from the Medicaid Program, States will be forced to limit coverage, jeopardizing Vermont's ability to overcome this crisis. Provisions that cap Medicaid spending do not create ``flexibility'' in This policy would instead force States to ration care.  Let's talk about what that means to This week I heard from Deborah in Waterbury, VT, who wrote to me urging me to vote to protect Medicaid funding:       For a while Medicaid paid for medical care my son and I      needed. Later Medicaid funding, and the cancer care it paid      for, literally saved my life. It turns out many Americans      find out that they or someone they love needs medical care or      disability services that only Medicaid covers. Medicaid not      only helps individuals and families who need medical care or      disability services in the community; it also pays for      approximately 64 percent of the people in nursing homes--     financial help that is necessary because so many people spend      down their life savings in the first few years of care. I am      glad that over the years some of my tax dollars have paid for      needed services for others. I believe we must and can improve      the quality, affordability and effectiveness of health care      in this country; but we won't do it by denying so many      Americans basic health and disability services.  Consider this deeply personal story from Allyson in Brattleboro:       About a year ago, I got a migraine. it never went away.      Instead, it got worse and worse, and turned into what is      called a hemiplegic migraine. These migraines look and feel      like strokes, but are `just' migraines. I started having      seizures soon after that; they would later be diagnosed as      psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. I have also had rheumatoid      arthritis for five years.       The saving grace in all of this has been Medicaid, made      available to me through the Obamacare Medicaid I      have not had to worry about affording the care I've needed      (probably close to $100,000, plus $80,000 in prescriptions),      which has taken one huge worry off my plate. I could go to      the seizure monitoring unit at DHMC for a week without      stopping to wonder how I was going to pay for it. I could      fill my--prescription ($4,000 a month) without worry, and      continue to walk around and look after my kids. I could try      several medications for migraine to try to get better. And I      could get good, solid therapy for mental health treatment.       Without these things, and the Medicaid that pays for them,      I would be far sicker than I am now. I would not be able to      care for my children, or work even a little bit. I would      likely die young. Instead, I am making it through, spending      time with my children, and healing.       Please continue fighting for my healthcare, for my life.  Vermonters came to Washington Monday in their efforts to attend the sole hearing on the hapless Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson proposal. They waited in line for hours, and they were not granted access to the hearing, held in a smaller room despite the known public interest in this hearing.  Waiting in line for a hearing he was not allowed to attend, Drew from Readesboro said:       ``[T]his is my second time down here. I'm here to finally      kill this bill as it will result in the deaths of millions of      Americans and significant loses to Vermont's funding.''  Todd from Bennington said:       The reason I oppose the bill is being I'm a walking pre-     existing condition. Diabetes, high blood pressure. It's      getting under control, but it wouldn't without healthcare.  Mari from Lincoln said:       I'm here because I have to. Like Marcelle [Leahy], I've      been a nurse for almost 30 years and if it weren't for the      Affordable Care Act many of the patients that I'm caring for      now in the inpatient cardiology unit at the University of      Vermont Medical Center would either not be alive or would be      in a much more devastating situation. Many of the young      adults that I care for in the cardiology unit have opiate      addiction and are there with serious infections because of      that. And if it weren't for the part of the Affordable Care      Act that allowed young adults up to 26 to still be covered by      their parents insurance, many of these young adults would not      be alive. So I've been fighting for health reform in Vermont      for decades now . . . This is THE most immoral bill I've seen      in my 58 years of life . . . I'm appalled and I'm angry, and      I'm very motivated. I wish we didn't have to be here but I'm      so proud to be here.  These are real stories, real lives. This matters.  These TrumpCare proposals are not healthcare bills. A true healthcare bill would not kick millions of Americans off health insurance. A true healthcare bill would not allow insurance companies to charge people more for less coverage. A true healthcare bill would not move us backwards to a time when healthcare was unaffordable.  Where there are deficiencies, let's fix them. Where we can find common ground, let's act. One of the first things we should do is stabilize the insurance market by making cost-sharing payments permanent. Earlier this month, the Senate was doing just that. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held bipartisan hearings aimed at stabilizing our insurance market. This week, the Finance Committee reached an agreement on a 5-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance This is important progress that should not be cast aside.  We should also be working to shore up funding for our health centers, which will see a 70 percent cut at the end of the month if we fail to act. One of the issues I hear most about is the cost of prescription drugs, which is why I have introduced a bill along with Senator Grassley that would help reduce drug costs by helping generic alternatives come to market faster. The American people expect us to work on real solutions. We should not be pushing a plan that hasn't been vetted where the primary goal seems to be to get to 50 votes, rather than actually improving our health insurance system.  Was the Affordable Care Act absolutely perfect when it was passed? No, and we acknowledged the need for continual improvement as the ACA would be implemented, but unlike with other important social programs that have been created over the years--such as Social Security and Medicare--Republicans have not allowed us the opportunity to improve, strengthen and perfect it over time. Those programs were also not perfect, but instead of playing partisan games, Republicans and Democrats came together to get something done, time and time again. We did not vote to repeal the Social Security No, we came together, and we discussed what needed to be done to better help the American people, not unravel their safety net.

Let me be clear. This is a horrible bill. It is mean-spirited and it is unfair. Despite this bill's misleading title, Americans who would be harmed by this bill are not felons and they are not fugitives.  In reality, this bill would rip benefits from individuals who haven't been arrested, tried, or even convicted. They have only been accused. This violates the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty, and it would terminate benefits without due process.  What is worse, most of these outstanding warrants are decades old and involve minor infractions when people are unable to pay for court fines and fees. This is awful.  This bill criminalizes families living in poverty, and it disproportionately harms communities of color. One in five SSI recipients are African Without this critical program, believe you me, African Americans will struggle even more.  Make no mistake; cutting off SSI benefits would put all families at risk of being unable to keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table, and meet other basic needs. And for what?

319,topic-id,249,"Madam Chair, I am disappointed that this bill, H.2824, injects needless controversy into reauthorizing the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting  Home visiting is an evidence-based approach that connects pregnant women and families with young children to nurses, social workers, and other professionals. Through these programs, parents learn skills that help reduce abuse and neglect and improve child development during the crucial early years of life.  Most importantly, home visiting is backed by strong evidence that shows these programs are an effective way to improve outcomes for at-risk families. Unfortunately, H.2824 ignores the proven successes of home visiting in favor of harmful, partisan changes to the law. In particular, I am troubled by language in this bill that would cut off funding to States and Tribal organizations that are unable to match Federal spending on home visiting. The bipartisan bill in the Senate does not do that; you do.  Advocates are concerned that this could cause States to scale back or even end their programs altogether. In addition, this bill makes a number of ill-advised changes that have little or no apparent justification. Research shows that home visiting programs are working well, yet only 6 percent of eligible individuals currently participate. We should be looking at expanding, not undermining, access to home visiting.  We need, at the very least, a clean bill that reauthorizes the home visiting program in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, H.2824 is not that bill, and, for that reason, I urge that we vote ``no.''

433,topic-id,1745,"Mr.President, today we begin debate on a position in our government that impacts the daily lives of every single If you use a telephone, connect to the internet, watch television, and pay a big cable company to do all of those things, then you need to know who Ajit Pai is.  President Trump nominated Ajit Pai to be the Chairman of the Federal Communications While Ajit Pai has devoted many years to public service, I cannot support his nomination. Under Mr.Pai's short tenure, he has made the FCC stand for ``forgetting consumers and competition.''  Let's take a look at who is getting a piece of the FCC pie under Chairman It is American consumers on the one hand versus big corporations on the other hand. Let's take a piece of this pie and determine who is getting that first slice of what is going on at the Federal Communications  Let's look at net neutrality. Net neutrality is the basic principle that says that all internet traffic is treated equal. Net neutrality ensures that internet service providers like AT&T, Charter, Verizon, and Comcast do not block, slow down, censor, or prioritize internet traffic.  If Ajit Pai gets his way, a handful of big broadband companies will serve as gatekeepers to the internet. Fewer voices, less choice, no competition, but more profits for the big broadband companies--that is Pai's formula. Yet it is today's net neutrality rules that ensure that those with the best ideas, not merely the best funded ideas, can thrive in the 21st-century economy. It is net neutrality that has been the internet's chief governing principle since its inception.  Consider that today essentially every company is an internet company. In 2016, almost half of the venture capital funds invested in this country went toward internet-specific and software companies. That is $25 billion of investment. Half of all venture capital in America went toward internet-specific and software companies--half of all venture capital.  To meet America's insatiable demand for broadband internet, the U.broadband and telecommunications industry invested more than $87 billion in capital expenditures in 2015. That is the highest rate of annual investment in the last 10 years.  So we have hit a sweet spot. Investment in broadband and wireless technologies is very high. Job creation is very high. Venture capital investment in online startups is very high. That is why more than 22 million Americans wrote to the Federal Communications Commission to make their voices heard about net neutrality. They do not want it repealed. Yet Chairman Pai's proposal would decimate the FCC's open internet order.  Chairman Pai has said: ``We need to fire up the weed whacker'' to net neutrality rules. Do we really want a leader at the Federal Communications Commission who, ultimately, is going to implement the agenda of the big broadband companies, which want to crush competition, reduce choice, and then make consumers pay more?  So the first slice of this pie of killing net neutrality goes to the big corporations, and the losers are the consumers.  Let's go to the next slice of the FCC pie. Let's see where that goes as these decisions are being made. The next issue is, in fact, broadband privacy.[[Page S6200]]  Chairman Pai has actively supported efforts to allow broadband providers to use, share, and sell your sensitive information without consumer consent. In 2016, Chairman Pai voted against commonsense broadband privacy protections that gave consumers meaningful control over their sensitive information. When he assumed the FCC chairmanship, Ajit Pai stopped the implementation of data security protections, which would have ensured that broadband providers better protect the information they collect about their users. Can you imagine that? Chairman Pai stopped protections that would improve data security.  I have 143 million reasons as to why that was a bad idea. Just this month, Equifax was subjected to a cyber attack that compromised the personally identifiable information of 143 million consumers. The American public wants more protection, not less. Yet what does Chairman Pai do? He effectively eliminates the very data security protections that consumers need to protect their sensitive information. That is just plain wrong.  Just a few weeks later, Mr.Pai supported congressional Republicans' efforts to rescind the Federal Communications Commission's broadband privacy protections. Now your broadband provider can relentlessly collect and sell your sensitive web browsing history without your consent.  You may wonder why Chairman Pai would actively support efforts to undermine the privacy of American consumers. The answer is simple. He wants that slice of the pie to go to the biggest corporations. How do they use it? They take that data--your personal data, the information you put online--and just sell it without your permission in order to make money for the big corporations. Once again, rather than consumers, the big corporations get the benefit of that decision at the Federal Communications  Let's take a look at the next issue. The next issue goes to the question of mergers, the mergers of big telecommunications companies.  The Sinclair deal has led to a proposal to merge with Tribune Media, granting one company an unprecedented market power of over 200 broadcast stations around the country. In order to help Sinclair, Ajit Pai reinstated what most consider to be an antiquated rule, the UHF discount, to pave the way for the merger. The UHF discount makes the FCC count only half of the stations on certain frequencies toward companies' ownership percentages. This merger would allow Sinclair to reach into 72 percent of American households, but with the discount, the FCC counts it as only 45 percent. Putting this discount back on the books is Chairman Pai's first step to helping Sinclair stay within the national ownership cap of 39 percent.  What will be the impact of this massive telecommunications mega-merger? Less local news, sports, and weather that millions of Americans count on today. It will lead to the continued squeezing out of independent programmers, and it will mean higher prices for consumers. What signal does approving this merger reveal? It reveals that the FCC and Ajit Pai have put out the welcome mat for the consolidation of other communications companies.  So this third slice, once again, goes to corporations and not to consumers. They are left out in the cold.  Let's look at the fourth slice and see what happens with that at the Federal Communications Commission under the approval of Ajit Pai's nomination on the floor of the The next slice is one that deals with the education rate, or the E-rate.  The E-rate has proven to be exceptional in linking up schools and libraries to the internet. We went from a country in 1996 in which only 14 percent of K-12 classrooms had internet access to a near ubiquitous deployment today. The E-rate has ensured that students from working-class neighborhoods can connect just like students from more affluent communities. The E-rate democratizes access to the opportunities and technologies that lead to bright futures. Over $44 billion to date has been committed nationwide.  Again, Ajit Pai does not take that perspective. At his confirmation hearing in July, I explicitly asked him whether he would commit to preserving the success of this bipartisan program and protecting the funding level or whether he would make programmatic changes that could undermine or weaken the E-rate. He would not make this commitment to maintain current funding for E-rate.  Students and library users around the country will not be able to afford this slice of the pie. Once again, consumers will lose and corporations will win.  Now we go to the final slice of that communications pie at the  Telecommunication is the great equalizer, but a household with no access to basic telecommunications services could lose educational and employment opportunities as well as emergency services. That is why the FCC's Lifeline Program is truly a lifeline for millions of Americans who are able to connect to the world. In Massachusetts alone, more than 180,000 low-income Bay Staters rely on the Lifeline Program to access voice and internet service.  The value of this universal service has always been a bedrock of our telecommunications policy. Yet one of Ajit Pai's first actions as FCC Chairman was to undermine Lifeline and make it more difficult for low-income people to access affordable broadband. I was dismayed by his decision to abruptly revoke the recognition of nine additional companies as Lifeline broadband providers just weeks after they were approved. Mr.Pai's action did nothing but unfairly punish low-income consumers by limiting choice.  So the final slice, again, goes to the Federal Communications Commission's supporting corporations and not supporting consumers.  That is the pie--the FCC pie--as it is put together on net neutrality, on privacy, on mergers, on E-rate, and on It is all the same. The FCC winds up standing for forgetting consumers and competition. That is the era that we are now in, and it will only intensify as each day, week, and month goes by. That is why I am recommending a ``no'' vote on Ajit Pai as the Chairman of the Federal Communications  Which side are we going to be on--that of the consumers or corporations? Are we going to side with innovators? Are we going to side with those who are trying to continue to take these platforms of dynamic change in our society for consumers, for entrepreneurs or are we going to allow for a closing of this revolution?  This is the era in which we live in the 21st century. This is the choice that people must make. In which direction are we going?  I urge a ``no'' vote by my colleagues on Ajit Pai's nomination. Of all of the things that we are going to do this year, this is very near the top of the list. In many ways, this telecommunications revolution is the organizing principle of our lives here in the United States and around the planet, and we have to make sure that we are heading in the right direction--more openness, more competition, more consumer protection, more privacy protection, and more access in libraries and schools to these technologies, not fewer and fewer and fewer and fewer. It is just the wrong direction to head in. I urge a ``no'' vote.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

755,topic-id,932,"Thank you, Mr. I would like to start my remarks today by offering my prayers and my support to the people of Puerto Rico and to their family members and friends here in the United States, many of whom have still not been able to get information about their loved ones.  Massachusetts is home to the fifth largest Puerto Rican community in the mainland United It is a vibrant community, an engaged community, and since Hurricanes Irma and Maria, it has been a mobilized community. They are horrified by the images that are emerging from the island, pictures and videos of destroyed homes and of the massive flooding and widespread devastation. These images are difficult for any of us to see, and for those who have family there, these scenes beg for immediate action. Thousands of families are homeless, infrastructure is almost beyond repair, and much of the population will be without power for an indefinite period of time going into the future.  We need to act now. We must treat Puerto Rico just like any other U.State that is experiencing a natural disaster. That means that the United States should continue deploying its military and civilian assets to provide lifesaving search-and-rescue, food, shelter, and power to residents of the island. Congress must also act to immediately provide additional aid and funding so that the island can begin the long process of rebuilding.  Puerto Ricans, like Texans, like Louisianans, and like Floridians, are U.citizens. They are our sisters and brothers, and it is our moral obligation to provide them with help and relief in this time of their greatest need.  As we debate healthcare, let's remember that in the wake of these devastating storms, Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands will have enormous public health needs. They will be subject to an increased risk of disease transmission from a lack of clean drinking water, to physical injury from the storm, and to mental and behavioral trauma from the remarkable losses they are suffering. For those who are suffering from chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cancer and heart disease, finding and accessing treatment will be a daily struggle. Puerto Rico is a medical tragedy that is happening right before our eyes. History will judge us by how quickly we respond to this catastrophe.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, we should remember that this debate over healthcare is not confined to just this week, and it is certainly not confined to this building or even to this mainland.  Yesterday, I held an emergency roundtable with the leading healthcare leaders in These are the healthcare heroes who provide compassion and treatment each day to their patients. They all spoke poignantly about the devastation that would come from repealing and replacing the Affordable Care  Peter Slavin, president of Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ``To repeal the [Affordable Care Act] would be a horrible sin for this country.''  Yet that is exactly what the Graham-Cassidy bill is. It is a cruel and inhumane sin that would damn millions of American families.  In some cases, this most recent TrumpCare proposal is even worse than the failed bills before it. The bill proposed the use of a totally subjective formula which was changed at the whim of the bill's sponsors to entice more Republicans to vote in favor of it. The bill was nothing more than something that had political plastic surgery that had been performed, but it was fundamentally the same bill.  At the roundtable I held in Boston yesterday, Henry Dorkin, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, said: ``I fear that if Graham-Cassidy were to pass, we would go back to attending more funerals of children.''  There is simply no reason to go back to a time when people died of preventable or treatable conditions simply because they did not have access to insurance.  Just moments ago, we learned that the Republican leadership will not hold a vote on this disastrous bill. They simply did not have the votes. Right now, millions of Americans are again breathing a sigh of relief.[[Page S6113]]  I applaud my colleagues Senator John McCain of Arizona, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and others in this Chamber who are calling for a bipartisan process to strengthen and improve our healthcare system. We have done it before on the opioid crisis. We have done it on Alzheimer's and other medical research funding. I still believe we can do it here. We need to do what we have done so many times before and focus on bipartisan solutions instead of partisan exercises.  I hope we can put Graham-Cassidy and other TrumpCare proposals behind us and embrace bipartisan negotiations led by Senators Alexander and Murray to stabilize the individual health insurance market.  Just last week, Senators Wyden and Hatch introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 more years. There are a number of bipartisan healthcare issues that need immediate attention this week, such as the funding for community health centers and extending the number of Medicare policies.  This bill was not our only option. It is not even really an option, at least not for those Americans with preexisting conditions, who are on Medicaid, or who need opioid treatment.  We need to work together in this Chamber to improve health in a way that works for all Americans regardless of where they live or who their Governor is. That is the responsibility of those who serve here, and now let us have a new beginning, where we begin to work together to solve those problems.  I yield the floor.

318,topic-id,444,"Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to express my deep appreciation for the opportunity to join in this advocacy for this very important bill.  One of the great frustrations I know I share is when we have to make choices, and I see people come to me and they want us to increase the funding for those who are on the front lines fighting for our country, to increase the funding for those who are suffering from diseases, to increase the funding to protect senior citizens in various capacities, and every one of them tears at your heartstrings.  That is why, to me, it is such an incredible accomplishment when you are able, at this particular period of time, with huge deficits, to be able to fight to make sure that we can retain the funding to drive a fundamental program. The chairman has done that in this case, and I find the arguments to double that to be just a Trojan horse, an impediment to helping us take a meaningful program and make sure that it is authorized and supported.  In April, I visited the Crozer-Keystone Community Foundation in my own district. The foundation operates MIECHV and uses the Nurse-Family Partnership model to serve women and families in Delaware The model enables nurses to conduct regular home visits for first-time mothers and their children who are less than 2-years-old. It is designed to improve prenatal health and outcomes, improve child health and development, and improve families' economic self-sufficiency.  The success is evident to the experience of the women and families in the programs. In fact, the Nurse-Family Partnership model has been shown to reduce child abuse by 48 percent, reduce emergency room visits for accidents and poisonings by 58 percent, and reduce behavioral and intellectual problems by age 6 by 67 percent.  A study found that $6 is returned to the community for every dollar it invests in the program. Did you hear that? For every dollar the community invests, they will get $6; so it is not wrong to ask our partners in the States to match this commitment. In fact, my own State of Pennsylvania, I am proud to say it has actually exceeded the[[Page H7508]]matching because they know it works and it makes a true partnership with the  So I want to, once again, conclude by applauding the efforts of the chairman to position this in such a way for us to be able to move forward, to create the opportunity for this genuine partnership, to move on, on behalf of the--not programs just like the Nurse-Family Partnership, but the broad spectrum that are supported.

118,topic-id,2482,"Mr.President, our Constitution begins with three simple words: ``We the People.'' The Founders wrote that in supersized font to remind us that this is what our Nation is all about. It is not about power by the privileged. It is not the elite. It is not to make the wealthy wealthier. It is not to add more to the abundance of those who already have much. It is to establish government that reflects the will of the people or, as President Lincoln put it, ``of the people, by the people, for the people.''  In this age where vast sums are spent on campaigns by a few billionaires to basically substitute government of, by, and for the people with government of, by, and for the powerful, we have an enormous challenge to maintain the integrity of the mission of our Constitution and the responsibility of this  We probably haven't seen a challenge to ``we the people'' in years like the equivalent of Certainly, it is designed to plan for massive tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans of hundreds of billions of dollars and to rip healthcare away from 20 to 30 million ordinary working families.  What a travesty that is of our responsibility under our What amazingly misguided effort to do damage, rather than to assist and provide a foundation for families to thrive.  A few years ago, a woman came up to me at a fundraiser for multiple sclerosis--a walk--and she said: Things are so different this year, Senator, than they were last year.  I asked her: How so?  She said: A year ago, if our loved one was diagnosed with MS and they had[[Page S6166]]insurance, they were likely to have an annual cap or a lifetime cap and run out of coverage.  That was a terrible situation to be in because MS is a mysterious and expensive disease.  She said: If the individual didn't have insurance, they now had a preexisting condition, and they wouldn't able to get insurance.  She said: Now, we have the peace of mind that if our loved one gets an MS diagnosis, that individual will be able to get the care they need.  Isn't that the summary of what we should be seeking in our healthcare system--the peace of mind that if our child or our loved one becomes ill, if our child or our loved one becomes injured, he or she will get the care they need? Shouldn't that be what we are fighting for?  Instead, we had the opposite. We had the TrumpCare bill that was designed to rip peace of mind away, destroy peace of mind, trample all over peace of mind so the wealthy could have more giveaways from the Federal  We had that House bill, and it was estimated that 23 million people would lose healthcare over 10 years and that our hospitals and our clinics would have a lot less funding to be able to provide care to everyone. Yet it passed the Then President Trump got briefed on what was in the bill after he held a champagne party at the White House and celebrated its passage. He said: Oh, wait. This bill is mean and heartless.  Over here in the Senate, the Senate's secret 13 went to work to try to produce a bill without holding any public hearings or having any discussions with stakeholders. They were secreted away in a room, and no one could find out where they were in order to be able to offer any insights. They did not hold any townhalls back home, and they had no meetings here. The public was totally blocked out. The secret 13, amazingly, came up with an almost identical bill to the House bill. Oh, the estimate was instead, maybe, of there being 23 million people who would lose insurance, 22 million people would lose insurance. Fortunately, the secret 13 bill was defeated--but just barely--here in this  Then came another version of this called the fake insurance bill. This fake insurance version said: Hey, let's let the insurance companies put out policies that are really, really cheap but that do not actually cover anything. Won't that make us feel good that everyone in America will be able to afford a policy that only costs $40 or $50 a month.  Of course, fake insurance is fake; that is, when you go to the emergency room, it does not cover the visit. When you get a blood test, it does not cover the blood test. When you get an x ray or an MRI, it does not pay for it. Oh, don't even begin to think about its covering hospitalization or any other normal medical service because it is fake insurance. The fake insurance bill failed by a few votes on the Senate floor.  Then we had repeal without replacement, and that failed. Then we had the skinny bill, and that failed by a single vote.  How is it possible that we came that close to passing a bill that is completely the opposite of the vision of our Constitution--to legislate for the foundation, for the American people, not the American privileged and not the American powerful. Yet it came within a vote of passing.  This week, we have the block grant version--the block grant version that proceeds to destroy immediately the exchanges, the healthcare marketplaces. Of course, the great irony is, that was the Republican idea: Let's create a marketplace within which people can compare individual policies, pick the ones best for their families, and get tax credits to be able to buy them. So the Republicans came out against their own plan.  In addition, it wiped out Medicaid expansion. In my home State of Oregon, the exchange is responsible for roughly another 100,000 people getting access to insurance, the marketplace, and 400,000 people gaining access through Medicaid expansion. There are a half a million Americans in just my State, my humble State of Yet here was a bill that said: We do not care. We are going to wipe out healthcare for a half a million Oregonians and untold millions across the country--20 to 30 million across the country.  We owe a big thank-you to grassroots We owe a big thank-you to ordinary citizens who believe in the vision of this country. They proceeded to connect with Capitol Hill--to fill the streets and to flood the phones and to overflow our inboxes--saying: What are you doing? Please stop. Please stop trying to destroy the peace of mind of They said: Make healthcare work better, not worse.  Is that really too much for us to ask?  As we ponder how to make healthcare work better, those in grassroots America have expressed a lot of ideas. They have said: We have a really complicated system that creates all kinds of obstacles for ordinary families, for working families.  For example, consider whether you have a job that provides you with insurance and your family with insurance but then the company changes the policy and only covers you. How are you going to get your children covered? Are you going to be able to get them signed up right away in the Children's Health Insurance Program? How do you go about doing that?  Then your employer says: By the way, you now have to start paying us in order for us to provide you with healthcare.  You say: That is a huge chunk out of my check. Can I possibly afford that and still pay my rent? Am I going to have to choose between healthcare and homelessness? It is not a choice families should have to make.  Then, perhaps, people are working several part-time jobs, and their employers have no healthcare programs at all, so they sign up for the Oregon Health Plan or the equivalent Medicaid plan across the country. They might like that, but it is complicated to apply, and they have to reapply periodically. What happens if their incomes go up just a little, and now they are over the line for eligibility? As a result of being over the line, they now have to go back into the individual markets. How do you do that in the middle of the year when it is not an open enrollment period?  There is such complexity, such difficulty. That is why it is so appealing to think about the vision of a seamless, simple healthcare program that you have that will provide quality healthcare when you need it--portable healthcare--just by virtue of your being an That is a beautiful vision, and it is not out of reach. Every other developed country has found some version of that and made it a reality. We need to ponder as to how to have that seamless, simple system down the road, but right now we have a more immediate task.  That immediate task is to stop the sabotage of the healthcare system we have. President Trump has engaged in many maneuvers to try to force the collapse of the insurance markets. One is to withhold the cost-sharing payments from insurers so they no longer have the funds they were promised. That uncertainty has caused many companies to say: Do not count on us to be in that market in the future if we cannot count on you, the Federal Government, to honor your obligations.  Why isn't the Senate body demanding that the President honor the obligations of those cost-sharing payments?  In addition, we have the President shutting down advertising during the open period so people will not know they can sign up. We have President Trump cutting the enrollment period in half. We have a plan now from the administration to cut the funds for consumer outreach and enrollment assistance, which enables folks who need to get healthcare to find out how they can actually get through the complicated application process.  Most recently, the administration announced it is actually going to shut down the website periodically on weekends during the open enrollment period, which is when people will have the time and effort and ability to apply. They are going to shut down the website so people will not be able to apply during portions of the weekend.  All of us should unite--100 Senators should unite--and tell President Trump: Enough of this sabotage. If you want to drive up insurance policies by 20 percent over any other increase they might otherwise have and if you want[[Page S6167]]to be responsible for millions of people not gaining access because of your irresponsibility, then we are going to hold you accountable for it. Everybody in grassroots America is going to hold you accountable for it.  Fortunately, we have a bipartisan process that has been underway to remedy these conditions. I, profoundly, thank Lamar Alexander, chair of the HELP Committee, and Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on the HELP Committee, for saying: Let's have the normal, rational process that we go through to try to understand how we can improve the healthcare system.  They have held a series of hearings. They have brought in the experts, and they have brought in the stakeholders. They have done it in front of the public so the public can weigh in. They have consulted constituents and encouraged all of us to consult with our constituents and be part of that conversation. Pragmatic, experienced legislators are gaining expertise from those on the frontline so they can make the system work better. Isn't that the way the Senate is supposed to work?  Their work shows a lot of promise. There are some very straightforward things they have heard from those experts.  They have heard we need to lock down the cost-sharing payments. No insurance companies are going to be in the insurance markets if they do not know they are going to get paid what they have been promised or they are going to raise their premiums incredibly high to cover the risk that they will not get paid. Then, of course, people will not be able to afford that insurance.  They have heard from the experts that you have to have reinsurance. If you want to have this private marketplace in which people can compare policies and use tax credits to buy the policies, an insurance company will not enter that market unless it has its own insurance policy against getting the disproportionate share of the really sick people. Of reinsurance, they have heard.  They have also heard we must not suppress outreach to those who need insurance but increase outreach--outreach to younger, healthier people to make sure they are part of the exchange as well as outreach to those who are often working several part-time jobs and have little time to focus on this question unless someone reaches out and says: Here is your opportunity. We are now in the open period. Here is how you sign up, and we can make sure you get that done.  In that set of hearings, they heard other things. They heard we need to do more to take on the challenge of mental illness in They heard we need to do more to take on drug addiction, the opioid epidemic in  There it is--a list of a modest number of things we could do together to make our healthcare work better. Wouldn't that be a beautiful closing chapter to the nightmare, the repeated horror stories we have been playing in the Senate that threaten to rip healthcare from millions of people and simply awaken from that war over healthcare and work together to address these fundamental questions.  We actually have had public hearings in the HELP Committee, which we have not done before. We have actually listened to the experts, which we have not done before. We have actually encouraged people to consult with their constituents rather than to hide from their constituents. The result would be a significant strengthening of what we have--lower premiums as a result, more competition in the exchanges, more awareness of how to sign up, more and healthier young people getting involved in the exchanges, which means the premiums will come down.  I think, as we ponder the goal of our healthcare system--the question of peace of mind--that is our best immediate step forward to provide peace of mind, to end the sabotage of the system we have, and address the shortcomings the healthcare experts and the people of America have pointed out.  Let us be that mission statement under this vision of a ``we the people'' government, in that we pursue healthcare that is designed for the people of America in order to create peace of mind, so when their loved ones become ill or when their loved ones are injured, they will get the care they need, and they will not end up bankrupt. We should be able to make that happen.  Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

398,topic-id,1380,"Mr.President, climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. It affects everything from our farms to our forests, to our fisheries. We see the impact from disappearing ice sheets and melting permafrost and glaciers. We see it in the coral reefs. We see it in the moving insect populations. We see it in the more powerful storms.  In response, communities across our globe are transforming their energy economies. They are working on energy efficiency, certainly--more efficient appliances and a little more mileage in their cars. Yet many are also working to transform their energy economies from a fossil fuel energy economy to a renewable energy economy.  How much do you know about the changes that are underway? Let's find out.  Welcome to episode 5 of the Senate Climate Disruption Here we go. Here is the first question.  This August, an electric 500 horsepower Tesla Model X SUV raced a 740 horsepower Lamborghini Aventador SV in a quarter-mile drag race. Who won? Was it the 500 horsepower electric Tesla or the 740 horsepower Lamborghini? Was the race called off or did they tie?  Take a moment. Feel free to lock in your answer.  The answer is, the Tesla won the race. The Tesla won the race, despite the fact that it had far less horsepower. In fact, it set a record for an SV in a quarter mile. It beat the Lamborghini by about 500ths of a second.  It just goes to help demonstrate the incredible torque and acceleration that comes with electric power, and if you have ever tried driving a Tesla and had it accelerate so fast that it pinned you against the back of the seat, you would know what I am talking about.  Let's turn to question 2. Taking a page from the white roof movement, which city in America has begun painting its streets white in order to lower temperatures? Is it the city of Phoenix, AZ? Is it Austin, TX? Is it Kansas City, MO, or perhaps Los Angeles, CA?  The answer is, among those cities, Los Angeles, You may have seen this in the news. After a heat wave and recordbreaking temperatures, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced plans to cut the average temperature in L.by 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next two decades.  One of the keys to doing this is to coat the city's roads in something called CoolSeal, which is a light-colored paint. Originally, it was a paint that was developed by engineers for military air bases so as to keep spy planes cool while they were resting on the tarmac. CoolSeal keeps streets and parking lots 10 degrees cooler than does black asphalt.  This is an interesting innovation, and I am sure the work L.does will help create information for other cities because cities are heat islands. Because of the asphalt, they are often much hotter than the surrounding countryside.  Question 3. In which State do 31 communities face an imminent threat of destruction from climate disruption? Is it 31 communities in Utah or in Michigan or in Alaska or in New Hampshire?  The correct answer is Alaska is experiencing a tremendous increase in the vulnerability of towns, which is the result of melting ice sheets; therefore, the storms closer approach. There are higher seas and more violent storms so we are seeing a real assault on those ocean communities. For one community of 600 people, it is estimated it would cost about $180 million to relocate all of the residents.  Meanwhile, the Trump administration is moving to dismantle climate adaption programs, like the Denali Commission, which have provided Federal assistance to safeguard or relocate communities that are at risk from rising sea levels, storms, and disappearing sea ice.  This takes us to question 4. Of the following statements, which statement is not true; that is, which of these four statements is false? Is it that July 2017 was the second hottest month on record? Is the false statement that only one country is not signed on to the Paris climate agreement? Is it statement C, that climate disruption played no part in the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma? Is it statement D, that the United States is now producing 43 times as much solar energy as it did in 2007?  Three statements are true, and one is false. The false statement is statement It is, in fact, July 2017 that was the second hottest month on record. In fact, we had a recent period during which each month was the hottest month on record in the calendar year. That extended for about 16 months in a row not so long ago.  Then, indeed, only one country is not signed on to the Paris climate agreement. That country is Syria, which is in the grip of a ferocious civil war. Nicaragua had not signed on, but it has signed on now. The United States has withdrawn or expressed its intention to withdraw, but it will not actually go off the Paris accord until the year 2020. So there is just one country, and that is also true.  It is true that solar power has increased 43 times in a 7-year period. We certainly know climate disruption does not cause hurricanes, but we also know the hotter temperature of the ocean causes the hurricanes we have to be much more powerful and much more destructive.  In the days leading up to Harvey, the sea surface temperatures in Texas were 3 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit above average. We saw this same phenomenon when Hurricane Sandy struck the Atlantic coast, where temperatures were 5 degrees or more above average.  Let's turn to question 5. Some scientists say we need to invent a device to pull carbon out of the air. Which of the following would accomplish that task? Would it be permafrost, wind turbines, glaciers, or trees? We do not think of any of these as an invention by humankind, but one of these processes that exists currently in nature does have a big impact in pulling carbon out of the air.  The answer is D, trees. Of course, that is a process we see during which, every year, the carbon dioxide level in the air surges when the leaves come off the trees and then decreases in the spring when the leaves are on the trees because they start pulling more carbon dioxide out of the air. So we need a lot more force in order to reduce carbon pollution.  The challenge is, worldwide, we are not adding to our forests. We are, in fact, losing our forests. In 2015, we lost about 47 percent more forested land than we did in 2001. The rate of deforestation is actually increasing so we need to be doing the reverse. We need to be ending deforestation and adding forests. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  In 2015, we lost about 49 million acres of forest around the world. We lost it because of wildfires, because of logging, and because of expanding agriculture. That is about the size of Picture it. In a single year, we lost forests that were the size of That is bad news in the fight against climate disruption because deforestation accounts for more than 10 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, not to mention that forests play an incredibly important role in supporting diversified ecological systems around the globe.  So there we have it--this week's episode 5 of the Senate Climate Disruption These are questions ripped right from the headlines. The facts on the ground are changing rapidly as the pace of climate disruption increases. This is the single biggest test facing humankind. It is a test that calls on every one of us to respond.  It is simply a fact that the devastation we have witnessed recently in[[Page S6127]]Houston, TX, is far more dramatic because of climate disruption and carbon pollution. It is simply a fact that the devastation we just witnessed in Florida is far worse than the disruption and the devastation that would have occurred otherwise. That is why we all need to keep working to tackle this challenge. The United States should be in the lead in taking on the seminal challenge of humankind in our generation.

1033,topic-id,1129,"Mr.President, anyone who watches the news, reads the newspaper, or goes on social media knows there are a lot of bad things happening in our world. Folks at home and across the globe are confronting devastations from hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, wars, and forest fires, as in my home Tensions between the United States and North Korea have never been higher, reaching a dangerous level. The world is watching all of this with bated breath.  In the midst of this deluge of news, a human rights catastrophe is unfolding virtually unnoticed. I am talking about the members of the Burmese military engaging in horrific acts of unthinkable violence against the Rohingya--a Muslim minority population in a predominantly Buddhist nation.  The Burmese military, along with civilian accomplices, have slaughtered more than 3,000 innocent civilians. They have raped thousands of Rohingya women. They have beheaded children as young as 6 years old. They have burned countless villages to the ground. Through these brutal acts, the Burmese military has driven half a million Rohingya refugees to camps in nearby Bangladesh, with Burmese soldiers continuing to shoot at them as they try to cross the border--a border, by the way, along which landmines have been laid by the Burmese military.  The brutality of what is happening in that country is truly beyond comprehension. The Burmese Government calls it a security operation, but we need to call it exactly what it is--ethnic cleansing. So often I have heard the words ``never again,'' that the United States will stand up to ethnic cleansing. This is one of those moments when we must stand up.  What is happening in Burma is a crime against humanity. As a country, we have more responsibility to take a stand and to speak out against it, to make the world take notice of the atrocities, call for their end, and to work toward their end.  The Rohingya are a people trapped in a cycle of violence and persecution by the Burmese Government and military. The Government of Burma has turned them into stateless people--refusing to recognize them, refusing to give them citizenship in spite of the fact that much of the Rohingya community has been there for centuries. They need our help.  The Burma Government has adopted laws that ban the Rohingyas from traveling without official permission, from owning land, from securing a public education, from obtaining employment by either a state or private business.  When the Burmese Government says that it will welcome back the refugees who can prove their citizenship, they are being completely disingenuous and completely treacherous, because they know--and the whole world should know--that the very laws of Burma make it impossible for the Rohingya to prove their citizenship since they have been denied citizenship by the Government of We cannot sit idly by and let ethnic cleansing continue.  One nation that has stepped up is As the leaders of Burma have persecuted the Rohingya and burned the villages and shot the refugees as they were fleeing, the Government of Bangladesh has opened its door. It has proceeded to allow humanitarian groups access and the United Nations access. This is commendable, but more needs to be done. These refugee camps are overcrowded. There are not enough supplies, clean toilets, food, or clean water. Doctors Without Borders says that they are on the brink of a ``public health disaster.'' Unlike Bangladesh, other countries have yet to speak up.  Indeed, I am concerned by reports that some factions within India have been explicitly, publicly seeking to expel India's own Rohingya population. It is important for the international community to weigh in with them and to ask them to respect international law and to protect the Rohingya refugees. India knows full well that there is nowhere to send them. If they send them back to Burma, there will just be more persecution of the men, the women, and the children.  It underscores the fact that the Rohingya need help and that the world should answer the call. As we do, we must use what influence we have to put an end to the violence and the persecution of this ethnic minority. We need to call on Burma's leaders to protect these minorities, not to assist in the[[Page S6212]]persecution. We need to call on the Government of Burma to immediately give humanitarian groups access to the Rohingya who are trapped in Burma, in what some have described as concentration camps. We need to call on Burma's leaders to provide the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who have been forced to flee their homes and villages with a safe and assisted right of return.  In addition, the Burmese Government--the Burmese nation--needs to figure out how to end the root causes of this conflict--an age-old ethnic and religious conflict--and find a way to embrace the diversity within their nation. Certainly, this is not the first time that the tensions have erupted into violence. It has happened time and time and time again, but this is the worst we have ever seen.  Kofi Annan, the former U.Secretary General, is the current chairman of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine He and his team have called on Burma to take the appropriate actions to end this cycle of violence, this cycle of radicalization.  The entire Rohingya community is counting on us--the world--to notice and to act. We must immediately see an end to the violence, full access for humanitarian organizations, cooperation with and access for the United Nations fact finding mission, the safe return of refugees, and the implementation of the full set of recommendations from Kofi Annan's report.  It is also critical that the United States and the international community continue to shed light on this horrific problem, provide sustained aid and support to the refugees in Burma and in Bangladesh, and take action to show other repressive governments that there will be consequences for pursuing this type of persecution, starting with a strong U.Security Council resolution.  International action to end this violence, increase humanitarian assistance, and extend our aid to the Rohingya people is the right thing to do. I pray that together we will answer that call.  I also thank my colleagues who have already been engaged in this issue. There are a number of them, but I am particularly aware of Senator Richard Durbin's, Senator John McCain's, and Senator Ben Cardin's involvement and leadership.  Let's build on that foundation to have the Senate demonstrate attention to this issue through letters, and we should also try to arrange a Senate trip to visit both Burma and Bangladesh in order to draw additional international attention and build momentum for action.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgS6205-2.txt,1900,1845,2017.0,28.0,September

626,topic-id,508,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for leading this Special  Mr.Speaker, in 1971, then-President Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs, which he labeled as ``public enemy number one in the United States.''  Now, at the time of this declaration, America's prisons and jails held fewer than 200,000 people. Today, that number sits at over 2 million people. In fact, the United States incarcerates 25 percent of the world's prisoners, but we have only 5 percent of the world's population.  In fact, shamefully, my State of Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate of African-American men on the planet  Now, John Ehrlichman, then-counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under President Nixon, admitted, Mr.Speaker, that the war on drugs was an effort to vilify African-American leaders and to disrupt the African-American community; admitted that the war on drugs was contrived to diminish the reputation of African Indeed, they were successful because the burden of this failed war has fallen overwhelmingly on African-American communities.  In 2014, African-American adults accounted for just 14 percent of those who used drugs, but close to one-third of those who are arrested for drug possession. And although African Americans and Whites consume drugs at a similar rate, African Americans are significantly more likely to be arrested.  Now, this disproportionate enforcement of drug laws in a nation in which racial groups use drugs at the same rate points to one fact, Mr.It can only be explained that race has played an inappropriate role in law enforcement's priorities and tactics.  It is worth noting that in the face of the 1980's crack cocaine epidemic in Black communities, the public policy response was incarceration. Here in 2017, in the face of our current opioid epidemic in predominantly White communities, public officials on both sides of the aisle have banded together to pass landmark legislation to provide drug treatment assistance to those victims.  In recent years, fortunately, leaders on both sides of the aisle have found common ground on the need to reform our broken criminal justice system. Stakeholders from the ACLU to the Koch Institute recognize the crisis of[[Page H7480]]overcriminalization in this country and the need for immediate action.  Both the House and the Senate have made strides toward the passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform in the 114th Congress, but, ultimately, a bill never made its way to the  Now our U.Attorney General of the United States, Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, a most ardent opponent to bipartisan criminal justice reform, sits there and does not inspire hope that those fighting to address this obviously harmful and race-based status quo will do anything.  And although our President has dubbed himself the ``Law and Order President,'' he has not taken the initiative to end this unfair policy.  Just very briefly before I close, Mr.Speaker, I want to list three things that this bipartisan group found would be helpful:  One, we should eliminate Federal mandatory minimum sentencing requirements. We should ensure true sentencing parity among crack and cocaine offenses, and deprioritize nonviolent drug offenders and seek medical treatment.

253,topic-id,991,"Madam President, it is nice to see the ranking member of the Commerce Committee on the floor today. I appreciate that he and I share a particular view about the privatization of air traffic control.  Today, we are going to presumably pass a 6-month extension for the Federal Aviation It was passed by the House earlier today, and once again we are in a position which, in my view, we shouldn't be in. We ought to be passing a long-term authorization of the Federal Aviation Last year, we did so. The Senate, with 95 votes, passed a 4-year FAA bill. It was the kind of meaningful, bipartisan accomplishment that is too rare in Congress today.  I supported that bill, but unfortunately when it was sent to the House and it came time to meet that last year's deadline, we were ultimately forced to pass a short-term extension--which I opposed.  Our ongoing efforts to pass a long-term bill, Republicans and Democrats in both Chambers of Congress, have found common ground and consensus among the entire aviation community on a wide range of important issues.  I am talking about reforms to strengthen the Contract Power Program, one of the most and overwhelmingly popular and successful FAA programs. That matters a lot to the State of Kansas, and communities in the State of Nebraska as well, the home of the Presiding Officer in the  I am talking about streamlining the aircraft certification process that allows the FAA to focus its valuable resources elsewhere while generating a positive impact on our economy and job security in the aviation manufacturing sector. Because, once again, Congress refuses to set aside the perpetually controversial proposal to privatize our Nation's air traffic control, we are left, again, with a short-term extension. It is another one of those take-it-or-leave-it moments that is occurring here at the eleventh hour in advance of September 30.  We know in the Senate this proposal for privatization will never have the votes to pass. Yet we keep considering short-term extensions that are damaging to the aviation community, particularly the airports that need certainty in planning their infrastructure projects, and they will be, first and foremost, to improve the safety for our air travelers.  A 6-month extension, in my view, is too short to provide the certainty that is needed. The grant process, at the Department of Transportation, will be ongoing, but no airport can plan based upon whether the FAA is going to be authorized 6 months from now.  I have come to the floor numerous times before to talk about how Kansas is a special place when it comes to aviation. Kansas has built three out of every four general aviation aircraft since the Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Today, over 40,000 Kansans earn a living in manufacturing, operating, and servicing our world's highest quality aircraft. These aviation businesses and their employees depend upon our ability to compete in a global marketplace, an ability which is significantly damaged when we are putting off passage of a long-term reauthorization bill not just once but year after year.  While general aviation manufacturing is our State's largest industry, it is not just those manufacturers and their employees who understand the problems and ramifications with privatization of air traffic control.  I have often said on the floor that I think at times I get categorized, as a Senator from Kansas, as a State that manufactures lots of airplanes and that my views are therefore solely related to the airplane manufacturing sector. I certainly bring that perspective to Congress, and I speak often and work often on behalf of the manufacturing of aircraft. But any of us who represent airports and communities that are not the largest in the country ought to oppose the privatization of air traffic control.  This is not the traditional rural-versus-urban argument that occurs sometimes around here. This is not about little towns versus everybody else. This is about everyone except for the largest cities with the largest airports and the most travelers. So this is not about just Garden City, KS; or Manhattan, my hometown; or Hays, my former hometown. This is about Wichita and This is about Kansas All but the absolutely largest airports would be damaged by the privatization of air traffic control.  We have said this many times. It is important to the manufacturers, but it is also important to the survival of communities that I represent and that all of my colleagues represent across the country.  Everywhere I go in Kansas, I am reminded that ATC privatization is a bad idea. The idea that we would allow a 13-member private board to make decisions about the future of airports and air transportation across the country is troublesome. Moreover, even the major providers of aircraft and avionics equipment that reside in Kansas--those businesses that create thousands of jobs in my State--are perhaps even more outspoken against privatization than anyone. These businesses know that privatization of the Nation's most complex air system is a solution without a problem that will ultimately create lots of problems, lots of unintended consequences.  Americans expect leadership from their elected officials in At a time when partisan dysfunction puts up constant barriers in the legislative process, we should be doing everything we can to find common ground and pass legislation that will have immediate positive impacts on our economy. For so much of the FAA reauthorization last year and again this year, we found that common ground--except for this one divisive[[Page S6204]]issue that we know ultimately will not become law. It impedes the opportunity to do what, without almost any exception, Members of the House and Senate have agreed to.  True FAA reform will dramatically increase the ability of American aviation manufacturers and businesses to create jobs. This short-term extension represents yet another regrettably missed opportunity to do just that.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse).

841,topic-id,910,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Cliff, for the introduction and all of your comments, and particularly for your leadership of Former Members of Congress during this year. You have done a superlative job.  Well, as you know, Former Members of Congress works with all Members of the congressional family. Our network also includes current Members of Congress and their senior staff to promote a collaborative, bipartisan, and effective approach to policymaking both at home and abroad.  Our flagship programs for our colleagues who are still in office are the Congressional Study Groups on Germany, Japan, and The Congressional Study Groups are independent, bipartisan legislative exchanges that strive to create better understanding and cooperation between the United States and our most important strategic and economic partners abroad.  Each study group has a membership roster of between 75 and 125 Members of Congress, and it is led by a bipartisan, bicameral pair of co-chairs who are currently in Our model celebrates active discussions among all participants, avoiding lengthy speeches or formal presentations, in order to create an atmosphere that promotes personal connections. We believe that the network of peers created via our programs have acted to renew and expand areas of mutual cooperation, especially in times of transition.  The Congressional Study Groups are not the only programs dedicated to this mission, but they are unique in their year-round outreach to Capitol Unlike other formats, we provide long-lasting staff support and maintain a well-respected reputation as independent and non-advocacy. As a result, our network attracts a large, diverse group of legislators and policymakers who are committed to international dialogue. What is most important for us is that they join the discussion.  A few highlights from the 114th Congress:  We hosted 62 roundtables in Washington, D.C., which are the foundation of our programming. Maintaining a year-round outreach ensures that we are developing meaningful relationships instead of having occasional encounters.  108 Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate and 204 senior congressional staffers participated in at least one of those roundtables; most participated in multiple programs.  We also organized 12 study tours abroad for Members of Congress and senior congressional staff because we know that immersive travel experiences have immense value.  Each trip is an opportunity for mutual learning and sharing, as well as forming bonds, with meeting partners and within the bipartisan delegation itself, and we know that is important.  Already, our programming calendar in the 115th Congress has been busy. In the first 6 months of 2017, we have organized three study tours for Members of Congress and three study tours for senior congressional staff.  Our roundtables on Capitol Hill also recently welcomed several senior officials, including the German Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, the chairman and CEO of Lufthansa, and a high-level delegation from the Japanese  I would like to acknowledge the service of all of our co-chairs for their hard work and dedication to these critical programs. Our co-chairs are true leaders, who not only serve in their role as official Study Group leaders, but are also called on by various embassies and outside organizations to speak on panels, attend roundtables, and meet with countries who have visiting delegations.  The Congressional Study Group on Germany is led by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Representative Charlie Dent, and Representative Ted We thank the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, for his service as a Senate co-chair until February 2017.  The Congressional Study Group on Japan is led by Senator Mazie Hirono, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Representative Diana DeGette, and Representative Billy  The Congressional Study Group on Europe is led by Senator John Boozman, Senator Chris Murphy, Representative Jeff Fortenberry, and Representative Peter We very much appreciate all their efforts in leadership.  I also want to mention that our work is not limited to the three main Study Groups on Germany, Japan, and For example, over the past 6 months, we have put a lot of energy into bringing Korea-focused programming to Capitol I don't have to tell you how important our relationship with South Korea is, and the many security and trade issues that shape this part of the world.  We, therefore, in addition to our ongoing focus on China, have commenced programming on We are very fortunate to have former Member Jay Kim chair this effort in Korea itself, and his leadership already has resulted in a number of incredibly informative Capitol Hill programs involving former and current  The work of the Congressional Study Groups is complemented by our Diplomatic Advisory Initially focused on European nations, the Diplomatic Advisory Council is now comprised of approximately 30 ambassadors from four continents who advise and participate in our programming. Their interest and commitment to multilateral dialogues is a very valuable addition to the Congressional Study Groups and provides a valuable outreach beyond our three Study  At the beginning of the 114th Congress, we also formed the Congressional Staff Advisory As former Members of Congress, we know the value of good staff. I always say my rock and my staff, they support me. The Staff Advisory Council formally recognizes the mutually beneficial relationships we have in offices across Capitol We are as grateful for the staff who participate in and support our group programming as we are for the Members of  Finally, I would like to add a thanks to those individuals, organizations, and corporations whose patronage makes our work possible.

777,topic-id,3063,"Mr.President, let me associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from There is a lot of work we need to do this week; she is right. There are healthcare crises right around the corner for millions of kids and families that we could be working on solving right now. As the Senator knows, both Connecticut and Massachusetts are still being wrecked by an opioid crisis--one that in my State is getting worse by the year, not better. We could be working together on that. We have brothers and sisters all throughout the United States who are right now in crisis because of devastating storms that have hit. We could be working together on trying to provide a meaningful response, and we aren't. Yet, again, we are back now talking about TrumpCare redux. This is version 10, version 11. I think there have been three versions already this week. This one is really the most dangerous version yet.  CBO just released a scaled-down analysis, noting that there was no way they would be able to provide a full analysis given the compressed schedule, given the need to pass this by the end of this week because of Republicans' desire to make sure that not a single Democrat is included in the negotiation. They gave us some hints as to what their score would say once it was fully completed.  Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by $1 trillion over the course of this decade. There is simply no way to rip $1 trillion out of the Medicaid system--the Medicaid system, by the way, as all my colleagues know, that provides insurance to the disabled, to children, and to the elderly--without millions of people losing access to healthcare, people who have nowhere else to go.  CBO unsurprisingly says that the number of people with comprehensive health insurance would be reduced by millions, and they predict that States would allow insurers to set premiums on the basis of an individuals' health status. None of that is news to people who have read this piece of legislation.  I want to talk for a second about why CBO comes to those conclusions and why this is the most dangerous version of the bill yet.  In this bill is a massive reordering of the American healthcare system. The healthcare exchanges, which right now insure millions of Americans across the country, are essentially eliminated under this bill because the whole reason they existed was to funnel tax credits that are attached to individuals based on their income to help them buy insurance. Those tax credits go away under this proposal; thus, the exchanges go away.  Medicare as an entitlement is ended by this bill. No longer will you as an individual have a payment from the Federal Government attached to you because of your income or your health status or your disability. States will now get a block sum of money to do essentially what they wish, which may or may not cover the same number of people today covered under  While proponents of this bill are trying to contend that it still protects people with preexisting conditions, no one is buying it, no one is believing it, because on the face of the text, it does not. It is important to explain why that is.  While technically it is up to the States as to whether they protect people with preexisting conditions, under this new version, States can just sign a form that allows them to permit insurers to price based on medical acuity again--meaning charge sick people more. They will have to exercise that option under this version of They will be forced to exercise that option because what is also eliminated by this version of TrumpCare is the requirement that healthy individuals buy insurance. You cannot require insurance companies to charge sick people the same as healthy people if you don't provide incentives for healthy people to sign up. There is no incentive, at least under the latest version of the bill that I read; thus, anybody who has taken a semester's worth of education on insurance practice will tell you that States will be faced with two choices: one, reimpose their own individual mandate--and I am going to guarantee you that based on the vitriol that has been launched against the individual mandate from Republicans in this Chamber and the House of Representatives over the past 6 years, most States will probably not take on their Republican Senators and congressional delegation by passing their individual mandate--or they will be forced to drop the protection for people with preexisting conditions.  CBO and JCT anticipate that many States--I would argue the majority of States--will have to drop that protection for people with preexisting conditions because they will not pass an individual mandate; thus, rates will skyrocket for sick people or anybody who has ever been sick, making insurance unaccessible for Americans who have had a cancer diagnosis or an addiction diagnosis or a mental illness diagnosis.  This bill is a massive reorientation of the American healthcare system, the elimination of Medicaid as we know it, the end of the healthcare insurance exchanges, the end of the tax credits to help people buy healthcare insurance, and the end of the mandatory national protections for people against abusive insurance practices. We are potentially going to vote on this later this week without a CBO score--with one hearing, with no markups.  I don't care how mad my Republican friends were about how the Affordable Care Act was passed. That was done in an open process, with dozens of hearings, with markups in every committee, with 30 days of debate on the floor of the U.Senate, with hundreds of Republican amendments that were offered and adopted as part of the affordable healthcare act, with over a year of public input and debate about the pros and cons of the proposal.  None of that is happening on Graham-This is being rushed through in the dead of night, with no time for Americans to review it, no time for Members of this body to look at it, and no ability for any Senator in the Democratic Party to be able to have any input into the final product. This is nothing like what happened on the Affordable Care No matter how mad you are that in the end you couldn't vote for it, Republicans had plenty of opportunity to have a say. The American people had plenty of opportunity to take a look at it. That is not happening with Graham- Because there is no CBO score, we have to rely on outside independent groups to size up the potential disaster of this bill. The Center for American Progress--which admittedly is a left-leaning organization but is one of the few that have taken the time to take a look at the text and what it will mean--came to the conclusion that 32 million people would lose coverage. The Commonwealth Fund, which is not a political organization, which is an independent, nonpartisan healthcare think tank, essentially came to the same conclusion, saying that after 2026, 32 million people would lose coverage. The Commonwealth Fund says that 15 to 18 million people could become uninsured by 2019.[[Page S6093]]  I have had this chart up here for 3 or 4 months, and I have had to adjust it over and over again because it started out with 23 million people losing insurance as we analyzed the first Republican repeal bill. Then, when the new version came in, you can see I had to write in 22 million people because the amended version that we were going to vote on right before the break was 1 million better. I had to redo my chart based upon this analysis of Graham-Cassidy, resulting in 32 million people losing insurance. Thirty-two million people. It is hard to understand how many people--32 million people will be losing insurance over the course of 10 years. That is the total population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, West We had to cross out Rhode Island, but then we had to add Mississippi, Arkansas, Vermont, Wyoming, and  Forgive me; I had to do my own artist's rendering of these States because the data is coming in so fast and the vote is coming so quickly, I didn't have time to have this chart made up again.  That is 32 million people. Think about that. Over 10 years, the equivalent population of all of these States--what is that? 17 States, 19 States--all losing healthcare at the same time. That is a humanitarian catastrophe, and nobody knows it because this bill is being pushed through without any debate, without any CBO score. That is what could happen if this passes.  It is no surprise that basically everybody in the American healthcare system opposes this piece of legislation. The proponents cannot find a single verifier inside the medical community for this piece of legislation.  This morning, I heard Senator Graham say: Well, that is to be expected. You know, we are making a big reform, and anytime you are making a big reform, the status quo players aren't going to like the result.  Well, that is a little unfair because the status quo for groups like the American Heart Association or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation or the American Cancer Society--the status quo for them is that their members--people who have cancer or juvenile diabetes or heart disease--don't go bankrupt any longer because they can't afford insurance. So, yes, they are kind of upset that 32 million people are going to lose insurance--many of their members--and that we are going to go back to the day in which if you are sick, if you have cancer, in most States, you can be charged more. So, yes, people are protective of the status quo--the part of the status quo that makes sure that sick people or people who have ever been sick don't lose insurance.  I think it is actually worthwhile for just a second--bear with me--to give a quick sense as to how many people in the medical community oppose this bill. Here is just a beginning list: the AARP, the School Superintendents Association, America's Health Insurance Plans, the ALS Association, America's Essential Hospitals, America's pediatric dentists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Association on Health and Disability, the American Cancer Society, the American Dental Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Diabetes Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Heart Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Lung Association, the American Osteopathic Association, the American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the Big Cities Health Coalition, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the Children's Hospital Association, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Endocrine Society, Family Voices, the Federation of American Hospitals, the HIV Medicine Association, the Human Rights Campaign, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Lutheran Services in America, Main Street Alliance, March of Dimes, the Medicare Rights Center, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the National Association of School Nurses, the National Alliance of State & Territorial AIDS Directors, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, the National Health Council, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the National Partnership for Women and Families, Planned Parenthood, the Arc Connecticut, the Arc of the United States, the Trust for America's Health, and 47 religious organizations representing various denominations, including American Muslim Health Professionals, Alliance of Baptists, Methodist Federation for Social Action, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Presbyterian Church of the United States, the United Church of Christ, and the United Methodist  That is the tip of the iceberg. You are not really in good company if you are supportive of this bill when every single medical association, every single patient advocacy organization, every single hospital association, every single insurer thinks that you are wrong. You would like to think there might be a couple of these groups who would think it was a good thing to pass a bill that uninsures potentially 32 million--maybe 25 million, maybe 22 million--and jeopardizes preexisting protections for millions of  What is so bonkers about this is that we were this close to getting a bipartisan agreement. It is not as if there wasn't another path. I sit on the HELP I had half a dozen conversations with Senator Alexander and Senator I know we were 80 percent of the way there on passing a bipartisan package of reforms--at least out of the HELP Committee--that would have kept what was working in the Affordable Care Act and tried to fix what wasn't working.  I saw Leader McConnell's tweet from earlier today in which he said that Senate Democrats have two thoughts on how to fix ObamaCare--one, do nothing; two, a fully government-run system that would take away even more of their decisions.  That is not true. That is not true, and everybody here knows that it is not true. Why? Because Senate Democrats were sitting down and talking with Senate We were at the table just a week ago, trying to come up with a package of reforms. So to say that the Democrats want only a single-payer healthcare system or what we have today is not true, and everybody knows that is not true.  I am certainly raw at the fact that Republicans walked away from that negotiating table when we were so close. I do not think that was in the best traditions of the U.Senate, but I am ready to sit back down at the table. I know that Patty Murray is ready to sit back down at the table if this process blows up, as every previous attempt at repealing the Affordable Care Act with a thoughtless alternative has blown up.  My constituents are not happy with the American healthcare system. They like a lot of the things the Affordable Care Act did, but they acknowledge there are still lots of problems that need to be solved. Amongst those constituents in my State who like what the Affordable Care Act has done but who still want to see changes are Isabelle and  Isabelle first wrote about her son to my office 2 days after the last election. This is Rylan, who was born with a congenital heart defect. He looked healthy when he was born. He and Isabelle had been scheduled for discharge from the hospital when Rylan went in for some routine testing, but he never came back. His parents kind of knew something was up, but when the doctors arrived back in their room, they told Isabelle and her husband that Rylan needed to be rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery because his body was not getting enough oxygen, and there was something wrong with his heart. He was diagnosed with several severe heart defects, and he required emergency open heart surgery.  The first thing Isabelle thought was: How are we going to pay for this? Does insurance cover it?  She found out, much to her relief, that insurance did cover it, because insurance was required to cover things like hospitalizations under the Affordable Care Act and that they would not lose coverage, because no matter how big the bills got, the Affordable Care[[Page S6094]]Act prohibited insurance companies from cutting her off.  Isabelle has been a warrior in preserving those protections in the Affordable Care Act, and I just want to leave you with an email that she sent me this week.  She writes that she is exhausted and that she is so tired of having to fight over and over and over again for She feels that no matter what she tries to do, this repeal is going to happen, regardless of Rylan's story, and that they are just going to be casualties of this political imperative to repeal the Affordable Care  In 3 weeks, Rylan is going to be going up to Boston for his big cardiac and neuro checkup. She wishes that their biggest fight were to keep him healthy and alive, but it is not. They are engaged in a political fight to try to stop the protections, which keep him alive and keep this family solvent, from being stolen from them.  This is not a game to Isabelle and to This is not about politics. This is about this little boy's life. I am going to tell you that my State cannot hold this together if you cut Federal funding for healthcare by 50 percent to Connecticut, as this bill would do--maybe more. What we are hearing is that money is going to be stolen from States that have implemented the Affordable Care Act in order to be delivered to the States of Senators who have not yet committed to the bill on the Republican side. We cannot hold it together for Rylan in Connecticut if you take away half of our Federal healthcare funding, if you take away the tax credits that help people buy insurance, if you take away the Medicaid that helps insure these kids--if you let insurers go back to the days in which they discriminated against these kids. It is not a game to  She writes:       Every time the repeal comes up (what is it--the third time      or more), I feel sick with anxiety. How quickly the rug will      be pulled from under us. How quickly the bricks will begin to      fall.  We are ready to work with you. We are ready to sit down, once again, and try to work something out that gets Democrats and Republicans together on this and that does what the American people want us to do--keep what works in the Affordable Care Act and improve what does not work. Please give this up. You are ruining the lives of these families who, in addition to having to save their children's lives, are having to become full-time political activists to stop this from happening.

203,topic-id,677,"Mr.President, before I begin on the nomination before us, I wish to first echo what so many of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--and millions of people across the country have made very clear today: enough with all of the partisanship around healthcare, enough with playing politics with people's lives, and enough with the repeated attempts to roll back all of our progress and move our country backward.  It is time that we drop Graham-Cassidy, drop TrumpCare, once and for all, and join together to actually work to improve healthcare, starting with acting right now to lower premiums for families and strengthen healthcare in a bipartisan way.  That has been my message to colleagues all along. The truth is that I know many of my Republican colleagues prefer a bipartisan route. They have said as much in the last TrumpCare debate, in the very productive discussions we have had in and outside of the HELP Committee, and in many of their comments over the past few days.  It begs this question: Why are we in this spot yet again?  People across the country have been demanding for months to turn the page on Instead of working in a bipartisan way to actually help people, a few of our colleagues have now pushed through yet another reckless repeal bill that is even worse than the previous TrumpCare version. It is a bill that will increase costs for families, especially seniors and people with preexisting conditions.  It will allow insurance companies once again to charge people more for basic healthcare, such as maternity care, mental health services, and more, and it will take away women's access to care at health centers like Planned Parenthood and result in millions of people across the country losing their Just like last time, the bill has not been subject to any real hearings, public debate, or even a complete and thorough CBO score.  Let's be clear. This bill is not a new proposal. It is not serious policy. It is not regular order. It is yet another version of TrumpCare that would be devastating for people across the country.  This is actually pretty simple because there is a clear alternative path before us. Let's do what my colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona, and so many others have so bravely called for once again and return to working together.  As I have said, I wholeheartedly agree with my colleague from Arizona that the right way to get things done in the Senate--especially on an issue as important to families as their healthcare--is through regular order and finding common ground. That is why I am still at the table ready to keep working. I remain confident that we can reach a bipartisan agreement as soon as this latest partisan approach by Republican leaders is finally set aside.  Mr.President, I come to the floor today on the nomination before us and to urge my colleagues to vote no on William Emanuel to be a Member of the National Labor Relations  On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to put workers first, but instead this administration has rolled back worker protections and prioritized corporate interests at the expense of our workers. It is critical today, more than ever, that the NLRB remain what it is supposed to be--independent and committed to protecting workers' rights to organize and to bargain collectively.  I am deeply concerned that President Trump's nominee, Mr.Emanuel, will use his place on the Board to advocate for corporations and special interests. As a corporate lawyer fighting on the side of management, Mr.Emanuel has spent decades repeatedly undermining workers and their efforts to unionize.  It is the core mission of the NLRB to encourage collective bargaining. Given his long anti-worker track record, I am afraid that workers' fundamental rights are not safe in his hands.  I urge my colleagues to join me tonight in doing what President Trump has failed to do and to start working to put working families first and to vote against this nomination.  I yield the floor.

145,topic-id,429,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.3229, which would extend an important tool in protecting the safety of judges and their families.  Each year, Federal judges and certain other judicial employees are required to file financial disclosure reports which are made available to the public. These reports serve a vital function in promoting transparency, particularly of any potential conflicts of interest.  By their nature, however, they also disclose sensitive personal information like a home address or family member's place of business. In the hands of a disgruntled member of the public seeking retribution or of an otherwise disturbed individual, this information could put judges and their families at great risk.                              {time}  1645  Under current law, the Judicial Conference may redact information from a financial disclosure form if publishing such information could endanger the safety of the filer or a member of the filer's family. Unless Congress acts, this redaction authority will expire on December 31 of this year. This commonsense bill simply extends the redaction authority for 10 years.  Unfortunately, many Federal judges face threats to their safety merely for doing their jobs, and according to the Judicial Conference, the number of threats against them are increasing. For example, an Ohio man recently pleaded guilty to arranging a murder-for-hire plot against a judge; an alleged ISIS sympathizer who was attempting to learn a judge's address was indicted a few months ago for threatening the judge; and last year, a California man, who was already in prison, was convicted of plotting to have the Federal judge, prosecutors, and FBI agents killed as revenge.  Sadly, earlier this year, we also saw threats against several judges who ruled against President Trump's Muslim ban. After the President himself launched a verbal assault against the judges and against the Federal judiciary more generally, the judges faced a cascade of online threats and they required heightened security measures. Even without such irresponsible and dangerous behavior by the President, Federal judges regularly face threats, and this legislation is an important tool in protecting their safety.  Although disclosure forms should only be redacted in the most extreme and limited circumstances, the Judicial Conference has used its redaction authority sparingly and wisely, and it should continue to have this authority available to it when circumstances warrant its use.  I appreciate Mr.Jeffries' leadership in introducing this legislation. I want to recognize Ranking Member Conyers for the work he has done to champion this issue over the years as well. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Mr.Issa for moving this bipartisan bill forward.  ",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgH7549.txt,850,NORTH KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,27.0,September
931,topic-id,572,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.2792, the hopelessly misnamed Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons  As has become sadly routine in this Chamber under Republican rule, this bill considers those merely accused of a crime as if they were convicted felons without bothering with little niceties like due process. Having dispensed with basic constitutional protections, the bill then cuts off vital government assistance to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  Under current law, the Social Security Administration helps law enforcement track down individuals with an outstanding arrest warrant for an alleged felony or an alleged violation of probation or parole. Those who are actively fleeing law enforcement can also have their Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, benefits terminated. Under this bill, however, SSI benefits, which serve as a lifeline for low-income seniors and people with disabilities, would be terminated, whether or not people are actually attempting to evade justice.  The mere issuance of a warrant or an alleged parole violation with no arrest,[[Page H7599]]no trial, and no conviction would be enough to cut off vital benefits to the neediest among us. This is not just unconstitutional, it is inhumane. The bill would ensure that many low-income seniors and people with disabilities will lose their benefits unfairly and unnecessarily.  The vast majority of people affected by this bill have outstanding warrants that law enforcement chooses not to bother serving, often because they are for very old or minor offenses. Many people do not even know that an arrest warrant has been issued for them, but this bill would consider them as felons fleeing justice.  Many warrants are issued on the basis of mistaken identity, inaccuracies, or paperwork errors. It can take months to resolve such errors, which might involve traveling to a distant jurisdiction, hiring an attorney, and working through an overloaded court system.  And supporters of this bill expect people living on less than $750 a month to do all of this: to go to a different jurisdiction, to hire an attorney, to do all of this while the benefits they rely on to subsist are cut off?  That is outrageous.                              {time}  1000  We heard from the gentlewoman from South Dakota about various exceptions to the bill, you can go through this process and that process. With what attorney? With what money? Does this bill have an appropriation in it to supply attorneys for people faced with this cutoff, people who, by definition, are the poorest people, who can't afford an attorney?  This legislation is a blatant violation of due process, and it will cause untold suffering to the people who need our help the most. At a time when Republicans are unveiling their proposal for massive tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill is a shameful illustration of the majority's priorities.  It is also a shameful illustration of something we have seen on this floor too often, and that is the assumption that anyone accused of something is guilty and that we don't have to bother with a trial, we don't have to bother with proof, and we don't have to bother with due process. That eviscerates much of the reason for the existence of this country, to vindicate due process, to give people rights and not to assume that anyone who a judge or someone thinks may have committed a crime is automatically guilty. We believe in due process in this country.  Mr.Speaker, I urge this bill's defeat.  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgH7595.txt,850,1545,2017.0,28.0,September

465,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I stand in opposition to H.3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, for one simple reason. This is an anemic response to these disasters, whether they occur on the mainland of the United States or within American possessions.  This should have been done on Friday afternoon with the two parties working together. Instead, once again, this was put together by one party, with minimal input from our side. These are all[[Page H7464]]members of the American family that have been impacted by what has happened with this terrible weather.  The chance here for us to work together to make this an expanded package, where we could be talking about a host of opportunities for these folks who have been put in such a precarious situation, is now being missed. There are 90 Members of this Congress who actually voted against direct aid in the past for relief for members of the American family, where we should have taken the position here, clearly: Let's try to figure out what we can do for a robust tax package, what we can do for immediate aid, and highlight the role that FEMA plays. And I certainly have expressed to Mr.Curbelo time and again I am there on board. I just think this needs to be more, and I think that is the position that we are offering today.  Furthermore, a partisan position had to be taken in terms of many priorities that we should have been consulted on, and even those could have been turned into bipartisan moments. I support the disaster relief that is in this bill, but it is clear that the package is woefully inadequate. I would hope that we could work together on these provisions.  The disaster relief package included in this bill does not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that will drive investment and speed up recovery in the American communities that include Texas, Florida, the U.Virgin Islands, and Puerto Without the fix that we want on this side, the effect of lost revenue is going to mean that money is lost that otherwise would be needed for normal operations and the response effort. It is going to take years to adequately respond to what has happened and the devastation that these folks are up against. We need to be sitting here, both parties working together, to say: They are all members of the American family. Let's get it done.  I consider this a missed opportunity, and I hope that we can do more in the next few days to get back on track to help them bounce back from these, indeed, tragedies. We should be sitting down here in the next 48 hours and putting together a massive package of relief for these States and for these possessions and making sure that they have what is necessary, rather than doing a piecemeal fix on what is sure to be a very tormented time for members of these communities and these States and these possessions.

I just don't think this is the moment to be discussing the flood insurance initiatives. Instead, I think that ought to be subject to a full-throttled debate in this[[Page H7466]]institution about getting those things done. This is not, I think, the appropriate forum for accomplishing that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Mr.Mr.Speaker, this is purportedly an absolutely essential extension of authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration to continue to operate after October 1. Unfortunately, it has devolved into other issues because it has turned into a Christmas tree on the Republican side of the aisle.  We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation The last time Congress failed to do this--and the ticket tax, which is what pays for air traffic control in America, expired--almost every airline in America raised their rates 7.5 percent, got a $400 million windfall, which the government lost, with the exception of two: I understand, Alaska and  So if we fail to reauthorize, we can expect that that will happen again.  Actually, their long-term plan is to privatize the FAA, do away with the ticket tax, reap a $10 billion windfall, and then impose a new per-head fee to use our national airspace, which, by the way, Congress will have nothing to say about that. No elected official will have any authority over what new fees they charge. That is extraordinary.  That came out of the Republican side of the Ways and Means What a bunch of losers. Come on. Give me a break. You are going to allow the airlines to have the authority, a private corporation, to tax people in America, and then say: Oh, it is not a tax; it is a user fee.  It sure feels like a tax to me, and it is going to feel like that to your constituents. But when they complain, you will say: Oh, go talk to the private corporation.  That is why we are here today, because the chairman of the committee has stubbornly persisted in attempting to privatize the air traffic organization of the United States of America, the most complex, the most efficient, and the safest system in the world.  Yes, there are a few reforms that are needed there. Most of them have to do with us. Congress sequesters their money. Even though there is enough money raised in the ticket tax and other taxes to pay for the system, we sequester their money, we shut them down. We do dumb things like that.  So I introduced a bill to take care of those problems, to exempt them from sequestration; to exempt them from budget shutdowns; and to require reforms in their personnel procedures, their policy procedures in terms of acquisitions; and to enhance the role of their coordinating committee, which has been doing a great job coordinating between the government and the airlines and all the people who use the system, not just the commercial airlines; and authorize funds to rebuild some of the major air traffic control centers, which are falling apart.  Instead, the chairman has insisted that we must privatize because Canada did it, which is kind of a tiny fraction of what we are.  Then the airlines have this fake group called the Citizens for On Time Flights, who say:       We have to fly zigzag routes, which are World War II radar.  Actually, we have deployed a system where you could fly all the planes in America closer together with GPS, but the airlines haven't bought the equipment, so they are blaming the That kind of stinks. So that is why we are here today.  We have a bill that otherwise is totally agreed upon. If we were voting today on an FAA bill to give them a 6-year extension without privatization, with the reforms we need, we would be pressuring the Senate to get something done.  Now, the Senate is hung up over whether or not you should have 1,500 hours of experience to sit in the copilot's seat. After the tragic Colgan accident, reforms were adopted that made these requirements. So they are hung up on that. On this side, we are hung up on privatizing the system.  So it is sad that we have come to this point today. My hope is that we will move forward soon in the bipartisan tradition of my committee, and we will move an FAA bill and any amendments that are allowed, or any riders or anything that is in it will have only to do with aviation, not to do with flood insurance, not to do with any of all these other miscellaneous things that are being thrown in here today.

People in Kentucky think that they invented basketball. It was actually invented in But I want to thank him personally, as well as professionally, for the good work that he has done in helping to bring about this day.  As the Hall of Fame celebrates its 125th anniversary of the invention of basketball, this commemorative coin symbolizes all the sport has accomplished since its humble beginnings in a YMCA gymnasium in Springfield, This truly American game continues to be played by men and women at every level and on every continent.  In December of 1891, a physical education professor named James Naismith created a game with a simple objective: throw a round ball into a peach basket that was suspended 10 feet above the ground. While only one basket was made available during those first games, it would soon become quite popular with students.  Thanks to the network of YMCAs throughout the country and the game's success on various college campuses, the sport soon became a national phenomenon. By 1894, basketball was being played around the Nation and in dozens of countries around the world.  During the 1920s and 1930s, teams like the Original Celtics and the New York Renaissance carried professional basketball to the national conscience for the first time.                              {time}  1630  Internationally, popularity of the new sport from America led to the formation of the International Basketball Federation, which was pivotal in adding basketball to the Summer Olympic Games in 1936. Eventually, the National Basketball Association was founded in 1946, and continues to enjoy great success.  The Basketball Hall of Fame inducted its first class in 1959, despite the lack of any physical structure. They would get their first home on the campus of Springfield College in 1968, just a short way from the game's first site.  Thousands of visitors came to the campus to see memorabilia and be inspired by the stories of the sport's early days. As the game skyrocketed in national popularity in the 1980s, with icons like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan, the Hall of Fame found the need to expand. As the mayor of Springfield at the time, I helped to ensure a location on the banks of the Connecticut  In 1985, the Hall reopened with a three-level museum with hundreds of pieces of memorabilia and displays. The admiration for the sport forced the Hall to expand once again, in 2002, with a state-of-the-art structure just steps away from the old facility.  Today, the Hall welcomes 6 million visitors annually. They are dazzled with its interactive displays and exhibits. As of this year, the Hall has inducted 365 of the greatest players, coaches, and referees. Players like Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Bradley, and coaches like John Wooden and Pat Summitt have been honored for their contributions to the sport. The Basketball Hall of Fame commemorative coin is the ideal way for the legacy of these great athletes and coaches to be remembered for decades to come.  With no cost to the American taxpayer, the surcharges on these coins will go to further the museum's curation efforts. The proceeds will also go toward educational programs to promote good sportsmanship and respect on and off the court.  Mr.Speaker, I have worked with the Hall of Fame on multiple projects for more than 30 years. It is a terrific tax-exempt organization that works tirelessly to preserve the history and educate people about this truly American game.[[Page H7455]]  I believe that basketball instills the virtues that this country was built upon and gives Americans someone to aspire to be.

But the key phrase here that my friend from Florida mentioned was the following: Now it is time for us to do our part.  ``Our part'' calls for a much more vigorous effort, a much more robust investment, and it could, it should, be done now. We don't have to wait to get this done. We don't have to parcel this out in the small amounts that are being suggested.  Now, earlier this week, I rose in opposition to H.3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act, as well.

I take no issue with a clean 6-month extension of the FAA expenditure authority, but today's bill includes an extensive list of extraneous provisions.  If we are to include extraneous measures on this must-pass legislation, then the process of compiling the bill should have been done in a bipartisan manner. Instead, our Republican friends assembled their near-term priorities barely, if at all, consulting the Democratic minority, even though many of these issues are indeed bipartisan.  Worse, rather than work together to solve what is rapidly becoming an American humanitarian crisis, they chose to take most of the day off to unveil the tax cut for the wealthiest people in  The priorities at this moment are misguided. As I noted earlier this week, while I support the disaster tax relief in this bill, the package is plainly insufficient. I had hoped that we might work together in a manner on these provisions, but that has not occurred.  Traditionally, in this body, we honored and used to respect what is known as the national principle. It was a code of honor that bound us together when one part of the Nation was beset by disaster. Whether it was an earthquake in California, a hurricane in North Carolina, a tornado in Massachusetts, floods in Missouri, or forest fires in Alabama, we did not ask about gender, race, geography. We simply said the national principle prevails and the Federal Government will offer a robust response.                              {time}  1745  We are failing in that respect to set the precedent today. Instead, unfortunately, this disaster relief package that we will consider does not provide the comprehensive package of incentives and relief that will drive investment and speed up recovery in American communities in Texas, Florida, the U.Virgin Islands, and the devastation across Puerto Rico.[[Page H7561]]  These hurricanes left massive devastation in their wake, and the ongoing situation in the U.Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are dire. The situation not only justifies but demands a comprehensive package of incentives and relief to help these communities and their residents get back to their feet.  Republicans will hide behind an amendment they added to the Rules Committee last night. It is really a fig leaf, amounting to $68 per person in tax relief. We can do much more for our American brothers and sisters in the Caribbean, especially given that the administration continues to drag its feet in terms of sending an emergency supplemental request. That should be done forthwith. We can do better, and we must do better.  They are making vague assurances that we will get around to considering a more extensive package later, but delay and uncertainty will make the situation worse, not better.  Today's package should have included other powerful and proven tax incentives that we have extended in the past disaster recovery efforts consistently. I consider this a missed opportunity.  We need to do more to help our fellow Americans recover from these tragedies. Therefore, I intend to oppose this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

They already did that once 5 years ago when there was a temporary lapse. Only two airlines didn't, Spirit and Everybody else grabbed the money and ran, $400 billion.  So Congress repeals the ticket tax. They raise prices 7\1/2\ percent, and then they would get three seats on the board. Three seats will go to direct airlines interests to decide what passengers and how people will pay to use the national airspace. So they, in all probability, will come up with a head tax.  So, in addition to paying $7 billion a year for baggage fees, now we are going to start charging people to use the national airspace with a flat tax. So, hey, that is a big, great win for the people with first class tickets. The people, of course, who have got a $100 coach seat are now going to be paying more like 20 percent or 25 percent. And the person with a $2,000 ticket is going to pay, basically, 3-point-something percent.  So this is all really unfortunate because we could have passed already out of this House a bipartisan bill, sent it to the Instead of trying to jam them with this bill that is loaded down with riders, we would be jamming them with good, long-term policy for the FAA and the traveling public and the aviation industry in  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

252,topic-id,717,"Madam President, I want to speak on the renomination of Ajit Pai to serve as Chairman of the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, to serve for a term of 5 years.  Under the previous administration, the FCC always had the consumers' back. Back then, that administration's FCC strengthened consumer protections. It furthered competition, it protected public safety, and it pushed forward to ensure universal service for all  Ultimately, the success or failure of the FCC rises and rests not on the fulfillment of special interest wish lists but on the treatment of those who are least able to protect themselves and whether their First Amendment rights, including those of journalists, are vigorously protected.  Chairman Pai has been a vocal and excessively partisan and often hostile opponent of pro-consumer steps taken by his colleagues on the We have seen that time after time in the previous administration.  Since becoming Chairman of the FCC this year, he has systematically undercut much of the work done over the past 8 years. I want to give you several examples.  He has acted to prevent millions of broadband subscribers from receiving key information about rates, terms, and conditions of their service. This is called disclosure. He has threatened the expansion of broadband into the homes of low-income Americans by limiting the effectiveness of the new Lifeline Program reforms. If that is not enough, he has proposed sweeping limits on the ability of States and localities to review and improve the installation of certain types of wireless equipment. Furthermore, he has supported the moves by the GOP Congress to eliminate commonsense privacy rules for broadband services.  If all of that is not enough, he has eliminated several media ownership[[Page S6203]]rules, paving the way for a massive consolidation among TV and radio broadcast stations. Continuing, he has acted as if the way to improve broadband in rural America is to lower standards and saddle our most remote communities with slower speed and worse service. He has also opposed widely supported updates to the E-Rate Program, which brings broadband to schools and libraries in every State in the Nation and leaves that critical program's budget--and the American schoolchildren--in the dial-up era. That is not what we want for our students. Furthermore, he has curtailed rules designed to help small businesses, schools, libraries, and hospitals to find competitive options for high-capacity telecommunications services. What that is going to do is likely raise the cost of these services and potentially harm their quality.  The list I just gave does not include the elephant in the room--Chairman Pai's planned elimination of the FCC's net neutrality protections. This Senator has been very clear that I oppose the effort to revoke these essential consumer protections on the internet. I think Chairman Pai's proposed course is shortsighted, especially when his preferred approach seems to be the abandonment of the FCC's oversight on the action of broadband providers. These are actions that directly impact on the lives of millions of  In March, I sent to Chairman Pai my deeply held concerns about some of these actions, and I expressed my sincere hope that his early moves were not a sign of things to come, but unfortunately my concerns have only been heightened by his record over the months since that conversation.  At the end of the day, the FCC has a responsibility to put the public interests ahead of the powerful special interests. Just as it has been under the leadership of the past Chairmen and Chairwomen, Congress expects the current FCC to uphold the laws the Congress has passed and to enforce the regulations properly adopted by the agency.  The vast majority of the actions of Chairman Pai have served to eliminate competitive protections, to threaten dangerous industry consolidation, to make the internet less free and less open, and to weaken consumer protections for those most vulnerable.  Ultimately, we need an FCC Chairman who has the consumers' backs. We need an FCC Chairman who is not afraid to use the robust statutory authority Congress has given to the FCC to protect consumers. Based on his record, I have serious and longstanding concerns about whether Chairman Pai really does have the consumers' backs. As a result, I will oppose this nomination.  I yield the floor.

766,topic-id,1451,"Mr.President, I want to express my appreciation to the fellow Senators who have come up innumerable times to express their regrets for what has happened to Florida, as we did with our colleagues from Texas with regard to the hurricane in Indeed, that was an unusual storm.[[Page S6119]]  The almost gold standard storm of Hurricane Andrew 25 years ago crossed the State of Florida in 4 hours. It was small in diameter compared to this present hurricane that hit Florida and traveled right up the peninsula and, therefore, covered up the entire  For the past few weeks, in my traveling all around, there was vast devastation either by the wind or by flooding. It is really hard to believe that a State as large as ours could be virtually covered up by a storm. There was limited access to critical supplies like gasoline, and some places sustained considerable damage. I remember down in the Keys, in the part that hit the northeastern quadrant of the eye wall, in Big Pine Key, I went to a trailer park--a place of mobile homes--and there was not one mobile home that was sitting upright. They were all turned on their sides or turned over on their roofs. It was something that you just cannot believe--the force of the wind.  The cost of rebuilding is going to be in the billions. We have passed a temporary measure of $15 billion, and that is running out. We are going to have to do something immediately for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, but there is going to be a continuing cost in Texas and a huge cost in Many people have been dislocated, and they are unable to move back into their homes.  Take people in the Florida There is a tourism economy there, and to have a tourism economy, you have to get the service personnel back in. Well, they don't have any homes. So you have to bring in temporary housing. In the Keys, there is one way in and one way out. So that is going to take some time.  Then, sadly, in the tragedy of all tragedies, 11 frail, elderly seniors died in a hot box that was a nursing home that had lost power, and the generators that were required under the existing law and existing regulations of the State of Florida were for putting the lights back on. They were not generators that were sufficient in order to run the air conditioning systems. The 11 senior citizens perished after there were a number of calls that had been made to the Governor's cell phone and calls that were made to Florida Power &  There is a criminal investigation that is underway that will answer some of the questions of why, as they pled for help to come and get back on the power, those calls were never answered. As a result, 11 people died. Something like that simply just shouldn't happen in America, a country that has the resources and the compassion that our people have.  I want to state that, if people can't get through in an emergency like this to a Federal or State agency, I want them to call me at my office at 407-872-7161 or on the WATS line at 888-671-4091 or to visit the website at billnelson.senate.gov. We will get to the bottom of it, because in an emergency situation like that, with people's lives on the line, that should never happen again.  I am so proud of the people who worked in our office so diligently. We had many of the employees here in the Washington office go to Florida as eyes and ears out there in the community before FEMA could get in to register people for individual assistance because they couldn't get through. If they had cell phones and the cell phone service was spotty, they couldn't get through. We had people out there in the field signing people up and getting it to FEMA for individual assistance.  Our folks on the Florida staff as well as the Washington staff who went down there did a wonderful job. They worked their fingers to the bone, and they worked their hearts out. I want them to know how much I appreciate that, serving the people of Florida in need.  It is important that those of us in public service respond with urgency and purpose when somebody calls for help. That applies to all of us in public service. I was really heartened when I saw all over Florida people helping people. I saw frail and elderly persons who had no place to go who were taken into a girl's dormitory that had air conditioning. They took care of them for 4 nights--eight frail, elderly women.  I saw people helping people in Belle Senator Rubio and I went to Belle Glade together and served food. We went and thanked those students in that dorm near We thanked them together for people helping people.  Now what we need to do is to take that same effort that we saw in Texas and that we have seen in Florida of people helping people and we have to help the people of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Over the weekend, the full scale devastation of the third hurricane became clearer. The first was in Texas, the second was in Florida and on up into the Southeast, and now the third one was not only hitting the Virgin Islands, like the former one did, but was just ripping up Puerto  I have talked to the Governor, and he says the island faces a humanitarian crisis. The devastation over this past week has become a lot clearer to us as we start to see all of the devastation on our TV screens. According to one report, ``Hurricane Maria whipped Puerto Rico with Irma-level winds, drenched the island with Harvey-level flooding, crippled communications, decimated buildings and damaged the dam that puts the downstream residents at risk of catastrophe.''  That is what our fellow Americans are facing right now down in the We need to act with urgency and purpose to aid Puerto Rico in their time of need. I will have a chance to go down there on I want to see it firsthand. I will continue to carry this message: The U.Congress has to come to the aid of our friends and our fellow citizens in the Virgin Islands and Puerto  I have talked to the Department of Defense and said: Do everything that you can do to assist. They are trying. I talked to the FAA There is just the simple thing of being able to have instrument landings after so many of the radars got knocked out. Here is one example of just a practical problem facing the island, as if they didn't have enough practical problems to begin with.  Look at the financial crisis. The Medicaid funds are going to run out. That is before the hurricane. Look at the Zika crisis in Puerto That is before the hurricane. Think what it is like now.  Here is an example. One of the radars on the top of a mountain gets taken out by the storm. All right, we need to get it back up there. We need a helicopter, and can get a helicopter to take a radar up to place it there, because the roads are impassable, but now there is cloud cover up in the mountain, and they can't fly up. So one problem compounds another, just so we can get instrument landings coming into Puerto Rico instead of the visual flight rules where we have to keep so much more distance from the planes. Just think if we end up having to have an airlift in order to get food and supplies into Puerto Rico to keep them alive.  Now is not the time to talk about the former financial problems or about the debt payments to bondholders. In a crisis, all that matters is saving lives and giving the people the resources they need to get back on their feet. I am hopeful that our colleagues will see the urgency of the situation in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, in addition to the ongoing troubles in Florida and, I expect, Texas, as well, which will continue for some time.  I hope we can work together to get an aid package soon that helps all of those affected by the storms as soon as possible. Why? Because we are all Americans, and we need to act like it. We need to come together and get on the long road to recovery.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Daines).

923,topic-id,791,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.2792, the Control of Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017. In 1996, Congress and President Clinton worked together to reform welfare and reignite the American Dream for families in need.  Aligned with this goal was a provision prohibiting a range of welfare benefits--including Supplemental Security Income--to fugitive felons and violators of probation and parole because safety net programs need to be protected from abuse so they can remain in place for those individuals who need them.  Individuals who evade justice violate the social contract that grants them this safety net. Simply put, it is incoherent and self-defeating that a nation of laws would pay a wanted person and prolong their flight from justice. Unfortunately, due to a number of factors involving the courts, these provisions have been watered down in recent years and rendered ineffectual.  Through the CUFF Act, Congress can stand up, once again, on behalf of our communities and affirm what every participant in our society should understand: if you have an outstanding warrant for your arrest, you have an obligation to face justice or clear your name.  This legislation not only stops benefits from going to those who are not following the law, but it also helps law enforcement apprehend those suspects. A 2007 report by SSA's inspector general found that this policy aided law enforcement in apprehending almost 60,000 individuals who were evading arrest for outstanding warrants. In fact, law enforcement thinks this policy is so effective that the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs' Association have expressed support for the CUFF  Unfortunately, despite the fact that this commonsense bill is endorsed by law enforcement and has a proven track record of success, I anticipate that my colleagues across the aisle may try to convince you otherwise.  I have heard many of their arguments when the Ways and Means Committee considered this bill and when the Rules Committee also considered this bill.  So let's take each of those concerns in turn.  Some may say that this is an old, failed policy.  In reality, this policy has a long track record of success. In 2015, the Social Security inspector general said, at a hearing, that this bill would stop hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to individuals with felony warrants.  Some may say this bill targets people with outdated warrants.  In reality, SSA already has a wide authority to exempt individuals if the alleged offense is nonviolent and not drug related.                              {time}  0930  Some may say that this bill would throw beneficiaries off the rolls with no warning. In reality, the SSA provides beneficiaries advance notice of 35 days before suspending SSI benefits, and there is a robust appeal process for recipients who have had their benefits suspended.  Some may say that this policy is burdensome to law enforcement. In reality, this bill is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the South Dakota Sheriffs' Association because it helps them do their job to locate individuals.  Finally, some may raise concerns that it targets minority populations caught up in overcriminalization or overly harsh sentencing. To those concerns, I say that these issues are absolutely important, and I look forward to us having those conversations about criminal justice reforms here in However, that conversation is outside the scope of the legislation that we have before us today.  My legislation does not speak to the content of a warrant, just the fact that one exists. The decision to grant a warrant is made by a judge in a court of law, not by the Social Security It should not be the duty of the American taxpayer to subsidize individuals who are wanted by the police.  Simply put, Mr.Speaker, if an individual has an outstanding warrant, it must be addressed and cleared. This bill does nothing to change that.  Under my bill, nobody will lose their SSI benefits because of misdemeanor offenses such as merely having a parking ticket, petty theft, or even driving under the influence. This bill stops payments to individuals who have outstanding warrants for felonies. These are crimes like murder, rape, and kidnapping. It also stops payments to individuals with probation and parole violations, limiting their ability to evade arrest.  Supplemental Security Income is a lifeline to those who are in need. We must ensure we are not further facilitating criminal activity in communities that are all too often already struggling.  Mr.Speaker, I am grateful for the time that we are spending to consider this important legislation, and I appreciate the opportunity to stand in support of my bill today.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgH7595.txt,2060,TRAVELING BY PRIVATE JET,2017.0,28.0,September

In August 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal      Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act into      law, which restricted the eligibility of fugitive felons, and      probation and parole violators for Social Security benefits.      The Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector      General (OIG) reported that this law has contributed to over      59,000 arrests since the inception of the program in 1996.       However, three different court decisions have eroded the      law's effectiveness and the original intent of Congress,      allowing fugitives to continue to collect benefits while on      the run. This legislation will restore the original intent of      the law by prohibiting an individual who is the subject of an      outstanding arrest warrant for a felony or parole violation      from receiving Social Security benefits.       The legislation will apply only to felony charges and amend      the Social Security Act to make clear that the suspension of      benefits is not just in cases of ``escape, flight to avoid      prosecution, or confinement, and flight-escape.'' The      American taxpayer should not be forced to support those who      are evading justice.

The bill does a number of important things including:      amending the Social Security Act to prohibit an individual      who is the subject of an outstanding arrest warrant for a      felony or parole violation from receiving Social Security      Benefits; restoring the original intent of the 1996 law,      revising current law to discontinue benefits for individuals      who are ``the subject of an arrest warrant . . .'' compared      to the previous language of ``fleeing to avoid'' arrest,      which was the main legal challenge; and applying only to      felony charges, or a crime carrying a minimum term of one or      more years in prison. This policy does not intend to punish      individuals convicted of misdemeanors, such as outstanding      parking tickets, as some have alleged.       Like you, I believe this is a commonsense bill that will      give more Americans piece of mind in knowing that tax dollars      aren't supporting criminal activity through continued      benefits to those breaking the law. I applaud your efforts on      this issue and look forward to working with you to ensure the      passage of this key legislation.

928,topic-id,494,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to clarify exactly what this legislation does.  This legislation will take SSI benefits from individuals and stop those payments to those who have felony arrest warrants or who have violated their probation and parole.  I want to go through the process so that everybody recognizes that there is plenty of time for individuals to go through the appeal process. Notice is given if there is a warrant that they need to get rectified with the jurisdiction that has authority. So let me step through this process.  Step one is through the Office of Inspector Law enforcement agencies give OIG information about individuals who have outstanding felony arrest warrants or who are violating conditions of probation or parole.  Then OIG compares this information to its computer files of individuals receiving these dollars or serving as representative payees. If there is a match, OIG verifies the identity of the individual, ensures that the warrants for the individual are still active, works with local law enforcement to attempt to locate the person, and then OIG refers the cases to SSA to begin the suspension process.  When this process gets to the Social Security Administration, SSA sends an advance notice to the individual. This notice proposes the suspension of benefit payments and informs the individual of their right to appeal the suspension decision, payment continuation, and the timeframe to take such actions after receiving the advance notice.                              {time}  0945  This notice includes why the SSA is suspending benefits and where, why, and when the warrant was issued. If SSA finds out, through a data match, 35 days is given for the individual to protest. If the individual protests, SSA will not suspend benefits until it figures out if the individual qualifies for a good cause exception. If the individual does not appeal his or her advance notice, then the SSA will suspend the benefits.  If the individual does appeal and gives his or her advance notice and provides evidence for the payment continuation, the SSA verifies the evidence and then continues the payments.  Other things that we should know about this legislation and what this includes is that warrants may only be resolved in the issuing jurisdiction. Grounds for dismissal of a warrant include identity theft, administrative error, and the individual's own move from the jurisdiction, especially if low income.  Warrants for misdemeanors remain warrants for misdemeanors and cannot become felonies. There is also latitude for the Commissioner to make decisions in special areas where there may be something to be considered, such as dementia or low-income abilities.  Mr.Speaker, this bill has been thoroughly vetted. We are making sure that the only people who are denied their SSI benefits are those who have felony warrants for their arrest or have violated probation or parole and have not gotten straight with law enforcement and rectified that past infraction.

929,topic-id,624,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I live in the State of South I have some of the poorest counties in the Nation in my State, and they happen to be my Native American They face 80 to 90 percent unemployment, poverty like no other place in the country, and they are isolated. They also have very high drug and crime rates.  In fact, we have seen a record number of murders in these communities, especially on the Pine Ridge Reservation, in this calendar year, and it is deeply discouraging and disheartening to me to think of someone who could have committed a murder in one of my communities in the State of South Dakota, that there is a felony warrant out for their arrest, and that we may not be able to find them. This bill will fix that situation.  If that individual is receiving SSI payments, that helps law enforcement locate those individuals who have gone out and committed crimes against innocent people. Rape, murder, kidnapping, they all happen in my Native[[Page H7598]]American Tribes, and this helps law enforcement find them and bring them to justice. It is one of the important things that this legislation will help us do in some of our most vulnerable communities.  I also recognize that the previous speaker talked about the fact that we need criminal justice reforms, and that is a very good debate that we should be having in But this is not the bill to talk about criminal justice reforms because this is not germane to the discussion that we are having today.  I wanted to speak for a minute on what is good cause because there is latitude for good cause within statute today, and I think there is some confusion as to exactly how this bill would be interpreted when it is signed into law.  In some cases, the SSI will not suspend or seek an overpayment of payments for good cause exceptions. There are two types of good cause exceptions that already exist in statute. The mandatory good cause exception is the SSA cannot suspend payments if a court has found an individual not guilty or has dismissed charges. If a court has vacated the warrant or issued any similar exoneration, then they cannot suspend payments. They also cannot suspend payments if there is a mistaken identity due to identity fraud.  The other exception in statute today is discretionary good cause exceptions. The SSA may suspend benefits for mitigating circumstances under two options:  Option A is the individual must prove that the criminal offense was nonviolent and not drug related. We also have that the individual has not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued, and the other point is that the law enforcement agency that issued the warrant reports that it will not act on the warrant. That is other exceptions for good cause.  Option B, the individual must prove all of these factors: if the criminal offense was nonviolent and not drug related; the individual has not been convicted of a felony crime since the warrant was issued; the warrant is the existing warrant and was issued 10 or more years ago and the individual lacks the mental capacity to resolve the warrant, which includes those living in a nursing home or mental treatment facility.  So as we have listened to opponents of this bill talk, they have discussed all of these issues as to how these benefits could be taken away from individuals that are clearly covered by good cause exceptions that are already in statute, and those situations are not relevant to the debate that we are having today.

I just want to remind everyone that the bill we are debating here today would suspend SSI benefits for those who have felony warrants for their arrest and those who have violated probation or parole. That is the discussion that we are having here today. And let's go back over, in summary, what the policy actually does and says.  This policy should not be thought of in isolation. This is part of a larger effort to reauthorize the evidence-based, outcome-focused Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program.  H.2824, which passed this Chamber on Tuesday, will be joined with this bill upon passage. It helps to improve the lives of families in at-risk communities, focusing on the first years of a child's life.  Unlike most Federal social programs, MIECHV funding is tied to real results, which ensures limited taxpayer dollars are actually delivering the intended results and helping those that are most in need.  Under current law, the program is 100 percent federally funded, but H.2824 introduces a Federal match similar to what States must already do in other social programs, such as foster care,[[Page H7600]]Medicaid, child support enforcement, childcare, and others. The rest of the package ensures this program remains a shining example of evidence-based policy by expecting the program to continue to demonstrate effective outcomes. That reauthorization is fully offset by the bill that we are considering here today, H.2792.  Instead of focusing on our Nation's debt, we should be doing more of what we are doing right here in these bills: prioritizing Federal spending and focusing on what works by improving the integrity of one program to provide funding for another.

324,topic-id,614,"Mr.Chair, this amendment would strike the provision in the bill that would add increasing employment and earnings to the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, or MIECHV, as it is generally referred to.  I, obviously, share the goal of increasing employment and earnings across the country. However, home visiting is not an employment program. It is a program to strengthen families to make kids healthier, safer, and more ready to learn when they start school. Those are the outcomes home visiting models strive for, and those are the outcomes they achieve.  I mentioned the other day in the Ways and Means Committee that I know the good that these programs do firsthand. In Passaic County--because most of these programs are run through counties throughout America--our home visiting program worked with a pregnant mom expecting a child with a heart defect.  The baby required open heart surgery shortly after being born last After the surgery, the newborn continued to have health complications. At times, his mom felt depressed and hopeless and feared that her child was not going to survive.  The home visiting program's family support worker was able to assist the mom by connecting her to services, providing her with emotional support, and acting as a liaison with the hospital where her son was.  We know the negative impact that postpartum depression can have on new moms and their babies. The home visiting program was able to connect this mom to supportive services and resources and alleviate her depression so that she could be a healthy and pleasant mom. I am happy to report that, after nearly 3 months in the hospital, this little boy was finally able to go home, and his mother continues to work with the home visiting program in northern New  I don't think anyone can hear that story and not see value in the services that were provided. The home visiting program helped a mom, like so many other mothers across America, navigate her newborn son's healthcare crisis and manage the mental health issues associated with it.  But under the provision that my amendment is seeking to strike from the bill, this outcome would not be measured as a success. There is something wrong with that.  Most home visiting models focus on families with newborns or very small children and focus on building a parent-child bond. That is a fact. Many home visiting programs focus on teen parents and young mothers, and the priority is to keep them in school and make sure they continue their education.  There are currently 18 evidence-based home visiting models. None of them[[Page H7513]]provide employment services, none of them measure employment and earnings.  Home visitors have raised concerns that having to ask families about employment and earnings would be intrusive when you know what the focus of the program is, and would undermine the relationship they are trying to build with families.  Even if the data is collected without specifically asking families for it, knowing their performance is being measured based on their client's labor force participation--here is the kernel of the issue--will likely make home visitors feel they have to press their clients to work even if, like in the case of the mom in Passaic County, that should not be the main object.  Additionally, this bill provides no new funding. We are not asking for any new money here. Any resources devoted to supporting work would have to be diverted from MIECHV's core purposes.

We all voted for the money a week and a half ago. That took 3 days. Other storms in the past took 3 months, so let's set the record straight.  I am pleased to support aid to those affected by Harvey, Irma, Maria, and I will continue to do so. We urgently need to deliver relief and assistance to those currently impacted by Hurricane Maria in the U.Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the entire island has lost power and many are without water.  I can't support a bill before us today which is not even close to providing the robust relief that Puerto Rico needs. You know it, and we know it. The Congress and this administration need to step up, help Puerto Rico recover.  I plan to reintroduce legislation to extend the earned income tax credit to residents of Puerto Rico, and I hope my colleagues will support it.  The bill before us today completely circumvented the committee process. I am not a process person, but this bill did not have any hearing, despite the fact that myself and my Republican colleague from New York, Mr.Reed, have had legislation on comprehensive disaster relief for the last 5 years.  I want to address something my good friend from Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, put out yesterday in response to my position and others. He said that Democrats were using hurricane relief as a ``bargaining chip'' and ``playing politics'' to enact our own agenda. He also tweeted that we were ``sick,'' which I can only hope was tweeted by an overzealous staffer.

I promised myself I would stay calm for the rest of what I have to say.  My only agenda, Mr.Speaker, is to help those who have been hurt by disasters, regardless of where in the United States they live, regardless of what they look like, regardless of how they cook their food. If that is a political agenda, I don't know what world we are living in.  As for ``playing politics,'' as I mentioned, the gentleman from New York and I introduced the National Disaster Tax Relief Act to take politics out of the process, to avoid having to have debates like these.

There are 180,000 amputations performed in the United States every year, and too many of them are unnecessary. More than 30 percent of patients who experienced an amputation had no arterial testing before their limb was removed. Studies have shown that diagnosing and treating patients with PAD with early intervention is directly associated with lower rates of amputation.  By supporting screening for at-risk populations and promoting multidisciplinary care with arterial testing, we can prevent amputation. It will improve lives, reduce patient mortality, and save billions of dollars in healthcare spending.

Before I begin, I also want to let the Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands know that we stand with them as they rebuild.  Madam Speaker, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees to all people in this country the freedom to speak out against injustice. When Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the National Anthem last year, he joined a long list of patriotic athletes who used their fame to do just that.  Muhammad Ali was convicted of draft dodging because he refused to drop bombs and bullets on Brown people in Vietnam while the so-called Negro people in Louisville, Kentucky, were treated like dogs.  Jackie Robinson, the great Baseball Hall of Famer who integrated baseball, admitted in 1972 that he no longer could stand and sing the National  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution endows all of us with the freedom of speech, the freedom to speak out our own truths. Muhammad Ali would not fight an unjust war; Jackie Robinson would not salute a flag that he believed symbolized his oppression; and Colin Kaepernick took a knee to bring America's attention to the fact that Black Americans are twice as likely as White Americans to be killed by police officers, to bring attention to the fact that 1 in every 10 Black men in his thirties is in prison or in jail on any given day, to bring attention to the statistic that tells us Black people are twice as likely as White people to be in poverty in the wealthiest country on  It is easy to keep quiet, to do nothing in the face of injustice. But just like the muscles in our bodies, our Constitution will wither if we do not exercise our rights. To speak out against injustice is to exercise the constitutional right of free speech. What is more patriotic than exercising the rights our Nation stands for?  When the President uses his right of free speech in an attempt to silence athletes, he is undermining the freedom for which patriotic Americans have fought during our 241-year history. When the President calls for men and women to be fired from their jobs because they dare use their public platform to combat injustice, he fuels the viciousness he claims that he wants to despise. As Langston Hughes put it: ``Let America be America again--The land that has never been yet--And yet must be--the land where every man is free.''  Madam Speaker, I talk about the Constitution because it talks about all people. There are times where I have been disappointed and let down by this Nation not holding up its creed because, you see, I believe in America, but I am waiting for that day when all men are created equal. I am still waiting for that day.  We are here tonight to bring attention to this matter. We are exercising our right to free speech, the right that has been given every American in this country, supposedly. But if the President of the United States can stand up somewhere in this country and call a section of this country, a certain people in this country, SOBs, then what does that say about where we are? This is the leader of the United States of America, the land of the free, the home of the brave. But is it that for everyone?  We have a ways to go in this country. Yes, we have come a long way, and some people will say: Well, you know, why are you still talking about those old issues? And, you know, things are different now and better for you. And, look, come on, get over it.  And then we see what we have seen over the last several years with African Americans constantly getting shot and there being no ramifications. It tears at your heart, Madam Speaker, to understand why, why, in the greatest nation on the face of the Earth, we still have these situations of such inequity.  So we will continue to raise the issue until one day this country can live up to its creed that all men and women are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights.

128,topic-id,2323,"Mr.President, I would like to echo what my esteemed colleague from Missouri has outlined in the last few minutes. His leadership on this issue is pronounced, and his experience on this floor is not to be underestimated. I appreciate his leadership on this, and I appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this.  Before my remarks today on this historic opportunity before us right now to finally, after 30 years, become competitive again with the rest of the world, I would like to preface my remarks with a personal comment. My mom and dad were schoolteachers. We were middle class. I grew up working on our family farm. My mom and dad were really the first two in their extended families who had ever been to college. All of my relatives were farmers in the  I think the Tax Code that we have had for the last 100 years, since it was instituted in our country, has created an imbalance. We can see right now that we are losing competitiveness with the rest of the world. We have a growing disparity among income levels in this country, borne out somewhat by the derivative results of an archaic, out-of-control, out-of-date, and inappropriate tax policy.  Today, we have two crises in I have spoken on this floor a lot about this. We have a global security crisis that cannot be argued against. It is deadly. It is serious. We also have a debt crisis, and they are interwoven because of our inability to discipline ourselves on this floor over the last 30 years, particularly the last 16 years. We now have $20 trillion of debt, and that is the result of an explosion in the size of our Federal  In 2000, the size of our government--these are constant 2016 dollars. The size of our government in 2000 was $2.4 trillion. ``Trillion'' is a big number, and it gets a lot of zeros out there. I have a hard time even digesting what that is. But 2.4--I can relate to the size that it is today, and it was $4 trillion last year. So our Federal Government has grown over 60 percent in 16 short years. There was one Republican President and one Democratic My experience here in the last 2 years has been that there are no innocent parties in terms of this out-of-control spending on the part of the Federal  One of the solutions to this debt crisis is a growing economy. President Trump, from day one, has said that growing the economy is job one, but it was part of a bigger strategy in his first year.  There were four components to the strategy in the first year. One was that we had to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court, and that was done. Second, we had to roll back on some of the more onerous regulations that were stifling the very life out of the free enterprise system. To date, over 800 regulations have been removed from our government. Third was healthcare. We are still trying to fix a collapsing ObamaCare system that is hurting people back home. Lastly, we had to reform our tax package so that we could become competitive with the rest of the world and get our economy going again.  Job one this year was to get the economy going again. To some degree, it is beginning to move. Consumer confidence is at a 16-year high. CEO confidence is at a 20-year high. Why? Because they finally see rhetoric in Washington talking about the things they have been asking for for over 10 years, and that is relief from some of the pressure the Federal Government has put on the free enterprise system that keeps us from being competitive with the rest of the world.  I have lived around the world, and I have run businesses. I started my career working for an hourly wage in construction. I understand that America--and I can say this with some authority--has some of the best workers anywhere in the world and in the history of the world. On the back of that, we have innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law. That is what has created this economic miracle over the last 7 years, but we have taken it for granted. What we have done is allow other countries because of our immigration policy, because of our tax policy, and because of our regulatory policy, particularly of late--we have lost our competitive edge.  We believe that to get this economy going, President Trump is right. I am absolutely committed to the strategy President Trump has laid out. It really is only three things, and we have already started on two with his leadership.  1 is regulatory reform, which I talked about.  2 is that we have to get this energy policy going. What the President has already done with the Keystone Pipeline and the Clean Power Plan has set the stage to allow us to become the energy czar, if you will, of the next century right here in North  Lastly--and maybe most importantly--is to get this Tax Code so we can be competitive with the rest of the world. Let's talk about what competitive means. In 1986, the last time we actually made any real, substantive change to the Tax Code, the United States, after those changes, had the third lowest corporate tax rate in the world. What that did is allow us to compete with the rest of the world and set the stage for the next 10 to 15 years of economic boom that is now part of history.  What has happened now, though, is that the rest of the world has caught up. They have lowered their corporate tax rates. They have simplified their regulatory environment and taken the burden off some of their people. Today we have absolutely the highest corporate tax rate in the world, and we are the last country of the major OECD countries--the 39 countries--to actually still have a repatriation tax. This is unbelievable. We have been so arrogant as a country that we have let the rest of the world outrun us to the next stop, and they are now outcompeting us.  How does this affect the average man and woman on the street? Well, this I believe--the repatriation tax and indeed the lack of competitiveness in our Tax Code--is an absolute tax on American workers. Why? Because right now, twice as many companies in the United States are being purchased by companies outside our country, as compared to companies that our U.companies are buying outside the United That is nothing but a reflection on the[[Page S6174]]imbalance of our high tax environment here at home, and the people who suffer from that are the people who buy products in the United States and the people who work for companies that sell products in the United By companies, I am talking about friends of mine who have small businesses in South Georgia and have four employees. I am also talking about friends who run large corporations, multinational corporations. All of the above contribute to our economy.  We have unwanted acquisitions. Just look at recent history. Burger King was bought by a Canadian firm, Timmy's. Look at the beer industry in Today, most of those companies are owned by Brazilians and These are not mean CEOs who decided to move their corporate headquarters, no. This is a reflection of a competitive disadvantage in which someone outside the country has used our Tax Code and our tax dollars to actually buy U.companies to the detriment of U.workers. How can anyone be against lowering our corporate tax rate and doing away with this repatriation tax?  The Business Roundtable in 2004 documents--and this is interesting--that if our corporate rate today were just 20 percent, over 4,700 companies that have been purchased over the last couple of years would still be in the United I think that is tantamount to a marching order for us here in the Senate to make this change.  The way forward is very simple. This is what is talked about in this tax package that we are beginning to talk about publicly, and this is only after 9 months of regular order in committee with multiple hearings. We heard in the healthcare debate: Oh, this is not regular order. We didn't have the chance to talk about it and put amendments in and all this.  Well, this time, in tax, it will be by regular order. There will be amendments. There will be debates. There have already been multiple hearings. We are looking for input from all corners.  This strategy has three parts: One, we have to lower this tax on our American workers--lower the corporate tax rate to be competitive with the rest of the world. Two, eliminate this repatriation tax as every other country in the world has done. And, last, we have to simplify our individual Tax  My mom and dad were schoolteachers. They were proud of their ability to pay their taxes, but they were burdened by that. Right now, we don't need to do that. We have to find a way to make this Tax Code more equitable for everyone.  Nearly 90 percent of Americans want the code changed. Over two-thirds think taxes are too high. Almost two-thirds say that lowering the corporate tax rate--again, they get the fact that this tax rate is lower in the rest of the world and that it is a penalty on the workers here in the United  Nearly every CEO surveyed by the BRT, Business Roundtable, said that delays on tax would damage our economy. Here is why. We just heard the Senator from Missouri talk about timing. We have to have a sense of urgency on this for one reason; that is, if you want to affect the economy next year, you have to get this done this year. Budgets are being finalized for next year right now. Capital investments have already been made in terms of determining how much and where and how soon they will be making it. More importantly, during the back half of next year, we will have the holiday season, which offers up a significant portion of our retail sales for the year, and those decisions are being made right now--before the purchases that are made next spring.  We have major CEOs weighing in on this. Randall Stephenson, CEO at AT&T, said that if we get the corporate tax rate lowered, ``We will step it up''--meaning their capital investments. ``Every additional billion dollars . . . is 7,000 hard-hat jobs putting fiber in the ground, cell sites up, and antennas on cell sites.''  David Abney, CEO of UPS, said: ``We'd like to bring some of those foreign earnings back, invest them into our network here.''  Finally, Mark Weinberger is the CEO of one of the major accounting firms we have here in the United They are multinational, so they have experience around the world in this with Ernst & Actually, through these tax changes, they will stand to lose revenue because we are simplifying how people calculate what they owe in taxes. His quote is this: ``I think it's truly a bipartisan issue''--I agree--``something everybody can rally around . . . it's urgent for our country.''  To get this done, we have to move past partisan politics and Washington games. We saw how we disappointed the American people--both sides. The Democrats in 2009 crammed ObamaCare down the throats of America through a supermajority. We now know it has failed. Republicans were not able to fix it this year, so far. So we all need to look at this tax issue as a bipartisan issue to fix this once and for all for the people back home.  We can't get bogged down in this scoring--this financial modeling that is only done this way in People back home don't run their small businesses this way. They don't run big businesses this way. They sure don't run their personal finances this way. We can't get bogged down in bad numbers and bad timing coming from the Congressional Budget Office--not this time. It is too important. The only score that matters to me is GDP growth and the jobs that it creates--the change of lives that it can affect for the people back home.  I hear people talking all the time: I work part time; can you help me get more hours? Wages at the low-income level have not grown at all in the last 30 years. That is terrible in the United We can fix that. It is a function of the thing I am talking about right now--American companies that lost their competitiveness because of the rules here in This is a 1-percent increase in our Say we grow from 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent. That alone is $3 trillion of revenue over the next 10 years. That is doable. Everybody in this room knows that.  But we have to change this Tax Code to put people back to work, to get our economy going again, and to become competitive with the rest of the world. The end result will be to address, finally, this debt crisis.  The reason we want this Tax Code changed is to put people back to work and to change lives here in But the long-term benefit of this is that it gives us more flexibility and more capital with which to solve this long-term debt crisis. Growing the economy alone will not fix this debt crisis, but we will not fix the debt crisis unless and until we fix this Tax  We need to have a sense of urgency like never before in order to get this done this year.

205,topic-id,755,"Mr.President, the debate over healthcare can be very confusing. Last night, a tweaked third version of this year's third bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act was released. This is after several dozens of votes taken in Congress on this very same issue since 2010.  There is no question--the debate over healthcare has been exhausting. Our Nation's disability advocates, patients, doctors, and anyone with a preexisting condition have spent this past year on high alert, waiting on a razor's edge for the next time they would need to plead with Republicans in Congress not to take away their healthcare.  Healthcare is a very complex subject, but rather than engaging in thoughtful, bipartisan debate, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are rushing to pass something--anything--even if they don't know the details.  What we do know about this bill is that millions of people will lose their healthcare. Why? Because Republicans in Congress are facing a deadline of September 30 to use an arcane, expedited procedure that will let them repeal the Affordable Care Act with a simple majority of the My Republican colleagues are in such a rush that they don't even want to wait until we get a nonpartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget I believe they don't want to wait because they know the budget analysis will make it very clear that this is a very bad bill.  Although the healthcare debate is often confusing, exhausting, and complex, I think we should focus on just one very simple concept: No one in this great country of ours should ever go bankrupt because they get sick.  Let me repeat that. No one should ever go bankrupt because they get sick.  Every American, no matter what ZIP Code they live in, should be able to have affordable, quality healthcare.  As I stand here today, we don't know what version of the Affordable Care Act repeal we will be voting on later this week, but some things are virtually certain: Michiganders will be forced to pay more for less healthcare; costs for older Americans will increase dramatically; insurance companies will once again be free to discriminate against individuals with preexisting conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease; and even if policies are available, Michiganders will never be able to afford them.  This last-ditch effort to meet an artificial deadline is not thoughtful, measured or kind; it is messy, rushed, and cruel.  The Affordable Care Act is not perfect, and nobody here is saying that it is, but while we are spending this week debating yet another repeal bill, we are wasting time that should be spent on improving our healthcare system for all We need to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, which expires at the end of this week. If it is not reauthorized, it could jeopardize care for over 100,000 children in my State alone. We need to also act quickly to support community health centers, which face the same funding deadline and serve as the primary healthcare home for nearly 700,000 What we need is a truly bipartisan process to improve the Affordable Care Act, while keeping what works in place.  The legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act before us this week will jeopardize care for individuals with preexisting conditions and increase costs for older Americans who are already living on a fixed income. I heard from countless Michigan veterans, small business owners, hard-working parents with children, and many others who will be hurt by the proposals in this Republican bill. My constituents are fearful that they will be forced to choose between going without the care they need or facing potential bankruptcy over the costs.  I will say it again. No one in America should ever go bankrupt because they get sick. Every American should be able to afford quality healthcare, and I will continue fighting to ensure we never go back to the days when families had to face impossible choices.

So what did President Trump spend his weekend doing? Fixing healthcare for tens of millions of people?   Lobbying for a robust job-creating infrastructure plan?   Sending aid to Puerto Rico?  Not that either.  De-escalate the situation in North Korea?  Well, actually, quite the opposite. President Trump spent his weekend doing one of his favorite things: attacking Americans and various groups on his favorite medium:  His most recent attack: NFL players who use their constitutional right to freedom of speech to protest.  But they are not the only ones and the only group being attacked. Back in July, The New York Times found that President Trump was on track to insult 650 people, places, and things on Twitter by the end of his first term. Well, 2 months later, he is certainly still at it. Instead of attacking our Nation's problems, he is attacking us.  Let's take a quick look at some of the people and groups he has attacked both as a candidate and On this board we have just a handful of the people, places, and things President Trump has insulted, and if we were going to list them all, we would probably have to have dozens of poster boards.  Here is a sampling: John McCain and Jeff Flake; Barack Obama; Hillary Clinton, even though the election happened a year ago; the media from The ``failing'' New York Times and the Amazon Washington Post to individual reporters like Katy Tur and Mika Brzezinski; ObamaCare; Hamilton, the Broadway musical; Jeff Sessions, his own Attorney General; the Emmys; Nordstrom; the Russian investigation; Rosie O'Donnell; the Paris climate agreement; Meryl Streep; Mexicans; protesters; fake news; John Oliver; Mark Cuban; Snoop Dogg; and this weekend, the NFL and its players.  The list goes on and on. Well, it is actually easier to name the people and things that President Trump has not attacked than all of the ones that he has. So I came up with a very small list of people or groups that he has not attacked after several extensive Google searches.  First, I don't think the President has attacked the barbershop quartet singing organization: the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing, also known as To the best of my knowledge, he has never attacked them, so maybe he is a fan of barbershop crooners.  Although it is fairly recent, pumpkin spice lattes. I know they just came out. It is a sign of fall, but so far there is no Twitter traffic from Trump attacking these tasty treats.  Finally, these very fine people President Trump hasn't attacked nearly enough: the Klan, neo-Nazis, and other White supremacists.  Instead of being the attacker in chief, President Trump is supposed to unify the Nation, but all he does is divide us. His job is to work for the American people, to deliver on the promises and actually help  Here are the issues we need help with: stabilize the Affordable Care Act to ensure tens of millions of people keep their coverage, and don't just sabotage the marketplace.  We need good-paying jobs and better wages for the American people. We need a job and infrastructure plan like the President promised, but we have yet to see.  We need trade agreements that work for American workers. Again, another promise we have had with no tangible results.  And we need aid for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after last week's devastating hurricanes, much of what has yet to materialize.  Mr.President, while you are so busy tweeting about the NFL, you attack a[[Page H7491]]Black man for nonviolence more severely than White supremacists for violence.  Look, taking a knee may have started as a protest about racial inequality, about behavior by some in law enforcement discriminating against others in this country, but unarmed people of color are being killed simply for the color of their skin.  I think today taking a knee is becoming a broader sign of patriotism and respect for our country, for a country that can be even greater for every one of its citizens. It respects the lives lost for those in this country to fight for its ideals, which include nonviolent protests. It is a sign of love of country, a country with a promise that has to be for everyone regardless of the color of their skin.  I join so many now in the NFL and elsewhere in taking a knee for the America that we all aspire it to be.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

They are responding to some devastating storms, especially when they are combined.  Our thanks also go to the first responders and the many volunteers, including some in the State of Ohio and those from my hometown, who stepped forward to help the people in need. It is extraordinary.

Tribute to Tim O'Neill  Mr.President, I rise today to talk about one of our colleagues here in the Senate, who has an inspiring story and is celebrating an important anniversary this week.  I want to mention this week Doorkeeper Tim O'Neill, who works with us in the Senate and celebrates 27 years of Government service. He has been a doorkeeper since 2010, during which time I have had the pleasure of getting to know him, as have many of my colleagues in the  His career has been a remarkable journey. He started in the Senate as a legislative director, and he later went on to work in the White House--not during one Presidential administration but during four Presidential administrations. Tim worked for President Ronald Reagan, President George H.Bush, President Bill Clinton, and President George  He worked in the Department of Treasury and at the Federal Housing Finance Board, eventually becoming the chairman of that agency. After that he went to the House of Representatives, where he was senior legislative counsel for the Financial Services We are happy to have Tim back here on the Senate side, where he works today.  Tim has had an impressive career which I outlined, but the most amazing thing about his career doesn't reside in what he has done but what he has overcome.  One weekend in January of 1989, when Tim was at the Treasury Department, his life was altered forever. Tim's life had first changed on Friday morning when he found out his wife Ginny was pregnant with their first child. But later that weekend, on a Sunday, as he was putting on his shoes to go jogging, at 34 years old, he suffered a major stroke that affected two-thirds of his brain.  The doctors didn't immediately tell Ginny how serious it was. Later she would find out that they did not believe he would live through the night, and, if he did, they believed his lasting brain damage would mean he would never walk again and never talk again.  Despite this very grim prognosis, Tim had a few things going for him. First, there was an incredible positive attitude that we all see in the Second, he was young and athletic, which improved his chances of recovery. He also talks about his Irish determination, which made him resilient. And he had the knowledge of knowing that Ginny was pregnant, and he was absolutely committed to being part of his daughter's life. In fact, one of the few things he said he remembered in his initial stages of recovery was that Ginny was pregnant and that he had a daughter coming. And when he began regaining his speech, the first thing he told Ginny was that he was going to recover.  The path was not easy. In those first few months, he worked 8 hours a day, trading his government job for a rehabilitation facility. He worked with speech and physical therapists. And with Ginny at his side, he put in overtime every day. The extensive road to recovery was daunting. Tim, a Harvard-educated lawyer in the middle of a successful career, had to totally relearn things. He had to relearn how to read, and he had to relearn how to write.  I know Tim will agree with me that his wife Ginny was the unsung hero of this story of recovery.  The O'Neills felt the support and generosity of those around them. As I mentioned, he worked at the Treasury Those close to Tim--and some who hardly knew him at all--donated their personal leave time to allow him to keep receiving a paycheck during this recovery process, and the Treasury Department assured him that his job would be waiting when he was ready and able to return.  Shortly after the stroke that he wasn't supposed to ever recover from, Tim was home, self-mobile in a wheelchair. Soon he taught himself how to walk again. He never regained use of his right hand at all--one of his only lasting handicaps to this day--so do you know what he did? He learned to write with his left hand. His resilience and determination are really amazing.  He went back to work. His stroke was in January of 1989. Again, that Sunday, doctors didn't think he would live through the night, and if he did, they thought his life would be in a wheelchair. In 1995, only 6 years later, he was sworn in as a Director of the Federal Housing Finance Board, a position he was nominated for by President Later, in 2001, President George Bush elevated him to Chairman of that In 2005, he became a senior legislative counsel to the House Financial Services Committee, until his first retirement from government in 2007. He had 20 years of service.  He had had a good career and a recovery story that was respected by everyone who knew about it. He could very well have sat back and enjoyed that retirement after those 20 years, but Tim's life is defined by purpose and service and people. So after trying retirement for a little while, Tim returned to the place he loved and the people he knew, coming back here to the U.Senate as a doorkeeper in 2010.  Tim's extensive knowledge of Capitol Hill has benefited the U.Senate, and I will tell you what--his good spirits have had an effect on countless Senators, including me, countless members of our staff, and many visitors. His attitude is infectious. He exemplifies the power of positive thinking. He certainly brightens my days, and I know he has inspired many.  By the way, I just heard today that he is also a leader among doorkeepers, including organizing periodic team-building events at the Nats games with his fellow doorkeepers.  This month, as we recognize Tim's 27 years of public service, we also recognize his incredible life journey and his resilience in the face of adversity. Strokes can affect people in a variety of ways. In Tim's case, I must say I think it made him a stronger person.  Guided by his love for his wife Ginny and their three children now and his dedication to public service, Tim has had a career and a life worthy of celebration and recognition.  So, Tim, today, this week, we all congratulate you on 27 years of honorable service and wish you many more to come.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6108-2.txt,924,1145,2017.0,26.0,September
1030,topic-id,1632,"Mr.President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague from Nebraska, and our hearts go out to those victims of the hurricane now in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, following the terrible devastation in Texas and These are American citizens who deserve our assistance and urgent help.  I am glad to hear there is now more support mobilizing on the island. I would like to associate myself with the comments of those who talk about the need to move quickly to save lives.                   Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act  Mr.President, I rise to talk about something different today, something equally urgent and concerning. It has to do with legislation that is present here in the U.Senate and in the House of It is about an issue called sex trafficking--human trafficking. It is a crime against humanity. It is a human rights issue that really transcends partisanship and transcends politics.  Every day that we aren't acting here to help push back against this, countless vulnerable women and children are suffering. I personally think it is a stain on our national character that sex trafficking is increasing in this country, in this century, at this time. Experts tell us that it is increasing because of the internet. So the internet, which has so many positive aspects, also has a dark side. One is the selling of children and women online with ruthless efficiency.  I appreciated the Senate Commerce Committee holding a hearing last week on bipartisan legislation called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers I appreciated the opportunity to testify in support of this legislation at that hearing. But, actually, the most powerful testimony by far came from a mom. Her name is Yvonne Yvonne received a call on Christmas Eve that every parent dreads. As a dad of three kids, I can't imagine. Her 16-year-old daughter, Desiree, was murdered while being exploited and sold for sex on backpage.com, the industry leader in the online sex trafficking of minors.  A 16-year-old girl should never have been trafficked online, but the tragedy of her death is compounded by the fact that backpage.com, the website she was bought and sold on, has repeatedly evaded justice for its role in child sex trafficking.  We know from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that backpage alone is responsible for most child trafficking. In fact, 75 percent of all child trafficking reports the organization receives from the public have to do with backpage.com. We know from a nearly 2-year investigation by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, that backpage actively and knowingly facilitated online sex trafficking, coached its users on how to post so-called clean ads for illegal transactions, and knowingly edited ads to conceal evidence of crimes, including the concealed evidence of underage girls being sold online.  Despite these facts, which are horrendous, courts have consistently ruled that a Federal law called the Communications Decency Act protects backpage from its liability for its role in sex trafficking. This law is 21 years old. It shields websites from liability for crimes others commit through their site. It was enacted when the internet was in its infancy. It was intended, by the way, in part to protect children from indecent material on the internet. Now it is protecting websites that sell women and children for sex.  This was never Congress's intention when enacting the Communications Decency In fact, last week, California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, testified at the Senate hearing I talked about. He was a Congressman in 1996 when the law was enacted. In discussing the Communications Decency Act, he said: ``I don't remember in 1996 believing my `yes' vote meant I was going to allow, 21 years later, for kids to be sold through the internet for sex.''  Congress clearly did not intend for this broad immunity to occur, but courts have made it clear their hands are tied because of legal precedent and have invited the Congress to fix this injustice.  Just last month, a Sacramento judge made the most blatant call on Congress yet. The court threw out pimping charges against backpage.com because of the liability protections provided to the website under Federal law. The court opinion stated: ``If and until Congress sees fit to amend the immunity law, the broad reach of section 230 of the Communications Decency Act even applies to those alleged to support the exploitation of others by human trafficking.''  Because of this interpretation of the law over the last 20 years, only Congress can fix this injustice. Again, that is why I introduced the bipartisan Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers  Along with coauthors Senators Blumenthal, McCain, McCaskill, Cornyn, and Heitkamp, we are determined to get this bill passed to make a difference in the lives of countless women and children who have been exploited by online sex traffickers.  Last week's hearing was a great positive step in that direction. We had bipartisan support in the hearing, and I hope that after the hearing, we can move quickly to a markup. I thank Senator Thune, who was on the floor earlier--chairman of the committee--for his leadership in this area.  The bill would do two things. They are both very targeted and narrow. One, it would allow sex trafficking victims to get the justice they deserve against websites that knowingly facilitate crimes against them. Second, it would allow State and local law enforcement to prosecute websites that violate Federal sex trafficking laws, again, with the knowing standard.  This standard of knowing is a high bar to meet. Websites would have to be proven to knowingly facilitate, support, or assist online sex trafficking to be liable. Because the standard is so high, our bill protects good technology companies--good actors--and targets rogue online traffickers like backpage. Our bill also preserves the Good Samaritan provision in the Communications Decency Act, which protects the actors that proactively screen their websites for offensive material.  These are commonsense updates to bring a 21-year-old statute into the 21st century.  This bill has received wide bipartisan support. Thirty-three Senators have supported it, one-third of the entire U.Senate as cosponsors. We also have the support of dozens of anti-human trafficking groups in all of our States, faith-based groups from around the country, law enforcement groups, all the national law enforcement groups, including the attorneys general, the groups out there that actually are involved in these prosecutions. They have all publicly endorsed this legislation.  Some significant players in the tech and business community have also stepped up to support it. Recently, Oracle endorsed the legislation, also 21st[[Page S6209]]Century Fox, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Walt Disney Company, and others have supported our narrowly crafted legislation because they know it is necessary, it is needed, and it doesn't affect the good actors.  I would love to see others in the tech community step forward and help us. We want them to partner with us in this. They should be as concerned as anyone, if not more, because online, on the internet, this is taking place. They should want to support, address this injustice, where traffickers exploit women and children with immunity.  Some in the tech community have argued this bill would inadvertently harm good-intentioned websites. I don't believe that is true, but, more importantly, nor do legal scholars who have looked at this.  Attorney General Xavier Becerra explained in last week's hearing that ``we have to prove criminal intent. We can't win a prosecution unless we can show that the individuals we're prosecuting, like Backpage, had the intent--the knowledge--to do what they are doing. The legislation that you have before you is very narrowly tailored. It goes only after sex trafficking.''  That was our intent, to do it narrowly. The bill targets websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking and protects those that don't. It is as simple as that. I think those in the tech community who remain in opposition to this legislation have to realize that by doing so, they are protecting these bad actors, bringing a bad name to the internet. Instead, they should partner with us to protect our kids.  I have spoken about courts and attorneys general calling on Congress to change the Communications Decency The most powerful call on Congress actually came at the Senate hearing last week--not from a lawyer, not from a judge. It came from a mom.  Yvonne Ambrose, whom I mentioned earlier, the mother of the late 16-year-old, Desiree Robinson, with great courage, stated:       Backpage.com and other companies like it must be held      responsible for what they have created. I'm sure when this      act was put in place in [19]96, the Internet was in its      infancy, and it was not intended to allow companies to      legally sell children on the internet. But somehow, a dollar      has become more important than a human life. If you're going      to fix this problem, fix it.  Let's fix it. Last week's Senate hearing was a step in the right direction. Senators from both sides of the aisle understood the injustice that occurs and were passionate in expressing their desire to find a solution. I would just tell you that we have very carefully assessed this problem over the last couple of years, carefully and thoughtfully not just assessed it but looked for a legislative fix that would be a solution to the problems we have identified. We now need to act on it as soon as possible to save those women and children who are being trafficked online every day as we wait.  The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act stops an injustice. I urge the Senate to take up this legislation, seize this opportunity, have the markup, get it to the floor, get it to the House where there is companion legislation, and fix this problem to protect our kids.  Thank you.  I yield back.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-09-28-pt1-PgS6205-2.txt,924,1145,2017.0,28.0,September

965,topic-id,1718,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this essential question of public integrity. I also want to salute my colleague from California (Mr.Ted Lieu), who has been a leading voice in demanding real financial accountability in the administration.  I want to underscore some of the things that my colleagues have said, Mr.If there are any Americans out there who love to fly wherever[[Page H7623]]they want, whenever they want, at taxpayer expense, then we have got the perfect job for you in President Trump's Now, of course, only billionaires and millionaires need apply for these jobs, but if you have a taste for fancy chartered air travel, paid for by hardworking Americans across the country, this is undoubtedly the job for you.  My friends, while millions of desperate Americans are suffering in the sweltering posthurricane conditions of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida, Texas, and Louisiana, we have got Cabinet Secretaries who should be doing everything in their power to save our people but are, instead, looking out for something far more important, apparently, than other Americans' mere survival. They are focused on their own first class, private charter, airplane flights to cushy destinations, paid for by hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money. We kid you not.  This comes out this week. It comes out that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is less interested in health and human services than he is in wealth and valet services. Despite the fact that he blasted the use of government-paid jet travel on CNBC just a few short years ago, he seems to have come down with a severe and chronic case of swamp fever, billing you and me and millions of other Americans for 26 customized, deluxe, premier, first class, private charter, plane flights at taxpayer expense, at an extraordinary estimated cost of more than $400,000. That is just one Cabinet  Now, I can't blame him for one of the trips that he took in August to the beautiful and secluded Simons Island in southern Georgia, and another trip that enabled him to get to his condo in Nashville and to have lunch with his son. You can hardly blame him for wanting to get out of town and to see the family. After all, it was hot here in Washington, D.C., as climate change sets in across America and the world. But as we say on Capitol Hill: ``It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.''  And look at what our Secretary of Health and Human Services did, and here I will read from Politico, September 26, an article entitled ``Price's private-jet travels included visits with colleagues, lunch with son.''  ``The HHS Secretary sometimes combined official travel and meetings with friends and family. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price took a government-funded private jet in August to get to Simons Island, an exclusive Georgia resort where he and his wife own land, a day and a half before he addressed a group of local doctors at a medical conference that he and his wife have long attended.  ``The Simons Island trip was one of two taxpayer-funded flights on private jets in which Price traveled to places where he owns property, and paired official visits with meetings with longtime colleagues and family members. On June 6, HHS chartered a jet to fly Price to Nashville, Tennessee, where he owns a condominium and where his son resides. Price toured a medicine dispensary and spoke to a local health summit organized by a longtime friend. He also had lunch with his son. . . .  ``An HHS official said both the Georgia and Tennessee trips were for official government business and were paid for by the Department.''  It is no problem getting out of town and going to see your family but, really, do the taxpayers have to pay for it?  If the taxpayers have to pay for trips like this, couldn't Secretary Price at least fly on first class commercial airplanes, rather than jacking up the taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars to book a private airplane to do it?  Politico asked the same question. Here they said:  ``Like some of the other 26 flights that Price took on corporate jets since May identified by a Politico review, the trip to Tennessee appears to have occurred despite the existence of multiple commercial flight options. The trip to Georgia, while less direct, also could have been accomplished with a routine connecting flight through Atlanta's busy international airport.  ``On August 4, Price flew a Dassault Falcon 2000 twin jet from Raleigh, North Carolina, where he had given a speech to a flu vaccine manufacturer, to Brunswick Golden Isles Airport, which is about a half-hour drive from Simons It was the same plane that had shuttled him between five States in four days, one that HHS had chartered through Classic Air Charter for more than $86,000, according to Federal contracts.  ``The plane arrived in Brunswick at 4:02 p.m. the afternoon before the start of the two-day Medical Association of Georgia retreat and roughly 40 hours before Price addressed the group, according to airport records. . . .''                              {time}  1300  ``At about the same time, there were connecting commercial flights from Raleigh to Brunswick via Atlanta that would have gotten Price to Simons Island that evening.''  My friends, you can go back and you can look. In all of these cases, for example, Secretary Price chartered a plane for $25,000 of government money from Dulles Airport to Philadelphia, a distance of a mere 135 miles. That charter flight left 5 minutes after a regular flight flew, commercial flight flew, from Dulles for a few hundred dollars. So he paid $25,000 and left several minutes later than he would have left had he just taken the commercial flight.  He also could have taken, of course, the Amtrak, which is what most people do when they are going to Philadelphia from the Washington area, for a mere $72. Even the first class Acela would have been around $200. He could have taken the British Airways--they go there--whose slogan is: ``To To Serve.'' I guess that is not quite right. Or he could have taken Southwest Their slogan is: ``Low fares. Nothing to hide.'' I see that wouldn't have fit. Maybe JetBlue, ``You Above All.'' That could have worked.  But no, instead, he had to book the private jet and fly for $25,000 from here to  Mr.Speaker, this is an old Washington story. The people who say they are coming to drain the swamp have become the swamp. And this is not something that affects just one Cabinet Several Cabinet Secretaries are doing this, as my colleagues have pointed out.  With Secretary Price, who seems to be the captain of the swamp flyers; Secretary Pruitt, who is a frequent swamp flyer himself; and Secretary Mnuchin, another swamp flyer, we have a serious staph infection spreading throughout the Trump administration.  And why not, the President seems to have evolved a whole new model of government in the 21st century. Government is a money-making operation for specific families and specific tiny groups in the society. And that is the message that pervades the Trump administration today.  Mr.Speaker, we need to pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act, which is very simple. It says that those of us who have the honor and the privilege of coming to serve the American people here in Washington, D.C., should use regular commercial air flights unless it is a matter of national security, or unless there is not a commercial flight that will get them to where they need to go.  But the idea that you have Cabinet Secretaries who have already taken dozens of flights, paid for with hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars, of taxpayer money when a commercial flight would have done is an absolute scandal. Now, it hasn't gotten much attention yet because on the scale of the scandals we have seen in this administration, I agree, it is a relatively small one. But it is a dramatic and vivid illustration of what is going on here.  The people who said they were going to drain the swamp became the swamp. And now, the swamp pervades everything. Every Cabinet member, all of the Secretaries, the entire government is engulfed in this kind of corruption.  It begins right at the top, where President Trump has continued to collect hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars in foreign payments at the Trump Hotels, at the Trump office tower, and the Trump golf courses around the world from foreign governments, and has not once come to the U.Congress to ask for our permission and consent as is required by Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the Constitution, which forbids the collection of presents, emoluments, offices, and titles from foreign governments by anybody who serves under the United States, who holds an office under the United States.[[Page H7624]]  This President is not only collecting rampant, extreme amounts of money through his businesses from foreign governments, he is not even asking us for our permission or our consent. We have got to pass the SWAMP FLYERS  I commend Mr.Lieu for writing this immediately when the news broke about this rampant abuse of current regulations. We need to take a stand as a Congress on a bipartisan level. Unanimously, we can pass this to say that government officials should not be flying at taxpayer expense for dubious reasons. We should be using coach like everybody else, flying commercial like everybody else.  If you have got to fly first class, fine, fly first class, but fly commercial unless it is a matter of national security, or unless there is not a commercial flight that will get you there. Is that something that we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis?  I just want to say, earlier today we saw a magnificent example of real public service and public dedication by our distinguished colleague, Mr.Scalise, who has returned, thankfully, to this body. He demonstrates and embodies what is best in terms of public service. Unfortunately, we have also seen in Washington this week the personification of what is the worst in public service. We have got to stop taking the American taxpayers for a ride.  Let's pass the SWAMP FLYERS Act immediately.

They have been trying to sell this as a new and better health care bill, but in fact they somehow have managed to come up with something even worse than the previous TrumpCare bills. It would repeal the Affordable Care Act, gutting key protections for people with preexisting conditions and ending Medicaid as we know it.  I want to recognize some of my colleagues, however, on the other side of the aisle who already stood up to this effort, because no matter how many changes have been made to gain the support of Senators, this bill would be devastating to every State, including my home State of Rhode  Senate Republicans are trying to hide the impact of the bill, potentially forcing a vote before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is even able to publish a full score and analysis of the bill, including estimates for how many people would lose coverage and how healthcare costs would be affected.

Yet the majority is attempting to rush this through in order to use budget rules that expire on Saturday that enable passage of this bill with just 51 votes.  Fortunately, a number of nonpartisan organizations are publishing data on the latest bill, and they all agree that this bill would have a similar impact as the previous TrumpCare bills. Tens of millions of Americans would lose coverage, State budgets would be decimated, and costs would increase--especially for those with preexisting conditions, who would be priced out of the market entirely. According to one of these organizations, Avalere, Rhode Island is slated to lose $3 billion by 2027, and the cuts only get worse from there. Medicaid would be cut drastically, meaning our most vulnerable citizens would lose access to health care, including children, people with disabilities, and seniors.  Over 60 percent of nursing home residents in Rhode Island access care through Medicaid, and half of Medicaid spending is on these long-term care services.  It would become impossible to protect these programs from the cuts projected under this bill. In fact, States would be forced to cut not only health care but also education and infrastructure and other priorities to make up or try to make up--and I think ``try to make up'' are better words to use--the difference. This would be nothing short of a crisis in every State in this country.  We have already spent so much time this year having this fight--time we could have spent working across the aisle to improve health care, to end sequestration, and to ensure a stable Federal budget to improve our economy.  In fact, after the efforts to pass TrumpCare failed just 2 months ago, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee joined together in a bipartisan fashion to come up with a bill that would improve our healthcare system and lower costs for everyone. Significant progress on this effort has been made.  However, by resurrecting this TrumpCare debate, we are again on the brink of voting on whether to kick millions of Americans off of their health insurance. With this effort, Republicans are taking our health care system hostage again, as deadlines approach this week for finalizing insurance rates for the next year. Health insurance commissioners and other experts have already said that the instability in Washington has caused rates to increase. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue down this destructive path.  What is especially egregious is that in addition to the jettisoned ACA stabilization efforts, we also need to extend funding for other critical bipartisan health care priorities, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program and the community health centers, whose Federal funding expires in just a couple of days. In fact, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee had come to a bipartisan agreement to extend funding for CHIP for 5 years, providing stability and assurances for States and families across the country. However, that work is now on hold, just like the critical ACA stabilization effort.  We must continue to make our voices heard and show the majority that this is not what the American people want. They want us to work together to strengthen health care, increase access, and keep costs down. The enormous outpouring of citizen opposition and health care experts criticizing TrumpCare over the summer was a very powerful statement about what the American people--my constituents and people across the country--believe should be the path forward on health care.  As my colleagues work to make last-minute changes to the bill and conceal the real impacts by refusing to hold substantive hearings and rushing new versions of the bill to the floor with little or no warning, my constituents are not fooled. They continue to write to me, urging me to keep up the opposition to  Just a week or two ago, I heard from Barbara in Middletown, Her mother has Alzheimer's diseases and relies on Medicaid for long-term care. Her sister has Down syndrome and has recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease as well. She also relies on Medicaid for her health care. This new proposal, just like the previous proposals, would be devastating to Barbara and her family.  I urge my colleagues to really think about who would be impacted by this legislation. Whether or not you like ObamaCare or voted for it 7 years ago, this latest TrumpCare bill is not the solution.  I will continue to oppose these efforts and hope to work with my colleagues to improve our health care system and lower costs for everybody.  I yield the floor.

619,topic-id,749,"Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman Evans, for leading this Special Order and for yielding to me, especially on a matter this important.  As I reflect on the last 200 or so days in this country, I am saddened.                              {time}  1930  The truth of the matter is I always thought this country was better than this. I thought that we had so many people, not just African Americans, but we had people of like mind, like Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner, who gave their lives and who sacrificed blood, sweat, and tears so that this country could be a more perfect Union, so that I could go to some of the best schools in the country, so that I could dream the impossible dream, so that I could stand on the floor of this House and speak my mind, introduce legislation, but, more importantly, fight for the ideals that make this country an exceptional country.  It is so easy for our President and our colleagues to say America's exceptional. Well, it is, but you have to understand how it got to be exceptional, because it didn't start off that way. In fact, we came here on boats. We survived middle passage. We built this Capitol as free labor. We have given as much blood, sweat, and tears as any people in this country.  To see the President of the United States call people who would walk with neo-Nazis and the KKK and white supremacists, some of them are fine people--but young African-American males are taking a knee not to disrespect our country, but they are taking a knee because they want a better future for their sons. They want better community police interaction. What they want is that people who are with the color of law with misconduct against African-American men and women, sons and daughters, parents, grandparents, what they want is a better country for them.  They didn't choose violence. They chose peaceful protests just like Martin Luther When King chose peaceful protests, what the President doesn't realize is that the country wasn't accepting of his ways either.  ``Letter from Birmingham Jail'' was all about King responding to people of like mind who shared the cause of freedom and equality and justice. They just didn't like his tactics. And the question was: We should wait. His letter was addressing people of like mind.  The problem here is I just can't address someone of like mind because I don't think that this administration has the maturity, the sensitivity, or the understanding, whether it is willful or unwillful, to understand what is going on in this country. Instead of doing the Presidential thing, instead of doing the right thing and bringing this country together, I am afraid that this country is being torn apart at its very core, and for that I know that we are a better country.  Let me just say in closing that, in order for us to move forward in a more responsible and more perfect fashion, it is going to take ordinary citizens like you out there watching us at home, it is going to take you all standing up and speaking out. It doesn't matter if you are African American or if you are Hispanic or if you are Black, injustice is injustice. The words ``no justice, no peace'' are not a threat. It is that it is hard to accomplish peace when there is no justice in the land.  I would just ask that we all come together and that we not only look at words, but we look at policies, so when we now look at the opioid addiction through a loving mental health medical crisis standpoint, we don't forget the young people who were addicted to crack and who got involved in drugs back then that we have now decided that, with opioids, we are going to take a nurturing approach and with crack we locked everyone up. We should come in, take the approach that we are doing with opioids, which is the exact correct approach, and we should apply it to crack, and we should apply it to all of those millions of people who are incarcerated for drug crimes.  When you start talking about root out racism, it has to be in policy, it has to be in our rhetoric, but it has to be in our daily lives.

480,topic-id,492,"Mr.President, today I would like to recognize an outstanding small business located in my home State of Dedication, hard work, and the entrepreneurial spirit are some of the guiding principles that define us as It is these traits that have enabled so many of our fellow citizens to achieve the American dream. As our workforce moves further into the 21st century, new opportunities are created every day by the American people themselves to ensure that they can achieve a better standard of life, without reliance on others. My State of Idaho knows this and is proud to serve as an incubator for many small businesses that seek to expand these values through their unique entrepreneurial spirit. As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize LiveRez as the Senate Small Business of the Month for September 2017. LiveRez is one of a good number of software companies in Idaho, which provides services to American businesses nationwide and serves as a true example of hard work in pursuit of the American dream.  LiveRez is based out of Eagle, ID, and was founded by Tracy Lotz in 2008, after years of research and development within the vacation rental sector. Tracy started his journey with vacation rentals in 1994, when he launched First Choice Vacation Properties, one of the few early websites where managers were able to advertise their vacation rentals in cyberspace. It wouldn't be until 2002 that Tracy and his nephew Jeremy would start building websites for their clientele of professional vacation rental managers, and within a year, they were pioneering online bookings in real time. It would not be until 2005 that the Lotz's would shift from providing the service at an incremental level to designing software that would be 100 percent cloud-based. In January 2008, LiveRez was launched as the first all-in-the-cloud management system. From there, they have continued expanding and innovating with the establishment of the First Advisory Board, mobile websites, and other technical applications that enabled their software to be one of the most sought after management systems for managers not only in the United States but also around the world.  Perhaps what makes all of this success even more incredible is that Tracy was able to do all of this organically, utilizing the revenue from the company's early days to continue to grow. He did not seek out venture capital for the company, nor did he take on debt. Today Tracy and the team at LiveRez host their annual partner conference, which includes classes, tech reveals, networking, and more amenities for members of the industry.  I would like to congratulate Tracy Lotz and the employees of LiveRez on their innovation and hard work and the commitment that they have to their partners and clients. I wish the best for LiveRez, and I am confident that they will continue to provide innovative services and ideas to their growing customer base.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgS6185-2.txt,1896,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,27.0,September
58,topic-id,646,"Mr.Speaker, for over 50 years, the only game in town for flood insurance has been the Federal Government through the National Flood Insurance That means that for over 50 years, if you want flood insurance, your best bet is to go to the Federal Government, which, by the way, especially after these two successive storms that have just hit Texas and Florida, is going to be over $30 billion in debt.  If we don't do something to save the taxpayers of this program that cannot actuarially support itself, we are doing a total disservice to our constituency and to our country. So what is part of the underlying bill that this rule will allow is the Market Parity and Modernization Act that will allow consumers to have a choice between the existing Flood Insurance Program, which is significantly in debt, or to have the private sector bring in their flood insurance programs to insure those risks.  In Florida, back in 2004, we had successive hurricanes that came through my district, and we had billions of dollars paid by FEMA, paid by NFIP, but we had $39 billion paid by the private sector because we had private windstorm insurance. The private sector does a much better job of doing business and managing risks than the Federal  What I am asking for this body to accept, what the American people are craving for, is competition in the products they seek to have to protect them with their valuable assets. It is kind of like the Flood Insurance Program is a boat, and after 50 years of plugging holes, it is taking on water more and more.  One of the suggestions is, let's just keep bailing. I submit to you that to any logical person, the first step would be to plug that hole. We are going to continue to bail. We need to continue to bail, but we need to plug that hole so we don't get deeper and deeper in debt.  So the underlying bill, the FAA reauthorization, has the Ross-Castor bill in there for a reason, so that we can invite a private market to come to the rescue of those consumers out there who need to not only be able to have options greater than what the National Flood Insurance Program provides, because they don't provide business interruption. They don't provide temporary housing, but the private sector will. More importantly, the private sector will mitigate and will manage that risk.  There is no mitigation program that is effective in the Federal Government right now. It is a flowing of dollars to say: Here, do this; or, do that.  Private risk management will help consumers mitigate, lessen their risks, have more resilient homes.  What I am suggesting to you is that this is a paradigm shift for this country. That if we are going to say that the business of the United States should be left to business, and government should do what government should do, then this is a move in that direction because government should not be in the business of insurance. It is in the business of relief.  There is no question about that, but relief is post-event help. Insurance is pre-event. It is calculating that risk. It is managing that risk. And that is what the private sector does so well. We owe it to our consumers and we owe it to our taxpayers who are bailing out the NFIP, that we give consumers this choice.  I would just submit to you, Mr.Speaker, that if we have a chance to finally make a paradigm shift when we take the burden of bailouts off the shoulders of taxpayers and allow those who do best what they do best in managing capital and managing risk, do so for the benefit of the consumers, that this underlying bill and the FAA reauthorization allows for that.

1149,topic-id,577,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this desperately needed legislation.  Included in this bill are two provisions that are particularly important to my constituents in central One is tax relief for families and small businesses recovering from the destruction of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, and The other is language taken from my legislation, the Private Flood Insurance Market Development Act, which will allow private sector insurers to compete with the National Flood Insurance  The catastrophic impact of the three major hurricanes is heartbreaking and tragic. However, it has been inspiring to witness the outpouring of charity and goodwill from our communities in response.  Now it is time for this Congress to rise to the occasion. The tax relief for disaster victims in this legislation is a great first step.  This bill will help individuals in the disaster areas keep their jobs, support retirement savers paying for recovery, encourage charitable contributions to help victims, and put more money in the pockets of families trying to get their lives back on track after having lost everything.  To deny our constituents this relief because it is not enough is simply irresponsible. To be sure, I agree that more aid will likely be needed.  But is that really a good excuse to do nothing?  I certainly don't think so.  Mr.Speaker, this bill isn't just about providing immediate relief. Thankfully, it also provides some measure of long-term relief to communities vulnerable to floods--the most costly of all natural disasters.  Thanks to the inclusion of my legislation, H.1422, this bill will provide consumers with more options and lower costs in the flood insurance marketplace as well as help to reduce the unacceptable number of homes not insured for flood losses.  Last Congress, this House passed nearly identical legislation by a vote of 419-0. That is why I was so disheartened to hear some characterize this reform as a long-time Republican priority. This isn't a Republican priority, and it is not a Democratic priority. This is a national priority.  The NFIP is more than $25 billion in debt and runs an annual deficit of $1.4 billion. Folks, this is an insurance company on the brink of being unable to pay out claims to policyholders without another taxpayer bailout.  The NFIP desperately needs to off-load some of its risk, and we can help by allowing the private sector to do what it does best: compete for customers by offering better service, lower prices, and more comprehensive coverage.  I understand some of my colleagues think competition will destabilize the First, we need to be clear that the NFIP in its current state is beleaguered, it is not stable, and it is not sustainable. Reforms must be made.  Second, I would urge my colleagues to recognize that by forcing nearly all of the flood risk in this Nation into a single, government-run insurance program, we contribute to the NFIP's bloated and unstable risk portfolio.                              {time}  1830  So the NFIP needs some help, and consumers need competition. More coverage options will help make flood insurance an attractive investment for everyone, thereby reducing the number of uninsured homes.  With the NFIP alone, our constituents are severely limited. For example, an NFIP policy only covers up to $250,000 of damages.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

389,topic-id,1672,"Mr.President, I had the opportunity yesterday, along with the Coast Guard and the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, Jenniffer Gonzalez, to visit San Juan, Puerto Rico, to see firsthand some of the devastation that has impacted this U.territory. I would summarize it by saying that what I saw were more than 3.5 million American citizens potentially on the verge of a serious and growing humanitarian crisis.  There are a lot of reasons for this. The first is that Puerto Rico has been in the eye of not one but three storms. The first was Hurricane Irma, which impacted it a few weeks ago, followed by the devastation of Hurricane Maria, and preexisting these two things was a very significant fiscal crisis that placed extraordinary constraints on the ability of the territory's government both to prepare for the storm and now to respond to it.  Our traditional model of hurricane response--one that, unfortunately, because of numerous storms, I have come to know well as a resident of Florida--is that FEMA basically arrives in support of the When Florida gets hit by a storm and Texas gets hit by a storm, FEMA comes in to the State and tells the State: We are here to help. Tell us where to go, tell us what you need, and we will provide those resources to the places you want. It works that way. The President issues an emergency declaration, and it opens up FEMA and other disaster relief, and then the State government directs that assistance and tells them: This is what we need, this is where we need it, and this is what we can handle on our own. This model will not work in Puerto It will not work foremost because, as I stated earlier, the financial and fiscal constraints have limited its capacity to build its own internal ability to respond.  They had just finished repairing the damage from Irma a few weeks ago. So, literally, there are not nearly enough basic things like those wooden poles to hold up the electric lines or the transformers that are attached to them or even the lines themselves, and, in many cases, the fuel, power, and crews to get to the work sites.  It will not work because, in many cases, the government of Puerto Rico still does not have a full assessment of the damage of the storm. While communication in San Juan is severely limited, in most of the other areas of the big island and smaller islands, communication is nonexistent.  Something was brought to my attention firsthand yesterday when we visited one of the Coast Guard centers and watched. Much of the response they are conducting there is limited to a paper map on the wall with some sticky note pads and four landlines on which they hope people can call in and get updates on what they are seeing in the field from a satellite phone. Hopefully, that has improved over the last 24 hours as more Coast Guard vessels have come in to support communications. But we still have large parts of Puerto Rico that have not communicated with the rest of the island, the government, or the outside world, for that matter, going on to today.  There are also logistical challenges. In most of the 50 States--certainly in my home State of Florida, we saw the largest power restoration effort in the history of the world. At least that is what they are claiming. Literally, we saw hundreds of those bucket trucks from all over the United States--all 50 States and even Canada--coming in with prearranged contracts and their crews to restore power. Even with that dramatic level of response, there were people without power until late this weekend, and there are still a couple thousand people in Florida who have no power.  You can't drive a convoy of trucks into Puerto They have to come in on a barge, and those barges take 7 days from Jacksonville and 5 days from Miami, plus whatever time it takes to travel and position those crews to get there. You not only have to deliver the crews, you have to deliver the supplies in order to be able to restore power.  What is the practical impact of not having power? Having no power is not simply an inconvenience; for many people it is life and death. Imagine an area outside of San Juan where someone is a diabetic and depends on insulin that needs to be refrigerated. That medicine has gone bad by now if they haven't run out. Imagine someone who needs dialysis twice a week. It has been longer than that since they have had it. Imagine if someone needs chemotherapy if they have cancer. That is not going to happen this week or next unless things change.  These are real challenges, and I raise them only because this is a disaster that will require an intensity of effort on behalf of the Federal Government that you would not traditionally see in a storm that impacts the mainland for the reasons I have outlined--and many more.  Now, the good news is, earlier today you saw the White House engage even[[Page S6124]]more in terms of some of the things they are doing. There are more Department of Defense assets and, as a result of some restoration at the airport, the ability to land more planes more quickly. So, again, more things are coming in. The port opened fairly quickly, but the challenges remain.  Even if today we could approve $10 billion in assistance and somehow figured out a way to deliver it to Puerto Rico in the next 24 hours, they would still be challenged to take it from the airport to the seaport and deliver it to the places that need it the most because there are roads that are still not clear, because we still don't have a full assessment of where the damage is and where the need is most and, quite frankly, because there are probably roads and bridges in parts of Puerto Rico that will collapse if one of these big trucks drive over them.  I say this because there is only one entity in the world with the capacity to respond to all these various issues; that is, the Federal Government of the United Leveraging the power of the Department of Defense and an assortment of other agencies, it remains the only institution certainly in our country--and probably in the world--with a capacity to respond quickly and effectively to the crisis at hand.  While response to this storm will take a significant amount of patience, it will also take a significant amount of urgency. For each day that goes by, this crisis will get worse, not better. I fear that if, in fact, there is not enough urgency in the response, we will be talking about a very different set of stories in the days to come.  I hope I am wrong, with all of my heart, but I fear that when communication lines come back up and when we start getting more access to some of these areas that have been cut off, we are going to start learning that the toll and the impact of the storm is far worse than we had imagined. I pray with all my heart that someone will watch this video on YouTube one day and say: Oh, look, he was exaggerating. It wasn't that bad after all. I hope that is what happens, but I fear it will not, and every day that goes by, it will only get worse.  I don't believe it is fair to say that the response up to this point is because some people don't care or because they haven't paid enough attention to it. I honestly think it is just a challenge that is unique and that requires us to respond to it in ways we wouldn't traditionally respond, for the factors I have just pointed out.  In most places on the mainland, if not all, the States have a certain capacity internally to address this, but Puerto Rico, for the challenges I have just outlined--and particularly because of the storm that just passed--has already had many of those resources depleted.  There is positive news today. The USS Comfort, a ship that is a hospital ship, is on its way, but again it will take it a number of days to get there. The Federal Government has agreed to a 100-percent Federal match. It usually means the Federal Government paid a portion of it and the States pay the rest. The Federal Government, for the next 180 days, has agreed to 100 percent payment of these services, and that will be critical because these restoration crews are going to want to know how their costs are going to be paid if they show up and begin to restore power.  I just think it is imperative that we don't lose focus and don't lose sight of what is at hand because there are over 3 million American citizens in danger. A number of them--perhaps in the thousands--already have existing vulnerabilities and are in severe danger of losing their life and extraordinary human suffering.  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who, throughout the day, have expressed a tremendous amount of interest in wanting to know how they can be helpful and what they can do. I think the most important thing we need to do now is to continue to drive the sense of urgency, to do all we can to bring to bear all of the resources the Federal Government can bring to assist in this recovery. Then we will be able to work together on not just rebuilding Puerto Rico but helping her to rebuild so she is stronger, more prosperous, and more stable than ever.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

875,topic-id,469,"Mr.Speaker, the Graham-Cassidy bill is the worst version of TrumpCare yet.  By block granting healthcare, this bill puts healthcare on the chopping block. In order to make ends meet, States will have to change their eligibility criteria, meaning millions more left uninsured. They will have to cut certain benefits and expensive coverage like perhaps cancer treatment or that extra stay in the hospital. They will have to reduce reimbursements for hospitals, clinics, and doctors.  That is a big, disproportionate cut to those healthcare providers, especially in rural and underserved communities. This means that millions more will be uninsured and hardworking families will be forced to pay more out of pocket for healthcare.  This also means that patients with preexisting conditions will be priced out of their healthcare and pay more out of pocket for higher premiums and higher deductibles. They will have to pay for needed care that will no longer be guaranteed coverage under essential healthcare benefits. Furthermore,[[Page H7494]]older Americans will be faced with paying higher premiums under the bill's age tax.  We cannot let this bill become law. We cannot allow patients, families, seniors, and those who have diabetes and chronic illnesses like asthma, COPD, or obesity to be left to fend for themselves. That is not the America that we know. That is not the values that we share.  We don't believe that healthcare is a commodity only for those that can afford it. Those who can't afford healthcare will have to fend for themselves, simply because they can't afford it. We believe that we all have a responsibility for health as a common good, with a social responsibility to make sure that our neighbors and our communities are well, that our neighbors' kids are free from infections that can spread to other kids. That is why we have strong vaccination programs.  Health is, fundamentally, a human right. The rest of the world sees it that way, so why not America, the leaders of our globe. We must and we can do better.  To my Republican colleagues, I know that passing a bill is important politically because you campaigned on this for the past 8 years.

177,topic-id,1617,"Mr.President, until you arrived to relieve me, I had been presiding since the opening of the Senate this morning, and I had the opportunity to listen to lengthy speeches from the Democratic leader and the assistant Democratic leader this morning. I would like to correct the record on three brief items.  First of all, as is common, almost an epidemic around here, there were repeated references to the Republican desire to cut Federal spending on healthcare for the poor and for the sickest among us. That is simply not true. It is an epidemic way of speaking around here, where people act as though, if you want to reduce the rate of growth, that is actually a cut. The fact that people in this body say it all the time doesn't make it true. No normal people ever talk that way. If you are having a debate at your house about your household budget and you are spending beyond your means and somebody proposes that next year you should spend 30 percent more than you spent this year, when this year you already spent more than you can afford, and you have big debate and you say ``Actually, next year, let's only spend 15 percent more than we spent this year,'' that is not a cut. You will still spend more money next year than you will this year. Because you have a debate about the rate of growth--that is not the same thing as a cut. It is a fundamentally dishonest way of speaking, and we should stop doing it around here.  The second thing that was said in these speeches that I listened to is that Republicans have a desire to give insurance companies more money. I would love it if some Democrat would come to the floor and explain why the stock prices of all the big health insurers in America have been through the roof since the passage of ObamaCare and why the big health insurance companies are the people lobbying the strongest to keep the current collapsing ObamaCare regime in place and actually asking for even more Federal money for insurance companies.  It isn't the case that the proposals Republicans are making on reforming healthcare are something for which the insurance companies are cheering; rather, the insurance companies want to keep the ObamaCare regime in place and add yet more tax dollars to it.  It would be great if we could have an honest debate around here instead of these sort of made-up stories that the Republican plans are in the interest of health insurance companies.  I will readily admit and have often admitted to this body that the Republican Party has done a bad job of explaining what we are for in terms of replacing We have done a bad job, and we have not spoken with a clear voice. But speaking for myself, I will say that I actually want to have insurance play a smaller role in the healthcare sector because there are all sorts of things that we are currently insuring against in healthcare that we don't ever conceivably think would be a rational way to build an insurance marketplace in other sectors. If you think of property and casualty insurance, for instance, we don't have any law that mandates that Allstate and State Farm have to buy my gas and schedule my Jiffy Lube appointments. If they did, I submit to you that we would all consume a lot more gas, we would do it less thoughtfully, and we would have Jiffy Lubes that are at the wrong locations, open at the wrong hours, with poor customer service, with a lack of clarity as to what services they are delivering and what quality metrics they have.  We don't try to take in other sectors--the entire sector and swallow it by insurance. Insurance is supposed to be insulation and protection against catastrophic loss in the event of unforeseen, unpredictable, non-behaviorally driven events.  To be clear, I don't think the Republican Party has spoken clearly and spoken with one voice. But for this conservative vocalist, I actually want American healthcare to work better by making clear what things we want to insure against and what parts of the healthcare delivery market we think might work better if moms and dads and local doctors and nurses were more empowered by having to mediate fewer[[Page S6103]]of their transactions through the insurance space.  So while I am not in favor of cutting Federal spending for the poorest and sickest among us, I am in favor of having a debate about how we get to a sustainable growth rate, not the unsustainable growth rate we are on that is going to bankrupt the next generation.  I am in favor of shrinking the amount of money that goes to insurance companies. The plans being debated here on the floor tend to be debates where a lot of the Democrats actually want to have a conversation about how we can give even more money to insurance companies. They often have Orwellian names like ``insurance marketplace stabilization funds,'' but make no mistake--what they are really talking about is giving more money to private health insurance companies that have had stock prices go through the roof since the passage of That is the second falsehood in the speeches this morning.  A third item on which it is important to correct the record--and this is not to pick on in particular the two most powerful Democrats in the body; those just happened to be the speeches I listened to this morning. We have a habit around here of people saying a lot of things that aren't true. You might ask: Why can you get away with saying things that aren't true? One of the ways we get away with it is, just as I am doing at this moment--I am speaking to an empty The Senator from Arizona is here. He has the duty to preside over the Senate right now. But he is the only person in this So everybody at home watching on C-SPAN--I know the camera angle is this wide, and so I am the guy on the screen, but this body has 99 empty desks.  One thing that is very common--and was true of both speeches I listened to this morning--is that there is no one in the Chamber even though, as the speeches are made, there is a lot of gesturing as I beat down this debate partner, and I just one-upped you and I just persuaded you. There is a lot of motioning and gesturing and fake rhetoric that goes on around here where we try to masquerade for the American people and for the 50, 60, 70 people in the Gallery right now. I see people chuckling because they all know that it is true. They are sitting in a body, and there is no one here. Yet, when people come and make their speeches on the floor, they pretend they are winning some grand debate, and then their communication staff rips apart the video and sends it to the local TV stations back home, where people get lots of credit, as if they just won some big debate on the Senate floor. And maybe they said a whole bunch of stuff that wasn't actually true, but there was no one here to answer them because we are not actually debating big issues very often in this body.  There are a lot of theatrics and a lot of charades and a lot of false deliberation. But right now, I am speaking to an empty Chamber, and both of the speeches that I heard this morning from the Democratic leaders--making up stuff about what the Republican healthcare proposals would do--those were speeches all delivered to an empty Chamber, even though the gestures implied somebody was winning a debate when that was happening.  Once upon a time--there is no golden age in world history; we all live post fall. But once upon a time, this really was the greatest deliberative body in the world. Two hundred forty years ago when the Constitution built a system of three separate but equal branches that checked and balanced one another, the Senate had a unique role. The upper body of article I, of the legislative branch, was a place where debates were supposed to be long so that you could forge consensus--70, 80, and 90 percent consensus--on issues, because people actually were in this body actually debating real issues.  We are not the greatest deliberative body in the world right now, and a lot of people pretend we are. One of the ways we get away with that is by standing in here and pretending there are a lot of people listening to our speeches when no one is here. Again, I am the third speech of the day in the Senate today, and all three of them have had an audience of zero. I submit that most of today on C-SPAN is going to have an empty Chamber with a little ticker at the bottom that says ``waiting for Senators to speak.'' When the Senator comes to speak, they are going to speak to an empty Chamber, and they are going to pretend they are winning a big debate. It is not a useful way to tackle the biggest public policy problems that face our people and not a great way to restore the We should make the Senate great again.

10,topic-id,2035,"Mr.Speaker, you have no idea how great this feels to be back here at work in the people's  As you can imagine, these last 3\1/2\ months have been pretty challenging times for me and my family. But if you look at the outpouring of love, of warmth, of prayer, my gosh, Jennifer and I have been overwhelmed with all of that outpouring. It has given us the strength to get through all of this and to get to this point today, and it starts with  When I was laying out on that ball field, the first thing I did once I was down and I couldn't move anymore is, I just started to pray. And I will tell you, it gave me an unbelievable sense of calm knowing that at that point it was in God's hands.  But I prayed for very specific things, and I will tell you, pretty much every one of those prayers was answered. There were some pretty challenging prayers I was putting in God's hands, but He really did deliver for me and my family. And it just gives you that renewed faith and understanding that the power of prayer is something that you just cannot underestimate. So I am definitely a living example that miracles really do happen.  The first place I want to go to thank true angels along the way starts with the United States Capitol When I was elected majority whip, as you know, the elected leadership has a security detail, and if anybody ever wondered why we are assigned security detail, I surely found out that day.  Let me tell you, I want to specifically mention Crystal Griner and David Crystal and David were assigned to my security detail that morning. Day in and day out, they are part of our family. Jennifer and I truly do treat them as part of our family because they are with us everywhere we go. On that day, it was no different.  On June 14, they came at 6:30 in the morning. We arrived at the baseball field just to play and practice for a game of charity baseball. Nobody would have suspected what ensued, and yet, as soon as those shots were fired--I will tell you, when I was laying on the ground, one of the things I prayed for was that David and Crystal would be successful in carrying out their duties.  Both David and Crystal are incredibly well-trained and incredibly professional. But when I was laying there, not long after the first couple of shots were fired, I could hear a different caliber of weapon. That told me that they had immediately engaged the shooter. Let me tell you, if they didn't act so quickly--even after being shot both themselves, they continued to engage the shooter and ultimately got him down, which not only saved my life, but saved the lives of a lot of other people that are here in this Chamber today.  Crystal couldn't be with us today, but David Bailey is with us. David, you are my hero. You saved my life. Thank you so much. Tiger blood.  I also owe thanks to a lot of the people who were on the field with me. Right after the shooter was down, a lot of my colleagues came and ran to come check on me. One I want to mention in particular is one of those things that Jennifer and I call the little miracles that happened that day and throughout the next few months of our recovery.  We happened to have Brad Wenstrup on the field that day, and he was one of the first to come to my side. As you know, Brad is not only a doctor, but he is a decorated Army Ranger who served in combat. And one of his roles and missions was to take care of people that were wounded before they went off on the helicopter to go get prepared. Who would have thought that God would have put Brad out there on that field with me because the tourniquet he applied, many will tell you, saved my life so that I could actually make it to the hospital in time with all of the blood loss. So, Brad, where are you at? Right down in front.  Once I arrived at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, I was a little bit out of it at that point. But luckily, I ended up in the trusted hands of Jack Sava and his great team over at They gave me a second chance at life. Through many, many surgeries, where my life was truly in the balance in a few of those, they did a wonderful job at making sure that I was well taken care of and, ultimately, made it through that point so I could get to Golden and his team who actually put me back together again, which was quite a task, to the point where I am actually able to relearn how to walk again. So, Sava, Golden, thank you for being here and thanks for your team's work.  Above all else, I want to thank my lovely wife, Those of you who know her know how strong Jennifer is. She is an incredibly warm and loving wife, and she is an incredible mother to our children. Somehow, through the late nights and the surgeries and all of the other things, she managed to hold our family together, to make sure that Harrison and Madison were cared for as well. Still, to this day, she is not only by my side, but she is also serving as a great mother. I am lucky to have you. Thanks for being here. I love you,  While it has been a challenging time for my family, the thing that really[[Page H7613]]overwhelmed us from the start was the outpouring of love and warmth and prayers. From southeast Louisiana, the district that I represent, we saw blood drives at Catherine of Siena We saw prayer groups at First United Methodist Church in  But what we also saw were prayer groups and well-wishes being given from people that we never met before throughout all of your districts. You shared it with me, and it was one of those things that was hard for us to completely comprehend that you had people from all walks of life that had never met me before, and yet, they saw what had happened and they just wanted to offer prayers.  Let me tell you, to each and every one of you--and please convey it to your constituents, and I sure convey it to my constituents back home--that warmth and love gave us just incredible strength that you can't imagine during some really, really difficult times. So that is one more example of the power of prayer.  Something else I saw firsthand wasn't a surprise to me, but it was the outpouring of love from you, my colleagues, both Republican and I know right after the shooting--we were practicing on the Republican side and the Democrats were practicing too--my colleague and friend, and sometimes archrival in baseball from back home in New Orleans--unfortunately, the star of the game too many times--Cedric Richmond somehow figured out which hospital I was sent to, and he got there. He was probably the first person there on the scene, in his baseball uniform, to check on me.  So many others of you, again, both Republican and Democrat, reached out in ways that I can't express the gratitude and how much it means to me, Jennifer, and our whole family. It really does show the warm side of Congress that very few people get to see.  I want to thank each and every one of you for that. You don't know how much it meant to me. When I came back into this Chamber here today, just seeing the faces of all of you, it just means more to me than you can imagine. So thanks for all of that love and support.  A lot of people ask: Did the event change you? And I think those of you who know me know I am an optimistic person. I am just a fun-loving person. I am from south Louisiana, and we believe you work hard and you play hard and joie de vivre.  Is an event like this really going to change that? The first thing I can tell you is, yes, it changed me, but not in the ways you might think. It has only strengthened my faith in God, and it has really crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people. I got to see that goodness in people.  While some people might focus on a tragic event and an evil act, to me, all I remember are the thousands of acts of kindness and love and warmth that came out of this and kept me going through all of it and, again, just reemphasized just how wonderful most people are and how much compassion there is out there.  Finally, I want to talk about something that I guess hit me and probably struck me more than anything that I was not expecting, and that was the outpouring of love and support from world leaders, people I have met and have known. Benjamin Netanyahu and I have had some incredible conversations from the hospital. And Theresa May, King Abdullah of Jordan--leaders that so many of us have met--reached out. But other world leaders also reached out, people I had never met before.  That touched me in a different way because each and every one of us, we come here and we fight for the things that we believe in. I have passionate beliefs. For some reason, some of you don't agree with all of those. But it is so important that we come up here. We are the people's This is the place where these ideas are supposed to be debated, and we fight through those issues. But, ultimately, we come together on whatever the board shows is 218. If you can put the majority together, that is what rules the day. It is so important that, as we are having those political battles, we don't make them personal.  One of the things I saw--and I guess this is the thing that really kept coming back to me--is I tried to make sense of all of this. In comprehending the outpouring of love that I saw, it kept coming back to those world leaders. Why would leaders from around the world that I had never met before reach out and say: ``Steve, we hope you can get back to work. We hope you can come through this.''?  And what it says is, sure, they cared about my wellbeing, but more than that, they saw this as an attack on all of us. They saw this as an attack on the institution of the United States Congress and our government. And they really count on us to be successful.  Look, we all know the United States is the leader of the free world. It is something that we have, frankly, had the honor as a country to hold as a distinction for generations. And yet, when you look at that title, what it really means is, is that there are people all around the world that want freedom, maybe that have freedom, but they know the United States being strong is critical to the rest of the world having the opportunity for freedom.  That is why I am so excited to be back because, as we are fighting through the issues of the day, let's just keep in mind that we rise above the challenges of the day and understand that it is not just us and our constituents and the country, the United States, that is counting on our being successful. People all around the world who believe in freedom are counting on us as well, and we will deliver for them. That is why I am so honored to be back here in the House serving with you.

I want to thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Capito for their work in the Senate on this, as well as Senators Corker and  I want to thank the staff who has put in a lot of hours on this, last session and this session, including my staff, Cassandra  Around the world, women are disproportionately affected by conflict and violence. At the same time, women are acting as some of the most effective advocates for peace. Again and again, women have proven their ability to advance peacemaking efforts where others have failed.  Look at In the town of Zabadani, women have been leading efforts to save their city from violence. Over 470 women signed a public petition, calling for a cease-fire. Their town had been under siege, experiencing daily shelling and barrel bombings. As the formal negotiations between the rebel-controlled local council and the Assad government constantly broke down, the war prevented the town from planting crops.  A group of women peace activists came together to found a group called Damma, and they facilitated negotiations between the local council, the Free Syrian Army, and the Islamic brigades. Where the traditional actors had failed, these women moved through five rounds of negotiations, ultimately achieving a cease-fire. Now, the cease-fire only lasted 40 days, but those 40 days gave the town critical time to plant crops and address its food shortage.  The power of women to advance peace and aid in postconflict reconciliation is not limited to Women in Liberia played a crucial role in bringing warring parties to the negotiating table, as the chairman said.  When the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front signed a major peace agreement in 2004, women made up 50 percent of the government's negotiating team and 25 percent of the signatories.  In Ireland, women helped ensure that the Good Friday Agreement included social issues, reconciliation measures, and compensation for victims of violence.  Women around the world are actively working to advance peace talks and ensure successful transformation from conflict to peace. Passing the Women, Peace, and Security Act will ensure that the United States actively supports these incredible women as we work toward ending conflict around the world.  When women are involved in the negotiations, peace is more likely to last. In fact, the International Peace Institute found that, with each 5 percent increase in women's participation in the political process, a nation is five times less likely to use violence when faced with international crisis or conflict.  Despite the strong evidence in favor of women's political participation, women remain underrepresented in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and postconflict peace building efforts around the world. We need to change that.  This legislation establishes women's participation as a critical element of U.foreign policy. It would encourage the United States to assist women mediators and negotiators by addressing barriers to their equal and secure participation in peace processes.                              {time}  1600  It would institute comprehensive training modules on the protection, rights, and specific needs of women in conflict, and require the administration to evaluate the impact of U.foreign assistance on women's meaningful participation.

It is our obligation to do everything we can.  Mr.President, the Senate is about to make an important decision about who leads the Federal agency that oversees everything from the internet, to the TV, to radio.  This vote is a choice: We can either give our stamp of approval on the FCC's direction under the leadership of Chairman Pai, or we can decide that his leadership has put the FCC on the wrong track and that it is time for someone else to take charge.  Generally speaking, here is how I approach a nomination. There are three reasons one might reject a nominee. If the person is corrupt, it is a nonstarter. If the person is nonqualified, it is also a nonstarter. And even on policy grounds, in the policy space, just disagreeing with someone can often boil down to the fact that there is a President from another party and is not sufficient to vote no.  Chairman Pai is someone I know. He is skillful, he is a decent human being, he is very smart, and he is qualified. When we disagree, we can do it in a way that doesn't ruin our ability to work together on the following day on the following issue. And this is no small thing in today's political climate. So it is important that if we are ever going to get something done, we are able to disagree and find common ground afterward.  I do like Chairman Pai as a person. I think he is ethical and he is capable. But he is just so wrong on policy. For me, that means he is not the right leader for the I want to highlight four of the concerns I have.  First, the FCC really is trying to end the internet as we know it by getting rid of net neutrality. If they succeed, your internet service provider will have the power to stop you from seeing certain kinds of content. They will be the ones that make decisions about what you can access online and how fast and how much you have to pay for it.  Some people say that companies aren't going to change the internet because it is not in their interest to change the internet, even if the law goes away. But think about this: Most often, these ISPs are publicly traded companies, and they are going to make decisions based on their own financial interests. It is not just an objective; it is their obligation. If there is an opportunity to change their business model for internet service, they are duty bound to pursue it. They do not have any obligation to a free and open internet; they have an obligation to shareholders and to profits.  That is why net neutrality exists in the first place--because we should not leave it up to any company to decide whether they are going to charge people more to stream video, for example, or block certain content altogether. If we allow the FCC to end net neutrality, Americans across the country are going to find that the internet no longer works in the way that it should. And this has happened under Chairman Pai's leadership.  It is not just bad policy that he is pursuing; they have also had some serious process fouls. When Chairman Pai announced that the FCC was revisiting the rules, he made clear that the FCC was going to get rid of net neutrality regardless of what happened throughout the process. He said: ``This is a fight we intend to wage and it is a fight we intend to win.'' Why is that a significant thing to say? ``This is a fight we intend to wage and it is a fight we intend to win.'' This a quasi-judicial agency. They just opened up a public comment period. There were 22 million members of the public who submitted public comments after the Chairman of the Commission has already announced that he has decided which way they are going to go. I think that is antithetical to the governing statute, and it is antithetical to the basic premise that if you have an open comment period where an individual has an opportunity to express themselves, you have to listen to them. You don't say: I already decided, but you 22 million people--if you have an opinion, I will be happy to receive it and file it and do what I planned to do all along. That is the exact opposite of how this is supposed to work.  The agency proposes the rule, the public weighs in, and then the agency considers the comments from the public in making the decision. But Chairman Pai turned it upside down. The FCC has tried to diminish the fact that so many people tried to weigh in. About 96 percent of the roughly 22 million people who have weighed in have weighed in in favor of net neutrality. They are trying to lay the groundwork to get rid of net neutrality even though the vast majority of people are for it. By doing that, the FCC is effectively saying that lobbyists and law firms matter more than regular citizens.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. The FCC has claimed that cyber attacks kept people from being able to comment, but they have not been forthcoming about what exactly happened, and we are still working in our oversight role to figure that all out.  Secondly, I would like to address media ownership. Local TV broadcasters are an essential part of every community. People know their local TV station. They trust it. There is a range of perspectives offered. Because the broadcasters are based in the community, they have relationships with their viewers that make their content better and more relevant.  For decades, Congress and the FCC have taken steps to keep local broadcasting local because it benefits the public interest. These are the public airways. It is like fast food options across the country. You may not mind McDonald's once in a while, but you don't want that to be the only option in your hometown. You want something that captures the local culture in your community. That is what local broadcasting does. It makes TV in Honolulu different from TV in Hartford or  But now the American tradition of local broadcasting is in real danger because the FCC is going to change the rules so that these stations can be bought out by a single company without any limits. I have no doubt this would create a world of sort of nationalized content distributed through each of these local companies, with consumers having to watch whatever is distributed to them by their national headquarters. This is no longer local news, and this is not the broadcast media that Americans deserve.  The third area I want to talk about is broadband access. Right now, Americans have widely different levels of internet speed basically based on where they live. In some places, you have great broadband access, no trouble streaming video, accessing government services online, downloading, uploading, but in rural and Tribal communities, they are very, very far behind. As the FCC noted, 39 percent of rural America and 41 percent of those on Tribal land lack access to advanced broadband. Even if they have cell phones with internet access, a mobile network will typically offer slower speed than fixed broadband, so they can't go online and do the things we can in Washington, DC, or in many[[Page S6214]]other cities across the country. So everyone, on a bipartisan basis, understands that this needs to change.  High-speed broadband is the cornerstone to economic development, public safety, and quality of life in every community, no matter how many people live in your community. The FCC has historically worked so that every home, school, and business has had adequate access to the internet because that is what it will take to unlock the innovation and potential for all  The FCC has worked on this issue by setting the bar for what it will take to connect more Americans to the internet. There is already a threshold in place which says that this is what high-speed internet access is, so we know who has it and who doesn't. But instead of actually working to get more people broadband, the FCC is working to change the definition of broadband so that it looks as if they have gotten people more broadband. That way they can say that more Americans are covered, even if they have internet service that does not meet their needs. In other words, they are not actually solving the problem; they are literally just redefining what it means to have access. Rather than giving people access, they are papering over the problem that they are not solving. This is a real issue, and it is something that the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee members have worked on on a bipartisan basis.  The way to get more people broadband access is to get more people broadband access. It is not to change the rules and to change the metrics so that you can come back to the Congress and say: Look, we just achieved more access by allowing these companies to claim that people are covered who are not.  The fourth and final concern I want to raise is a little more sensitive because, as I said, I like Chairman Pai, and I respect Chairman Pai, but he made some comments during his confirmation hearing that worried me. I asked if he agreed with the President's comments calling the media the enemy of the state. He would not give a direct answer.  I understand that Mr.Pai is a That is not the problem. I understand Republicans will be appointed in a Republican administration. I am the former Democratic Party chairman of the State of Hawaii, so I understand party loyalty. I respect party loyalty.  We have a President and a White House that are pushing to blur the legal, moral, and ethical boundaries in our Nation's This is not the time to get cute when we ask a question about the rule of law. This is not the time to finesse an answer. The only acceptable answer is this: I will not let anyone interfere with my work, whether it is the President or anyone else, and the media is not the enemy of the state. Mr.Pai did not take that opportunity. This was one of a few opportunities Mr.Pai had to be unequivocal. The senior Senator from New Mexico, if I remember correctly, and other members of the panel, sort of gave him a second and third bite at the apple so that he could get it right. It was an easy one to get right.  I understand it is politically complicated, but sometimes you have to set aside the politics and just say what is right and do what is right. My instinct is that he will not use the FCC to do anything that crosses any ethical boundaries that I am worried about, but the fact that he will not say so leaves an opening that should not be there.  The President has tweeted about media companies that give him bad coverage. He consistently refers to the media as ``fake news'' media and ``garbage'' media and makes unsubstantiated claims about various networks and newspapers and threatens to come after them. So it is not out of the realm of possibility that this could go beyond some partisan talking point from the Democrats in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee and into a real crisis.  I just want to hear from Mr.He will be confirmed on Monday, but I want to hear from Mr.Pai that he does not believe the media is the enemy of the state and he will not allow any interference from the White  I would like to end by bringing this back to the American people. This vote is our chance to stand up for them. There will not be a vote on net neutrality on the floor in the next weeks or months, but they deserve to keep their faith in local broadcasting, they deserve a free and open internet, and they deserve to have adequate access to the internet no matter where they live. That is why I have to vote no on this nominee.  I admire Chairman I like him as a person, but he is the wrong leader for the I urge my colleagues to join me and vote no on his nomination.

112,topic-id,1977,"Good morning, Mr.First, I would like to talk about taxes.  Today, President Trump and Republican leaders will announce several proposals as part of their tax plan. According to recent reports, that plan will include proposals to repeal the estate tax, lower the rate on passthrough entities, lower the top rate, and actually raise the bottom tax rate. Each of these proposals would result in a massive windfall for the wealthiest Americans and provide almost no relief to middle-class taxpayers who need it most.  It seems that President Trump and Republicans have designed their plan to be cheered in the country clubs and the corporate boardrooms. How does repealing the estate tax help middle-class people?  Only 5,200 of the wealthiest families in America, couples whose estates are worth $11 million, pay the estate tax. Are there any middle-class families worth $11 million? Is that the President's definition of the middle class?  The estate tax is skewed to the very wealthiest among us, and they are going to repeal it. This is not going to fly with the American people, let me tell you.  Our Republican colleagues tried to do something the public disliked on healthcare--taking away benefits, reducing healthcare. Now they are trying to do the same thing on taxes, helping the very wealthiest. They are going to be in for a rude awakening because the American people are going to rise up against this. Over 70 percent of Americans are against tax breaks for wealthy Americans and wealthy corporations.  Lowering the rate on passthrough entities would create a huge loophole, allowing very wealthy Americans, such as hedge fund managers, to funnel their income through a business entity in order to avoid the top bracket and pay a much lower rate. So the upper middle-class family making $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 can pay 39 percent, but these wealthy hedge fund managers, lawyers, and whoever, through a passthrough, can pay no corporate tax and then a 25-percent rate on the rest of their taxes. Does that help middle-class Americans? Absolutely not. Does it help the wealthiest who have the lawyers to set up these passthrough entities?  By lowering the individual top rate, the top 1 percent, who make above $490,000 a year, would get a tax break because their rate would be lowered. God bless them. They make a lot of money. Do they need a tax break? I don't think so.  President Trump clearly believes, despite his rhetoric, that the wealthy in this country deserve another tax cut while middle-class families at best get crumbs. Amazingly, the Trump tax plan will even include a proposal to increase the bottom tax rate--a punch to the gut of working  The American people should be able to see the principle behind President Trump's tax plan in this one fact. He proposes to cut taxes on the highest income brackets and raise them on the lowest. He raises the bottom rate and cuts the top rate. This is ``wealthfare''--``wealthfare''--helping those of great wealth with more tax breaks.  The American people should be able to see the principle behind President Trump's tax plan with little more than an across-the-board tax cut for America's millionaires and billionaires. God bless them. I am glad we have a lot of rich people in I don't begrudge them. Many of them have worked very hard to get their money. Some of them get it through an estate; so be it. But the wealthiest among us don't need a tax break. They are doing great.  All of the statistics show that those at the highest end are making more money than ever before and the middle class is flat or sinking. Who needs the break? The Washington Post-ABC poll showed yesterday that more than 70 percent of Americans say our tax system already tends to favor wealth more than the middle class. This bill makes it much worse.  One more thing to watch today is whether the President and his Republicans provide any details about how they intend to pay for these massive cuts. Without these details, I suspect Republicans will turn the age-old trick of promising that economic growth will make up for the entire difference. Some of them call it dynamic scoring, but that name obscures what dynamic scoring really is.  President Trump calls the media outlets fake news. Dynamic scoring is fake math. It is just made-up, fake math to hide another deficit-busting tax cut to benefit the wealthiest  No less of an authority than James Baker, a conservative Republican and former Republican Treasury Secretary who led the last successful tax reform effort under President Reagan, said:       We must not let tax revenues decline and worsen the      deficit. In other words, tax reform must be revenue neutral      and should be judged on its own merits.  Let's call it the Baker rule--the Jim Baker rule: Tax reform must be revenue neutral, judged on its own merits, with no dynamic scoring and no fake math.  I am amazed that President Trump, whenever he talks, says he wants to help the middle class, and his plan at best throws crumbs at some middle-class people. Some will get a tax increase, especially those in high-tax States like New York, but his plan benefits the wealthy.  Has the President read this plan? Has he been involved in creating this plan or is it the people around him--many[[Page S6161]]of them from Wall Street--who came up with this plan, and the President doesn't even know what it does?  I will tell you, if he goes to Indiana today and says that his plan helps the middle class rather than the wealthy, he has it backward. It helps the wealthy far more than it helps the middle class.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, yesterday the majority announced it would not be holding a vote this week on the latest healthcare bill, Graham-Every American should breathe a deep sigh of relief.  The majority has vowed to revisit ACA repeal, maybe even with this legislation. But President Trump and our Republican colleagues should have learned from these failures that the American people do not want to cut healthcare. If they try to do it a third time, they will fail again for the simplest reason in politics: The public is against what they want to do.  This administration, which campaigned it is for the people and populist, on healthcare is doing what people don't want and on taxes is doing what people don't want. What is going on?  I remind my Republican colleagues that continuing to threaten repeal is like hanging a giant sword of Damocles above our Nation's healthcare system. It causes great uncertainty in the healthcare market, and it leads insurers to raise premiums on average  Now, I understand that for political purposes Republicans don't want to ever admit that ACA repeal is off the table. They promised it to the American people for 7 years but deluded them on what it really meant. The average American thought that, if you took ACA off the table, premiums would go down and coverage would go up. The bills the Republicans have proposed do just the opposite, but I understand why they do it. They promised it so often. But those promises have a real human consequence in the form of higher costs for everybody. The responsibility and the blame for the rate hikes, should they occur--and they probably will--will fall squarely on the Republican shoulders. President Trump and the Republicans are in charge. Saying, gee, something in the past caused it, when they failed to correct it, is not going to work.  My Republican friends, you are no longer in the minority. You are running the show. It is your responsibility to help bring premiums down. We want to do that and, in fact, there are good bipartisan sprouts. Senators Alexander and Murray are very close to a bipartisan agreement. Now, we hope out of pique or anger that our Republican colleagues will not reject a good bipartisan compromise that helps the American people, put together by the chair of the HELP Committee and the ranking member.  I hope and expect the negotiations to pick up right where they left off because we Democrats want to work with our Republican colleagues to stabilize the markets and lower premiums for millions of We hope our Republican colleagues will not just sit back, repeatedly threaten repeal, and watch as millions of Americans pay higher healthcare costs. That will be wrong substantively, and, politically, it will fall right on their shoulders.  So I hope we can have the negotiations pick up between Senators Murray and Alexander right where they left off. Each of them said they were close to an agreement before Chairman Alexander was pulled away by Republican leadership.  Insurers are about to set their rates for the next year, and whether we can come together or not could be the difference between a stable market and premiums that are hundreds of dollars more expensive. So for the sake of the American people, for the sake of turning over a new leaf on healthcare, let's work together in a bipartisan way to shore up and improve our Nation's healthcare.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Finally, Mr.President, on the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, Hurricanes Irma and Maria have left the islands--home to well over 3 million American citizens--hanging on for dear life. You have seen the pictures, and they are devastating. Water, food, diesel, power, cell service, medicine, shelter, security, the basic needs of human survival are limited and running out in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Diabetic patients who require insulin shots are unable to keep their lifesaving medicine refrigerated. Hospitals still lack power and running water. This was a catastrophe on an epic scale. It may have been one of the worst humanitarian crises within our borders.  Now, the President has a bully pulpit. More importantly, he is in direct control of the vast resources of our Federal Government--the military, the Department of Energy, FEMA, USDA, and much more. He can direct the attention of all Americans to important issues. Previous Presidents have used this platform to focus our attention on disasters that strike our country. Barack Obama did it, George Bush did it, Bill Clinton did it, George H.Bush did it, and Ronald Reagan did it. The President can direct resources--boots on the ground and a structure to coordinate it all. But a President needs to act aggressively, comprehensively, and urgently, and some of that has been lacking with this President unfortunately.  A cursory scroll of President Trump's Twitter feed and public comments from the past few weeks does not show him using the power of his office to focus our attention on the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin It has been a week since the storm hit and, as I said, his Twitter feed and public comments don't show him using the power of the office. When he mentions Puerto Rico, President Trump promotes his own administration's efforts and implies that Puerto Rico was partially at fault for the devastation they have been suffering. The response from the administration needs to get a whole lot better fast.  I spoke to the Governor of Puerto Rico yesterday, and he gave me specific items that would provide immediate help. I spoke about them yesterday, and I hope the administration acts on them quickly. But most importantly, we need the administration to send us an emergency and interim aid package to pass, just as we did in the wake of Hurricane Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands shouldn't have to wait a second longer for aid than any other American State or We should take up and pass this package here in the Senate before the week is over.

175,topic-id,1655,"First, let me thank my dear friend and colleague from Illinois for his remarks. As usual, he is one of the most articulate Members of either side. He is also one of the most thoughtful and compassionate, and I hope people will listen to what he has to say.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, I would also like to respond to what the majority leader said this morning on healthcare. My good friend Senator McConnell continues to try and create this straw man because he has nothing good to say about his bill. He wants to make this healthcare debate about a false choice between Graham-Cassidy on their side and single payer on our side, but as Senators Sanders and Klobuchar made clear in an excellent debate last night on CNN, Democrats have a lot of ideas to improve healthcare. There is not just one; there are many, and many Democrats support a bunch of different ideas. Each of our ideas, however, endeavors to increase coverage, improve the quality of care, and lower the cost of care. None of the Republican plans achieve these goals. That is the difference.  The difference is that one side wants to cut healthcare to average Americans, increase premiums, and give the insurance companies far more freedom, and one side wants to increase care to the number of people covered, lower premiums, and provide better coverage. That is the divide.  Our colleagues can't stand and debate that issue. They believe in letting the market have more say. We have learned that, left alone, the poor little consumer against a big market gets crushed in healthcare because there are infirmities. It doesn't work like an ordinary market for a whole lot of reasons. So we are happy to have a debate on the real issues.  Does Graham-Cassidy expand or reduce healthcare? They are rushing this through so we don't get a full CBO report. I am sure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle maybe breathed some relief there. CBO said that costs are likely to go way up for older Americans and Americans with preexisting conditions under Graham-They said that Graham-Cassidy would reduce coverage by gutting Medicaid and reducing subsidies that help Americans afford insurance. So there is, indeed, a contrast between the parties. It is a contrast we welcome.  Every Republican plan this year would cause millions to lose insurance and costs to go up, whereas Democrats are looking at many different ideas about how to achieve the exact opposite.  As my colleague said, we want to work in a bipartisan way to improve the existing system. Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have had great negotiations. Once this repeal effort is dead and gone--this repeal and replace--we are willing and eager to sit down and come up with bipartisan improvements and do it in the regular order, as some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have correctly and courageously recommended. Let's do it in regular order.  Senators Alexander and Murray have had hearings, called in witnesses, and have had a lot of bipartisan discussions--just what this body is supposed to do. Let's realize that Graham-Cassidy is highly unpopular with the American people, doesn't do what some are saying it does, and cuts healthcare. Democrats don't want to do that, and neither do the American people. Let's move on and try to make our system better.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, the main subject I am going to speak on today is that instead of trying to take healthcare away from millions of Americans, the Senate and the White House should focus on a much more pressing matter this week: the desperate situation in Puerto Rico and the Virgin  After suffering from the winds and rains of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the island of Puerto Rico is completely devastated. I can't recall in my lifetime a hurricane wreaking such devastation on any part of the United There are 3.5 million American citizens facing one of the gravest humanitarian crises in recent memory.  Listen to these facts. Nearly the entire island is without power. The reserves of gas and diesel fuel are dangerously low; there may be a 20-day supply left. I read in the newspaper this morning that 80 percent of the major power lines--the big trunk lines that deliver power--are down. Without power, just think of what that does.  The Governor of Puerto Rico said last night that 40 percent of the people on the island lack potable water; some estimates say it is as much as 65 percent. The food supply is dwindling, so people are without food. Fewer than 250 of the island's 1,600 cell phone towers are operational. People can't find their parents, children, or relatives. There is no way to reach them.  I remember the day of 9/11 when cell phone service went out in New York and I couldn't reach my daughters. This has been going on for days and days and days.  The damage to one of the largest dams on the island has created the need for another massive evacuation, but with 95 percent of the cell phones out of service in that part of the island, the evacuations have to be carried out by officials going door-to-door to the nearly 70,000 residents in harm's way, telling them that they have to leave their homes. Worse still, the damage to Puerto Rico's roads, bridges, and ports have isolated communities and delayed the arrival of aid.  It is not hyperbolic to say that the two storms together have set Puerto Rico back decades. The damage is apocalyptic. It is  The situation on the U.Virgin Islands is similar. Words and statistics can hardly begin to describe the devastation these Americans are beginning[[Page S6102]]to grapple with. It has hit home. One of my staffers couldn't find an uncle, and they found him dead on the Virgin Islands last night. So it hits home to all of us and to all Looking at the pictures and the news reports, the islands now resemble a war zone.  What we need to do now is provide aid to Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands as quickly as humanly possible--water, food, power, shelter. They need help and they need it now.  Here is what should happen. First, President Trump must issue a full disaster declaration for all of Puerto Right now, 24 of the 78 municipalities on the island are not eligible for FEMA grants to rebuild their homes.  President Trump should also waive the local cost-share requirement for emergency funds so that Puerto Rico can rebuild without having to worry about falling even deeper into debt.  While our Nation's Armed Forces--and we salute our Armed Forces all the time--are already assisting Puerto Rico, more needs to be done. As the most experienced part of our government in the movement of food, water, mobile power, and medical supplies, the Department of Defense should immediately determine what additional resources and capabilities can be deployed to aid Puerto If Secretary Mattis hasn't already met with the Director of FEMA, I hope he will do it today.  Most importantly, the administration should prepare an immediate and interim emergency aid request, and the majority leader should put that package on the floor of the Senate before we leave this week. Anything less would be an abject failure of our duty to come to the aid of our fellow U.citizens.  The administration submitted a request for Hurricane Harvey less than a week after the storm made landfall. We are rapidly closing in on that same marker for Maria having hit Puerto We need to move fast. We need to move now. Lives are at stake.  This morning I saw that President Trump had tweeted that Puerto Rico was in ``deep trouble,'' but relief efforts were ``doing well.''  With all due respect, President Trump, the relief efforts are not doing well. They are not close to good enough. All any American needs to do is open up a newspaper or turn on a TV to know that Puerto Rico is not doing well.  In his tweets, President Trump also brought up the issue of Puerto Rico's debt. Now, that is a totally different issue, and it pales in comparison to the immediate humanitarian crisis faced on the island.  Again, now is not the time, Mr.Puerto Rico needs help from aid workers, not debt collectors from Wall Yes, Puerto Rico needs debt relief, but first they need humanitarian relief--water, food, medicine, fuel.  But this fits a pattern of how our President unfortunately responds to natural disasters. He insists that relief and recovery efforts are ``doing well'' or ``doing great,'' and sometimes it has no relation to the facts on the ground, as if this is a public relations campaign and not a rescue, recovery, and rebuilding operation. The time for tweets and talk is over.  The American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands need action and results. The best thing the President can do is to get all of the relevant people in his administration together and come up with an aid package and deliver it to us in the next day or two so that we can pass it before we leave here this week.  Again, instead of trying to take away healthcare from millions of Americans--that is what we are debating now, and that effort seems to be in real trouble--the Trump administration and the Republican majority should put an emergency aid package on the floor before the week is out.  Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, said earlier today: ``We need to get our act together because people are dying.''  The situation is desperate. The need is urgent. It is time to act now.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

350,topic-id,1214,"Mr.President, on healthcare, last night we began to see reports of a new version of the Graham-Cassidy bill. Faced with stern resistance from several Members of their own caucus, it appears that the authors of the legislation have tweaked the bill in an attempt to gain the support of the holdouts. Despite sending more money to the States of those Members, this new bill, if anything, is worse in many ways than before and, in the long run, will still result in a net cut for every single State in the country.  It still contains a massive cut to Medicaid, it still defunds Planned Parenthood, and it actually further weakens consumer protections, and almost completely does away with protections for those with preexisting conditions--even worse than in the first version.  The S&P has just come out with a study that estimates that Graham-Cassidy would result in 580,000 lost jobs and $240 billion in lost economic activity by 2027. That is not a Democratic propaganda machine, that is Standard & Poor's; down the middle, 580,000 jobs lost and $240 billion in lost economic activity if Graham-Cassidy is enacted.  Under the latest version, States would be able to lift the regulation that caps out-of-pocket costs, meaning insurance companies could offer barebones policies with sky-high deductibles and copays.  Under the latest version, States could do away with lifetime limits, meaning insurance companies could cap the amount of coverage you receive for a given illness. Imagine the parent of a child suffering with cancer being told your policy only covers 4 months of treatment; you are on your own after that--devastating to too many families in this country.  Under the latest version, States could remove the benefit of getting preventive services at no cost, such as birth control, cancer screening, and immunizations. Under the latest version, States could opt out of the preexisting condition without even applying for a waiver. So even more so than in the old bill, preexisting conditions are not protected.  States just have to submit a plan that allows for adequate and affordable insurance. In other words, the new Graham-Cassidy makes it even easier and even more likely that States will allow insurance companies to discriminate against Americans with preexisting conditions. Again, that parent of a child aching with cancer is in real jeopardy. Maybe they can't even get insurance at all.  In short, the new Graham-Cassidy tells every American with potentially high medical costs, you are on your own. If you have diabetes, cancer, congenital illness, or asthma, Graham-Cassidy says that you are on your own. It eviscerates the protections that make healthcare affordable for those who need it most.  It is no wonder that it is so unpopular with Recently, even though the bill has just been introduced, a majority of Americans say they don't like it. The more they learn--just like with the old TrumpCare--the less they like it.  Americans want good healthcare, lower premiums, and more coverage. This bill does the opposite--higher premiums, fewer people covered, and it makes it harder to get good insurance.  Guess what. We are expected to vote on this bill in just 2 or 3 days. There will have been only a single hearing, which Republicans scheduled almost as an afterthought, just to say they had one. Certainly, there will not be any amendments to the bill. It is not going to go through the committee process. There will not be a shred of input from the minority, despite all the complaints that ObamaCare, which did have input from the minority, was passed by one party's vote.  The Senate's former Historian said he could not think of ``anything comparable'' to the process Republicans are employing in the entire history of the The Senate's former Historian, a scholar, said that there is nothing comparable to the process being employed now--one-sixth of the economy, no amendments, one hearing, no changes.  Add to that fact that the CBO will not have enough time to properly analyze this legislation. We will not know how it actually impacts our healthcare system. At most, we will get a barebones analysis sometime today that may not tell us a thing about how Graham-Cassidy would impact coverage--the cost of care, the quality of care, and the stability of marketplaces.  It is shockingly incomplete not to have our CBO tell the American people and tell us--the representatives of each State--how it affects their State and rush it through. Even after the minimal CBO report today, Republicans will still be voting on a healthcare bill with thick blindfolds on their eyes. They will not be able to see it. My guess is that I don't think they want to see it.  When the American people learn what is in this bill, they are going to dislike it intensely--intensely. The new TrumpCare is bad policy. It is being jammed through this body at an alarming, ludicrous pace. To say it is hastily constructed and considered barely scratches the surface.  New versions are coming out every few hours. The websites of the Senators from Louisiana and South Carolina keep saying: We are changing this; we are changing that.  It is We are voting this week. The Republicans are basically scrawling a healthcare law for 300 million people on the back of a bar napkin. The bill should go down. I believe my Republican colleagues who were skeptical about this policy and this process are too principled to be swayed by last-minute formula tweaks.  Governor Walker of Alaska, an Independent, has said he will not support a healthcare bill that is bad for the country, even if it might be good for his State, which the bill isn't. That is principled leadership. I believe the same kind of principled leadership exists in this body as well. I know it does.  I wish to say to all of my Republican colleagues directly: Vote down this bill. If it goes down, we Democrats are pledged to work in a bipartisan way to improve our healthcare system. We are pledged to work through committee, to support the efforts of Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, and to find a bipartisan consensus on a healthcare package.[[Page S5875]]  We welcome bipartisan change. We know there is always give and take when that happens, but usually the product is better. A bipartisan process led by Alexander and Murray to make the present system better will be a whole lot better for both the process in this body and for the health of the American people than this rushed-through, half-baked proposal.  We disagree in the Senate a lot. Very rare are the times when there is a clear right and wrong, but this bill and the process it has gone through are clearly wrong. The bill would hurt so many people in our great country. The process has damaged this institution and would do much greater damage if it were to pass.  We have a chance--a chance--to legislate the right way, through regular order, by resuming bipartisan work already started by the HELP Committee, which has had hearings and intends to--at least, as I understand it--go through a process with amendments. We Democrats are at the table. We ask our Republican friends to join us at the table once again.

421,topic-id,2412,"Mr.President, let me thank my friend from Oregon for his outstanding remarks. He has been a leader in keeping the internet open and free and making sure that this new highway system, in effect, is as free as our old highway system, or the existing highway system, to let the big guy and the little guy compete on equal terms. That is all we want, and Mr.Pai doesn't seem to get that.  There is a whole round of appointees from this administration who simply side with big corporations no matter what, and this is an example of just that.  So I thank my friend from Oregon for his remarks.  Mr.President, I have three topics this morning--briefly, healthcare, then, Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, and, finally, taxes.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, on healthcare there is a bit of good news. I just spoke with Senator Murray this morning. I saw Senator Alexander in the gym, as I do just about every morning. Both are two of about the best negotiators we have in this body. Both have come to agreements across the aisle on many other occasions. They both inform me that they are on the verge of a bipartisan healthcare agreement to stabilize markets and lower premiums.  Now, we have had some bipartisan sprouts on healthcare recently. It is time for those sprouts to flower, and I am hopeful they will. I told Patty Murray that she has my faith and confidence. She has the freedom to cut the best deal she can, and I hope the leadership will tell the same to Senator  It was widely reported, before the Graham-Cassidy bill was withdrawn, that there was pressure on Senator Alexander to pull back. Well, that is over. Let's all come together. Our healthcare system needs it, and our constituents need it. They don't want premiums to go up and coverage to go down, and it would be a great start for some bipartisanship in this place, which I hope we can continue on more issues.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, on Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, we know about the crisis. Just looking at the pictures breaks your heart. We hear the stories of people desperately needing their medicine and diabetics needing insulin, which can't be refrigerated because there is no electricity to keep the refrigeration going. There are people dying right now because they can't get the medical attention they need, and, of course, there is a need for food, water, power, and transportation. It is awful.  Yesterday, Leader Pelosi and I met with Lori It felt nice, amid this devastation, to see a woman have four stars on her shoulder. She is a four-star general in the Air Force, and she is head of the U.Northern She is the military person in charge.  We met with her to get an update on the Department of Defense's work in assisting the islands. It was evident from our conversation that, while the military is increasing the amount of resources it is sending to the island, there is a lack of command and control about how those resources are distributed. In other words, they probably have enough food, they probably have enough gasoline--that is what the Governor of Puerto Rico said today--but they can't get it to the places it needs to go. Part of it is because they need transportation--trucks and things--but a lot of it is because there is no one there to make sure. Puerto Rico's command and control has been decimated by this storm as well. People can't get to the places they are supposed to go. They don't have their phones, et cetera.  I spoke with Senator Rubio this morning in the gym as well. He had just recently visited Puerto He had seen the devastation firsthand, and he told me the same--that Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are struggling, and they need help fast. His visit to Puerto Rico confirmed this idea that we really need command and control.  Well, there is no better command and control organization than our military, and we need our military to start aiding Puerto Rico in the command and control sense, as well as in the shipping of supplies, food, and the other kinds of things they need.  Puerto Rico needs help fast. They need personnel to direct the supplies and resources on the ground. All the aid in the world will be ineffective if it doesn't go where it is needed to go. So I joined Senator Cantwell, the ranking member on the Energy Committee, which has jurisdiction in many ways here, and Senator Nelson, who cares a great deal about Puerto Rico and is from Florida, nearby, and 30 other Senators in sending a letter to the Trump administration that contains a list of needed resources and personnel to coordinate our relief efforts.  It appears there will not be a request for emergency supplemental appropriations this week. We hope it comes very soon.  Mr.President, we cannot forget the utter devastation facing the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico and the Virgin I have been on this Earth now for quite a few years, and I have never seen such devastation anywhere in the United States or its territories. So we need to act, and we need to act quickly. Command and control, which our military can help supply, should be at the top of the list.                               Tax Reform  Finally, Mr.President, on taxes, yesterday President Trump and Republican leaders laid out their tax plan, sharing the first sketchy set of details with the American people about what they want to change in our Tax Any serious analysis of their proposal will leave you with one conclusion: President Trump and the Republicans have crafted a massive tax break for the very wealthy in our country.  Welfare is supposed to take care of the poor. This plan takes care of the rich. Plain and simple, the Republican plan is ``wealthfare,'' the opposite of[[Page S6196]]welfare. It is designed to take care of the rich. It repeals the estate tax, which goes to so few people in such large amounts of money, slashes the corporate rate, creates enormous tax loopholes for wealthy hedge fund managers in the form of a rate cut on passthroughs, and it lowers the rate, amazingly enough, on the top bracket of the wealthiest Americans while raising the tax rate on those at the bottom of the income scale. Who would have thought?  Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, and the President himself have said: We want to help the middle class. Then the first thing they come out with--again, we don't know all the details--lowers the top rate on the wealthiest and raises the bottom rate on the working families, which is the opposite of what they are saying.  On the estate tax, the bottom line is that only people whose estates are above $10 million pay a nickel of estate tax--only those. It is a handful. We are compiling how many people in each State have paid the estate tax for the last 5 years. Everyone in their State will see how few people are affected. You know, if someone has a big farm and maybe it is $12 or $15 million and they don't want to sell it--pass it onto their kids--I am willing to make an exception for that. I think most people will, but that doesn't justify repealing the entire estate tax.  Moving on to corporate taxes, there is a difference between the big corporations and small corporations. The big corporations right now are making record profits. Let's say the thousand biggest are making record profits. They have more money than they have ever had. According to a study--I believe it is by Goldman Sachs, which is hardly a leftwing think tank--they are paying the lowest percentage of their profits as taxes in a very long while. Big corporate America is flush with money. They are not using it to create jobs. Why in God's Name anyone thinks, after giving them more money through a tax break, all of a sudden they are going to start creating jobs when they are not doing it now is beyond me.  It is different for small businesses. We Democrats understand that small businesses need a break. We will work with our colleagues to do it. But even this passthrough--the biggest benefit is going to be wealthy lawyers and hedge fund managers, who will then pay an individual tax rate of 25 percent while so many others who have much less wealth are paying more in taxes.  So the President gets up and says this is a tax break for the middle class. I believe he said this morning that he will not benefit from it. Please, let's have some honesty here. If you really believe giving tax breaks to the wealthiest people and the biggest corporations is going to create jobs, then have the courage to say it. Don't fudge it.  President Trump said that his plan would create a middle-class miracle. I think it would be a miracle if it helped the middle class, given the numbers I have seen. While the tax plan doubles the standard deduction--that is one of the points where they say they help the middle class--it eliminates the personal exemption. The standard deduction is $12,500; personal exemption is $6,000. Figure it out, my friends. If you are a family of three or more, you lose, not gain. Three times $6,000 is $18,000; that is opposed to a $12,500 standard exemption. It doesn't make sense.  Oh, and how about this one: The personal exemption is not the only one gone. State and local deductibility--I predict that is going to be a downfall of this plan. I know the ideologues say: Let's go after the States that charge taxes. Let me tell you, there are 40 or 50 Republican Congressmen from well-to-do suburban districts in high-tax States--New York, California, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland--whose constituents will be clobbered by removing State and local deductibility. They will be clobbered. The $12,500 they gain in the standard deduction, minus what they lose in the individual deduction, is far less than they pay in State and local taxes in those districts.  We are going to be watching them like a hawk. I will tell my New York Republican friends from those well-to-do suburban and upstate districts: You are going to be hurting your constituents if you vote for a plan that gets rid of State and local deductibility. The eyes of America will be on you, and certainly the eyes of each  How about this one: They eliminate the deduction for extraordinary medical expenses. If you have a child with cancer, it is hard to pay for it, and your insurance covers some, but you are not going to get a tax break for shelling out money for that extra medicine or that extra MRI scan--no.  So the Republican game plan gives a few crumbs to the middle class--and many in the middle class will pay more in taxes, a few hundred off taxes maybe--and at the same time gives a huge break to corporations and the superwealthy. The American people will not buy it. This is not 2000 or 1982, my Republican friends. We have huge problems where the wealthy are doing great, and the middle class and the poor are doing badly.  The American people will not buy tax breaks for the rich. They will not buy it. Seventy percent of Americans already think our system favors the wealthy, and the Republican tax plan drops an anvil on the scales of our tax system, tipping them even further in favor of the wealthy. The American people will not be for that.  What about the deficit? We hear about deficits every time there is a new program. This dwarfs any spending program in terms of the deficit that we have enacted over the last several years--$5 to $7 trillion of deficit. What has happened to all the Republicans who talk about wanting to be deficit neutral when it comes to spending? Is that out the window? We will see.  Let me tell you something that really got under my skin--sorry to my colleague from North I am just agitated about this in a good way.  This morning, the chief economic adviser to President Trump, Gary Cohn, said the administration believes it ``can pay for the entire tax cut through growth'' by using a dynamic scoring model. Gary Cohn comes from Goldman If he used that funny kind of math at Goldman Sachs the way he is using it here in Washington, he would have been kicked out of that firm a long time ago. Gary Cohn should know better; Gary Cohn does know better.  Let me repeat what I said yesterday: Dynamic scoring is fake math. Paying for tax cuts with growth is fake math. We know it is fake math; we have real-world examples. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts were promising they would pay for themselves through economic growth. It is the same thing you hear from the Club for Growth and some of my colleagues.  Some dynamic scoring models at the time predicted the 2001 and 2003 tax breaks would grow the economy so much it would nearly wipe out the national debt, but what happened? I heard the Club for Growth leader get on TV and say: Well, there may be a deficit in the short run, but after 10 years it will all be taken care of. Ten years after the Bush tax cut, CBO estimated the Bush tax cuts added $1.6 trillion to the deficit.  How about the example of the great State of Kansas? Governor Brownback slashed the top rate. He exempted passthrough businesses. It was a real-life experiment in a Republican State, similar to what President Trump announced. Brownback's backers used dynamic scoring models to estimate that his tax cuts would generate $323 million in new revenue by 2018. Guess what happened. It added so much money to their deficit over 4 years that they have had to figure out ways to raise taxes now, just as Ronald Reagan did in 1986. So this idea that the administration can pay for a $5 to $7 trillion tax cut through growth is simply selling a bill of goods using fake, fake math.

778,topic-id,1447,"Mr.President, first, let me so commend my friend and colleague from Connecticut for his intelligent, articulate, and, most of all, passionate words. I hope that everyone on the other side of the aisle hears this.  This is not a game. I know that it is not the Presiding Officer's State, but the States that are taking the money are the ones that did not want to give good coverage--enough coverage--to people. The States like Connecticut and like New York that wanted to help people and had to put in half the money themselves are now being penalized by the States that did not. Most Americans are against that. The vast majority of Americans are against it. When Americans hear what this bill is about, almost none of them like it. None of them like it. That is why we are hiding this bill. That is why we are not debating this bill. That is why we are trying to rush it through without a score.  Yet, just over an hour ago, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a preliminary analysis of the latest version of TrumpCare, the Graham-Cassidy bill. The CBO is nonpartisan. The head of it was appointed by the Republican leadership. This is not one of those liberal think tanks that the other side dismisses as we dismiss the conservative ones. This is down the middle.  While the CBO has not filled in all of the details, the outline is devastating enough: The new TrumpCare bill would gut Medicaid, cause millions to lose coverage, create chaos in the marketplace, and not protect Americans who have preexisting conditions.  Members should not need any more details to know how bad a piece of legislation this is--though, certainly, we need to await more details. The other side does not want to. Even in plain language, without the numbers, the CBO makes clear that Graham-Cassidy would be the largest step backward for American healthcare in our Nation's history.  Let's go over a few things that the CBO report listed. These are down-the-middle, green-eyeshade findings that are not political.  First, Graham-Cassidy would gut Medicaid: ``All told, Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by about $1 trillion . . . and the program would cover millions fewer enrollees.''  That means they do not know how many millions. My guess is it will be about the same as the previous bills or even worse. That means there will be a drastic cut to healthcare funding that goes to help older Americans in nursing homes, those in opioid abuse treatment programs, and low-income Americans who rely on Medicaid as their source of coverage. All of those would be slashed.  If you are a middle-class family on Long Island, in Anchorage, or if you have someone in a nursing home--a parent--you will be faced with an awful choice with too many likelihoods. Pay thousands of dollars a month out of your own pocket or ask Mom or Dad to come live with you when you don't have a spare room in your house, and you are trying to raise your kids. It is not very pretty.  The CBO writes that Graham-Cassidy would cause millions to lose healthcare coverage, with the most abrupt loss of coverage occurring as soon as 2020 due to ``substantially lower'' enrollment in Medicaid, nongroup coverage, and insurance of all types because there would be no incentive to sign up.  The CBO also wrote that Graham-Cassidy would destabilize the individual market, creating a death spiral.       [Under Graham-Cassidy], average health care costs among      people retaining coverage would be higher, and insurers would      have to raise premiums in the nongroup market to cover those      higher costs. Anticipating such an unsustainable spiral, some      insurers would not participate in the nongroup market. . . .      In many States, the transitions starting in 2020 would be      difficult, and some areas would probably have no insurers      offering policies in the nongroup market.  That is a quote from the It is not by Chuck Schumer, not by Chris Murphy but from the CBO--destabilizing markets and huge numbers of people not getting insurance.  Here is another thing that the CBO wrote. Graham-Cassidy also fails spectacularly to protect Americans with preexisting conditions because it allows States to opt out of very popular consumer protections in our current law. According to the CBO: ``Coverage for people with preexisting conditions would be much more expensive in some of those States than under current law.''  I have heard my colleague from Louisiana say that this will not change the law with regard to preexisting conditions. Then why did they have to add this clause and give States the option? If they want to keep preexisting conditions, they should keep existing law.  The CBO even predicted that the ``flexibility'' of Graham-Cassidy would likely drive some States to pursue an age tax, charging older Americans five times as much or more for their healthcare than younger  If you are 50 to 64 and you have worked hard your whole life, your healthcare costs go up. There is a little bit of protection in present law. Much of that protection is removed by the Graham-Cassidy bill. If you are a senior citizen or close to it, you are going to pay more in too many places. That is why the AARP--again, not a very political organization--has come out so strongly against this bill, as, by the way, has the AMA and the American Cancer Chris Murphy listed many of the groups.  All in all, even without specific numbers for estimates, the CBO report confirms much of what we already knew about Graham-It is a wholesale dismantling of our healthcare system, which would create chaos in many places, cause millions to lose coverage, drive up costs, and put healthcare out of reach for the folks who need it the most.  To boot, today, Standard & Poor's--another hardly partisan organization--estimated that Graham-Cassidy would carry a staggering economic cost.[[Page S6095]]Standard & Poor's estimates that Graham-Cassidy would result in 580,000 lost jobs and $240 billion in lost economic activity by 2027.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are starting tax reform. They want to cut taxes on the wealthiest people, such as big corporations, because it will create jobs. Maybe yes but maybe no--many of us think no. But right here, if we are interested in creating jobs, don't pass Graham-Cassidy because we will lose 580,000 jobs, according to Standard & Poor's.  A number of Republican Senators have expressed their opposition to this bill--most recently, Senator To Senator Collins and to the rest of my Republican colleagues, I want to say that once repeal is off the table, we want to work with you to improve the existing system. Once this bill goes down, we are ready to work with you to find a compromise that stabilizes markets and that lowers premiums.  We are ready. We have proven some of that already. Senator Alexander and Senator Murray--one a Republican and one a Democrat, the chair and the ranking member of the HELP Committee--were making great progress toward a bipartisan agreement. They held hearings, heard expert testimony, and solicited input from colleagues on both sides of the aisle--something not done with this Graham-Cassidy bill. They were crafting a fair package, where each side got a little and each side gave a little. Once this bill goes down, those negotiations should pick up right where they left off. That is what we on this side of the aisle believe, for sure, and I think many on the other side as well.  There is no time to waste. Insurers are about to set rates for the next year. Whether we can come together or not could be the difference between a stable market and premiums that are several hundreds of dollars more expensive.  We should pick up where Senators Wyden and Hatch--again, one Democrat and one Republican--left off, to come to an agreement to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program, for community health centers, and for several other programs that need to be extended this week.  CBO, even with the bare structure of what this bill is all about, issued a devastating report. It is very, very hard to look that report in the eye and say: This bill improves healthcare for Americans--very hard. I hope for the good of our healthcare system, for the good of our country, and for the good of this institution that my Republican friends abandon Graham-Cassidy and its one-sidedness and choose instead to come back to the table with Democrats to do the hard work of forging a bipartisan consensus on healthcare. That is what America wants. That is what America needs.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-09-25-pt1-PgS6088.txt,1036,VOTE EXPLANATION,2017.0,25.0,September

1067,topic-id,5538,"Mr.Speaker, my hope is that you find this as entertaining as I did putting some of this together. Actually, let's put these boards up. We are going to actually do something that, with the rollout of the tax reform mechanics--and I apologize to everyone. Some of this is going to be a little geeky. But I wanted to try to put some things in perspective because I have heard some and read some crazy stuff the last couple of days.  So we are going to actually do some dynamic scoring 101. And, actually, at that moment, I think I just heard thousands, if not tens of thousands, of C-SPAN watchers just turn their televisions off. But this is actually important, because every time we are heading towards working on major tax reform or other types of programs that actually have big, bold policy built within them, we get into this sort of debate.  What are the effects? What are the effects on society? What are the effects on tax revenue? What are the effects on labor participation? What are the effects on our entitlement programs? And there is sort of this intellectual duplicity around this body. I know that is a little harsh, but we have got to be honest about it. If it were the stimulus package from President Obama several years ago, we had lots of Members on this side who actually talked about, supported, and thought the dynamic scoring models were great.  But when we actually talk about something within the Tax Code, rewriting the Tax Code, well, then dynamic scoring is just unacceptable. So I am going to ask everyone to open up your minds and first understand, when we talk about scoring, what we really mean. And we are going to touch on a handful of things, and this is going to be very elementary, sort of basics. So we are going to walk through a number of these.  And then I have a number of slides that we will get to in a moment that are more about examples of what math means when looking at it. And the fact of the matter is, there are such things as tax cuts that do not pay for themselves, but there are also such things, actually, as tax policy that do pay for themselves.  You have to just choose and be willing to work through the math, and the history of math, and stop being afraid of data around this place.  I get behind this microphone quite often and run this joke that this is sort of a math-free zone. And I am working[[Page H7625]]really hard to drag my brothers and sisters on both sides to understand that sometimes the folklore we believe in is correct, but a lot of times it just isn't.  First off, before we do some of the slides, I want to walk through some of the terms. How often do you hear us talk about the baseline? Okay, we talk about it all the time. The baseline is this--you do realize, the baseline actually does have a series of dynamic aspects when we build it. Why do you think, when we come out here every March, or like we did this last March and then again in June, all of a sudden the numbers have changed? That is a case where the world did not stay static. We didn't create a number a year ago, and that is what the world stayed.  Remember, we went through this really ugly, uncomfortable thing this year, where, in just a few months, the deficit actually grew dramatically to the point where we are almost borrowing $700 billion this year. And if we went back a year and a half, we thought this year we might be as low as $500 billion, $550 billion. So if we had stayed static, we would still be just pretending that we were at that number.  We recalculate constantly. But it is not just calculating, hey, here are the tax revenues. It is also, hey, we see this trend in number of people taking jobs; hey, we see this trend in number of people signing up for entitlement benefits. So understand, we already, for years, and years, and years, have lived in a dynamic scoring sort of model right now, and we call it our baseline.  I also want us to try a couple other things. I want us to think about dynamic scoring as not that number that is given to us but as a way of ranking decisions. So if I came to you right now and said, ``Hey, we have these things in the tax policy, and here are the effects we believe we see as we have the information today,'' think of it as a tool for making decisions, not that that number is the same number that it is going to actually produce 10 years from now.                              {time}  1315  With the best data and information we have today, if you as a policymaker--if you are blessed to be one of us who gets to be in this body saying, well, it turns out if I spend the money on this type of tax change compared to the same money on this type of tax change, I get this different effect in the size of our economy, in the number of our brothers and sisters who have jobs and employment opportunities, but also in what it effects in tax revenues.  So I know that is culturally hard for a lot of us because we all like to beat up CBO and the Joint Committee on But in all fairness, a dynamic scoring model is a ranking model.  What is the real difference? If I asked you just to say in a single sentence we all had to agree upon a common definition of here is static, here is dynamic, the real difference is a dynamic score has calculations that reflect changes to the size of our economy, which is really important.  Now I am going to digress to one side. About once a month I get behind this microphone, and we do a series of slide presentations on how much trouble we are in. The fact of the matter is that in not that distant of a future, we will barely have the revenues to cover our entitlement costs. We are living in a society right now where about three-quarters of our spending is what we call mandatory spending--both earned and unearned entitlements--your Medicare is an earned entitlement. Your Social Security is an earned entitlement. But we also have other types that you get because you fell below a certain income or you may be part of a certain group.  But the vast majority of what we do in this body is not managing the three-quarters of our budget that is on autopilot. These are by formula. If you look at that sort of remaining 25, 27 percent of our budget, well, about a little more than half of that is defense, and everything else is what people think of as government--that is the FBI, that is the National Park Service, that is the FDA, and that is education and research. That will continue to shrink, and it is going to start shrinking fairly dramatically because baby boomers are retiring.  Remember, the peak of the baby boomer is only 60 years old right now. We have our brothers and sisters whom we have made promises to, and this body never sat down and did the hard math to be prepared for what happens when 76 million of our brothers and sisters move into their retirement benefit years.  So one of the critical reasons you do tax reform is economic growth, because without economic growth, it gets really ugly in about a decade.  I continue to be sort of shocked that my brothers and sisters, particularly on the left, who claim to be sort of evangelical advocates for a lot of this entitlement spending, aren't standing alongside of us and saying: We need to do a major rewrite of our Tax  That does just a couple of things. It makes it fairer, and it makes it more simple, but it dramatically--over the next 10, 15, 20, 30 years--expands the size of this economy, because without that expansion, the math is just ugly.  A great example of this is when we talk about dynamic scoring. If you do actual dynamic scoring on what is about to happen over the next, functionally, 20 years of where we are demographically, the models don't work. The actual computer comes back to you and says: Doesn't work, doesn't work, doesn't work, because the math is impossible.  Functionally, the amount of debt to the size of our economy gets so big that the models basically say that society has collapsed. You can't float another bond, and you can't borrow money from anyone else. It comes to an end. When the computer tells you that, when the computer starts giving you a red flashing--maybe if you don't believe those of us who get behind the microphone, maybe they will believe the data.  Let's go ahead and start to walk through some of the slides. We are going to walk through a series of these ideas. I am probably going to say parts of this two or three times to have it sink in.  We have already had a number of our folks quoted in the press and others showing their cynicism towards dynamic scoring. But those are some of the very same people who actually stood in this same well and promoted the immigration reform and the dynamic scoring that was built into the immigration reform. They are the same folks who actually promoted the dynamic scoring that was built in the stimulus bill several years ago. But they are also the same folks who actually believe things like global warming mechanisms, which are built on a dynamic scoring model, are the absolute facts of math.  You can't have the intellectual duplicity of saying: I believe in this sort of modeling math for things I am ideologically comfortable with, but things I am ideologically not comfortable with is not true.  It is math. Let's try one more time because if we are going to come to policy decisions, we have got to stop living in sort of a math-free zone.  I am doing this as more of an example. None of this is actually policy in the tax reform that those of us on the Ways and Means Committee are so incredibly blessed to be working on. It has been the most interesting year of my life grinding out this math. I can't tell you the number of times that I thought I had a brilliant idea, you work it out, and you find out that the really smart people around you had all figured out all sorts of ways to get around your Tax Code changes.  So sometimes you have got to be humble and just understand that what we are doing is tough. It is complicated. If you make one change over here in the Tax Code, then it turns out it affects over here and creates leakage over here. So that is why you have to do this unified theory.  Just so we see this conceptually, if I came to you right now and said, Hey, we have this much money--I think in this model it was $70 billion or $60 billion. The actual dollar amount isn't that important.  If I came to you right now and said, ``You have this much money, you have got to make a Tax Code change with that money,'' if we did a static score, then the model says it costs you that much money. If you spent $60 billion on this over the 10 years, then it costs $60 billion. Then when we do the dynamic scoring, it turns out that not all tax changes produce the same amount of economic growth, even though it may[[Page H7626]]promote fairness, it may promote simplicity, and there may be some things we haven't calculated.  So on this one, if we take a look over here, this was actually something we took from the Tax Foundation's website. I encourage you to go there. It is a nonpartisan group, and it has some really interesting modeling.  If we functionally doubled the child care tax credit to a couple thousand dollars, it turns out the model over 10 years functionally adds almost nothing to GDP growth. Now you will want to try to model it saying: Does it change birthrates? As you know, we are in a societal crisis right now where our birthrates are falling so low that mathematically, in about 20 years, we are going to have some real difficulties having enough taxpayers moving into society's workforce to actually pay for our pay-as-you-go entitlements.  Social Security and Medicare are pay-as-you-go entitlements. Today's workers are paying for today's retirees. If that population mix of workers moving in gets too out of whack, then the math gets really uncomfortable.  For the same costs, if I came down and in this particular model reduced marginal tax rates, or we have another one where you are going to see we are expensing, which is a type of sort of depreciation that you can take all at once, then all of a sudden this one gets me almost no GDP growth. But the same dollars at that get me well over a point of additional GDP growth.  If I am standing in an event back in Arizona and say, ``We are going to spend $60 billion, and we are going to double the child care tax credit,'' that helps me get re-elected. But if I come and say, ``We are going to spend $60 billion changing the marginal tax rates for corporations, or the exact same money for expensing so businesses, particularly smaller businesses, buy new plants and equipment so we get more efficient so we have more growth so more people have jobs,'' then intellectually we know this is really important for everyone in our society. But this one down here is easier to talk about and easier to get reelected.  That is the tough thing here when we live in a world of these pithy, little sound bites, where we say these quick, little simple things then march off and the intellectual discourse of, hey, it is harder than that, we need to find a way to be simpler and fairer, but we also have to be rational on what creates the next generation of economic growth so our brothers and sisters actually have jobs, they have chances to save, chances to have money to put their kids through college, and even their own retirements.  We are going to walk through a few more of these examples, and then I have some actual data examples of where this is actually happening in our lives.  Now, this slide is a little bit on the geeky side, so forgive me, but this is dynamic scoring 101. All this slide I really want you to look at is, when modeling, it is not only where the money goes, but did it increase the capital stock, and, therefore, there is more capital in these businesses and in these organizations to expand and buy equipment and provide employment, or did it not?  But there is also: Did the tax change that creates that new capital stock stay in our Tax Code long enough that the next generation of new, more efficient equipment, new productivity moves in?  We actually have some really interesting examples that have been produced datawise on what happens if a Tax Code change phases out. We see this a lot where we have done these, hey, this marginal tax rate for business is for 5 years, and then it goes back to the old higher rate. Or what we are struggling through right now is how to get as much economic growth as possible if we create a type of expensing or accelerated type of depreciation, and what happens in the future of that? Does it phase out? And if it does phase out, what are the economic effects?  If you take a look at the green line, you can see what it actually meant both for GDP growth and also for attached within those numbers are revenues. Do you see the red line? So we both have a sympathetic curve here, and then the value of that actually fades away and actually falls, in some occasions, below what would have been a static score because you get the spike of people saying: We have to invest, we have to do this right now, and now we have to back off because of next year.  A good example is if I came to you right now and said: Today you have this tax rate, but 2 years from now we double it, what are you going to do with your life? We are going to work like crazy this year, and that 2 years from now, you are planning on taking a vacation year. It is human nature, and I think we have to stop pretending that the Tax Code somehow operates just outside human nature.  We will grind through some of these a little faster. At the end, we are going to talk about where you can see all these different charts.  Why this is important is when you actually look at the effects of the deficit--and where this was interesting is this was just revenues taken out of society in the ACA, sort of the economic effects of what would happen when we actually did the microeconomic movement calculations, and you actually see if we did repeal those additional dollars--because, remember, this is costing, there is an additional special tax on capital gains and what it is actually doing in economic growth.  We have a lot of slides, so I am going to try to go through some that are a little more entertaining.  What we are trying to show here is what happens when you take, actually, the exact same functional cost with dynamic effects and static effects. This one is from the Tax  The real difference is, remember that first slide we walked through where we talked about if we doubled the child care tax credit? Hey, here is our cost, and here is what it actually does. If we dynamically score it or if we actually static score it, oddly enough, it comes out almost identical because there is none of that macroeconomic change.  But if you actually dynamically score it, you will see they actually have tremendously that same spending if it were in corporate tax cuts. It has very different economic scores.                              {time}  1330  We have another slide. We will show on the one down at the end that, at the end of 10 years, we actually make revenue. The revenue line goes beyond its costs. In the 10 years, the first option does not expand. At the end of 10 years, it is actually scored as a loss. That static score is actually accurate.  There are a number of these sort of examples out there.  I am going to actually go back. This is not being mean. Remember, we are operating under a principle that the dynamic scoring is as much about the money as, hey, we think we are going to have this much tax revenue or this much tax loss at the end of 10 years or the end of the year, but it is also helping us rank.  These are important. From 2003 to 2008, we had a tax change, often referred to as the Bush tax cuts, that was going to be $317 billion over 10 years. If you looked at the models that were generated back there, it was supposed to actually cost society, cost the government money. But when we actually got to the end of that time, the end of the phaseout, it actually produced $77 billion more than that tax cut actually cost.  That is just in our recent memory, but I have a number of charts here that actually show over and over and over that, if the tax cut is actually put in the right place, we get economic growth and, therefore, additional revenue from it.  There are certain things out there that do not pay for themselves. That is why we have this whole discussion of how you find balance if you are working for fairness, if you are working for simplicity, but knowing we must have that economic growth if we are going to keep our promises here. This is just one more example.  When you actually see something like this, this first one is as if we were actually to change depreciation tables, that function. It ends up taking about $308 billion out of GDP if we dynamically score it.  Each one of these tax policies costs $32 billion. That is actually the idea. This costs $32 billion to the taxpayers.  So, if I came right now and said we need to raise $32 billion and we intend to do it in a change in the Tax Code, and then we go out there and say, all right, let's change depreciation tables to business and we take in $32 billion of[[Page H7627]]additional money, what did we just do to the economy?  In a static score, it says, hey, you just got $32 billion. If you do a dynamic revenue estimate, which actually does have some macro effects in there, we actually just lost $38 billion, because business slowed down.  But if you do the dynamic scoring of what it does over 10 years to the economy, that $32 billion of hopeful tax revenue actually shrunk the U.economy by over $300 billion. When they build this model, they are using data going back to the 1950s.  But we have an example on the other side. If you go to the far side, what if you were to disallow half of State and local taxes as a deduction? It turns out you would say that we are getting $32 billion because that is what it is written at. You end up bringing in about $29 billion, but you only shrink the economy by $19 billion.  Policywise, staticwise, they both say $32 billion in new taxes, but they both have dramatically different effects on the economy. When we actually talk about the dynamic scoring, it is both actually on the tax-raising side as much as the tax-cutting side.  The same sort of concept here, but what if we did it going the other direction? Actually, the same slide we just did, what does that mean in the percentage of GDP, if anyone is sort of thinking in that fashion.  The first one, where we actually changed the depreciation tables, we took away of the ability of businesses--particularly, smaller business--to depreciate. It ends up shrinking the U.economy almost two points over those 10 years. State and local taxes are actually less than, I think, 0.16 of a percent of GDP over those 10 years.  So when you actually hear the phrase ``tax cuts don't pay for themselves,'' or, ``you don't get the revenues expected,'' that is actually true, except for properly designed and properly targeted.  This is actually the flip side of what we just did. Remember, we just did two boards that showed both the revenues and the actual percent of GDP we raise taxes. How about now if we do sort of the exact same thing but we do it as a tax cut?  Once again, you are going to actually see--and I am sorry, I put additional notes to make it understandable--that not all tax cuts are the same. In this case, I am going from one end to the other side.  So let's say we go to the full end and we did full expensing. So instead of a depreciation table where, over the 7 years, it is this piece of equipment, or 10 years, whatever it may be, what if you could take the value of that almost immediately? In a dynamic model, it is adding a couple hundred billion dollars to the size of the economy.  But if those same dollars, the same amount was spent on, let's say, over here, we cut the bottom tax rate, that might be the appropriate thing to do for societal fairness. But we have to be cognizant, when we are calculating, what that means in GDP growth. You can see the blue here in the end, and the blue here is positive, but barely. That is over 10 years.  This makes it hard because, so often, the very tax policies that are good for us in our reelections may not actually be best for what is good for society and its opportunity for jobs and economic growth.  This is now sort of the exact same slide, but in the percentages and sort of understanding, when we doubled the child care tax credit or we lowered the individual brackets, maybe doubling the child care tax credit actually has an effect on birthrates. That would be terrific for society, and particularly for the future of our ability to pay into our entitlements, but if you are looking for GDP expansion and economic growth, it is marginal.  The expensing or the corporate tax cuts, when you see those on there, you actually see we have substantially more of what they call capital stock. That is the money that is used to buy new equipment to get more productive, to hire more people, to raise their salaries, and for all of us to have more opportunity.  I think we are going to make this our last one. This is the easiest one to sort of get our heads around, and it is the crispest of all.  Say you are a fellow Member of Congress and I come to you and say we have $70 billion, over 10 years, that we can plug into on the Tax Code, we have that much capacity. Where do we put it that is best for our society?  The initial instinct is to have that discussion of, well, what if we were to cut the bottom Federal tax rate? It is wonderful for our hardworking brothers and sisters who are at the lowest tier of income. It would be wonderfully fair. How about if we put that into expanding the child care tax credit, expanding that? How about if you put that money into expensing?  If you get in front of an audience and we did an audience vote, what do you think we would get?  The fact of the matter is, when you look at the models, what we have learned from the dynamic scoring, some may get almost no economic expansion. We may get economic fairness, which is a laudable goal. But, ultimately, over the next decade, I need my brothers and sisters in this country to have more job opportunities, more ability to be employed, putting that money into expensing so we get more productive as a society in buying new plants and equipment and machinery to make us more productive so we can pay people more, so we have the ability to save for education, for their retirements. That actually has over 5 percent additional expansion of the size of our economy.  These are the types of issues that those of us on the Ways and Means Committee have been struggling with over the last year and are going to struggle over the next month as we try to find that balance of what is simplicity, what is fairness, but also what maximizes economic growth.  Just as a couple of little last pieces here to sort of understand this.  I am begging for those of us who are going to be in this sort of battle, debate, that we do our best to sort of be intellectually honest about what we are talking about.  A good example is the number of dollars we are talking about right now in rewriting the Tax Code is, I think, 1 percent or so of GDP, maybe less than that. The stimulus from several years ago was 7 percent of  We have had some folks who are criticizing this over here and saying you intend to dynamically score that, but were almost giddy about spending and scoring actual spending over here that we learned later did not allocate well.  There is a concept, if I had a dollar, where would it be spent best to grow society, if I gave it to you as an individual, as a businessperson or an entrepreneur, saying: Where would you put that? Would you try and take that dollar and do something with it that grows the economy?  Or we have the other side over here. When government spends it, we have this bad habit of spending money on things that are often politically driven and that don't necessarily have the same type of economic expansionary effects. It is this thing called price theory, where money gets allocated into society. Who is better at allocating that dollar?  I will make you an argument that individuals in the market actually have a long history of doing it much healthier, much better.  As we finish what we will call Dynamic Scoring 101, what did we learn?  The scores are incredibly important in making decisions about how you allocate resources, both on raising taxes, lowering taxes. Where does it have the most impact? Where does it do the most damage? Where does it do the most good?  Dynamic scoring is actually a ranking mechanism, because the ultimate number, we are never going to have enough information to be perfect, but all we can do is take the information we have today and try to find a way to say, with today's information, this use of these resources creates this much more opportunity in our society than spending the same dollars over here.  So when we are going to get into this debate about what the dynamic scoring is providing those of us who are making the policy, understand, it is sometimes more of choosing A over C, because A produces more expansion in our society, more opportunity, even though they cost the same, than sometimes looking at the dollar amounts.  Often, as we saw on some of these boards here, the dollar amounts, if we[[Page H7628]]statically score it, are the same. They just have different effects.  This is really, really important. So think of dynamic scoring as just that: it is the scorekeeping of how we all do this.  For everyone that is actually interested in this, I will strongly encourage you to go to the Joint Committee on Taxation's website. I believe they actually have a tab there that actually geeks out a little bit on what dynamic score is, particularly if you are an accounting or quant major. You will love this stuff.  Also, the Tax Foundation, which is nonpartisan. We have actually borrowed lots of information from them. They actually have some really great examples of, when we, over the years, have made certain types of policy decisions, what has been good for society and where we have actually missed and not gotten near the numbers that we have promised.  Do understand that, when we take a look at what we did in 2003, the U.economy ended up being 4.6 percent larger by 2006. So, from 2003 to 2006, we actually were 4.6 percent larger--I know these are a little bit geeky--than the models back then provided for.                              {time}  1345  It is not that the models were bad and evil. They just didn't have all the data. But they still provided an opportunity for the policymakers, back in 2003, to actually make their decisions.  So I hope--actually, if anyone actually found this interesting, please write and tell us. If you are now bored out of your mind and we helped you sleep, please let us know. But the reality of it is, what is about to happen in the debate over tax reform is going to have a lot of really technical, really complicated debating points in it.  As I learned yesterday, when we were rolling out some of the math, some of our brothers and sisters who desperately do not want us to have a win decided that zero was a tax hike. I just beg of everyone for at least on this issue, if we can sort of pull our partisan rage away and just sort of focus on the working population of our society and how we help and also how do we help for the future so my 2-year-old daughter, so your children, so my family that may be heading towards retirement, everyone has a fair chance. And that fair chance can only happen if we really start to grow this economy and start to grow it fairly dramatically.

30,topic-id,490,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, the whole world is aware of a series of storms that have hit not only America's shores but those shores of so many of our territories, including the U.Virgin Islands and Puerto                              {time}  1530  A series of these hurricanes over the past few weeks has caused great devastation in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico, and, of course, again, the U.Virgin These are people who are American citizens, and they are in these territories, and they are suffering from loss and devastation, and we have never seen an occurrence like this with two storms in succession.  While there remains much to be done and evaluated, this legislation takes important steps, I believe, that are necessary to begin providing relief to those individuals. We have had a lot of debate not only on this floor and not only at the Rules Committee, but certainly in the U.House of Representatives and the public media about what steps need to be taken, who needs to be there first, what FEMA's responsibility is, what the responsibility is for HUD, what the responsibility is for States, and what the responsibility is for citizens and their local communities. But the bottom line is that much of the evaluation, the undertaking of saving of lives, trying to work to save more property and to be there in support of people, is an ongoing project that will take a long period of time.  Specifically, this underlying legislation helps to address five targeted and meaningful tax provisions that provide relief and make it easier for people to recover and to return to their homes and to make long-term decisions from a money and tax perspective.  It will allow hurricane victims to keep more of their paychecks, deduct more of the cost of their expensive property damage, and provide more affordable and immediate access to retirement savings should people decide that they would choose to go that direction at this difficult time in their life.  This legislation also encourages more Americans--Americans who see what is happening--and companies to be able to donate, to donate to those who are in need by temporarily suspending limitations on the deductions for charitable contributions for hurricane relief efforts this year. This is an important step, and it removes obstacles that might be in the way for the public to get involved and to help their fellow citizens.  Taken together, these five tax provisions go a long way, we believe, in helping these people recover from these storms.  The rule also makes clarifications to ensure Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands are treated equitably in all tax sections of this bill.

466,topic-id,501,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me time.  I rise today in support of the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017.  This extension provides stability to our aviation system and extends the funding to the FAA over the next 6 months while Congress continues to make progress on a full FAA reauthorization bill. This extension is absolutely necessary to prevent a shutdown in FAA programs, delays in airport construction projects, and the possible furlough of thousands of FAA employees across the country. I will be the first to admit I am disappointed we have not passed a long-term bill yet.  Unfortunately, this is not a new problem for Between 2007 and 2012, Congress passed 23 extensions before approving a full reauthorization. These short-term stopgaps, while necessary, create long-term budget instability, and they contribute to the FAA's overall inability to effectively manage the modernization of our antiquated air traffic control system.  Congress has passed numerous piecemeal reforms over the years to try to help the FAA act more like a business and efficiently modernize the system. These reforms have not worked, and passing the same kind of reforms again is not going to change the simple fact that the Federal Government is not an innovative, high-tech service business.  It is time to face the truth that, without transformational reform, the American people will not get the most modern and efficient air traffic control system that they have been promised and deserve. For too long, we have been trying to manage the symptoms of the problem instead of finding a cure.  Thankfully, we now have that cure.

In the meantime, we have to pass this extension today to provide 6 months' worth of certainty and stability to the FAA, the aviation community, and the flying public.  Without it, starting this Sunday, October 1, the FAA programs will face a shutdown, thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed, airport projects across the country will come to a halt, and approximately $40 million a day in aviation trust fund revenue will go uncollected. That is funding for air traffic control, airport development, and other safety and modernization programs that will never be recovered.  I want to remind my colleagues again that the very fact that we have to pass this bill today is one of the many reasons we need fundamental, comprehensive FAA reform.

The FAA technicians are working around the clock to restore services, but because of the extent of the damage and the challenges of the terrain where equipment is located, it is difficult to determine when full restoration will happen.  For instance, as we debate this bill, technicians are making their way to a long-range radar site on a mountain in Puerto The last two miles to the site through the rainforest are impassable, so the technicians are using chainsaws to clear a path for themselves and their replacement equipment. The radar and navigation equipment are critical for the safe operation of flights.  We will have plenty of time to debate aviation policy in the coming weeks, and I look forward to it. But the FAA extension we are considering this week is not a pawn in a Washington game of political brinksmanship.

We challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.  Finally, we stand here tonight, unified, for the military families who have experienced this tragedy, and we say to you: Your family's loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones, and we will not rest until every veteran has access to the care he or she needs.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.Johnson), who understands the importance of addressing this epidemic, a colleague and friend of mine.  Thank you for being here this evening.

371,topic-id,493,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to extend my thanks and gratitude to Congressman Not only is he an amazing Representative for the people of Ohio, he is also a veteran who served our country ably and proudly, and his story of a veteran in his district lost to suicide should be a call to all of us around the country to take care of the veterans in each of our districts.  We have made some progress since last year. I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, Sergeant Daniel Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in He served on Task Force Lightning, an intelligence unit. He ran over 400 combat missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a Part of his role required him to interrogate dozens of terror suspects, and his work was deemed classified.  Like many veterans, Daniel was haunted by the war when he returned. He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and additional symptoms of post-traumatic stress, made worse by a traumatic brain injury.  Daniel needed help. He and his family asked for help, but, unfortunately, the VA enrolled Sergeant Somers in group therapy sessions, which Sergeant Somers could not attend for fear of disclosing classified information. Despite requests for individualized counseling or some other reasonable accommodation to allow Sergeant Somers to receive appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA delayed providing Sergeant Somers with appropriate support and care.  Like many, Sergeant Somers' isolation got worse when he transitioned to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but he was unable to work due to his disability.  Sergeant Somers struggled with the VA bureaucracy. His disability appeal had been pending in the system for over 2 years without resolution. Sergeant Somers didn't get the help he needed in time.  On June 10 of 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family. In the letter he said: ``I am not getting better, I am not going to get better, and I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on.''                              {time}  1900  He went on to say:  ``Thus, I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in a war to be at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who would take the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out--and, thus, deserve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but the world is better without me in it.  ``This is what brought me to my actual final mission.''  We lost Sergeant Somers that day.  No one who returns home from serving our country should ever feel like he or she has nowhere to turn. I am committed to working on both sides of the aisle to ensure that no veteran ever feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental healthcare.

372,topic-id,203,"Mr.Speaker, Sergeant Somers' story is familiar to too many military families. Sergeant Somers' parents, Howard and Jean, were devastated by the loss of their son, but they bravely shared Sergeant Somers' story and created a mission of their own. Their mission is to ensure that Sergeant Somers' story brings to light America's deadliest war--the 20 veterans that we lose every day to suicide.  Howard and Jean are working with Congress and the VA to share their experience with the VA healthcare system and to find ways to improve care for veterans and their families. We worked closely with Howard and Jean to develop the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act, and ensure veterans of classified experiences can access appropriate VA mental healthcare services.  After more than 3 years of work, I am proud to say that the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act is now law. But this is just one small step forward, and our work with Howard and Jean doesn't stop here. We have so much work left to do.

837,topic-id,1102,"Cliff, thank you very, very much for your very kind words. I am honored to receive this award. It is especially important because it comes from my peers, and I am humbled, given that prior recipients of this award included such giants as Amo Houghton and Lee My great thanks to you, the Executive Committee, and the board of directors.  I am here to talk a little bit about the Congress to Campus program that Cliff has already alluded to. It is our most impactful and important domestic program, and I am glad to report on it and also to add some thoughts about the state of civic education across  What a year Congress to Campus has had during 2016 and 2017. Under this program, bipartisan pairs of former Members visit college campuses for several days to speak to students from all disciplines in a variety of settings, large and small.  We have three goals: to promote public service in the next generation of Americans, to teach about Congress and the work of a Member of Congress in ways that political science doesn't often capture, and to engage students in a discussion about the issues of the day.  The format demonstrates that a Republican and a Democrat can have different points of view and opinions but still have a respectful debate looking for common ground and a path forward.  Last fall, during the election season, the Former Members of Congress sent teams to 16 campuses. We had an additional 14 visits during the spring term. It was the busiest academic year in the 35-year history of the program.  Former Members visited all over the U.S., from the University of Maine to Alcorn State in Mississippi and from the Naval Academy to Arizona There were also four international Congress to Campus visits.  Students come away with a better understanding of how Congress works and what the life of a Member of Congress is like. Sixty percent of the students report that their opinion of Congress improves after hearing from a bipartisan pair of former  After hearing from such a visit, one student observed that Republicans and Democrats aren't completely at odds and that they can work together. That is certainly very different than the way the media portrays things. Another student came away with a sense of how important it was to be involved in public service.  In 2016, over 50 Members gave their time to speak to almost 7,000 students, not just at colleges in the Congress to Campus program, but also students in high school and middle school. I want to thank my colleagues on behalf of the Association for their participation in these many visits.  Special thanks to the Former Members of Congress staff, particularly Sharon Witiw, who is here in the Chamber, for nurturing this important program, for getting on us to participate and expanding it in partnership with our friends at the Stennis We have come a long way since the years when a busy Congress to Campus year consisted of two or three visits per semester.[[Page H7580]]  For these college audiences, we don't talk about how a bill becomes law but, rather, examine issues deeply and look into the politics of today's The program is civic education in practice.  I also need to report that more and more, during these visits, we encounter a lack of civic literacy, a lack of basic understanding of our Constitution and the structure and practice of American representative democracy. It seems to be getting more pronounced every year.  Our Association shares with many others across the country a growing concern about the current state of civic knowledge and skill. Just last week, the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania found in its survey that only a quarter of Americans can name all three branches of government and more than a third can't name any of the rights protected by the First  Lack of this sort of basic civic knowledge and skills probably has a relationship to the current level of distrust in government and officeholders. This has led the Association to look for possible solutions.  Building on the civic ed admission of our Congress to Campus program, the Association now intends to play a larger role in addressing civic illiteracy by reaching younger audiences in middle and secondary schools.  A bipartisan group of our Association came together for strategic planning around this mission. Working with the Lou Frey Institute at the University of Central Florida, the campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools, and Tufts University and facilitated by Pete Weichlein's wife--is she here today, Pete? Okay.--we developed a plan for how former Members could be more actively involved.  This work has generated some exciting developments. Cliff has already shared the idea of a Congressional Study Group on Civics, which we intend to have bring together current Members, district directors, and chiefs of staff, bring them into our undertaking to advance civic learning and practice.  Last week, the Association participated in a groundbreaking national symposium on civics organized by our two partners, the campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools and the Lou Frey Institute, where funders and many civic organizations exchanged ideas and renewed their commitments to improving our common efforts to educate for democracy.  Pete and I were there and had the privilege, on behalf of our Association, to commit us to making civic education the centerpiece of the Former Members of Congress' domestic programs, and Pete will be on each and all of us to make good on that promise.  We have a steering committee of former Members committed to the effort. My friends and colleagues, George Nethercutt, Jim Gerlach, Bill Sarpalius, Tom Coleman, Karen Thurman, Steve Horsford, and Mickey Edwards join me on that committee. We will convene soon to discuss what former and current Members can do together to make a difference and to issue a call to arms to our membership. Consider yourselves forewarned. I am looking at you, Dan  By exemplifying bipartisanship and taking advantage of the networks we still have, former Members can make a tremendous contribution to addressing the core need of American democracy: preparing our young people for active citizenship. I look forward to reporting to you again next year on our progress.  More importantly, we need to engage all of you in this effort. Our people's lack of understanding of our own system of government has become pervasive, and it threatens the It explains much of what ails us politically.  Cliff, thank you very much for your leadership of the Association and for the opportunity to give this report.

31,topic-id,599,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, extending the Federal Aviation Administration's authority is traditionally something that gets bipartisan support. That hasn't been the case this time, as we saw on Monday when a prior version of this bill failed on suspension. It contained several extraneous provisions, but it didn't include some of the most important priorities that we face.  September 30 is nearly upon us. That is the deadline to reauthorize programs that the American people depend on. That includes things like the Perkins student loan program, which helps low-income students to finance their education.  There are 500,000 students across the country, including nearly 50,000 from New York, relying on it right now, but the Perkins Loan Program isn't anywhere in this bill.  The bill also does nothing to extend the Children's Health Insurance Program created in 1997 with broad bipartisan support. More than 9 million children get their health insurance through this program. Without continued Federal funding, States are going to begin running out of money to take care of some of the most vulnerable kids, and they can't wait until the end of the year for us to act.  Community health centers have also been left out of the bill, and they have told us that they will have problems from day one. If we don't extend their funding, an estimated 9 million people would lose access to healthcare.  These are essential bipartisan programs, Mr.Speaker, and what does it say about the majority's leadership if they are not extended by the deadline? It does not bode well for our ability to fund the government later this year, to raise the debt ceiling, extend the Flood Insurance Program, or reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  This bill is an incredibly important one. No one in this Chamber or anywhere that I know of in the world wants the FAA program stopped and their employees furloughed or airport projects brought to a halt. We should work together and get it right.  This package, however, has not been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. It didn't go through regular order. Committees have been shut out of the process, and Democrats, who represent half the population in the United States, didn't get a say.  We are all glad to see provisions included here to provide some tax relief for victims of the recent hurricanes. With regular order and a more open process, this could be a more comprehensive package of extenders that provide more tax relief for victims to recover and to rebuild. After all, the Democrats did suggest 21 bipartisan tax provisions which were included in previous relief legislation after previous disasters.                              {time}  1545  But none of those, except five, I think, are included in this bill. That is a shame.  We have said it before. This is, I think, the 44th closed rule this session, and that is just about all the bills we have done. This bill could either have been bipartisan extending the FAA authorization, or a comprehensive package of extenders that provided the tax relief necessary for hurricane victims to recover and rebuild. The bill before us is neither. I doubt many of us have had time to review the changes that were made last night.  I have often said that a bad process leads to a bad product, and, Mr.Speaker, I am afraid that is what we see with this bill. Another opportunity for bipartisanship has been turned into another political fight.  I, regretfully, reserve the balance of my time.

387,topic-id,758,"Mr.President, first of all, I rise with a sigh of relief that the decision has been made not to go forward with a vote on a very divisive healthcare bill.  More importantly today, I rise to say this is really an opportunity for us to work together to get something done--something very positive--as it relates to healthcare costs and healthcare coverage for the people whom we all represent in our States and the people across the country. I am hopeful we will see action soon, and I am hopeful it will be this week when we can come together around very good work that is being done in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee with our two great leaders--Senator Alexander and Senator  They have been holding a number of committee meetings and forums, and I am very pleased to have participated in those. We have had great bipartisan participation in focusing on how to stabilize the current insurance marketplace. We know that has to be step one[[Page S6123]]if we are going to bring down rates, bring down costs, and create a path forward so more insurance companies are participating in the current system. I have great confidence that we can come together and get that done. It needs to get done immediately because decisions are being made about rates this week, and I am hopeful we can take action on that this week.  Mr.President, we have two other things that are very important--open dates that are looming by the end of the week. One is for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers 9 million American children across the country. In Michigan, we call it We have children today who can go to the doctor and parents who can take their children to the doctor because of the MIChild The Federal funding for that ends on September 30, this weekend, if we do not take action.  This is another piece of good news because the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch; the distinguished ranking member, Senator Wyden; others; and I have introduced a bipartisan bill that will extend that program for an additional 5 years. It needs to get done this week. It is a bipartisan effort, and I am hopeful that can get done as well.  We have community health centers in our country--our federally qualified community health centers--whose funding runs out, again, this weekend. Funding health centers has strong bipartisan support. Senator Roy Blunt and I, along with a total of 70 out of 100 Members of the Senate, have joined in a letter to continue the funding for health centers. That needs to get done right away. In addition to that, there are what we call certain health extenders or policies that are bipartisan that can be done together as well.  We see a picture of important efforts of stabilizing the insurance markets to bring down costs, creating more opportunity for competition in the marketplaces, continuing the Children's Health Insurance Program, continuing the funding for health centers, which are so critical in communities in every one of our States, where people are getting the care they need at their local health centers.  Bringing those things together can be done. Now, it is a lot of work to do that in a couple of days, but these are bipartisan efforts that can be done together to show that in fact we can come together and get things done. I know the people in Michigan want us to do that. They want us to work together to get things done. They want us to focus on lowering costs for healthcare and increasing coverage, and they are anxious to see that we can come together to do that.  I am hopeful. It is only Tuesday, and I am hopeful, with the remaining days of the week, given the bipartisanship that is there and the agreements that have been made on legislation already, that we could go into high gear in the next few days and come together and have a positive story, a good news story to tell at the end of this week about what we are able to do, working together, to be able to fix problems in the healthcare system and to be able to continue very important programs that provide healthcare for children and for families in local communities around the country.

835,topic-id,3271,"Mr.Frost, thank you very much, and I would also indicate the former members of the European Union are all accounted for and present here, and we welcome all of them here especially.  I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As I prepare for today's report, I want to give you a little quote from Aristotle that goes back 2,500 years. He was asked: What would be the best form of life one could live? He replied that ``the best form of life, the Eudaimonia outcome, given all that, would be the life of the good lawgiver.''  He didn't mention the richest person, nor the most spiritual man, but the legislator. For all of us, service in this remarkable building was the pinnacle of our professional lives, and I am very proud that through the Former Members of Congress we can continue, in a very small measure, the public service that brought us here to Congress in the first place.  My colleagues, our Association was chartered by Congress, and one requirement of that congressional charter is for us to report once a year to Congress about our activities.  Incidentally, in 2016, there were approximately 1.8 million not-for-profit organizations in the United Of that number, right around 100 are congressionally chartered, and those include such outstanding organizations as the USO and the Boy and Girl Scouts of Former Members of Congress, therefore, is in very exclusive and prestigious company, and we take the mandate that comes with being congressionally chartered very seriously.  Our Association was founded in 1970 and chartered by Congress in 1983. It is a bipartisan, nonprofit, voluntary alliance of former United States Senators and Members of Congress standing for America's constitutional system, which vests authority in the people through their elected offices.  We work together to strengthen Congress in the conduct of its constitutional responsibility through promoting a collaborative approach to policymaking. We seek to deepen the understanding of our democratic system, domestically and internationally, and to encourage the citizenry through civic education about Congress and the importance of public service.  We are successful because Democrats and Republicans work together in a partnership for all of our programs and our many projects, including participation with current Members of  We are so proud to have been chartered by Congress, and we are equally proud that absolutely no taxpayer dollar is earmarked or expended to make all of our programs possible. Everything we do, and you will hear about many of our activities in a short while, is financed via grants and sponsors, our membership dues, and our annual fundraising gala. Our finances are sound, our projects are fully funded, and our most recent annual audit by an outside accountant confirmed that we are running the Former Members of Congress in a very fiscally sound, responsible, and transparent manner.  We are successful because former Senators and Representatives come together, across party lines, for the good of our organization. They all believe in our mission, and they continue to have the public servant's spirit at heart.  Former Members of Congress, in 2016, donated over 6,500 hours of energy, wisdom, mentoring, and expertise. All of these activities were donated pro bono. No former Member received any kind of honorarium to go on a Congress to Campus visit or participate in any Former Members of Congress' programs. Your only remuneration is the knowledge that you are giving back, that serving in Congress was a unique privilege, and that it comes with a mandate to teach the next generation.  Before I report on specific activities, as your Association's president, I want to thank all the Members who have contributed their time and expertise to make our organization such a success. So on behalf of the Former Members of Congress, thank you wholeheartedly for your participation.  Many of you have joined us for several years on this occasion. There will be numerous programs and projects which, by now, you have become quite familiar with. This is a sign of the Former Members of Congress' stability and purpose. We are extremely proud of our 50-year history of creating lasting and impactful programs that teach about Congress and representative government, and our ability to take longstanding projects and expand them and improve upon them.  In addition to hearing about programs we have conducted for many years, you will hear from us about a new vision we have for this organization. For over a year now, our Association has engaged in a very detailed, in-depth strategic planning process which has set us off for a very exciting path.  This process was led by a strategic planning professional who has worked in this field for decades, has written extensively on management and organizational success, and has served clients, including many Fortune 100 companies. His name is Mark Sobol, and he made the service of his company, Longwave Partners, available to us pro bono, because he so strongly believes in our former Members organization, that it can play an integral and impactful role in reconnecting citizens with their government, and also showcasing that public servants, no matter what the party label is, are eager to work together for the good of this country.  Our work with Mark and Longwave included our board of directors, countless former Members of Congress, our excellent staff, and numerous other stakeholders. It resulted in a vision for Former Members of Congress that outlines the next 3 to 5 years and has, as its core, four strategic principles: We will provide forums for dialogue that will strengthen bipartisan relationships here on Capitol Hill; we will become recognized nationwide as an unparalleled resource for the United States Congress; we will be a champion for public service and an advocate on behalf of Congress; and we will create internal mechanisms for maximum impact.  Sincerely, I want to thank Mark for his invaluable leadership on this transitional, transformative undertaking, and I also want to thank my colleagues for being so engaged in this exciting progress.  I include the Former Members of Congress' strategic plan for the      The United States Association of Former Members of Congress  (Cliff Stearns, President; Martin Frost, Vice President; Tim Petri,  Secretary; Karen Thurman, Treasurer; Barbara Kennelly, Past President)                              introduction       We are engaged in a strategic planning process to deepen      the impact and shape of the future of the US Association of      Former Members of Congress--We continue to believe that      the current political climate and dysfunction is preventing      Congress from functioning at its highest possible level. This      condition has compelled FMC, a Congressionally chartered      501(c)(3) non-profit, to reevaluate its mission and identify      those opportunities that will deepen the positive      contribution we are making toward a more civil[[Page H7577]]     and productive political discourse in our nation.       With the input of a bipartisan group of more than twenty      former Members over the summer, as well as staff and      ``friends of FMC'', we convened meetings in the fall of 2016      and early January 2017 to create a mission and strategic      themes for FMC that would serve us and our country well into      the future. Since that time, we have assembled staff to build      the comprehensive strategic plan we will deploy this year and      beyond.       Ahead, are the results-to-date of our collective efforts.                           Mission Statement       FMC is a bipartisan, nonprofit, voluntary alliance of      former Unites States Senators and Representatives, standing      for America's Constitutional system, which vests authority in      the people through their elected representatives.

Specific Actions:       Redefine programming portfolios to fall      into easily recognizable categories, for example group all      exchange programs, group all Capitol Hill programs, group all      non-DC programs rather than current labels.       1) Build partnerships with like-minded organizations that      offer programs which align with FMC's mission.       2) Identify vital themes and streamline programming into      consistent and recognizable groups and develop cohesive      schedule of events       3) Streamline staff responsibilities and portfolios to      group programs in a more coherent way.       4) Expand Congress to Campus model to other constituencies      by marketing events better, incorporating social media and      modern technology such as an updated website, and using      modern technology to keep constituencies involved.       5) Make more concerted effort to have Statesmanship Awards      Dinner celebrate true bipartisanship and build coherent year-     round programming around event theme.       6) Increase public service element of annual and regional      meetings by incorporating FMC programming and telling FMC's      story to our own membership in a more compelling and cohesive      way, which will also aid in recruiting FMCs to be more      active.       7) Expand programming impact and ability to keep      constituents involved following a program by building a      cohesive schedule of events so that participants from one      event can continue their interaction with former Members via      a follow up event, for example a Congress to Campus visit is      followed up by a webinar.       8) Find ways to incorporate technology into every aspect of      FMC events, from marketing to registration, from tweets      during event to creating platforms for follow up.       Regional Develop a comprehensive plan for      regional outreach to reach new constituencies.       1) Increase regional outreach based on FMC's themes, for      example bipartisanship or civics, and involve local media.       2) Incorporate as many FMC constituencies as possible into      a regional program, for example by combining a Congress to      Campus visit with a Congressional staff delegation, all      involving local former       Social Broaden and enhance social activities to      create relationships       1) Identify and create new forums by building      collaborations and partnerships.       2) Enhance FMC presence by creating unique and inclusive      events on Capitol Hill and at non-Congressional venues.       3) Bring together the different members of the      ``Congressional Family'': former Members, current Members,      Congressional staff, FMC partners, etc.     core strategy 2: elevate and streamline our brand so that our accumulated wisdom and convening power is recognized as a reputable and                unparalleled resource on the U.congress       Purpose: Vastly expand our reach and our impact; be an      advocate on behalf of the Congress and on behalf of the value      of public service; unify our leadership, membership and staff      behind FMC's core message.       Specific Actions:       Brand Unify and elevate FMC brand and      marketing materials, both internal and external.       1) Decide whether ``FMC'' accurately describes the work of            2) Create consistent, unified visual brand for all FMC      artwork, logos, letterhead, etc.       3) Create unified message and train everyone, including      board and staff, to communicate the same points about       4) Develop cohesive schedule of events with same themes      across programming.       Have a more modern, dynamic and interactive      site that better tells our story and is a more effective tool      for staff.       1) Redesign current site.       2) Drive social media traffic to website and vice versa.       3) Make better use of partners and like-minded entities to      expand outreach via social media and advertise FMC      capabilities and programming.

Specific Actions:       Create a call-to-action on a national and      regional basis to expand the present number of actively      involved former Members, and create a pool of engaged Members      in all regions of the country.       1) Focus on civic education to create a call-to-action that      is regional and happens at the state level; raise Members'      engagement in FMC by giving them a real issue with real      action items and real deliverables that can be applied across      the country.       2) Organize regional meetings to gather former Members who      are no longer in DC, engage them in FMC as an organization,      educate them on FMC projects, issue call-to-action on civic      education, and use these relationships to build a more      actively involved membership in all regions of the country.       3) Give broader group of engaged stakeholders an      opportunity to benefit the organization by expanding notion      of ``Congressional Family'' to also include current Members,      current senior staff, former senior staff, etc. via      partnerships and collaborative efforts across the country.       Expand the number of former Members of      Congress, both in the Washington, DC area and in all other      parts of the country, who actively participate in the call-     to-action through FMC programming and are willing to donate      their time, expertise, leadership and funding to       1) Increase the degree of former Senator participation and      active engagement.       2) Make recruitment a core element of all regional meetings      as well as the DC-based annual meeting, utilizing these      gatherings to focus much more on FMC's programming and the      need for membership support.       3) Showcase success by highlighting the impact specific      former Members have made by participating actively in FMC      programming.       4) Create regional hubs across the country where fully      engaged FMC members can take a leadership role to recruit      former colleagues in the area.     Core Strategy 4: Develop FMC for maximum impact and efficiency       Purpose: Streamline all of FMC's resources--staff, funding,      leadership--for greater impact; modernize programs and      processes to capitalize on new technology, thus expanding our      impact, but expending fewer of FMC's limited resources.       Specific Actions:       Short-term resources. Refine our notion of where we      spend our time and money in the short-term:       1) Develop a strategy specific to Congress to Campus visits      that envisions an increased number of visits, a Steering      Committee composed of FMC board members, and additional      funding via a corporate or foundation sponsor.       2) Decline participating in projects by outside      organizations if project does not meet the following test:      Does the project further FMC's mission?

If no, is the project's purpose or potential for future      FMC impact worth expending our own resources? If no, decline.       3) Communicate to outside groups that there is limited      opportunity for short notice and ad hoc programming (it will      emerge clearly after a 12 to 18-month calendar of events is      created which time windows lend themselves for additional      programming, and which do not).       4) Streamline program implementation procedures and create      templates to eliminate redundancies across the organization.       Long-term resources. Refine our notion of where we spend      our time and money in the long-term:       1) Examine benefit of hosting charitable golf tournament.       2) Examine benefit of hosting Life After Congress       3) Eliminate current model of Congress Bundestag       Create more effective and cohesive procedures:       1) Group programming into themes.       2) Streamline staff portfolios.       3) Elevate impact of board of directors.       4) Expand notion of ``Congressional Family'' and outside      stakeholders.       5) Develop long-range calendar to implement cohesive      message and common themes.       Review and Install an annual review process to      evaluate implementation of this plan and whether the plan's      objectives continue to be core strategies for                            Plan Commentary       With current staffing and budget levels, we can:       Develop an across-the-organization unified visual brand      to incorporate logo/look/marketing materials.       Via SKDKnickerbocker contract:       1) Develop consistent branding message.       2) Train board members and staff to communicate consistent      message and deploy trained spokespersons to interact with      local and national media outlets.       3) Develop social media strategy.       With additional funding, we can:       Redesign website.       Hire senior staff member as Director of Development to      free other staff up for program creation and implementation      instead of fundraising.       Develop recruitment strategy to incorporate regional      outreach, DC-based former Member outreach, and marketing      materials.       Develop new programs that are mission-specific,      incorporate multiple themes we aim to address during a given      year, can serve as a recruitment tool to bring additional      former Members into the fold, and take advantage of the      resources like-minded organizations offer via partnerships      and collaboration; new projects could include:       1) Case studies of legislation that showcase across-the-     aisle collaboration and resulted in high positive impact for      the nation.       2) A national theme--civic education--that can be      implemented regionally, thus creating a call-to-action and a      common project for former Members and other stakeholders      across the nation.       3) Programming focused on advocating on behalf of Congress      and current Members, for example highlighting the need for      Congressional Reform or shining a spotlight on the tremendous      fundraising demands put on current       4) Social events and travel for current Members and senior      Congressional staff to build bipartisan relationships.       Hire junior staff member to assist with additional      programming as well as support senior staff that service the      needs of partners and collaborative projects.       Organize regional activities to recruit FMCs and to      broaden the organization's national footprint/impact.       Offer additional programming in DC to build across-the-     aisle relationships for current Members and senior      Congressional staff.       Purchase hardware and software to make much better use      of technology, for example to offer webinars, webcasts and      podcasts; this could be an option for academic institutions      (colleges, community colleges, high schools) to participate      in a condensed Congress to Campus experience without the cost      of travel or an administrative fee.            Crosscutting Themes for Strategy Implementation       Communicate cohesive message.       Develop across-the-organization look.       Train staff and board to communicate unified message.       Create a stronger media presence by redesigning website and      social media strategy.       Take advantage of technology to tell more compelling and      interactive story.       Use technology to engage membership and program      participants before, during and after an FMC event.       Make use of the SKDKnickerbocker opportunity.       Develop cohesion across the organization.       Sync programs into cohesive themes.       Sync long-range calendar of events.       Redefine staff portfolios.       Redefine deliverables and expectations of board of      directors.       Build partnerships and opportunities for collaboration.       Expand successful programs to new venues.       Expand internal definition of ``Congressional Family''      and FMC stakeholders.       Build FMC footprint that goes beyond       Serve partners by offering FMC as a resource, and take      advantage of partners to utilize their projects to further      FMC's mission.       Elevate FMC from a DC organization to a national      organization.       Recruit former Members from all parts of the country to      support the organization's mission and diverse range of      programs.       Bring broad range of FMC programming together for a      regional project.       Empower regional stakeholders--former Members, local      media, local Congressional staff, etc.--to take advantage of      FMC as a resource.

836,topic-id,1479,"Already, this work has had a tremendously positive impact on us. I am extremely pleased to announce that, since our last meeting, as a direct result of our strategic plan, we have secured three new grants: the Democracy Fund; the Hewlett-Packard Foundation's Madison Initiative; and just last week, the Japan-U.Friendship These outstanding sponsors join our long-term partners with whom we have worked for many years, including the Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership, the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, and The German Marshall Fund of the United  In addition to this fundraising success, or more accurately because of it, we have added four additional staff members to the Former Members of Congress team, many of whom you will meet throughout the day.  We have also launched a new program aimed at connecting, on a bipartisan basis, current district directors from throughout the country with each other to work together on specific issues and benefit from hearing each other's best practices.  As you know quite well, district directors are at the very forefront of our representative democracy and tend to be the first interaction between a constituent and his or her The district director functions as a mediator, bridging the gap between the national policy and the district's interest. But the very nature of being in the district means that the congressional professionals do not have the same opportunity their colleagues in D.have: to get to know their counterparts in other offices, to work collaboratively on issues of common concern, and to build a network of contacts among their peers.  Thanks to expanding on existing grants and winning new foundation support, we have conducted a number of district director specific staff delegation trips and now have brought together, under one umbrella, dozens of district directors from all parts of the country and, of course, on both sides of the political aisle. District director study tours provide an exciting opportunity to build bipartisan relationships, share best practices, and, with the international travel, build transatlantic relationships.  In March, a bipartisan group of 10 district directors from around the country traveled to Stuttgart, Germany, to study security issues, dual vocational education and apprenticeships, trade, and foreign investments.  In April, a bipartisan group of six district directors traveled to Houston to learn about the energy industry and workforce development.  In June, a bipartisan group of six district directors went to Boston and focused on the tech industry and education.  This October, another bipartisan group of six district directors will be going to Iceland to focus on alternative energy, the environment, and natural resources.  After all these trips, we can confirm that district directors greatly appreciated and found immense value in the opportunity to not only learn about the organized topic but to share the experience with other district directors, particularly from the other side of the aisle.   One statement heard again and again, ``I have that same issue, what did you do about it?'' These district directors through FMC have a chance to really bond, regardless of what party, where in the country they are from or what the demographics of their constituency is.  For 2018, we already have confirmed another district director trip to Germany and to We also plan for other activities to engage district directors, including possibly two more domestic trips and invitations to all Former Members of Congress regional meetings.  Regional meetings are another outgrowth of our strategic plan. One clear refrain of the strategic planning sessions that we had that resonated loud[[Page H7579]]and clear was that we need to get outside of Washington more. If we are going to be supportive of Congress, we need to make sure we are not a voice just heard in D. Former Members live outside of Current Members are spending much more time in their districts. It is, therefore, critical that we participate more outside of D.and with the congressional staff that is outside.  Since our last report to Congress, we already have hosted three regional meetings, with a fourth one planned for later this year. These meetings are a day long and not only provide an opportunity for former Members to come together, but we also provide them an opportunity to share their knowledge and expertise with the younger generation by building into our program outreach to a college campus, or a high school, for example.  We were in Los Angeles late last year and included a meeting with UCLA students. In April, we went to Chicago, where a group of former Members held a panel for Northwestern students. In July, we visited Boston, where a group of former Members and a visiting delegation of district directors met with interns in the Massachusetts State  We have a regional meeting in Orlando on the schedule for November 7th and have arranged for a mini Congress to Campus visit to the University of Central In addition to bringing together former Members from the region, we extend invitations to State Representatives, district directors, local academics, and others in the congressional family.  We plan to crisscross the country with regional meetings so that we can both engage our membership and meet their needs, as well as expand our mission to deepen the understanding of our democratic process and to engage the citizenry through civic education about Congress and public service.  Our last new development should be highlighted: we are issuing to our Members a call to action on the crucially important aspect of civic education. We have formed a partnership with the Lou Frey Institute at the University of Central As you are surely aware, civic education has been one of the most important issues our dear friend Lou Frey has worked on since leaving Congress, and his institute has become a leading voice on this topic in my home State of Included in this partnership is the Civic Mission of Schools, which works hand in hand with the civic education initiative of Justice Sandra Day O' We envision an extremely active role for former Members to play at the State level to be an advocate for civic education. Florida, of course, is a great example on how civics can be restored if there is a bipartisan consensus and commitment to make it happen.  In addition to this partnership, I am proud to share with you that we are in the process of taking our highly successful model of the international Congressional Study Groups and translating it for the first time to a domestic issue: the Congressional Study Group on  Our vision is to bring together, under our umbrella, the bipartisan congressional family--Republicans and Democrats; former Members and current Members; chiefs of staff currently working on the Hill and some who left the Hill and are now in communities all over the country; and our newest constituency, district directors for current Members--all of us working together under the umbrella of the Congressional Study Group on Civics to promote civic education and make a better understanding of our representative democracy and a much greater knowledge base when it comes to Congress and the work of Members of This new undertaking is in the very beginning stages, and I look forward to reporting to you next year on our progress.  One goal of this civic outreach is to remove the stigma that now is attached to the word ``politician.'' John Buchan had a quote. He was an English scholar; he wrote 42 books; he had numerous publications; he was elected to parliament in England at the beginning of the 20th century; and he was appointed Governor General of the Assembly in Canada by the  This is what he said: ``Public life is regarded as the crown of a career, and to young men and women, it is the worthiest of ambitions. Politics is still the greatest and most honorable adventure.''  If our civic education outreach can reintroduce this appreciation of public service in this next generation, then we will have succeeded.  Civic education and this commitment to reaching out to students across the country are just two of the reasons we will honor our colleague David Skaggs later today. I hope you all will join us during our luncheon in David's honor as we recognize his exemplary service to this country with our 2017 Distinguished Service  As many of you know, David was an officer in the Marine Corps in Vietnam before seeking public office. He served in the Colorado State Legislature and, of course, here in the House of Representatives for six terms. He now serves with Martin Frost and Vin Weber on the board of the National Endowment for He and his lovely wife, Laura, will be with us during lunch today.

My colleagues, as all of you know, our most active programming involves current Members of Congress from both parties and from both Chambers and, of course, our Congressional Study We conduct programs focussing on Europe and We bring current Members of Congress together with their peers and legislatures overseas, and we work with our Department of State to talk about representative democracy with audiences overseas, also.  Via the Former Members Association, I have met with numerous groups of legislators from other democracies who come to Washington for a better understanding of our representative government, our form of democracy, and what is going on politically in the United States and on Capitol  These conversations and meetings are always a two-way street, and I learn as much, if not more, from our visitors as they do from me. Our Association has a longstanding partnership with a great NGO called Legacy International, bringing young professionals from the Middle East and North Africa to the United  Our most recent group completed their 6-week D.stay earlier in the year and was composed of young professionals from Tunisia and Most of these visitors worked in the NGO sector in their countries, and they[[Page H7581]]came to the United States to learn about the interaction between government and the nongovernmental sector. It is truly a very enriching cross-cultural dialogue, and I am very pleased that FMC offers this opportunity to our Members and to their visitors.  As I stated earlier, the main international activity of our Association is housed with the Congressional Study Groups on Japan, Germany, and These are our programs that involve current Members of Congress as well as current senior congressional staff.

You and Ken have given so much over the years for this golf tournament. I can only echo your remarks about the Statesmanship Awards Dinner, which will be held next year on March 21.  All the programs we have described, of course, require both leadership and staff to implement. Our Association is blessed to have top people in both categories. I simply want to take this opportunity to thank our board of directors--over 30 former Members of Congress divided equally between the parties--for their active advice and counsel, and I really sincerely appreciate it.  I also want to thank the many partners and supporters we have to make our programs possible. We are truly lucky to have assembled a group of corporations and foundations that believe in our work and make our success possible, and we very much value our partnership with them.  Also, I would be remiss if I did not thank the other members of our Association's executive committee: our vice president, Martin Frost; our secretary, Tom Petri; our treasurer, Karen Thurman; and our past president, Barbara  You have all made this Association a much stronger organization and much better than it was before, and I thank you, of course, for your time and energy.  To administer all these programs takes a staff of dedicated and enthusiastic professionals. It is just amazing to me how much we get done with just a relatively small staff, and it is a testament to their dedication and their capabilities how successful we have been because of this.  Andy Shoenig and Rachel Haas left the Former Members of Congress after many years of tremendous service, and we wish them both all the best as they pursue their new opportunities. Andy is earning his master's degree at the University of North Carolina, and Rachel found a great new position with a firm much closer to home, though I am very glad to see that she is with us this morning.  As I mentioned earlier, we have added four new staff members, and I hope that throughout the day you will have an opportunity to meet them. They are: Alia Diamond, who is working on our communications; Kathy Hunter, helping us with development and membership; Patrick Egenhofer, focused on the Congressional Study Group on Germany and some of our domestic programs; and Paul Kincaid, who is our brand-new director of Congressional Outreach, and his first day is today.

254,topic-id,2402,"Mr.President, every week, I have been coming to the floor to talk about my State and what I think makes it the greatest State in the country and in the world. We like to celebrate and recognize somebody in Alaska who is making a difference for their community, for the State, and for the country, and we like to call these extraordinary Alaskan individuals our Alaskan of the  Like many of us here in the Senate, I spent a lot of time recently in August traveling throughout my home State, and wherever I went, I met strong, generous, versatile Alaskans, many of whom survive in some of the harshest conditions on the planet but still have time for their communities and their families and their neighbors. But, like in many places around the country, I also saw the scourge of addiction that is tearing apart communities and tearing apart families.  We have all heard how addiction is often passed down through generations. There are many in Alaska and many throughout the country who are determined to break this intergenerational cycle of addiction and many who are succeeding. We don't always hear about them, but there are many. So this afternoon I wish to introduce my colleagues to 81-year-old Rozann Kimpton, our Alaskan of the Week, who is doing that and a lot more.  Rozann and her husband moved to Alaska from Washington State in 1958, and they immediately settled in. They ran businesses together, including a small retail store, and then they got into construction and contracting. They raised two children. They were a team. About 10 years ago, they moved to a large plot of land in Wasilla, AK--over 50 acres--to spend time in retirement, and they made plans: gardening, traveling around the world. But it didn't take long for Rozann to recognize that something was wrong--very wrong--in her family, particularly with what was happening to two of her great-grandchildren, Luke and They were living in a situation that was harmful to them and they needed help.  At this point, Rozann's husband was also suffering from his own illness--cancer--but the two of them took Luke and Amanda in and adopted them. ``It was the only way to make sure they were safe,'' Rozann said. ``And when a kid needs to be taken care of, and when a mommy and daddy can't, you do it,'' she said. ``I couldn't live with myself knowing that they were in danger and I did nothing.'' This is Rozann talking about her two great-grandkids.  That was 10 years ago. Rozann, now a widow, lives with Amanda and Luke on that big plot of land in Amanda is a senior in high school, and Luke is an eighth grader. They are great kids. As a matter of fact, I just had the opportunity to visit with them in my office yesterday.  Amanda loves geometry. She plays a violin with the Wasilla Youth Orchestra and drums and dances with the Intertribal Drum Group in Luke's big dream is to join the Navy, which I think is great.  The three of them volunteer in their community, helping foster kids. Amanda makes blankets for the foster kids. Every Sunday, they drive over 100 miles to attend Emanuel Presbyterian Church in Anchorage, which is like a second home to all of them.  In addition to all of this, Rozann is the area volunteer coordinator for Volunteers of America Grandfamilies, a grandparents support group. Once a month, she has a picnic for her fellow grandparents and other parents who have adopted kids. The kids play games, eat hamburgers and hot dogs, and adults sit around the campfire, share stories, and encourage one another in all the work they are doing. She is in constant contact with about 25 families, and whenever she spots someone she thinks might need help with their kids, their grandkids, or their great-grandkids, she gives them her card.  ``I am not a shy person,'' she said. ``I will talk to anyone who looks like they are struggling, and I am particularly good at spotting grandparents who are raising kids''--grandparents who are raising kids throughout our great  As the opioid crisis is hitting Alaska, just like it is hitting so many other States, she is seeing more and more grandparents stepping in. ``It is a plague,'' she said, ``but the most important thing is to help the children as early as possible, and to do what we can to make sure they don't carry on that plague.''  Rozann Kimpton is here right now in Washington, As I mentioned, I had a great meeting with her yesterday. She is here to attend a banquet where her efforts will be recognized. She is the 2017 recipient of the Alaska Angels in Adoption Award and will be recognized by the Congressional Coalition on  Rozann, thank you for your warmth and for all your hard work for Congratulations on your award, and congratulations on being our Alaskan of the                            Economic Growth  Mr.President, an issue I have been coming to the Senate floor to speak about for the past couple of years is an issue that I don't think we focus on enough here in the Congress, here in the Senate, and that is the key issue of America's economic growth.  With the exception of national security, strong, robust economic growth is probably the most important issue we can be focused on in this body. We certainly have many challenges in this country, but so many of them are made easier when the American economy is strong, when job opportunities are plentiful and optimism in the future because of that strong economic growth is high.  So how have we been doing over the past decade? I want everyone to take a look at this chart. The answer is, not very well; not very well at all. This chart shows the gross domestic product--GDP--decade after decade through different administrations, Democratic and Republican, over the last several decades. So if we take a look at the chart, we see Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, Bush 41 and 43, and President We see where levels have been. We see that over the years, over the decades, the average economic growth is about right here--about 4 percent.  There has been a lot of talk about what has made America great and what makes America great. This is what makes America great: strong, robust, economic growth decade after decade. That is the key.  So what happened over the past decade, right here? If we take a look right here at this red line, that is 3 percent. That is not the traditional level. Traditional levels over 200-plus years of American history are closer to 4 percent. But 3 percent GDP growth is considered OK--not bad, not great, but pretty good, and something we should all aspire to, something we should hit.  When we look at this chart, we see that in the last decade we never hit it, not even 3 percent GDP growth--more like 1.5, 2 percent. As a matter of fact, President Obama is the first President in American history where we never hit 3 percent GDP growth for a year.  I know what some may be thinking. This seems to be a pretty important issue, right? Economic growth last decade not even hitting 3 percent. Why wasn't the press writing about that? We didn't hear many stories in the press about this very important issue--a decade of lost economic growth. Many of us come to the floor to talk about this critical issue, and there is a yawn in the Press There is no interest. It is hard to understand why.  One theory I have is that if you look at our country more broadly, these are the numbers--very, very weak growth--but certain places in the country over the last 10 years have actually done very well, especially this city, Washington, It has been growing very strong, with probably 5, 6 percent growth. Some other places, some of the coastal big cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Boston, are all doing well--way higher than 3 percent. They are growing stronger. So the[[Page S6205]]press, in my view, is probably not that interested in this number because in places like Washington, everything seemed to be going great. But it wasn't going great.  Think about this: If Washington or L.or New York or San Francisco are growing at 3 or 4 percent growth and yet the country is at about 1.5 or 2 percent, then there are probably huge parts of America that are actually shrinking, not growing at all.  These charts talk about economic growth, It can sound a little bit wonky. Really, GDP is a marker for the health of our economy. It is an indicator of American progress. It is a proxy for the American dream and optimism in the future.  As this chart shows, we have had a sick economy over the last 10 years, a lost decade of economic growth. The press hasn't written much about it, and when they have, they have typically bought the line of the previous administration saying: Hey, look, we know that the traditional levels of economic growth are close to 4 percent. Look at Clinton, look at Reagan--4\1/2\, 5, 6. We know that is the case. We know 3 percent is But we haven't hit that in the last 10 years, so what is wrong? Well, the press started buying the line from the last administration: That is the ``new normal.'' We can't hit 3 percent anymore. We certainly can't hit 4 percent anymore. So 1\1/2\, 2 percent is America hitting on all cylinders. I believe that is a surrender. I believe dumbing down our expectations for economic growth is a retreat from the American dream.  As you know, the American people aren't buying this. They are not buying the dumbing down. They are not saying: Oh yeah, we can live with this 1\1/2\ percent growth. No problem. They are wise, and they aren't buying the dumbing down.  We all saw the book recently released by former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her book is entitled ``What Happened.'' What happened? This is what happened: Our citizens saw the American dream slipping away after a lost decade of economic growth, and they weren't ready to surrender to the new normal.  What do we need to focus on in the Senate? We have to start moving beyond this. We have to. We need policies that are going to focus on reigniting growth--the growth that Democrats and Republicans have supported for decades. What is that? I think there is a lot of agreement--infrastructure, less burdensome regulations, energy. America has enormous supplies of energy that we can take advantage of. Yet the issue we are starting to debate now in the Senate is tax reform.  As we debate this and work in a bipartisan way--I have heard a lot of my colleagues say that we do need to undertake tax reform. We need to keep asking ourselves, on all these policies, what they will do to reignite growth, to reignite the American dream, to allow hard-working American families to keep more of their paychecks, and to return to the optimism that comes with a robust economy, not just along the coast of America but throughout the entire country, to get back to that optimism and growth. That is what I am going to be doing as we undertake this debate on tax reform.  The Trump administration is off to an OK start. The first quarter--again, kind of a hangover from the Obama years--1.2 percent growth. That is not good at all. The last quarter, second quarter, was 3.1. It hit above 3 percent, which is what the President says his policies are meant to do. As long as they are focused on that, I certainly am going to be somebody who wants to support those kinds of pro-growth policies, and I think it is imperative, whether it is tax reform, infrastructure, regulatory reform, or energy, that we all come together in this body and make sure we work together so the next decade of growth in America does not look like this last one and gets us over 3 percent, gets us back to traditional levels of growth. I don't think there is anything more important we can do in the Senate than getting back to those important levels of growth for our country and our citizens.

375,topic-id,918,"Mr.Speaker, I want to start by thanking Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Murphy and all of my Democratic and Republican colleagues for trying to bring attention to this very important issue.  I also want to thank Secretary Shulkin, who has announced his Get to Zero initiative to try and address this problem of 20 veterans every day committing suicide in our country.  Just today, as on many days, I saw a veteran who had lost both of his legs. It is common here in Washington, D.C., but it is common throughout every city and every town throughout our country that we see more and more veterans who have injuries. After 16 years at war, there are more and more veterans in our country who have been disabled.  With 20 veterans committing suicide every day, we know, however, that there are many injuries that we cannot see, injuries that veterans carry around by themselves at home, alone, in the dark of night, with nothing but their pain.  As Congressman Murphy pointed out, 70 percent of the veterans of the 20 per day that commit suicide in our Nation--70 percent, 14 of the 20--do not have access to veterans benefits at the current time and do not utilize those services.  In fact, in our Nation today, there are 21 million veterans, approximately, and of those 21 million veterans, only 7 million have access to veterans benefits.  I have introduced a bipartisan bill, H.2736, to suggest that what we need to do in our Nation is provide mental health benefits to every single veteran in our country, regardless of whether they were Active Duty, whether they were in the National Guard or in the Reserves, whether they were honorably discharged or less than honorably discharged. It is estimated that, since 2009, there have been 22,000 veterans with mental illnesses that have received other than honorable discharges. Arguably, most of those discharges were because of the same mental illness that they now carry around with them today.  Think of a veteran who is in crisis, a veteran who is contemplating suicide, a veteran who, as Congressman Murphy described, is at the end of their rope and feels that there is no help and the only way to escape their pain is to commit suicide. Think of that veteran who reaches out for help at the  Could you imagine going through the bureaucracy to figure out whether or not you were even eligible for services if you weren't currently enrolled? You are seeking help, you are in the middle of a crisis, and you have got to fill out a form. You have got to determine whether or not you meet the criteria.  I am an attorney and a certified public accountant and a Member of the United States I read the requirements, and I couldn't figure them out. We need to make it much easier for anyone who has ever worn a uniform in any capacity whatsoever: in battles that we won, in battles that we lost, whether they were in combat or whether they worked on a truck, whether they were Active Duty, whether they were Reserve, whether they were in the National Every veteran should have access to mental health services during a crisis. We have to make it much simpler.  We heard a story tonight from Congressman Johnson, who talked about a veteran who was trying to get an appointment to get mental health services in the midst of a crisis, and the time was put off and put off and put off, and he finally got the appointment. And the Congressman was informed when he called the VA: Oh, we have good news; the appointment has been scheduled. The Congressman advised the VA that the veteran had already committed suicide.  So we have got a couple obligations, I believe. Number one is for those veterans who are currently utilizing VA services. We have to, as has been suggested by some of my colleagues, make sure we have the resources in place so that those veterans receive the services that they need on a timely basis, especially when they are in crisis, to make it as easy as possible for them to navigate the bureaucracy and get the help that they need.  Additionally, we need to make sure that those veterans who are not currently enrolled for veterans services and veterans benefits are made eligible for mental health services, certainly in crisis conditions, so that when someone reaches out to them, they are embraced with the loving arms of their country, as manifest in the VA, and they are brought in and cared for and helped to navigate through that crisis in their life.  There will be talk about how much it is going to cost. There will be a challenge as to whether or not we can afford to take care of these men and women who have served our country and are now facing this crisis in their life.  But I would guarantee you that any American in this country would say that we have to expend any cost for every veteran because there is no higher obligation in this Nation than taking care of the men and women who have worn our uniform, no greater obligation in this country. We can never forget the vet.  I want to thank Congresswoman Sinema for inviting me here tonight to talk about my bipartisan bill, H.2736, and for helping to bring attention[[Page H7573]]to this very serious crisis in our country.

343,topic-id,424,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to support H.3819, which reauthorizes several essential veterans' programs that support the men and women who have served our These programs include assistance and support services for caregivers who so often make profound sacrifices to support their loved ones, grants to our vital veterans service organizations so they can continue providing transportation for rural veterans to help connect them with the services they need, and programs to reintegrate homeless veterans which offer opportunities for meaningful employment and address the complex challenges they face.  This bill reauthorizes specialized counseling for women veterans. This is particularly important in light of the stunning VA report released this month which showed that female veterans are six times more likely to die by suicide than any other women.  These programs are fundamental to the well-being of our veterans and their families, and they are a reflection of our gratitude to those who serve.  In addition, this legislation makes important technical changes that will allow us to follow through on the promises of the new GI Bill, which we passed unanimously earlier this year. Specifically, H.3819 allows us to correct the perverse incentives that discourage veterans from attending local community colleges and universities, which is a provision I worked on with my Republican colleague, Congressman Paul  It also allows for the restoration of benefits for veterans left stranded by the abrupt closure of for-profit colleges, which I championed with Republican Luke  After the closures of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, student veterans in my district and across the country were left with nontransferable credits, depleted benefits, and none of the job opportunities that they were promised.

878,topic-id,1051,"Mr.President, one of the Senate Republicans' most important priorities for the rest of this year is passing comprehensive tax reform. Why? Because comprehensive tax reform is perhaps the single most important thing we can do to get our economy back on the path to long-term health. Comprehensive tax reform done right will boost jobs. It will increase wages. It will provide much needed tax relief for middle-income taxpayers and families. It will help businesses reinvest in their operations, employees, and new products. And most importantly, it will help us achieve strong, consistent economic growth.  Over the past few weeks, leaders from the House, Senate, and White House have been meeting to develop the framework for the tax reform bill we will take up later this year. This morning, they unveiled that framework. The framework supports Republicans' five principles for tax reform: providing tax relief for the middle class; increasing wages, jobs, and economic growth;[[Page S6180]]keeping good-paying jobs here at home; increasing American competitiveness in the global economy; and simplifying the Tax  The framework released today emphasizes tax relief for the middle class.  First and foremost, we are going to ensure that working families receive a much needed increase in take-home pay. Right now, 50 percent of families are living paycheck to paycheck, while one-third of people across this country say they are just $400 away from a financial crisis. That is not acceptable.  Our tax reform plan will ensure that these families are no longer left behind. Our plan will increase the standard deduction, which will provide tax relief to those families who need it the most. It will also enhance the child tax credit, and I don't need to tell anyone that the important work of raising a family is getting more and more expensive. It is time for hard-working families to get a break with a larger child tax credit. Finally, we will be lowering the rates on middle-class families. By collapsing the seven income tax brackets to three, we will ensure that working families get to keep more of what they earn.  Second, our tax plan will increase wages, jobs, and economic growth by lowering taxes and improving cost recovery for American businesses and job creators. The framework released today lays out a goal of a 20-percent corporate tax rate. Right now, our corporate tax rate is the highest in the developed world. Our competitors pay an average rate of 22.5 percent, while U.companies face a 35-percent tax rate. That is a big problem. Our uncompetitive tax rate has driven companies to move their headquarters and jobs overseas and led to wage stagnation and a lack of opportunity for American workers. Lowering the corporate rate will create jobs and increase wages for working families across the country.  An equally important priority laid out in the framework is lower tax rates for small businesses, farms, and ranches. Like bigger businesses, small businesses--from partnerships to S corporations--currently face high tax rates, at times even exceeding those paid by large corporations. Lowering tax rates for these businesses and creating a new maximum passthrough rate will allow a business to reinvest more of its earnings in successful operations. In short, it will help these job creators thrive. The Republican tax plan will also allow for unprecedented expensing. Allowing small businesses to recover their costs more quickly will free up capital and allow them to grow and to create jobs.  The framework released today also shows how we are going to meet our goal of making America more competitive and keeping those good-paying jobs here at home. A key part of keeping good-paying jobs here at home is making the United States an attractive place to do business by reforming our outdated worldwide tax system. Having a worldwide tax system means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home as well as on some or all of the profit they make abroad, once they bring that money back to the United The problem with this is that American companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they too often end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits and at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no surprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, new jobs, and increased wages.  Between 1983 and 2003, when the U.tax rate was much more competitive with those of other countries, there were 29 corporate inversions where U.companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014, when other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and shifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions.  Our tax plan addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our outdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. By shifting to a territorial tax system here in the United States--a move, I might add, that is supported by Members of both parties--we will eliminate the double taxation that encourages companies to send their investments and their operations overseas. Combine that with a reduction in our high corporate tax rate, and we can provide a strong incentive for U.companies to invest their profits at home in American jobs and American workers instead of abroad.  We will also simplify our Tax Each year, Americans spend 2.6 billion hours filling out complicated individual tax forms. Not only is this a drag on our economy, it is an annual frustration and burden for hard-working families. The goal of our tax reform plan is to let American families complete their taxes on something as simple as a postcard.  Lower rates, fewer tax brackets, and a generally simplified code will end the complicated mess that too many families face every tax season.  We will continue to develop the details of this framework in the coming weeks as we work toward a final draft of our comprehensive tax reform bill. I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues in the Senate Finance Committee as we work to put our country on the path toward long-term economic health and the jobs, increased wages, and opportunities that come along with it.

Prior to becoming a Commissioner, Chairman Pai worked on telecommunications policy in both the public and private sectors, notably serving in the Senate as a staffer on the Judiciary Committee as well as in the general counsel's office at the  It is my belief that Mr.Pai's stellar career and communications policy, his integrity, and his tireless work ethic all serve him well as he continues to serve the FCC and guide the agency back to being a more collaborative and productive institution.  In just 9 months since becoming Chairman, Mr.Pai has made much needed reforms to improve transparency at the FCC and to improve the agency's processes. I am particularly heartened by Chairman Pai's efforts to treat his fellow Commissioners fairly by instituting the process of sharing documents with other Commissioners before discussing them publicly.  Additionally, under Chairman Pai's leadership, the public is now able to view the text of all agenda items in advance of Commission meetings. Also,[[Page S6207]]to better reflect the realities of today's competitive landscape, Chairman Pai has announced the creation of an Office of Economics and Data to provide cost-benefit analyses to better inform the FCC's work.  These measures are a significant step forward from the last Chairman's leadership style, which I frequently criticized as being hyperpartisan and warned would lead to counterproductive outcomes over the long term. That is why, a little over a year ago, I felt compelled to stand in this same spot and to strongly criticize the previous Chairman of the FCC for leading the Commission with unprecedented partisan zeal. At that time, I noted that the voting record for open meetings at the Commission showed a long history of consensus-building with the previous five permanent FCC Chairmen combining for only 14 party-line votes at open meetings during their tenures. However, this all changed under Chairman Wheeler as he pursued a highly partisan agenda, driven by ideological beliefs more than by a sober reading of the law. Chairman Wheeler forced 3-to-2 votes on a party-line basis a total of 31 times. To put it another way, in 3 years under Chairman Wheeler, the FCC saw over twice as many partisan votes than in the previous 20 years combined.  While partisan differences are sometimes inevitable, what were once very rare events have become standard operating procedure at the This extreme partisanship was used to do the following things: a complete upending of how the internet is regulated, creating years of uncertainty for everyone; stripping important consumer protection responsibilities from the Federal Trade Commission; a failed attempt to override States' rights on municipal broadband and a power grab that was overturned by the courts; increasing the size of the Universal Service Fund by billions of dollars by simultaneously undermining bipartisan efforts to improve the program's accountability; the unnecessary and possibly unlawful disclosure of trade secrets and a plan to have the FCC and its Media Bureau design and dictate the future of television ads.  I was not alone in noticing Chairman Wheeler's overreach. On several occasions other Federal agencies refused to support his actions. The Copyright Office strongly criticized a proposal for set-top boxes. The staff at the Federal Trade Commission called the FCC's privacy rules ``not optimal,'' which is bureaucrat speak for really bad. The Obama administration's Department of Justice refused to defend the FCC's unlawful action on municipal broadband.  With respect to internet regulations, I am pleased that Chairman Pai has sought to hit the reset button on the 2015 title II order because, as I have previously said, the FCC should do what is necessary to rebalance the agency's regulatory posture under current law. I continue to believe, however, that the best way to provide long-term protections for the internet is for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation.  Two and a half years ago, I put forward legislative principles and a draft bill to begin the conversation, and I continue to stand ready and willing today to work toward finding a lasting legislative solution that will resolve the dispute over net neutrality once and for all.  Thankfully, the net neutrality debate has not distracted the FCC from important work in other areas. For instance, the FCC's proposed rulemaking on robocalls is a positive step in the right direction. The government must do everything we can to protect consumers from those who are truly bad actors, but we also must be sure that the government's rules are not unfairly punishing legitimate callers who are not acting maliciously. The FCC's notice of inquiry will give that conversation a much needed jump-start.  Furthermore, Chairman Pai's focus on the expansion of rural broadband and acceleration of next-generation infrastructure deployment will help close the digital divide--a goal that we all share. He has also worked tirelessly to help ensure communications services are restored to the communities affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Given the FCC's importance to the future of our economy and our society, it is important for the Commission to seek opportunities for common ground. In the past, people used to say that communications policy was not particularly partisan and that both sides of the aisle could often find common ground to work together. Well, times have changed, and the debate on this nomination is another example of that.  I know that agreement is not always possible. Nevertheless, as a corrective to the Commission's recent history, I urged Chairman Pai at his confirmation hearing to treat all Commissioners fairly, to respect the law, to be willing to ask Congress for guidance, and to seek consensus whenever and wherever possible. I believe doing so will improve the agency's credibility and will result in actions that are more likely to endure, and I believe that Chairman Pai will do these things.  As I noted at the outset, Chairman Pai has already made much needed reforms to improve the processes at the FCC and to empower his fellow He has already shown a commitment to ensuring transparency and openness at the Commission, which gives me great confidence in the direction that he will lead the agency. Chairman Pai's new approach, I believe, will lead to more long-lasting and positive results at the That is why I believe the elevation of Ajit Pai to be the Chairman of the Commission is a much needed breath of fresh air, and why I believe he should be confirmed promptly and without further delay.  So I urge my colleagues to support this nomination.  I yield the floor.

129,topic-id,1094,"Mr.President, I was presiding when the colloquy started with my colleagues here to talk about tax reform. I had not intended to speak today, and I am sure my staffers are scrambling, wondering what the boss will say. I want to weigh in with this discussion mainly because of the personal perspective of a leader who has seen the positive impacts of having the courage, focus, and discipline to deliver on tax reform.  Back in 2011, I was in my third term. Republicans had the majority, and I became speaker of the house. When I came in February of 2011, it was reported to me that we had a $2.5 billion structural deficit. We had the fourth highest unemployment rate in the Nation and we had 6 months to figure out how to balance the budget. So it was counterintuitive to a lot of people that we would spend time on regulatory reform and tax reform--particularly tax reform--reducing the amount of revenue coming in at the same time we were in a deficit ourselves. But in the first 6 months that we were in the majority, we cut the sales tax. Then we went over a 2-year period, even with that $2.5 billion structural deficit, to make the changes in the corporate tax and the income tax. It took North Carolina from the 44th most taxed State--in other words, there were only 5 States ahead of us for the highest tax burden in the United States--now down to 12. It was one of the worst growing economies, and it now ranks in the top five in the Nation, and it is one of the fastest growing economies in the[[Page S6175]]We created over 250,000 jobs and actually put North Carolina on the map by all references--CEO measures and by independent organizations. It is the State where businesses want to set up and do business.  We took the corporate tax from 6.9 down to 2.5. We took personal income tax rates from 7.75 down to 5.49. We got people back to work.  Along the way, we had our challenges. Everybody in Washington is for tax reform. They are for tax relief. They will come into your office and tell you: Let's get her going. Then on the side they will say: except for that one righteous exemption I may need. We have to have Members who have the courage to do tax reform that helps working families, that creates jobs, and that silences the people who want to take this exemption or that exemption away, so we do what is right for the generation that is about to look for jobs and the people who need a job today.  They want their businesses to grow. They want their economies to thrive. They want the United States to be the strong, great economy that it can be. It is going to take courage. It is going to take discipline. It is going to take time--but only so much time.  I believe this Congress, this Senate, over the course of a few months, if we focus on it and with the support of the President and in collaboration with the House, can get this done. We have to get it done. We promised the American people last year that if we had majorities, we would do what we had to do to deliver on this promise. It can be done. A lot of times, people ask me what keeps me up at night. I tell them two things: coffee and the national debt. Coffee is for the obvious reasons, but why the national debt? I will tell you why. Because when I have people on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the service chiefs come into the Senate Armed Services Committee and say the single greatest threat to our national security is our debt, we should take notice. These are people who are skilled in warfare. They are people who know how to take the fight to the enemy. When they think the greatest threat to this Nation is our national debt, we had better take that seriously.  How do you resolve the national debt? You grow the economy. How do you grow the economy? You create jobs and help businesses throughout. How do you do that? You do that through tax reform. You also take criticism that is going to be waged by some people on the far left when we talk about corporate tax reform. They are going to say: How could you favor the big guy over the little guy? I don't know about you all, but I worked for companies before in my life. When I was 19 and living in a trailer park, I was working for a corporation. I was a little guy working for that corporation. Fortunately, in the 1980s, we had a President who had the wisdom to know that, if you reduced the tax burden on corporations, more little guys like me--that 19-year-old living in a trailer park--could get a job--a better-paying job--and, ultimately, have enough money to put himself through school.  So when we get into this argument, don't take the bait by some people who will say that because we are focusing on corporate taxes and reducing the tax burden on businesses, that is somehow a guy in a suit trying to help out a business. That is a guy who has worked his way from that trailer park now into the U.Senate and benefited when Congress had the courage to reduce taxes and get the economy back on track. That is what we better do. That is what we promised. That is what we are here to do today. The time is now to get it done.  The President has shown wisdom in the blueprint--and our leadership here, in terms of the broad strokes about what tax reform needs to look like. Now it is our job--each and every individual Member of the Senate and the House--to deliver on the promise to produce tax reform to help the little guy and to get this economy going to be the great economy that it has been in the past, and I have every reason to believe that it will be so in the future.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Toomey).

760,topic-id,1504,"Thank you, Mr.President, for your recognition.  I rise today with my colleagues from the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Heitkamp and Senator Cortez Masto, to talk about how the Republicans' latest and most heartless healthcare bill hurts American Indians and Alaska  I have just heard some good news that this bill might not be brought up for a vote this week, but Republicans insist that they will continue their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and raid the Medicaid expansion program, which will devastate Indian So this latest withdrawal is great, but they are saying that it is not going away. So we have to maintain vigilance on this issue.  We came together before, in July, when Republicans' Better Care Reconciliation Act threatened to roll back healthcare for Native communities. With that bill's defeat, we hoped the debate over legislation that jeopardized healthcare for Native communities was behind us, and we hoped we could begin to work in earnest in a bipartisan way to address the real healthcare problems that Americans face.  Given this new threat, my Indian Affairs Committee colleagues and I must remind this Chamber, once again, that the Federal Government bears a solemn trust, treaty responsibility, and obligation to ensure that Native Americans receive quality healthcare. Each version of the Republican repeal we have seen so far violates that trust responsibility by taking healthcare away from hundreds of thousands of Native Americans and abdicating the Federal Government's Native healthcare responsibilities. If any of these proposals pass, Native Americans' health and lives will be in danger. These efforts must be stopped.  Everyone familiar with Indian Country knows that the Indian Health Service is severely underfunded. ``Don't get sick after June'' was a familiar refrain on many reservations, pueblos, and villages. Limited funding meant medical services were often rationed to only emergency care or life and limb. IHS patients were not guaranteed access to comprehensive medical services, specialized services, or preventive care.  The Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion changed this equation and changed it dramatically. The ACA alone has increased third-party billing revenues to IHS more than 25 percent, and Medicaid funding for IHS has increased nearly 50 percent. Tribal and urban health facilities have been able to move away from healthcare rationing.  Medicaid expansion has provided health insurance to an additional 290,000 Native Americans from 492 Tribes--almost 90 percent of all This includes 45,600 Tribal members from my home State of New  Uninsured rates in Indian Country have decreased from 53 percent to 39 percent, and many Tribal communities' uninsured rates are even lower. At the Santa Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico, 22 percent of Kewa Pueblo Health Corporation's patients were uninsured in 2013. In 2016, the uninsured rate was down to 7 percent. At the IHS Sante Fe Service Unit in New Mexico, 84 percent of our patients now have some sort of insurance. On the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota, they have seen a 14-percent reduction in uninsured Tribal members. At the Portland Urban Indian Health Center, the rate of uninsured has gone from 56 percent to 8 percent, solely due to Medicaid expansion. This is impressive. Let me just say that again. It has gone from 56 percent uninsured to 8 percent.  Medicaid expansion has helped to make up for this historic underfunding in IHS services. Third-party billing revenue through Medicaid is now up to 35 percent of the Kewa Pueblo Health Corporation's total budget. For the Jicarilla Apache Tribe in New Mexico, Medicaid makes up more than 75 percent of their third-party billing revenue. At the Navajo Crownpoint IHS hospital, 50 percent of their budget comes from Medicaid third-party billing revenue. For Seattle's urban Indian health clinic, operated by the Seattle Indian Health Board, Medicaid and Medicare expansion have resulted in a revenue increase of 146 percent since 2012.  Medicaid expansion has allowed IHS to expand services and build new facilities. Kewa Pueblo Health Corporation has used some of its third-party billing to offer new specialty-care services, like obstetrics and podiatry, and to build new clinic space. Santa Fe IHS used its additional funds to build new examination rooms for Santa Clara Pueblo, establish a mobile health unit for San Felipe Pueblo, and update outpatient rooms at the main clinic in Santa The Seattle urban Indian clinic uses its additional revenue to expand patient services to include a pilot opioid addiction program.  In the words of the National Council on Urban Indian Health, Medicaid expansion has been an ``unqualified success.'' The ACA brought new hope to Native families and communities.  But this latest Republican plan will undo this success. Thank goodness it has been withdrawn. In that plan, they claim they will preserve Medicaid expansion eligibility rules for This offers a false hope.  Like most people on Medicaid, Tribal members go on and off the rolls as their income fluctuates. Proposals like Graham-Cassidy would require that they be continuously enrolled in Medicaid expansion and work to receive benefits. If not, they would be dropped permanently from the program.  Section 128 of Graham-Cassidy is also being pushed as helpful to Indian This section expands IHS's Federal reimbursement rate to non-Native providers, but really it is a veiled attempt to buy off State leaders concerned about massive cuts to the Medicaid It will not improve Tribal healthcare facilities. It will undercut the IHS, and it will undermine the Tribal self-determination by bypassing Tribal input in the Federal Medicaid reimbursement process.  There are 30,000 Native Americans who now have private individual health insurance thanks to the Every Republican plan so far strips away the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies and tax credits, which help make private insurance affordable for many of these Tribal members and for millions of working The Republican bill does nothing to help these Native Americans keep their health insurance.  The sponsors can try to dress this bill up, but the glaring reality is that TrumpCare 2.0 would be terrible for Indian In fact, it is worse for Tribes than any other proposed repeal plan so far.  It is no surprise that prominent Native organizations--the National Indian Health Board, the National Congress of American Indians, and the National Council of Urban Indian Health--oppose Graham-Cassidy and proposals like it. They join virtually all major patient advocate organizations and medical organizations in their opposition, including the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Medical  Eighty percent of the American people disapprove of the Republicans' attempts to undermine healthcare. Graham-Cassidy is woefully out of touch with the American people and, especially, with Indian I am glad this bill will not receive a vote this week.  Just like tens of millions of our fellow Americans, Tribes, Tribal organizations, and individual Native Americans all around the country are worried about what Republicans will do to their healthcare. I have received a record 15,000 calls, emails, and letters from constituents about healthcare this year. Almost all of them have been[[Page S6116]]opposed to the Republicans' relentless attacks on healthcare, and not a single Tribe has reached out to my office in support of this bill.  These attacks are happening behind closed doors. There was only one rushed hearing, and it was yesterday. There is no formal Congressional Budget Office analysis, and there has been no meaningful consultation with Although many of us have called for that, there has been no consultation. It is difficult to adequately describe the recklessness, cruelty, and cynicism in the Republicans' rush to tear down the  The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee started a bipartisan effort to address the real healthcare needs in this country, but Republicans froze it once Graham-Cassidy was introduced. I am really hoping now that Chairman Lamar Alexander and Vice Chairman Patty Murray can get back to the bipartisan work that needs to be done. Other time-sensitive legislation with broad, bipartisan support--like reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which need to be enacted before the end of September--was pushed aside.  Congress needs to change focus. We need to work across the aisle to meet the needs of the American people, and we need to improve Native American healthcare. We have come a long way under the Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion, but we are far from being able to declare victory. I echo our colleague from Arizona, Senator Given the enormous impact of healthcare on the lives of Americans and our economy, we need to find bipartisan solutions through the regular order.

763,topic-id,420,"I say to Senator Cortez Masto, thank you so much. Thank you for bringing the statements forward from Chairwoman She has every right to be concerned.  The short answer to her question is, yes, we don't want to go back. Chairwoman Torres is right to be concerned. Tribal leaders across the country want to know how this bill would impact their members, but, as Senator Heitkamp highlighted, Republican leadership has not engaged in any meaningful Tribal consultation.  I know that is something that concerns you a lot. Working with you on our committee, you always raise that issue--Tribal consultation and how important that is. That did not occur before these proposals were put before us.  Repeal of the Medicaid expansion would pull millions of dollars out of critical funding at the Indian Health Service and would return the entire system to life or limb. Medicaid funding at IHS has increased by over $240 million since the Affordable Care Act passage, and that is an increase of 43 percent.  Under the ACA, Tribes and urban Indian health facilities have started offering a much wider range of healthcare services to Native Americans, such as OB-GYN, podiatry, and behavioral health.  I have mentioned the old official IHS motto several times: ``Don't get sick after June.'' This was a motto because the Indian Health Service would run out of money after So what people would say with regard to their healthcare in Indian Country is ``Don't get sick after June''--a pretty outrageous situation. In practical terms, that motto translated to exactly the sort of healthcare rationing Chairwoman Torres described in her letter.  Imagine living in that sort of healthcare system, where diabetics are told that help is only available once their kidneys start to shut down, where expectant mothers can't access prenatal care.  The reality is that Graham-Cassidy--and we hope another proposal doesn't come forward like Graham-Cassidy; we know they buried that today--would turn back the clock in Indian Country, taking us from this current era of Tribal healthcare innovation back to the days of life and limb.

They do not need legislative lip service passed just so that the majority can claim they are helping. Instead of taking real and meaningful steps to provide much-needed relief for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, this bill ignores the challenges they face.  Providing personal casualty assistance and penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts is commendable, but not for Puerto Just under half the island is living in poverty, and the average median income is under $20,000. In fact, 67 percent of workers have no money left to save for retirement after paying bills, and only one in five workers is contributing to retirement savings.  So I ask you, what savings will they pull from, and how and when will this happen? American citizens in Puerto Rico cannot even get cash out of an ATM without waiting hours in line. Providing funds based on the assessed value of those provisions for Puerto Rico is insufficient. It is a fig leaf offered by Republicans so that they can check it off their list.  In order to truly help the many victims affected by the hurricanes, Congress needs to start by providing the economic support required to recover.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We intend for this resolution to raise awareness within and outside of Congress about Southeast Asia's critical role in the global order. Southeast Asia has tremendous cultural, political, historical, and religious diversity.  The Association of South East Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, was formed in 1967, in part, to create a bulwark against communism in the region among the five founding nations.  Today, ASEAN's goals have evolved, and the region is experiencing tremendous growth. ASEAN now includes 10 major countries in Southeast Asia, which together have established a major regional economic integration agenda.  ASEAN is our fourth largest goods exports market. $102 billion of U.goods and services are exported to ASEAN, meaning this market rivals our $113 billion market in  According to the ASEAN Matters for America report, 20 U.States send over $1 billion in goods exports to ASEAN annually, and over half of the U.congressional districts export over $100 million to ASEAN each year.

Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of the Increasing Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents Through Evidence-Based Home Visiting In my home State of Indiana, three of the nine counties eligible for MIECHV funds are in my district.  In April, I had the pleasure of visiting with Healthy Families Joseph County to hear firsthand the good work they are doing in Indiana's Second I heard from a single mom who had no job, no place to live, and very little money when she gave birth to her son; but with the help of Healthy Families, she turned long odds into success. The mother gained confidence to raise her son, and her son gained a shot at a thriving life that he may not have had without this program.  Home visitors helped over 2,600 Hoosier families in situations like this in Indiana last year.  MIECHV is a program that gets results. It works. We know this because of the statistics, but we hear it in the stories that they share with us. Parents get the tools and the confidence they need to raise their children. This improves outcomes for their children in the really early critical years and sets them on a better path as they grow up. The program helps to root out deeper issues like drug abuse and domestic violence that destroy families and hinder a child's development.  If there is one thing I have learned as I have heard from people in my district who successfully broke the cycle of poverty, it is this: It is one thing to provide money, but if that money comes on a one-size-fits-all basis, people cannot break the cycle. Checking a box doesn't break the cycle. Human interaction, looking at each person as an individual and not just a number, resolving underlying issues unique to each person's situation, and having a person coming alongside, saying, ``I am with you; let's do this together'' breaks the cycle. MIECHV is a great example of a program that does this.  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgH7506-2.txt,2128,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,26.0,September

Included in this bill are provisions related to their healthcare, their benefits, homeless veterans, and other related issues.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to support extending programs related to the support for caregivers, childcare for certain veterans receiving healthcare, and the pilot program on counseling in retreat settings for women veterans newly separated from service.  It also has provisions to extend the authority related to rehabilitation and vocational benefits to members of our Armed Forces with severe injuries or illnesses, homeless veterans reintegration programs, homeless women veterans, and homeless veterans with children, and providing housing assistance and counseling to homeless and at-risk veterans.  Also included are extensions of authority for programs to help disabled veterans as well as authority to enter into agreements with the National Academy of Sciences to review the research on links between diseases and dioxin exposure. This is a critical step in creating any new Agent Orange presumptions that still may be there. Both of these provisions are critical in helping our aging Vietnam veterans as well, as we move forward.

303,topic-id,1783,"Mr.President, our economy is in trouble. In markets all across our economy, a few giant corporations hold all the power. It is everywhere. Four airlines control over 80 percent of all domestic airline seats in Five health insurance giants own over 80 percent of the health insurance market. Four companies dominate over 80 percent of the beef market. Three drugstore chains control almost all retail pharmacies in the country. Two companies sell more than 70 percent of the beer in  As competition has been snuffed out in industry after industry, big corporations have made out like bandits, and everyone else has paid the price. How do we pay? American families shell out more for lower quality goods. Small businesses find it harder and harder to compete against the big guys. Innovators and entrepreneurs struggle to promote new ideas that can change the world. Income inequality has left more American families struggling to make ends meet as the top 1 percent has grown even richer and richer. As fewer companies have seized more economic power, they have translated their economic muscle into political power--power they can use to elect the politicians they like, get the kinds of laws and policies they like, and run up even more economic power.  It is a nasty, self-perpetuating cycle, and it is exactly why Congress created antitrust laws over a century ago. Back then, like today, a few powerful companies were stifling competition in markets all across the economy and gaining extraordinary political power. Congress decided to create laws to break up trusts and protect competition.  Today the Justice Department's Antitrust Division is charged with protecting competition by blocking anti-competitive mergers and going after companies that engage in illegal conduct. For decades, though, antitrust enforcers have put their tools on the shelf instead of aggressively enforcing our antitrust laws, they have given the green light to megamerger after megamerger and allowed big corporations to misuse this power without a peep.  That problem is set to get worse in the Trump administration. Since taking office, President Trump has loaded his administration with a Who's Who of former lobbyists, Wall Street insiders, and corporate executives committed to tilting the scales even further in favor of his powerful friends and against American families.  Now, President Trump has nominated someone to head the Justice Department's Antitrust His nominee, Makan Delrahim, will be in charge of determining whether there is someone to stand up for competition or let the big guys just get bigger and more powerful. Unfortunately, Mr.Delrahim's approach to antitrust enforcement is based on a hands-off economic theory that just leaves big corporations to do pretty much whatever they want to do. Case in point, just last year, when asked what he thought about the proposed merger of AT&T-Time Warner--a merger that would combine two of the most powerful companies in media--Mr.Delrahim said he didn't think it was a ``major antitrust problem.''  Mr.Delrahim spent over a decade working to convince government officials that other megamergers weren't antitrust problems. During the airline merger wave that left us with only four major carriers, Mr.Delrahim was lobbying the government to approve a merger between US Airways and Despite the fact that there are only a few large retail pharmacies, he lobbied to get government approval for CVS's proposed takeover of Even though only five health insurers control the vast majority of the health insurance market, he tried to convince government regulators to approve Anthem's unsuccessful attempt to merge with  Now he wants to take a spin through the revolving door and regulate the industries he worked to make even less competitive. For the giant corporations, wealthy individuals who want to amass more power and profits for themselves, Mr.Delrahim is a dream candidate, but he is also a dream candidate for President President Trump has not been shy about his willingness to use his power against individuals or companies he doesn't like, and he has made it clear that he expects his agency heads to carry out his orders.  Mr.Delrahim has been a loyal supporter of President Trump's since the campaign. He urged fellow Republicans to support President Trump because he correctly believed President Trump would appoint a pro-corporate Justice to the Supreme He also served as legal counsel to President Trump after he was sworn in and as the President reversed rules that made it easier for families to pay their mortgages or reversed rules to prevent people with serious mental illnesses from buying guns or reversed rules to stop companies from dumping toxic waste into water. As head of the Antitrust Division, Mr.Delrahim will be in a position to make even more harmful decisions.  It is no secret that Americans don't trust They see politicians who care more about catering to corporate donors than fighting for the interests of hard-working people who are trying to figure out how to pay the bills and build a little security in their own lives. It is a real problem, but it is a problem we can solve. We can begin to solve it by fighting the economic concentration that is putting more money and more power into the hands of a few giant corporations. That means choosing enforcers who will hold companies accountable when they break the rules, and that means rejecting nominees like Makan                           Tarbert Nomination  Mr.President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Heath Tarbert, who has been nominated by President Trump to be the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and If confirmed, Mr.Tarbert will be in charge of the Treasury Department's role on a multi-agency body called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, which reviews whether foreign acquisitions of a U.company would pose a threat to our national security and then makes recommendations to the President on whether the President should block the transaction.  This is not about whether foreign investment benefits our economy. Of course it does. The United States is the third largest recipient of foreign direct investment, and our markets attract the world's best talent and capital. Going back to the 1990s, only four foreign acquisitions of American companies have ever been blocked by a President based on a recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United This is about whether our national security is put at risk when foreign governments, foreign state-owned enterprises, and foreign investors acquire our companies and assets. This is also about foreign governments and the companies they own,[[Page S6178]]trying to gain access to sensitive technologies that are important to our military and our national security.  The risk posed to the security of the United States is real. I want you to consider just one example here. According to a news report last year, an internal Pentagon report found that China was making significant targeted investments in cutting-edge American startups, with expertise in areas like autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and robotics. These can be transactions that don't necessarily result in foreign control over one of our companies, but they can give a foreign adversary access to technologies that could harm our strategic interests and erode our military advantage.  The risk is significant, but unfortunately CFIUS does not apply to these transactions. The problem is, CFIUS was created back in 1975. Since then, both technology and the nature of foreign acquisitions, mergers, and takeovers have changed substantially. The nature of the threats we face has also changed substantially. Our top military leaders--such as the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs--believe that CFIUS needs to be updated to fully address them, and I agree.  Another concern is that CFIUS does not focus enough on whether the benefits of foreign acquisition outweigh the costs when it comes to the competitiveness of American workers. While I recognize that CFIUS has historically focused on the national security impacts of foreign investment, I think Congress should consider elevating the Department of Labor to the group of agencies that are currently part of the core CFIUS review process. If we believe economic security and national security are intertwined, then I think we can both look out for the American worker and review the national security threats posed by foreign acquisitions.  Finally, the ethics problems that are everywhere in this administration come forward again in the area of national security. We all know President Trump, his family members, and other Trump administration officials have business ties in the United States and throughout the world, even if we don't know the full extent of President Trump's business ties because he will not release his tax returns.  Imagine a Trump administration official who has a financial stake in an American company, a foreign state-owned company or both. Now imagine that a foreign company backed by China, Russia, or another foreign adversary tries to acquire a U.company and a Trump official suddenly has financial ties to that transaction and then that transaction triggers a CFIUS review for national security concerns. If that scenario were to occur, I am deeply concerned about the conflicts of interests that could emerge. I would expect CFIUS to vigorously review such an investment as it affects our national security.  I raised all of these issues with Mr.Tarbert when I met with him today and his answers improved from when I asked him about these issues earlier this year, but I remain concerned about his commitment to modernize CFIUS and to ensure that CFIUS does more to consider the impact of foreign acquisitions on American workers. I hope I am wrong, but I still have concerns about his nomination, which is why I will vote against it.  Mr.Tarbert promised me that if confirmed, he would work to ensure that no transaction is approved by CFIUS if national security concerns remain unresolved, and that is encouraging to hear. If he is ultimately confirmed, I will use my position in the Senate Banking Committee to hold him to that promise because the threats we face are growing in complexity, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States must be ready to confront them. We don't want to wake up one day and discover that our adversaries have access to key components of our national security technology because Congress and the White House were asleep at the wheel.  If confirmed, I will work in good faith with Mr.Tarbert to ensure that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is updated so it is in the strongest position to protect our national security--both from the threats we face today and the threats we will face in the future.

737,topic-id,952,"Mr.President, today we are voting on the nomination of William Emanuel to serve on the National Labor Relations The NLRB may be one of the most important independent Federal agencies that you have never heard of. They are responsible for protecting the lawful rights of workers to come together and bargain with their bosses for higher wages and better working conditions.  Starting a union is not an easy task. Often, it is a large corporation against its own employees. The money and the ability to threaten retaliation are heavily weighted on the corporate side.  For more than a century, many corporations fought unions tooth and nail, hiring strikebreakers and union-busting thugs and, later on, union-busting lawyers. So back in the 1930s, Congress established the NLRB to act as a referee and to keep the playing field level so that workers would have a chance to form a union if they wanted to.  President Trump picked William Emanuel to fill a vacancy on the Mr.Emanuel has over 40 years of experience practicing labor and employment law. He has represented manufacturing companies, trade associations, logistics companies, hospitals, and dozens of other giant companies involved in labor disputes. He has represented big companies like Nissan, FedEx, Rite Aid, Safeway and That is an impressive resume. There is just one problem with it: In his more than four decades of practice, he has never been on the side of the workers--not once.  Every party to a dispute is entitled to legal representation, and Mr.Emanuel has every right to spend his career representing corporations, but a guy who has never even once represented workers should not serve on the NLRB, period.  The NLRB is not the Department of It is not the Chamber of It is not there to help pump up big corporations. When Congress created the NLRB, it gave it a simple mission: encourage collective bargaining. An individual who has spent his career working for some of the country's most ruthless union-busting firms, fighting off union efforts at every turn, has absolutely no business at the helm of an agency whose job is to encourage collective bargaining. The deck is already stacked against hard-working  For the last few decades, productivity has increased, corporations and shareholders have gotten richer, but workers haven't shared in that growth.[[Page S5880]]Hourly wages have been virtually flat for almost 35 years, and one reason for this is the decline of unions. The impact is everywhere.  Inequality has risen in Why? According to the Economic Policy Institute, the decline in unions accounts for about 20 percent to 30 percent of the growth in income inequality over the past several decades. When unions decline, all workers are hurt. For the more than 40 million non-union men working in the private sector, the loss of unions over the past 30 years has been equivalent to an annual wage loss of about $109 billion. It is no wonder that American families are feeling the squeeze.  The decline of unions isn't an accident. It didn't happen on its own or as the unexpected byproduct of some other event. Large corporations have called on their Republican buddies in local, State, and Federal governments, and they have launched a quiet but deadly attack on unions. Twenty-eight States have passed laws banning the collection of union dues from workers that the unions represent. The only purpose of these laws is to starve the unions of resources and make it harder for workers to join together and to stand up for themselves.  The Supreme Court hasn't been kind to unions either, effectively decimating the ability of home healthcare workers to join together in 2014. Now with a Republican-appointed majority on the Court, they are poised to deal the knockout blow to public sector unions later this term. And with the nomination of Mr.Emanuel, workers won't be able to count on the NLRB, either.  As a candidate, President Trump promised American workers that under a Trump Presidency, ``the American worker will finally have a president who will protect them and fight for them.'' He also promised to ``drain the swamp'' in Washington and fill his administration with those who would work for working Americans--not for donors and not for special interests.  When President Trump nominated Mr.Emanuel to serve at the highest labor court in the land, he delivered another gut punch to working people. In fact, Mr.Emanuel is the dream nominee for the donors and special interests. Trade associations for the companies that make their profits on the backs of low-wage workers immediately came out in support of his candidacy. The National Restaurant Association, the International Franchise Association, the National Retail Federation, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, the National Right to Work Committee, and the U.Chamber of Commerce applauded President Trump's pick with almost giddy enthusiasm and urged the Republican Senate to quickly confirm him to the Today, unless a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle decide to stand up for workers, they will get their wish.  We all know that Washington works great for the trade associations and their armies of lobbyists and lawyers, but it delivers one punch after another to the hard-working Americans who sent us to Washington to work for them. If Congress isn't going to stand up for workers, the very least we can do is give these workers a fighting chance to join together and stand up for themselves.  It is the NLRB's job to make sure that employees can join unions if they want to. That is the law. A man who has spent 40 years beating back workers' efforts to form unions has no business on the I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his nomination.

776,topic-id,2194,"Mr.President, Wells Fargo creates 3.5 million fake accounts, charging customers fees and ruining credit scores. Equifax lets hackers steal personal information on 143 million Americans, putting nearly 60 percent of American adults at risk of identity theft. What is the Republican Party's response? To take away your legal rights to hold companies like Wells Fargo and Equifax accountable.  I know that sounds nuts, but it is true. Here is the issue. If you have a checking account, a credit card, a private student loan, or any other number of financial products, there is a good chance that you have given up your right to go to court if this financial firm cheats you. That is because millions of financial contracts include a forced arbitration clause that says that, if you want to legally challenge something your financial company did to you, you can't join with other customers in court. You have to go to arbitration all by yourself.  Think about what that means in the real world. You wake up one morning, and you find a mysterious $30 fee on your account statement. You call the bank and say: Hey, I didn't agree to this. The bank tells you: Go pound sand. So what are your options?  Well, if there is no forced arbitration clause in your contract, you can join a class action lawsuit against the bank for free. Chances are you are not the only customer who got hit with an unauthorized $30 fee. A class action gives you a chance to get some of that money back, and, just as importantly, the bank might actually have to cough up some real money and think twice before hitting you and their other customers with hidden fees again.  Think what happens if there is a forced arbitration clause. You can't join with other customers in court. Your only option is to go out on your own and file an arbitration claim, which will cost you $200 or more just to get started. Who is going to pay $200 to get back a $30 fee? No one. And that is exactly what the banks are counting on. They can get away with nickel-and-diming you forever.  Earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau put a stop to that. They issued a new rule that prohibits financial companies from forcing you to give up your right to join in a class action. The rule guarantees your right to join other customers in court and to hold your bank accountable.  But Republicans in Congress are now coming after the rule. House Republicans have already voted to reverse the rule, and now Senate Republicans are gearing up to follow suit.  Make no mistake: Anyone who votes to reverse this rule is saying loud and clear that they side with the banks over their own constituents, because bank lobbyists are the only ones who are asking Congress to reverse this rule. Every other organization--all of those that represent actual human beings--want the rule to be saved.  Let me read from just a few. The Military Coalition, which represents more than 5.5 million veterans and servicemembers, supports the CFPB rule because ``our nation's veterans should not be deprived of the constitutional rights and freedoms that they put their lives on the line to protect, including the right to have their claims heard in a trial.'' The Coalition says, ``The catastrophic consequences these [forced arbitration] clauses pose for our all-voluntary military fighting force's morale and our national security are vital reasons'' to preserve the rule.  The AARP, which represents nearly 40 million American seniors, says that the CFPB rule should be preserved because it ``is a critical step in restoring consumers' access to legal remedies[[Page S6091]]that have been undermined by the widespread use of forced arbitration for many years.''  And the Main Street Alliance, which represents thousands of small businesses, says the CFPB rule will help small businesses fight against big financial firms that try to drive up their fees.  There it is: veterans, servicemembers, seniors, small businesses, consumers--all lining up to support the CFPB rule. But that is not all. Let Freedom Ring, which is an organization that proudly touts itself as ``supporting the conservative agenda'' likes the CFPB rule too. They say it is ``in keeping with our Framers' concerns that without appropriate protections, civil proceedings can be used as a means to oppress the powerless.''  That is the thing we have to understand. The effort to reverse the CFPB rule isn't about promoting a conservative agenda, and it sure as heck is not about promoting a working people's agenda. It is about advancing the donors' agenda, the big money agenda. That is it, period.  It is amazing. Not even a decade ago, the banks sparked a financial crisis that hurt millions of working families. And while the big banks got a taxpayer bailout and are back to doling out multimillion-dollar bonuses to their executives, a lot of working families are still struggling to recover.  Yet, here in Congress, the Republican Party is still carrying water for the big banks. The big banks say: The Republican Party asks: How high? The big banks tell Congress to take away their customers' rights to hold them accountable, and the Republican Party says: You bet. The big banks say: Take away those rights right now--right on the heels of Wells Fargo and Equifax sticking it to millions of customers. The Republican Party, without an ounce of shame, says: Yes, sir, just keep those donations coming.  The Republican Party will stop carrying water for the big banks only if you demand it. There are a lot of dollars on the other side, but your votes, your calls, your emails can make a real difference. Tell your Senators to stand up to the big banks and vote no on this resolution.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, over the past several weeks, families all over this country have raised their voices yet again. They have not given up, nor have they been shouted down, and they have made it very clear where they stand on the issue of healthcare.  The American people don't want tens of millions of people to lose their healthcare coverage. They don't want to open the door to insurance companies discriminating against people with preexisting conditions or eliminating addiction coverage or denying care for people with mental illness. They don't want to kick our grandmothers out of nursing homes or tell the parents of babies born prematurely that they are on their own to deal with a multimillion-dollar hospital bill. They don't want the Republican healthcare repeal bills--not any of the bills that have come before and not the latest version that was revealed this morning that is still as rotten to the core as every bill that has come before it.  Doctors and nurses don't want the Republican repeal. Neither do hospitals and insurance companies and nursing homes and Governors and State insurance commissioners.  But Senate Republicans plow ahead anyway. They are so desperate to destroy the Affordable Care Act that they keep yelling about how our healthcare system is in crisis, how it is imploding in front of our very eyes, trying to convince everyone that we need to blow the whole thing up in order to save it. But the thing is, while Republicans try to manufacture an imaginary healthcare crisis to justify their cruel repeal bill, there is a real crisis about to unfold--a crisis created by the  September 30 is the deadline for several healthcare provisions. If Congress doesn't act this week, Federal programs that help children, pregnant women, people in need of addiction treatment, veterans, Medicare beneficiaries, and other populations will run out of funding or just expire altogether. In many cases, Republicans and Democrats have bills stacked up, just waiting to get a vote, the agreements all hammered out. But instead of bringing those bills to the floor, the Republican leadership is fixated on repealing health insurance coverage. They insist on voting again on something that most of America doesn't want while they ignore the work on healthcare that needs to get done now. This is beyond stupid.  One of the most important programs that will be expiring is the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 9 million low-income children and pregnant women across this country. Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch wrote this legislation together back in the 1990s. Today, that program works with Medicaid to provide health insurance for one out of every three kids in this country, including foster children and kids with special health needs.  Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden--a Republican and a Democrat--have a bill ready to go to extend this program. Funding expires on September 30, but instead of holding a vote on that bill, Republicans want to spend this week trying to squeeze reluctant Senators to support the Graham-Cassidy bill, which contains permanent cuts to the Medicaid  Then there is the funding for community health centers, which provide high-quality, integrated care. In Massachusetts, our community health centers serve one in every seven residents. Our health centers are on the frontlines of the opioid epidemic. They are working to eradicate tuberculosis. They are improving nutritional health. They are taking the stigma out of mental health treatments. And they save money, promoting prevention and reducing the use of hospital emergency rooms.  Community health centers are a big part of what is working well in healthcare today--more coverage at lower cost. They work, but they are running out of time. Funding for community health centers runs out on September 30. Last week, 70 U.Senators--including 24 Republicans--signed a letter urging Congress to act to extend this funding. But instead of extending these funds, the Senate Republican leaders say: Too bad, we are too busy trying to knock millions of people out of healthcare coverage.  Then there is the funding for medical training at a special type of health center--teaching health centers. This program helps train primary care doctors. Greater Lawrence Family Health Center in Massachusetts was the very first community health center in the country to have a residency program like this. Almost 80 percent of their residents continue to work in underserved communities after they graduate--areas that often have a shortage of primary care physicians.  Funding for this program also runs out on September 30. Senator Collins and Senator Tester--a Republican and a Democrat--have a bill ready to go to extend funding for teaching health centers. But instead of holding a vote on that bill this week, Republicans have said: Sorry, we are too busy trying to take away healthcare coverage from the many people who walk through the doors of community health centers.  What else is at risk if Senate Republicans refuse to act before September 30? A whole package of Medicare Programs, which help seniors and people with disabilities access the care they need. In Massachusetts, this includes the SHINE Program, which helps Medicare beneficiaries pick the right health insurance plans.  Medicaid payments that go to hospitals treating large numbers of low-income patients are also going to run out.  Funds for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, which funds home visits to new and expectant parents to help give them the training they need and the help they need to keep a new baby healthy and safe, will run out. Senators Grassley and Menendez--a Republican and a Democrat--have a bipartisan bill ready to go. But instead of voting to help those new babies and their families, Republicans want us to vote on a bill to take away health insurance.  Let's not forget the bipartisan compromise that Senator Alexander and Senator Murray--a Republican and a Democrat--were working on to lower health insurance premiums. In order to keep insurance premiums down for millions of insurance plans, the bill has to[[Page S6092]]pass this week. But Republicans walked away from the table because it is more important to them to rip healthcare from millions of Americans than to lower healthcare costs for hard-working families across this country.  There is a whole list of concrete things that Republicans and Democrats could be working on together to improve healthcare in this country--healthcare for babies, for new moms, for seniors on Medicaid, for people with disabilities, and for every American who buys an ACA insurance plan. In fact, behind the scenes, Republicans and Democrats have already been working together on these programs. The bills are ready to go. They are drafted, they are printed up, and they are just waiting for a vote.  We are on the edge of a healthcare crisis. It is a healthcare crisis created by the Senate Republican leadership that insists that we burn time off the clock this week, voting on yet another effort to rip away people's health insurance.  The Senate has real work to do--work that could help millions of American families. It is time to drop this cruel effort to repeal healthcare and instead focus on making sure that important health programs don't run out of funds in the next few days. That is what the American people want to see us do.  Mr.President, I yield.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

123,topic-id,2041,"Mr.President, may I bid a public farewell to Emily Enderle, who is here with me and who has served as the lead on my very active and busy environment unit for quite some time now. She is going on to another role in Washington and will continue to serve our cause. She has done an amazing job, and I want to be sure to say that on what will be her last appearance on the floor with me for one of our ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches.                             Climate Change  Mr.President, I have spoken before, as you know, about the fossil fuel industry's persistent effort to undermine public understanding of climate change and to confuse people about the actual effects of carbon pollution on our atmosphere and oceans.  I have mentioned Drexel University Professor Robert Brulles' follow-the-money analysis, which reveals the complex network of organizations and funding--what we have called the web of denial--that is designed to obscure the fossil fuel industry's fingerprints and to perpetuate the fossil fuel industry's climate denial.  Brulle calls this ``a deliberate and organized effort to misdirect the public discussion and distort the public's understanding of climate.'' That is what this industry is up to.  One front group for that industry is called the Heartland It is a nice name, but they are not very nice people. For decades, the Heartland Institute has played a prominent role disseminating alternative facts and fake science at the behest of its industry funders. They have a long history of doing the bidding of industry funders. In the 1990s, it was teamed up with Philip Morris to challenge the facts about the health risks of tobacco. Using the same tactics--along with funding from the Koch Family Foundations, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests--it undermines public confidence in the established scientific consensus about climate change. Heartland is quite shameless in its methods, once sponsoring a billboard comparing those who accept the science of global warming to the  For my 180th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, I would like to explore the Heartland Institute's latest gambit, which is to airdrop climate denial propaganda directly into children's classrooms.  This spring, Heartland delivered packages to hundreds of thousands of K-12 and college-level science teachers across the country. These materials were designed to have a veneer of credibility. Each one was stamped with the headline ``Study: Science Teachers Giving Unbalanced Education on Climate Change.'' This intriguing story was attributed to something called Environment & Climate News.[[Page S6170]]  Inside the package, the teachers found a report titled ``Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming.'' It was issued by something called the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate As a bonus, each teacher also received a DVD copy of the ``History of Climate Change in Greenland,'' produced by Idea  A cover letter from Heartland's Center for Transforming Education--transforming education into propaganda, I assume is how that sentence gets finished--asks teachers to ``consider the possibility'' the science of climate change isn't settled.  That is the package they got. Let's look behind that veneer. When you do, the smell gets pretty rotten. It turns out that the Environment & Climate News is not actually news. It is not a news outlet. It is the monthly newsletter of, guess who, the Heartland They are citing themselves, masquerading their newsletter as a news outlet. The foolishness goes on.  Their featured article, ``Study: Science Teachers Giving Unbalanced Education on Climate Change'' was written by a person named Bonner Cohen, who is a featured expert--guess where--with the Heartland Institute, who previously held senior positions in--believe it or not--Philip Morris front groups.  Their Nongovernmental International Panel On Climate Change sounds like a well-known actual authority: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate The actual Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a United Nations-sanctioned, Nobel Prize-winning scientific body that reports the findings of thousands of climate scientists from hundreds of countries. The Heartland group--this so-called Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change--is a misleading decoy designed to mimic the real entity.  The three experts who wrote the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change report Heartland pushed out do not have degrees in climate change modeling, do not having degrees in climate science. All are paid by All their claims have been repeatedly debunked by real science.  There is one faint hint of accuracy in this propaganda publication Heartland put out. There actually is a PBS series called Idea However, the Idea Channel DVD in the Heartland packet has nothing to do with that series. It was actually produced by something called the Free To Choose Network, whose funding, like Heartland's, is linked to the fossil fuel industry. It is another masquerade designed to mislead.  One of the tricks of Heartland's little scheme was to dupe legitimate scientists into participating. One of the experts interviewed, Rie Oldenberg, the curator at Greenland's Narsaq Museum, was told she was participating in a video on Norse history for the Discovery When she found out what she had been duped into, she said: ``I am somewhat horrified.''  Other participants are frequent fliers in the climate denial circus, like Willie Soon, who received over a million dollars in funding since 2001 from the Koch brothers, the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil, and other fossil fuel interests. The year the video was released, Willie Soon received nearly $20,000 from Free To  The Heartland cover letter asked teachers to ``consider the possibility'' the science of climate change isn't settled. Even that is not new. This echoes the infamous Big Tobacco declaration, ``Doubt is our product.'' The heart of the fossil fuel industry's scheme is to undermine legitimate science with false doubts. Because of the financial stakes behind industry science denial and because of the communications advantages propaganda has over real science--you don't need to waste a lot of time in peer review, for instance, you go straight to the networks--this scheme is a real problem for institutions like our schools that cherish and support real science.  All this masquerade and subterfuge by Heartland Institute looked a lot like fraud. Senators Schatz, Warren, Markey, and I wrote to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to ask whether DeVos and her staff at the Department of Education helped or coordinated with the Heartland Institute on this scheme to pollute our classrooms with phony science.  That simple request drew quite the response from our friends at the Heartland ``Your letter is a monumental misuse of your office and a betrayal of the trust of your constituents,'' wrote Heartland CEO Joseph He called our letter ``defamatory'' and ``despicable.'' ``Shame, shame, shame,'' he proclaimed in bold font--this, unironically, from that same classy group that put up the billboard comparing anyone who accepts climate science to the Unabomber, just to give you an idea of their level of shame.  Even that little outburst is considerably nicer than in 2015 when Bast called some of us ``fascists'' and ``ethically challenged . . . mental midgets.''  Why is the Heartland Institute so very touchy? We obviously hit a nerve. The lesson is, poke an imposter and the imposter gets very agitated. Fortunately, teachers are smart people who follow real science. Imposters like Heartland that pretend their stuff is coming through an Idea Channel that it isn't, that mimic the name of real organizations to try to fool people, that pretend their newsletter is real news and package the whole thing up as if it is intended to be helpful to teachers face an uphill battle against informed educators.  One example, Nebraska recently approved new State standards requiring climate change to be taught in schools. According to the Omaha World-Herald, Nebraska's new standards ``challenge kids to think and act like scientists,'' which is exactly what our science classrooms ought to do.  One Omaha resident encouraged the school board to ``do the ethical thing and tell the next generation what's going on with climate.'' A science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln said the standards represented ``good solid science, good solid science education.''  This is what we need in science education--real-life scientists from real institutions of higher learning engaging and helping our children learn. What we don't need are fossil fuel front groups pumping out more phony science to pollute public education, just like they pollute our oceans and atmosphere.  I have been pretty heartened to hear about this from teachers working in classrooms in my home State of Rhode Holly Emery teaches science to seventh and eighth graders at Exeter-West Greenwich Junior High Her students focus on solutions to climate change--something we could use a bit more of around here. They examined Germany's plan to significantly reduce its carbon emissions. Students were so motivated by what they heard, they requested to share their projects with other grades in the school. One of Miss Emery's students said: ``This is important and the other kids need to know.''  Students in Jane Ramos's eighth grade science class at Gallagher Middle School in Smithfield learn about climates around the world. They read, research, and make slides about the human contributions to climate change, including the carbon cycle, burning fossil fuels and the greenhouse effect, deforestation, livestock practices, and the production of methane. They discuss the effects of warmer oceans, expansion of water, melting ice, and rising seawater levels. These are important issues for Rhode Island, the Ocean  Science students from Brenda Dillmann's class at South Kingstown High School planted grass on the Narrow River salt marsh as part of a major unit on climate. During the lessons, the students learned about the role that salt marshes play as carbon sinks--absorbent carbon from the atmosphere. They went out and got dirty and planted by hand some 35,000 seedlings of 3 different types of salt marsh grasses.  Since 2007, more than 500 students have become climate experts in Kara Ratigan and Renee Hadfield's fourth grade class at James Eldredge Elementary School in East Ratigan and Hadfield have developed a curriculum that integrates climate change across all subject areas. For the kids, the year begins with a visit to a local assisted living facility, where students pair up with a senior buddy. The students interview their senior buddies, asking how the climate has[[Page S6171]]changed over time and looking for lessons that can be applied today.  In their math class, students learn how to read charts and graphs and how to frame a convincing argument through data. In social studies, the students learn about the regions of the United States, about their differing climates, and about how each is affected by climate change. In science, the students learn about erosion and weather patterns and the effects of human activity on rock, soils, and sediments. Students make observations about climate change all around them and delve into society's responses to the harms of climate change.  This past spring, the Norman Bird Sanctuary, in Middletown, hosted seventh graders for a beach ecology lesson at nearby Third The director of education, Rachel Holbert, and her staff led a discussion with the students about the greenhouse effect associated with burning fossil fuels. They explained how the excess heat trapped in the atmosphere puts stress on the oceans, undermining the oceans' ability to stabilize the global climate and, of course, leading, as we have seen, to a higher frequency and strength of extreme weather events, such as powerful hurricanes. The kids' lesson ended with a focus on solutions. If the oceans are the heart and lungs of the climate, what can prevent future damage?  Teachers like them play such an important and formative role in helping the next generation understand the world we live in. They teach our children to make observations, collect information, and use evidence to formulate conclusions. They are honest and they are decent.  The fossil fuel industry, on the other hand, is neither honest nor decent. The filthy hand of the fossil fuel industry has, regrettably, a firm grip on this There is a reason that we never do anything about climate change, and it does not involve the merits of the issue. It involves the politics of the industry. We have, perhaps, not yet plumbed the bottom of how low they are willing to go, but, surely, this is a new low to reach with their game of phony science, masquerade, and subterfuge into our children's classrooms, like ",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgS6159-7.txt,1823,RECOGNIZING THAT FOR 50 YEARS THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTH EAST ASIAN,2017.0,27.0,September

212,topic-id,358,"Mr.President, today I am introducing a set of three bills that will lower the cost of energy storage, increase flexibility in the power grid, and create a comprehensive set of grant programs to advance development of renewable energy technologies throughout the country.  Currently, many energy technologies--like energy storage--compete in unfair markets, making it hard for new innovations to measure up to more established technologies like those of the fossil fuel industry. Congress and the Department of Energy can work hand-in-hand with industry to level the playing field, using a fair, tech-neutral approach when updating the electricity system, to benefit the American consumer.  My Reducing the Cost of Energy Storage Act will provide funding to the Department of Energy to research and develop ways to lower the cost of energy storage technologies. Ultimately, this bill will make it possible for renewable energy to be used on a more reliable and affordable basis.  To protect the power supply from disruptions caused by natural disasters, which can wipe out power to millions of homes, my Flexible Grid Infrastructure Act will require the Department of Energy to find and develop ways to make the power grid more flexible and responsive to these challenges. The bill will also connect displaced workers to training programs that will allow them to transition to high-skill clean energy jobs. Finally, this bill will provide states and utilities with resources to upgrade the flexibility and reliability of the power grid.  In order to ensure private sector growth in distributed energy technologies, my Distributed Energy Demonstration Act will create competitive, cost-share grant programs for new small-scale, grid-connected projects such as rooftop solar panels, hot water heaters, electric vehicles and modernized utility pricing technologies.  Together, or apart, these bills will promote a more flexible electricity grid that can respond to power disruptions from natural disasters and ensure reliable, low-cost electricity for consumers now and in the future. They will also lower costs for energy storage technologies that make renewable energy more reliable and cost-effective, boost funding for cutting-edge research and reward state and private sector innovations, which will make renewable energy more reliable and affordable for U.energy consumers.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-09-27-pt1-PgS6188.txt,1247,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018--MOTION TO,2017.0,27.0,September
419,topic-id,2282,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the President's nomination of Ajit Pai to head the Federal Communications  My view is that, Mr.Pai will do an enormous amount of damage to one of the foundational principles of the internet--net neutrality. I am going to outline why that would be a horrendous mistake for our country.  After we came to use the internet and see what an extraordinary asset it would be to our country, really beginning in the late 1990s, and early 2000s, we laid out what I still consider to be the legal foundation for the internet.  On a bipartisan basis, there was a big effort in the Senate and the House to really lay out what were the foundational principles of the net, and there were a variety of them. We wanted to make sure that folks were not hit with multiple and discriminatory taxes, and that they were not taxed on access to the internet. We wrote the digital signatures act, which is of enormous benefit to people, for example, in the Presiding Officer's home State of Nevada, where they are making business transactions. We made a judgment, which some have said has led to $1 trillion worth of private wealth for our economy, whereby we said that we were not going to expose the small entrepreneur--the person who is getting started in the garage--to needless litigation.  One of those core principles was net neutrality, which, in my view, for the reasons that I am going to describe this morning, I think Mr.Pai would work long and hard to try to undermine.  Because so much of the telecommunications debate sounds like a lot of complicated lingo, I want to try to describe in something resembling English what ``net neutrality'' is. Essentially, ``net neutrality'' means that after you have paid your internet access fee, you get to go where you want, when you want, and how you want. In a sentence, that is what net neutrality is all about, and it is a bedrock principle for internet users in the Presiding Officer's home State of Nevada and in Oregon and all across the country.  It locks in equal treatment to accessing the internet.  We are not going to have some kind of information aristocracy in our society whereby the affluent have access to some kind of technological treasure trove, and folks who do not have much are kind of stuck with what almost resembles dial-up. That is not what we want for communications policy in We want to give everybody a chance to get ahead so that the kids in rural Oregon and rural Nevada have the same kind of opportunities as youngsters in Beverly Hills or the Gold Coast of Chicago or Palm We want to make sure everybody has a chance to get ahead.  Mr.Pai says that he is for real net neutrality, and we have tried to pin him down on a whole host of policies that really get him to commit to the essence of it, but he mostly says a version of what the big cable companies say. The big cable companies have[[Page S6194]]come to say: We like net neutrality. We are not going to block anything. We are for the consumer; we are for the little guy. We just do not want a whole lot of government.  They say that what they really would like is voluntary net neutrality.  Let me tell my colleagues something. There is about as much likelihood that the big cable companies will voluntarily subscribe to net neutrality as there is the prospect that William Peter Wyden--one of my 9-year-old twins, the boy--will voluntarily limit himself to one dessert. It is just not going to happen. It is just not going to work. Mr.Pai is on the side of the big cable companies. He has a long history of putting those companies before the consumers--the big corporate players over the small businesses--and pay to play over a free and open internet.  I introduced the first strong net neutrality bill here in the Senate in 2006. We all know that back then we were just starting the debate about technology policy. The Senate was getting ribbed pretty seriously by the late night talk show hosts who said that the internet was a series of tubes. So, as I have indicated, what we have tried to do is to make sure that if you pay your internet access fee, you get to go where you want, when you want, and how you want.  Net neutrality has been the law of the land, and our economy has grown around this leading principle with respect to equal access to information and customers. Mr.Pai has said that he wants to take a ``weed whacker'' to the strong, enforceable net neutrality rules. Right away, with his quotes that are on the record, he is talking about blowing up this notion of a level playing field, which is so crucial to innovation and free speech online and that allows the startups to get out of the garage to become the next YouTube and Google and  I want to emphasize that point.  People talk a lot about technology policy.  To my colleagues, this tech policy debate is about the little guy who wants to be able to get his business out of the garage so that he can become the next big guy. Net neutrality gives us the opportunity to create opportunities for that small entrepreneur, the person who is a small entrepreneur with big dreams.  Net neutrality prevents your internet service provider from favoring one type of content over another. As an example, suppose your internet provider has a financial stake in a third-party content site. It could ensure that content goes to your home faster and clearer than to the homes of its competitors if you did not have real net neutrality--enforceable, real net neutrality, not something like Mr.Pai wants, which is, oh, we will kind of pay lipservice to net neutrality but not make it enforceable.  For example, you could have AT&T deciding to provide free data for customers streaming HBO, which would cause more folks to subscribe to that service over its competitors and starve other creators of the subscribers necessary to create new and innovative content. That is the kind of thing that happens if we do not have real net neutrality.  It even holds true for telehealth providers. Telehealth depends on reliable, fast, and low-cost internet coverage to transmit critical health information, especially in rural and remote areas--for example, the remote monitoring of blood glucose levels in diabetes patients. Net neutrality prevents the internet service providers from viewing this lifesaving service as a cash cow, thus charging rural hospitals and community health centers a premium fee to deliver critical and timely healthcare services.  Not long ago, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a strong legal framework that would make sure that the Federal Communications Commission had the tools to protect the open internet, and the reality was that, then, the Federal Communications Commission and a gentleman named Mr.Tom Wheeler, who had a background in the industry, used their experience in how companies operated and how they treated consumers to make sure that we had constructive, real, and concrete consumer protections.  The reason I feel so strongly about Mr.Pai's nomination is that Mr.Pai made it clear with his comments about taking a weed whacker to anything enforceable. He is going to roll back the rules, and then he is going to claim to be fixing a problem that doesn't exist.  The reality is that we have strong net neutrality protections in place right now. If you vote for Mr.Pai, make no mistake about it, you are voting to roll back consumer protection. You are voting to take a big step backward for the internet. You are going to hurt the people--the small business people, the startups--who are dreaming in their garage of the chance to be big and who are going to have a lot more problems if there is a telecommunications policy that doesn't give them a fair shake.  As I indicated, this notion of a voluntary solution to net neutrality is absurd. I talked about it in the context of my own son. It would be hilarious if I even suggested to my son that I am going to let him, William, voluntarily limit himself to one dessert. He would smile and wait until I got out of the room, and he would dig in for some more. That is going to be the same thing if we embark on a net neutrality policy that says: Let's just trust the big cable companies; the cable companies, in their heart of hearts, are all about the little guy. They are just going to voluntarily go along with net neutrality because they are just that kind of good folks who want to make sure that the little guy gets ahead. The fact is, Chairman Pai's track record demonstrates that he is not in the consumers' corner.  Last year the Federal Communications Commission acted on the responsibility given to it by the Congress to protect browsing history, favored applications, and even the location of broadband users from the During that vote, Mr.Pai voted no. He was, again, with cable companies' profits over the American consumers' privacy.  During the August recess, Mr.Pai began an attempt to really backdoor a proposal that would lower the acceptable standard speed of internet access in rural areas. That is just wrong. Rural areas are already facing huge broadband challenges. Last Saturday night, I was in Oak Ridge, OR, which has a population of a little over 3,000. Earlier that day, I had been to La Pine, OR, in Central Right on the top of their agenda is trying to find ways to expand opportunities for better communications in rural areas and more opportunities for broadband.  So in the August recess, when communities like Oak Ridge and La Pine want more opportunities in rural communities, we had the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission trying to sneak through a proposal that would lower the acceptable standard speed of internet access to rural America and hurt rural Make no mistake about it. That would hurt rural America--the Oak Ridges and La It is just wrong. The Congress mandated that the FCC expand access to high-speed internet to every American, and Mr.Pai basically said: No, slower internet speed is good enough.  As I indicated, just this last weekend, on Saturday night, we had a townhall in I am telling you what these small communities are telling me about their current frustrations with slow and unsatisfactory internet speeds. Mr.Pai is giving a big gift to the powerful interests, and their internet speeds are going to get slower rather than what rural America wants, which is faster internet so that they have more opportunities to participate in the global economy and more opportunities to help their kids with their homework. Congress and the Federal Communications Commission ought to be working for all to have access to high-speed internet and not telling folks in rural America that what they have is just good enough.  Mr.Pai has repeatedly failed on another matter, and that is to act even in the face of clear danger to the security of America's mobile phones. Despite years of warnings about well-known weaknesses in mobile phone networks that allow hackers and spies to track Americans' phones, intercept calls and messages, and hack the phones themselves, Mr.Pai has taken a hands-off attitude. His Federal Communications Commission says it is not going to force wireless carriers to fix the weaknesses, and--what a surprise--his traditional answer is that ``voluntary measures are going to do enough.'' I disagree because they haven't worked.[[Page S6195]]  We always talk about the role of government. I think this is an area that really lends itself to thoughtful discussion because, obviously, we don't want government if you can figure out a way to solve a problem without it. The voluntary measures have not worked here on these basic security issues I have described. The self-regulation approach has failed. The Federal Communications Commission has to force the carriers to secure their networks and protect America's critical communications infrastructure. The failure to act on this security issue means that the American people are going to be less safe.  I close by saying that my view is that net neutrality has sparked the flames of innovation and commerce on the internet. Net neutrality has been one of the foundational principles that we started working on in the late 1990s and in the early part of this century. It was up there in terms of importance, like trying to prevent multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, particularly taxing internet access, and the digital signatures law, making sure that you couldn't hold somebody personally liable if they were to invest in a website or a blog. These were foundational principles that have been of enormous benefit to our country, and net neutrality was one of those. I guess it would be the fourth in the list of foundational principles that we talked about and have been talking about for well over a decade.  We should be building on net neutrality, not walking it back. I believe that what Mr.Pai is talking about is a significant retreat from the freedom and openness that the internet is all about.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the confirmation of Mr.Vote in favor of a truly open internet.  I yield the floor, as I note the Democratic leader is here to speak.

722,topic-id,566,"Mr.President, today is a big day in the ongoing effort to update and strengthen Medicare's guarantee to seniors. Senate passage of the[[Page S6153]]Finance Committee's chronic care bill means seniors with multiple chronic illnesses will have their individual needs better met and get the type of care they need earlier.  It is my judgment that the Finance Committee has no job more significant than updating the Medicare guarantee, and that is exactly what today is all about. The CHRONIC Care Act begins a transformational change in the way Medicare works for seniors who suffer from chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.  If you could bring the lawmakers responsible for the creation of Medicare into 2017, they would barely recognize the program they created more than half a century ago. Back then, if a senior needed surgery for a broken hip, he or she visited a hospital and used Medicare Part If a senior needed treatment for a nasty bout of the flu, he or she visited their doctor and used Part  Today, more than 90 percent of the Medicare dollar goes toward seniors who have two or more chronic conditions. Today's seniors get their care in a variety of ways. It is not just fee-for-service; there are Medicare Advantage, Accountable Care Organizations, and other new systems under development.  Keeping up with those changes--updating the Medicare guarantee--is a big policymaking challenge, and that is why the Finance Committee worked so hard, for so long, to get this bill across the finish line. There are still more steps before these policies reach the President's desk, but with strong bipartisan backing of the entire U.Senate, I am confident the job will get done.  The CHRONIC Care Act will mean more care at home and less in institutions. It will expand the use of lifesaving technology. It places a stronger focus on primary care. It gives seniors, however they get Medicare, more tools and options to receive care specifically targeted to address their chronic illnesses and keep them healthy. Those are all important steps forward in updating the Medicare guarantee. Still to come is ensuring that every senior with multiple chronic conditions has an advocate to help them navigate through the Byzantine healthcare system.  Finally just a few points about the bipartisan process leading to this bill's passage today. The Finance Committee, in my view, has handed the Congress a model for how to legislate on a bipartisan basis. I want to thank Chairman Hatch, with whom I formed a bipartisan chronic care working group almost exactly 2 years ago, and I want to thank Senators Warner and Isakson who generously took on the challenge of leading it.  Of course this bill wouldn't have materialized at all if not for the sweat equity put in by staff. Somewhere amid all the endless hours of work that went into writing this bill, they found time for multiple weddings, the birth of three children, and a handful of job changes. Thank you to Karen Fisher, Hannah Hawkins, Kelsey Avery, Leigh Stuckhardt, Liz Jurinka, Beth Vrabel, and Matt Kazan--our chronic care lead--all on my team. Chairman Hatch, I thank you for your commitment to keep working on this and to your staff, including Jay Khosla, Brett Baker, Jen Kuskowski, Katie Meyer-Simeon, and the chronic care lead, Erin Thank you also to Senators Warner and Isakson for lending us Marvin Figueroa and Jordan  ",CREC-2017-09-26-pt1-PgS6147.txt,1247,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,26.0,September
880,topic-id,2576,"Mr.President, often late at night when the Senate passes a piece of legislation by unanimous consent, people often don't get a chance to understand what it really means, and usually there is a sense of, well, this maybe won't be the most important thing coming down the road, and everybody just said OK, and so it passed the  Last night, the Senate took action on At a time when 10,000 people will turn 65 every day for years and years to come, Medicare is something millions of older people rely on, and their kids and grandkids make plans to make sure their grandparents are taken care of, but also they want to know what their future is going to be all about.  What the Senate did last night--Democrats and Republicans coming together--is, in my view, transformational for seniors today and the beginning of an effort that is going to evolve in the days ahead for kids and their parents and their grandparents to, in effect, benefit from an updated Medicare guarantee that will stand the test of time for many years to come. The reason I say ``updated Medicare guarantee'' is that Medicare is not a voucher. It is not a piece of paper. It is not something you get and then, well, maybe it will do you some good, but if your healthcare costs go above your vouchers, you are going to get buried in costs. Medicare is a guarantee that vital services are going to be available to those over 65.  Last night, all Senators voted to send to the House of Representatives a bipartisan effort that was years in the making to update the Medicare guarantee to start focusing on chronic illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's.  Mr.President, I am going to make this a little bit personal. I am so grateful to Chairman Hatch, Senator Isakson, Senator Warner--the bipartisan group in the Senate that has been working on this.  What I can tell the Senate tonight is that back when I was director of the Gray Panthers and ran the legal aid services for older people, Medicare was a very different program. Back in the 1970s when we were getting the Gray Panthers off the ground, it was a very different program than it is in 2017. Medicare really consisted of two parts. There was Part If a senior broke their ankle or needed surgery for a broken hip, they went to the hospital, and Medicare Part A would be there to cover a senior's surgery. If a senior had an awful bout of the flu, he or she visited the doctor and they used Part That is not Medicare in 2017. Medicare in 2017 is not primarily about treating the flu or a broken ankle. It is there for those conditions, and we are very glad that it is, but more than 90 percent of the Medicare dollars go to treat[[Page S6181]]older people with two or more chronic conditions. I will tell you, until the Senate Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, began to deal with this problem--and fortunately, we had a couple of colleagues in the House who picked up on it as well--my sense is that, basically, both political parties had missed it. They really missed the fact that most of the Medicare dollars--90 percent--go to seniors who have two or more of these chronic conditions. They might, for example, deal with diabetes and heart problems.  But today's seniors really face the kinds of conditions that didn't dominate the program back in the days when the Gray Panthers were getting off the ground. Today, seniors get their care in a variety of different ways. It is not just fee-for-service medicine. We have the Medicare Advantage Plan, Accountable Care Organizations, and other new systems under development.  So keeping up with those changes--updating the Medicare guarantee--ought to be a real priority for policymakers. That is why the Finance Committee has put so much effort over several years to get the bill that passed late last night across the finish line. There are still more steps before the policies reach the President's desk with strong bipartisan backing of the entire I am confident the job will get done.  The CHRONIC Care Act means more care at home and less in institutions. It will expand the use of lifesaving technology. It places a stronger focus on primary care. It gives older people--however they get their Medicare--more tools and options to receive care specifically targeted to address chronic illnesses and to keep them healthy. These, in my view, are a whole set of building blocks that you have to set in place to update the Medicare guarantee. Still to come is ensuring that every older person with multiple chronic conditions has an advocate to help them navigate through the Byzantine healthcare system in  I just want to highlight that point. If you have two or more of these chronic conditions--I guess the physicians call them comorbidities--you can be drowning, especially if you are not part of a coordinated Medicare program or Medicare Advantage or something like that. You can just be drowning in forms and processes and procedures. Lots of times, over the years, I have gotten calls from a child who is a lawyer or an engineer and they said: Ron, help me out in trying to get through all of this maze of bureaucracy to try to get help for my parents. So I want it understood that what the Senate has done as of last night is an extraordinarily important beginning, but there is a lot more to do.  I want to wrap up my comments on this subject and, then, turn briefly to one other, by handing out some very appropriate thank-yous. I think the Finance Committee has handled this bill, in my view, as a model to work on a bipartisan basis. I want to thank Chairman He and I put together the bipartisan chronic care working group two years ago, and Senators Warner and Isakson did a first-rate job of leading it.  There is an awful lot of sweat equity put in by staff. A lot of staff worked on these issues while they were dealing with weddings. We had three children born in the process, and there were job changes.  Big thanks go to Karen Fisher, Hannah Hawkins, Kelsey Avery, Leigh Stuckhardt, Liz Jurinka, Beth Vrabel, and Matt Kazan on our team.  Chairman Hatch and his team really stepped up to work with us and all the Senators: Jay Khosla, Brett Baker, Jen Kuskowski, Katie Meyer-Simeon, and the chronic care lead, Erin Big thanks also go to Senators Warner and Isakson for lending us Marvin Figueroa and Jordan  I close this portion of my remarks by saying that I think what happened last night--while certainly not something everybody is talking about this evening--is something that is going to be extraordinarily important in the years ahead. It is an issue that I know the President of the Senate and I have talked about--this whole question of healthcare and Medicare and the like. This was an important step to take and an important step we can build on. I hope the other body in the House will take action quickly.          Puerto Rico and U.Virgin Islands Recovery Effort  Mr.President, let me turn now to this question of the Puerto Rico disaster. It has now been a week since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, and 3.5 million American citizens are living amidst a horrifying state of devastation. When I was chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the affairs of Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, and America's other territorial possessions, I got very involved in the economic issues on the island.  But I come today to make a humanitarian plea to my friends and colleagues in the It is a plea not about economics. It is about people--fathers and mothers, children, grandparents, teachers, nurses, and thousands of veterans who served their communities and their country proudly. They are dealing with something that is almost unimaginable--this horrifying set of circumstances that they now find dominating their lives. The press accounts describe Puerto Rico as looking like a war zone. Millions of people on the island are without power, running water, and fuel. The few hospitals that are open--only 20 for the entire island--struggle to care for the injured and the sick. Many doctors and first responders are unable to get to their workplaces because their lives, too, are thrown into chaos, and 911 still doesn't work. Cell service and power are down. The airport in San Juan barely functions now, after days of being completely off the grid.  It is almost impossible for us here in this city to imagine this. We have the basic infrastructure and health and safety that we take for granted every day. Only one word sums up the state of the islands--demolished. It is almost impossible to gauge the full extent of the devastation. Nobody knows how many lives have been lost or how many homes and businesses have been damaged beyond repair, and how many lives have been shattered.  What is known is that this disaster has affected the lives of every single one of the 3.5 million individuals living on the island and the millions more on U.mainland, who have had sleepless nights worrying about loved ones. This is a humanitarian crisis on American soil. It is past time to step up and provide immediate aid to help these Americans--not only for Puerto Rico but also for the U.Virgin Islands, which has also been clobbered by these storms. It is not just the right thing to do. It is the only thing to do.  A few hours ago, I joined 35 of my colleagues in sending a letter to the President, and we requested a number of concrete actions. There are other additional steps in my view that are vital. So I want to just tick through some of them on the floor.  First, the President has to issue a full disaster declaration for all of Puerto Rico, not just parts of it. Currently, 24 municipalities in Puerto Rico have yet to receive individual disaster assistance. This means that people who have lost their homes in these areas are ineligible for Federal assistance. This is unacceptable.  Next, while the President rightfully revised his original disaster declaration so that the island will not have to split the cost of disaster relief with the Federal Government for 180 days, the President should continue this assistance until the island is back on its feet.  The administration also needs to include funding and necessary emergency support for the Puerto Rico Medicaid Program in any emergency request. Medicaid in Puerto Rico doesn't work the way it does in the 50 states, where it is a guarantee of care for vulnerable, low-income people. Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program is built on a block grant, which means that in times of crisis, resources might not be there when it is needed most. Even before the disasters, Puerto Rico was close to depleting its Medicaid supplemental funding. When it does, it will have nowhere to turn to pay for medical care for many of its most vulnerable.  In my view, this is a perfect example of why block grants--as contemplated by the bill that we considered in the Finance Committee this week--Graham-Cassidy-Heller--and vital programs like Medicaid don't mix. It is a recipe for disaster.  In addition, there are expired tax provisions unique and vital to Puerto[[Page S6182]]Rico's economy, and they ought to be extended with any disaster relief package in order to give workers and businesses certainty and predictability. This includes tax incentives for producing goods in Puerto Rico and rebates for taxes on exported rum. In my view, if this is done properly and laid out in a proactive way, it will give predictability for the future and make a difference--an important difference to a lot of people on the job.  It is also vital to get Puerto Rico's electric grid up and running and provide power generators in the meantime. This isn't simply a matter of recharging phones or turning televisions back on for news updates. Going without power is life-threatening. Perishable food goes bad. Those with diabetes can't refrigerate their insulin. Hospitals have a difficult time running essential medical equipment, like dialysis machines or heart monitors. Air conditioners are useless, which is especially dangerous for kids and seniors given the hot, humid temperatures and the limited supply of safe water.  Another necessary step is to help ensure that Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands receive assistance as quickly as possible, and that would include a short-term waiver of the Jones The Jones Act is an important policy for ensuring a vibrant U.maritime industry and for our national defense. But in times of disaster it is more important to get supplies to the impacted areas as quickly as possible. The government has granted such a waiver in Houston and Florida, and it is, in my view, beyond comprehension that they haven't done the same thing for Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Finally, the administration needs to mount a full-court press to rebuild the islands' roads, ports, and airports. Once aid arrives, it is useless if you can't get it out to those who need it most.  As several of my colleagues and I wrote to the President today, our military is uniquely qualified to help Puerto Rico meet some of its critical recovery needs. That includes construction battalions that can repair power and surface transportation infrastructure.  I close by saying that the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are desperate for our help. This situation is extreme. Congress and the administration need to act as soon as possible. The cleanup from Maria and Irma is just the beginning. The fact is that these megastorms, fueled by global warming, are going to keep coming, even after the power is restored and the storm damage from Maria and Irma is repaired. There is going to be a lot of work necessary to reverse years of struggle and build up Puerto Rico's economy and infrastructure.  Coming to the aid of our fellow Americans at a time of crisis, in my view, is at the very core of being At home, I call it ``the Oregon way.'' Our natural disaster this summer was wildfires. Recently, I was out visiting fire camps that stretched from our northern border with Washington State to our southern border with California and many points in between. I met people helping Oregon fight fire from all over the United I met Floridians who were there the weekend Irma hit They were there to help Oregonians deal with fire, when they and their families were worried about what Irma was going to do to  Colleagues, I close simply by way of saying that we should expect no less in our efforts here in the Senate to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin The American people now have to be part of a mobilization to bring together the enormous resources in the Federal Government to help when disaster strikes. It is a matter of basic fairness and humanity to help protect and restore these American citizens and lands.  I yield the floor.  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his courtesy.

1039,topic-id,1921,"Mr.President, I am going to take some time this afternoon to respond to the remarks of the President's top economic adviser, Mr.Gary Cohn, with respect to this administration's approach to taxes.  Let me be clear right at the outset. The President and his parade of millionaires are executing a middle-class con job. I am going to be very specific in saying why I reached that judgment with respect to what they are saying about taxes.  The President said: ``I don't benefit. Very, very strongly I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth.'' Those are the President's exact words. ``It's not good for me, believe me,'' the President said in his speech unveiling the tax reform blueprint on  Unless the President paid zero tax, the President is going to benefit enormously from his tax plan. His family would save billions if the estate tax is eliminated, as he has proposed. His more than 500 passthroughs will be able to take advantage of the new Grand Canyon-sized passthrough loophole that his plan proposes. Based on his 2005 tax return--that is the only one available--the President would save millions each year if the alternative minimum tax is eliminated.  Today, the President's top adviser, Gary Cohn, said: ``We've also said that wealthy Americans are not getting a tax cut.'' They expect you to believe them and not your lying eyes.  I want to take a few minutes and describe exactly what the well-to-do are getting in this bill.  The plan outlined by the Trump administration would cost upwards of $5 trillion, and it is overwhelmingly skewed toward the wealthy and the biggest corporations. It lowers the corporate rate from 35 to 20, and much of that goes to wealthy shareholders.  The new passthrough, which would give this big gift to high-flyers, hedge funds, basically would let them start calling ordinary income business income, so it could be taxed at a much lower rate, and they would in the process harm Social Security and Medicare because they aren't paying those payroll taxes.  I mentioned the estate tax. This is for just a few thousand people. The exemption for a couple is already $11 million. This break would cost the American people between $250 to $270 billion. That is an awful lot of money to parcel out to a few thousand families.  They would lower the individual top rate from 39.6 to 35 percent. Let's make no mistake about it--the President of the United States and his top economic adviser have said they are not going to give tax cuts to the wealthy. That is not what they said yesterday. They said that the top rate was going to go down from 39.6 to 35 percent. And to add insult to injury, for those at the bottom of the economic system who pay 10 percent now, theirs would go up to 12 percent. So this is just making a mockery out of the President's pledge that this was going to be about working families and not about the wealthy. The fact is, with respect to the middle class, the Trump team is running a sleight-of-hand shell game. What they give with one hand, they just take away with the other.  They touted yesterday that they were going to be helping middle-class folks by doubling the standard deduction. First of all, that is walking back the bipartisan proposal we had here in the Senate--written by myself and my colleague Dan Coats, now a member of the Trump administration--that would triple the standard deduction.  What is particularly outrageous is that the Trump people aren't leveling with those middle-class families. Basically, they are saying: Oh, you are really going to do well. You are going to double the standard deduction. What they don't tell them is that they are going to eliminate the personal exemption that large middle-class families rely on. In effect, those large middle-class families--I think a lot of working-class families who may have supported the President--are going to see a tax increase under the President's tax outline that we heard about yesterday, even with this larger standard deduction.  The President's team also took a big pass on the opportunity to expand the child tax credit to make sure more working families would benefit from it. There are no specifics about the child tax credit in this plan.  The Treasury Secretary went on FOX News and said that the tax plan is going to cut the deficit by a trillion dollars. Mr.Mnuchin is doubling down on the failed experiment--the idea that the tax cuts, in effect, pay for themselves through economic growth. History shows that just is not true.  The tax cuts don't pay for themselves. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts were billed as tax relief for the middle class to spark economic growth. Instead, the benefits skewed to those at the very top, and they added trillions of dollars to America's debt. Middle-class wages fell. Unemployment increased. This is a pattern that working families, middle-class families, cannot afford to have repeated.  Now the Secretary of Treasury's claim is: Well, the Trump tax cuts will not just pay for themselves; they are going to bring in an additional $1 trillion in revenue atop their own cost. William Peter Wyden, age 9, my son, would say: That is just a bunch of whoppers. It couldn't be further from the truth.  As even Republican-appointed Budget Office Director Keith Hall has said and made clear, the tax cuts do not pay for themselves: ``No, the evidence is that tax cuts do not pay for themselves.'' Those are the words of the Budget Director appointed by the  That Budget Director, Mr.Keith Hall, went on to say that the models they are doing--the macroeconomic effects, the fancy kind of economic lingo for the big picture in the long term--show it.  The other comment that was noteworthy from Mr.Gary Cohn is that the President remains committed to ending the carried interest deduction. Despite his campaign promise that won him bouquets from political commentators and typical middle-class voters, once again, the President's plan doesn't close the carried interest loophole. This is the second big occasion on which the President has failed to follow through on his campaign promise.  A few months ago, in the spring, they had a one-page outline. They said that was where they were going on taxes. They said that one-page outline was shorter than a typical Fred Meyer receipt. Fred Meyer is kind of an iconic store in our They had one page then and didn't do anything about following through on the President's promise to get rid of the carried interest loophole.  Yesterday--again, we didn't get a bill, but at least when you kind of eliminate all the white space, they put out close to five pages. Once again, they didn't close the carried interest loophole.  In fact, the plan gives such massive tax cuts to those at the top, investment managers will not be the only[[Page S6216]]people who can get away with paying less than their fair share. Many of the megawealthy are going to be able to do so. It is all going to be legal under the President's plan.  What is the one question on which the Trump team doesn't bend the truth? Whether their plan will protect the middle class from a tax hike. On ABC, the Trump adviser, Mr.Cohn, said that he couldn't guarantee taxes will not go up for middle-class folks. On ABC, the Treasury Secretary said that he couldn't guarantee middle-class folks would not pay more under the tax plan.  What is really striking about this, and it is quite a contrast, is that what people at the very top are going to get is spelled out in detail--in detail. They are going to see the abolition of the estate tax, an incredible windfall to a few thousand families.  Middle-class folks--can't guarantee you will not pay more. Mr.Cohn said: We are aiming to help the middle class. But then he was asked: Would you commit to it? His answer: Well, I don't know. There might be somebody somewhere.  Then there are State and local taxes. He just wouldn't stand behind the middle class the way that this administration stands foursquare behind those at the top. It is why I have said that the President and his parade of millionaires are executing a middle-class con job, and we sure saw it today.  The President's ultrawealthy, out-of-touch advisers clearly fail to understand that the time is now to deliver tax relief to middle-class folks who need it most. It is time to go back to the drawing board and come up with a plan that doesn't threaten middle-class Americans, particularly those with larger families, and doesn't hit them with a tax increase they can't afford.  I want to close by way of saying that on our side, we have repeatedly said we share the view that the tax system is a dysfunctional, broken-down mess filled with loopholes. Then you have the inversion virus. Often my wife says: Why don't you stop there? Any more is going to frighten the children.  We share the view that the tax system is broken. I have been very proud over the years to join two senior Republicans, close allies--the majority leader, Mitch McConnell--in a tax reform proposal that is bipartisan that really puts the focus on the middle class and on red, white, and blue jobs.  Our proposal--the outline laid out by Democrats--was that there had to be fiscal responsibility, it had to focus on the middle class, and the tax relief couldn't go to the 1 percent. The bill I wrote that had Republican support, the outline led by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, doesn't even go as far as Ronald Reagan and the Democrats went in 1986.  President Reagan, whom no one would call a flaming liberal, entered into an agreement with Democrats in 1986 that said there would be equal treatment of income earned by a cop or a nurse with that earned by someone from a hedge fund or an investment shop.  In effect, Ronald Reagan said that a dollar is a dollar is a dollar. Everything ought to be treated fairly. That was important then, and it is even more important now because, in reality, there are two tax systems in There is one for the cop and the nurse. They have their taxes taken out every paycheck. That taxation is compulsory--no Cayman Island deal for them.  Then there is another tax system for the kind of people who benefit from what the President outlined yesterday. Those are the high-fliers. They get to pay what they want when they want to. I think it is very unfortunate that what the President has described is another gift to that group I just described, who pay what they want when they want to. To quote the President, it is really sad to hear that this administration and the President are pretending that they are doing something else and putting the focus on the middle class when what they really are doing is advancing the cause of the parade of millionaires, a number of whom are part of this administration.

I commend Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen for leading this reauthorization effort, and Chairman Royce and my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for their support of this legislation.  The horrific human rights abuses committed by Kim Jong-un are an integral part of his power structure. Countering these unspeakable crimes, however we can, is both a moral imperative and a sound strategy.

It will provide light to the North Koreans; not just light to read by, but shine light on those innate basic beliefs of liberty and freedom.  Specifically, this language updates the means in which information can be disseminated, helping to find new ways to end the Kim regime's monopoly on information.  The two bills are natural partners and, together, they can meaningfully advance human rights and free flow of information in North  Mr.Speaker, I again thank the chairman for yielding.
