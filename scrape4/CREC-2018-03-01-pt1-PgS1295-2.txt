                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord our God, as our lawmakers take up the duties of this day, give 
them Your wisdom and guidance. Remind them that You already know their 
needs, motives, hopes, and fears. Lord, keep them from being awed by 
difficulties and frightened by problems, as You provide them with 
wisdom in their decisions and harmony in their interactions. May the 
work they do today on Capitol Hill have eternal significance.
  We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.
