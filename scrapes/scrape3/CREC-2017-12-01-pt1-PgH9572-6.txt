                          REPUBLICAN TAX PLAN

  (Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, from California to New York and everywhere in 
between, the Republican tax scam steals from working class families to 
give the top 1 percent and large corporations a massive tax break.
  The Republican plan eliminates deductions like State and local taxes, 
mortgage interest rates, medical expenses, and student loan interest 
that working families rely on.
  This bill will only increase income inequality in our country, where 
the rich get richer and those in the middle class and those struggling 
to get into the middle class are left further and further behind.
  I can't believe anyone would vote for such a bill. Either you know 
what is in it and you don't care about the consequences of your vote, 
or you don't and you will still vote for it anyway. I don't know which 
one is worse.
  To the Republicans who care about the deficit only when Democrats are 
in power, you have lost all credibility when it comes to this issue. I 
hope the American people will remember who voted for this bill.
