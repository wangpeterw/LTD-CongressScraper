                         TAX CUTS AND JOBS BILL

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will have further comments on the tax 
bill that I will deliver on the Senate floor late tonight after the 
conference report, but I just want to say that this bill will be an 
anchor around the ankles of every Republican. It so helps the wealthy 
and the powerful corporations, and it does so little and even hurts 
many in the middle class. It is a loser.
  In a CNN new poll, a majority of Americans oppose the tax bill. When 
did you ever hear that Americans are against a tax cut bill? Well, you 
are hearing it now.
  It is because our Republican friends are listening to the thousands 
of really greedy multibillionaires who want their taxes cut, even 
though they are doing great, and don't want to share those benefits 
with the middle class even if they make millions of middle-class people 
pay more.
  The Republicans will rue the day that they passed this tax bill--will 
rue the day--because it is so unfair to the middle class. It so blows a 
hole in our deficit. It so threatens Social Security, Medicare, and 
Medicaid. They will rue the day.
