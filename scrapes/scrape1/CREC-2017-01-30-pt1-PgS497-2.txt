SENATE RESOLUTION 29--RECOGNIZING JANUARY 28, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL DATA 
                             PRIVACY DAY''

  Mr. DAINES submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on the Judiciary:
  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, as an engineer who worked at a cloud 
computing company for 13 years, I have seen firsthand how technology 
has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Innovative products 
and services have made it easier than ever to learn, communicate, and 
to share our data with others.
  Personal data has become a form of currency, and the sharing of 
personal information may compromise privacy if appropriate protective 
action is not taken. That is why I am proud to recognize January 28, 
2017; as National Data Privacy Day. Each year, our Nation recognizes 
this day as an opportunity for private organizations, governments, and 
individuals to work together to raise awareness and promote privacy and 
data protection best practices.
  I am pleased to recognize this day and am committed to working with 
my colleagues to ensure the privacy of individuals is protected.

                               S. Res. 29

       Whereas, on January 28, 2017, National Data Privacy Day is 
     recognized;
       Whereas technology has enhanced our ability to communicate, 
     learn, and work and is now a part of our everyday lives;
       Whereas personal information has become a form of currency;
       Whereas it is easier now than ever before to share personal 
     information with friends, colleagues, and companies;
       Whereas the sharing of personal information may compromise 
     the privacy of individuals if appropriate protective action 
     is not taken;
       Whereas governments, corporations, and individuals have a 
     role in protecting the privacy of individuals; and
       Whereas National Data Privacy Day constitutes a nationwide 
     effort to educate and raise awareness about respecting 
     privacy and safeguarding data: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes January 28, 2017, as ``National Data Privacy 
     Day''; and
       (2) encourages governments, individuals, privacy 
     professionals, educators, corporations, and other relevant 
     organizations to take steps to protect the privacy of 
     individuals.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.
