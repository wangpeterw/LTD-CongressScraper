                 CONGRATULATING CRISTINA JIMENEZ MORETA

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize and 
congratulate an immigrant advocate, and now MacArthur genius, Cristina 
Jimenez Moreta. Like me, she is a CUNY alumni and she grew up 
undocumented.
  Since founding United We Dream in 2008, Cristina Jimenez Moreta has 
become a powerhouse champion for immigrant groups across the country. 
By elevating the stories of DREAMers and putting faces and names to a 
discussion that was, at times, dismissive and dehumanizing, she changed 
the dialogue surrounding undocumented young people.
  Her work has impacted the lives of young immigrants nationwide, and 
in honor of her significant contributions, she was recently selected as 
one of 24 MacArthur Fellow winners worldwide in 2017.
  I congratulate Ms. Jimenez on her MacArthur Fellowship, and I applaud 
her decision to use the grant money to further the development of other 
undocumented young people.
  Cristina, your work is paramount now more than ever now that we brace 
as a nation to give rich people a big tax write-off that will put our 
country in jeopardy, a big gambling casino effort that has seen a 
failed attempt in the past with trickle-down economy.
  ``Because we are not one. We are not 100. We are millions. Count us 
well.'' ``Porque no somos uno. No somos cien. Somos millones. Cuentanos 
bien.''
