               IMPROVE MONITORING OF FOREIGN INTERFERENCE

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, today, the heads of our intelligence 
agencies are testifying in the Senate with a unanimous and stark 
warning: Russia's meddling in 2016 was not an isolated incident, our 
midterm elections remain vulnerable, and Putin is targeting the 2018 
elections.
  ``The United States is under attack,'' said Director of National 
Intelligence Dan Coats.
  Russia's actions demand a serious response, both to hold our 
attackers accountable and to deter future interference. Remarkably, 
President Trump

and his administration have proved unwilling to act. We must do better.
  I am proud to join with my friend and colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, 
to introduce the DETER Act in the House. This bicameral, bipartisan 
legislation, introduced in the Senate by Chris Van Hollen and Marco 
Rubio, will improve our monitoring of foreign interference and impose 
immediate and severe sanctions when such actions are identified. It is 
an important step to ensure the integrity of every American's vote.
  Protecting our elections is a national concern superseding party and 
politics. As we approach the next national election in less than 9 
months, we must work together and we must act now.
  I urge my colleagues to support the DETER Act to secure our elections 
this year and beyond.
