                     UNITED NATIONS JERUSALEM VOTE

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express deep disappointment 
in the United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/ES-10/L.22 and 
state my serious concern over the anti-American and anti-Semitic 
behaviors of the United Nations.
  Today, the United Nations continues its ugly legacy of singling out 
Israel for condemnation. According to the NGO, UN Watch, 86 percent of 
the U.N. General Assembly resolutions criticizing countries between 
2012 and 2015 have targeted Israel.
  It is a sad and confounding sight to watch Syria, North Korea, Cuba, 
and other human rights abusers degrade our ally, Israel, and attempt to 
nullify a decision made by the United States regarding our own Embassy.
  I applaud Ambassador Haley for her resolute remarks and strength of 
spirit as she stood against rogue regimes for democratic values and 
American interests.
  I look forward to working with the administration and my colleagues 
in Congress to reassess our foreign aid commitments and realign them 
with our values and our strategic interests.
