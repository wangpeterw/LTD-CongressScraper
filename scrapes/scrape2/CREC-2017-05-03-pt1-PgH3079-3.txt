           MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING SERGEANT JOSHUA RODGERS

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor 
Sergeant Joshua Rodgers, who made the ultimate sacrifice last Wednesday 
night in Afghanistan. Sergeant Rodgers was a native of Bloomington, 
Illinois, in my congressional district, and was one of two American 
soldiers killed during a raid targeting an ISIS prison last week.
  Sergeant Rodgers graduated from Normal Community High School in 2013, 
where he competed on the track and football teams. His teammates and 
coaches remember him as a hard worker and a great leader. He had a true 
sense of duty and believed it necessary to serve his country.
  After graduation from high school, he enlisted in the Army, achieving 
the position of Army Ranger. In his short career, he did three tours in 
Afghanistan. He would go on to receive numerous medals for his service, 
such as the Army Achievement Medal and the Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medal.
  Sergeant Joshua Rodgers was a man of courage, and he gave his life on 
the battlefield fighting against the evil of ISIS and terrorism. His 
bravery and sacrifice in the name of liberty and freedom will not be 
forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with Joshua's family during this 
difficult period.
  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would ask that the House rise and take a 
moment of silence to pay tribute to Sergeant Joshua Rodgers for his 
service and sacrifice for our country and for free people everywhere.
