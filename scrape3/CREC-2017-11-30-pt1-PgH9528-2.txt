                RECOGNIZING FSU PRESIDENT JOHN THRASHER

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a decorated combat 
veteran and distinguished public servant as one of the newest inductees 
into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.
  This week, Governor Rick Scott and the Florida Department of 
Veterans' Affairs honored John Thrasher for his continued commitment to 
the State of Florida.
  John currently serves as the president of Florida State University, 
where he earned his bachelor's and law degrees. John joined the United 
States Army after graduating from FSU and went on to receive two Bronze 
Stars while serving in Vietnam, eventually earning the rank of captain.
  He has been an advocate for veterans throughout his entire life, 
especially while serving as the speaker of the house in Florida and 
later as senator. Under his leadership as president, FSU has become one 
of the top universities in the Nation.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating FSU President John 
Thrasher for being inducted into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame and 
thanking him for his continued service to our veterans.
