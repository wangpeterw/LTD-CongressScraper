                        PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEGACY

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important parts of 
President Obama's legacy is the recognition that Americans should not 
be discriminated against based on preexisting conditions. This 
principle was enshrined in law by the Affordable Care Act, and now 
millions of Americans across the political spectrum support these vital 
protections. Even yesterday, President Trump, an avowed opponent of the 
Affordable Care Act, stated unequivocally that he was opposed to 
discrimination based on preexisting conditions.
  The bill under consideration by this House, the American Health Care 
Act, does not represent that same bipartisan principle. My colleagues 
are advancing a measure that would let States turn back the clock for 
millions of Americans and begin that discrimination again.
  Today, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill for the sake of all 
those it would harm. For the sake of anyone who has survived cancer, 
battled diabetes, or was simply born a woman, I urge you, vote ``no.''
