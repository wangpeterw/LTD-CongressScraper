                   REPEAL OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, we are less than 2 weeks into the start of 
the new Congress and Republicans are already trying tomake good on 
their central campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
  Regrettably, it is a promise that will cause more than 30 million 
Americans and at least 86,000 Rhode Islanders to losetheir health 
coverage. It will increase prescription drug costs for almost 16,000 
Ocean State seniors, and it will cost RhodeIsland an estimated 12,000 
jobs in 2019, according to a recent report by The Commonwealth Fund and 
George Washington University.
  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans' promise to repeal the Affordable Care 
Act will have devastating consequences for healthcareproviders, 
patients, families, and even employers. I have long said that ObamaCare 
isn't perfect, and I am willing to work in abipartisan manner to 
improve it--a task we have tried to accomplish for years without 
Republican cooperation.
  Mr. Speaker, the budget resolution the Republicans are jamming 
through Congress now is anything but bipartisan. I pledge todo 
everything in my power to fight their cynical attempts to revoke the 
health coverage of thousands of Rhode Islanders and ofmillions of 
Americans who need it and who depend on it.
