                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, thank You for Your mighty love. Today, empower 
our Senators to pass the test You permit them to experience. Give them 
the wisdom to believe that You will not permit them to be tested beyond 
their ability to prevail. Lord, provide them with a path of escape from 
life's vicissitudes. Help them to strive to be faithful servants of 
Your Kingdom, thereby leaving behind a legacy that will bless 
generations yet unborn. Use them for Your glory. And, Lord, sustain 
those who are dealing with the Parkland, FL, school shooting.
  We pray in Your sovereign Name. Amen.
