                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the fountain of every blessing, we praise You for Your 
loving kindness and tender mercies. We are astounded by Your wonderful 
works to the children of humanity. Lord, we are incomplete without You. 
Fill our thirst for the knowledge of the sacred with Your Divine 
wisdom.
  Today, inspire our lawmakers to do Your will. May they bring love 
where there is hate, light where there is darkness, and hope where 
there is despair. Lord, use them to transform dark yesterdays into 
bright tomorrows and to bring harmony from disharmony. May they rejoice 
because of the blessing of sins forgiven, striving to glorify You in 
all they do.
  And Lord, stay close to those affected by the bombing in Manchester, 
England.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
