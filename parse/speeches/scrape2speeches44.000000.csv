9267,topic-id,182,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise in support of H.1108, the Working Families Flexibility  Many Americans can relate to the difficulties of balancing work duties with family obligations. It is not always easy to attend a parent-teacher conference, care for an aging parent, or stay home with a newborn when outdated Federal laws create constant barriers to workplace flexibility.  H.1180 will amend the outdated Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and bring much-needed reform to the workplace. It will give employers the freedom to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked.  I emphasize this is a voluntary option, which means that employees who want to receive cash wages can continue to do so; and if they choose to accept comp time and change their mind, it allows workers to withdraw and receive cash wages whenever they choose.  By passing this bill, American workers will gain more flexibility in the workplace, allowing them to have more time to spend with the people they love.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that supports our American workers.  ",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3038.txt,2239,TRIBUTE TO JOHN MICHELS,2017.0,2.0,July

8994,topic-id,794,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the 100th anniversary of a great Wisconsin company: Oshkosh  Oshkosh Corporation began ten decades ago when cofounders William Besserdich and Bernard Mosling believed they had created something that would change transportation in Their new technology would improve vehicle steering and drive capacity, two factors that were essential for navigating unfinished roads. While the engineering was groundbreaking, they could not find a manufacturer who would purchase and build their designs.  Faced with possible failure, William and Bernard moved on to plan B: manufacturing and launching their own vehicle. On May 1, 1917, they founded the Wisconsin Duplex Auto Company that soon issued its four-wheel drive truck prototype, known as Old Betsy, using the duo's innovative technology. The company's rapid growth led them to move the production facility from Clintonville to Oshkosh, where it was renamed the Oshkosh Motor Truck Manufacturing  Over the next 3 years, the Oshkosh Motor Truck Manufacturing Company grew exponentially as a defense supplier for the U.military. In 1945, the U.Army and U.Navy presented Oshkosh with the ``E'' award for excellence in wartime production. Throughout the 1940s, companies like Auto Body Works, Inc., and Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering, which would later become part of the larger Oshkosh Corporation, made their marks on the military industry. The success of these companies built the foundation for Oshkosh Corporation's current success.  The escalation of the Cold War led to Oshkosh's first major defense contract. They produced 1,000 WT-2206 snow removal vehicles that allowed the Air Force to remove snow for bomber planes. Throughout the 1950s, the company continued to produce high-quality, technologically advanced trucks for various branches of the military. As our country transitioned out of a wartime economy, the company's focus shifted, resulting in the 1967 name change from Oshkosh Motor Truck Company to Oshkosh Truck  Over the next several decades, Oshkosh continued to grow, as did its subsidiaries. Whether it was defense or construction, Oshkosh is known for its consistency, advanced technology, and efficient designs. In the area of defense, the Oshkosh name has become synonymous in the minds of U.servicemembers with quality, durability, and safety. From heavy-duty trucks, to the lifesaving MRAP--which was rapidly produced by skilled and patriotic Wisconsin workers in order to accelerate the safer vehicle's deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan--to the current production of the joint light tactical vehicle, Oshkosh boasts an unparalleled track record of delivering leading capability to our men and women in uniform. That is a record I have been honored to support throughout my time in As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have worked to secure the funding required by the Armed Services to meet their need for tactical vehicles.  I have also been proud to represent Oshkosh in the Senate because the company has a steadfast commitment to its employees. Whether it was 1917 with two employees, 1972 with 500 employees, or present day with over 12,000 employees across the world, Oshkosh provides for its employees with scholarships, employee safety, and support. On the production floor or in the office, Oshkosh Corporation employees' remarkable dedication can be seen throughout the organization. I have been honored to meet many of these talented workers, including speaking with hundreds at a recent all-hands call at the Oshkosh Defense facility in  Oshkosh's success has also lifted the fortunes of hundreds of Wisconsin companies throughout its various supply chains. Oshkosh is a true linchpin of my home State's manufacturing economy, and both its commercial and government programs support thousands of good-paying, skilled jobs. Just last year, I had the opportunity to partner with Oshkosh Defense and the Wisconsin Procurement Institute to strengthen this vibrant network by convening an event to build relationship's between Wisconsin suppliers and Federal agencies.  I would also like to commend the company's current leadership, including president and CEO Wilson Jones, and John Bryant, the president of Oshkosh's defense unit, both of whom I have had the pleasure of working with over the years. Similarly, I want to recognize the tremendous contributions made by their immediate predecessors, Charles Szews and John Urias, respectively. The steady hand provided by these leaders will ensure that the company is an integral part of Wisconsin's economy for another 100 years.  Now, 100 years after the creation of ``Old Betsy,'' Oshkosh Corporation and its brands continue to lead the industry; yet the company has remained firmly committed to its strong ethics and employee-centric culture. For the last ten decades, Oshkosh Corporation has cemented its international reputation for innovation and excellence. I know Oshkosh leadership and frontline employees will continue to hold themselves to this high standard, as they continue to grow and contribute to our great Wisconsin economy. I am so pleased to add my voice in celebrating this monumental anniversary.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-11-pt1-PgS3915.txt,1558,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,11.0,June

Senate Republicans and House Republicans drafted their bill in secret, behind closed doors, and without a single hearing. But after seeing the bill, Mr.Speaker, I know why they kept it a secret.  TrumpCare will allow States to eliminate essential healthcare benefits like emergency room visits, preventative screenings, and prescription drug coverage. TrumpCare will gut Medicaid $772 billion and allow insurers to charge hardworking Americans more money for less coverage.  It will cost the State of Ohio, my State, more than $25 billion, giving 400 of the richest families a massive tax break.

Do you want the added time so that you have control of your schedule?  Yes, this is about empowering the employee.  It is so interesting, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 put in place something for the public sector. They forgot about the private sector.

9248,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, unfortunately, too many workers in Oregon and across the country are still facing a great deal of economic uncertainty. They worry about rent payments, healthcare costs, saving for retirement, balancing family responsibilities and work, and making ends meet.  Congress should be considering policy changes that support workers, not a bill that threatens their economic security. This bill takes away overtime pay and, instead, a workers gets a vague IOU for compensatory time sometime in the future, and only if the comp time does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer--whatever that means.

In fact, when her youngest got the flu, her older son had to stay home from school to care for him.  In May and June, we celebrate Mother's Day and Father's This is a perfect time for Congress to focus on legislation that allows parents like Anjeanette to be more present in their kid's lives and still pay their bills.

9199,topic-id,325,"Mr.President, I wanted to express my support for the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver Act, also known as the WILD I commend my Senate colleagues for passing this legislation last week.  I firmly believe that we have a moral duty to be good stewards of our planet, and that includes working together to conserve species and their habitat in the United States and around the world. We face many pressing wildlife management challenges; yet we have heard in the Environment and Public Works Committee that State and Federal agencies do not have adequate resources to face these troubling challenges. That is what makes innovation and collaboration so important, and the WILD Act inspires both.  The WILD Act incentivizes innovators by establishing cash-prize competitions for new technologies that prevent poaching, promote conservation, manage invasive species, protect endangered species, and use nonlethal methods to control wildlife. It directs Federal agencies to manage invasive species on public lands and reauthorizes effective government conservation programs, including those that protect some of our most loved species--elephants, great apes, tigers, rhinos, and marine turtles.  The WILD Act also reauthorizes the Department of Interior's Partnership for Fish and Wildlife Program, which leverages Federal funding by working with hard-working private landowners to restore and improve fish and wildlife habitats on their land.  Wildlife conservation is not a partisan issue, which is why I was so pleased to join with Chairman Barrasso and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in support of this legislation.

9154,topic-id,1442,"Mr.President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his kind words.  I rise to speak about our Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care I always kind of chuckle when I say the ``Affordable Care Act,'' as I have a friend back home whose quote for his insurance was $39,000 for 1 year. That is the un-Affordable Care Act.[[Page S3202]]  A family member from San Francisco whose policy was $20,000 for 1 year had a $6,000 deductible for each person. I think her husband actually voted for Bernie Sanders, but she is like: The heck with this because I cannot afford it.  Then there is another fellow here in Washington, DC, who is an insurance consultant. If anybody can get a good deal, an insurance consultant should be able to. He says:       My family premium is $24,000 a year with a family      deductible of $13,000. We will pay $37,000 before we receive      benefit from our insurance policy.  That is unsustainable.  President Trump saw that during the campaign. He said over and over again--kind of his four pledges, if you will--that he wished to maintain coverage, lower premiums, get rid of those mandates that Americans hate in ObamaCare, and care for those with preexisting conditions. This is what he said over and over. It is a great pledge.  He actually said something else as well: He said he wanted to make healthcare easy. Now we have an approach to do this. Some people call it auto enrollment, but I call it making it easy. In this way, we can increase coverage and achieve the goals of President Trump's to lower the premiums. We are using something that is already used in Medicare and 401(k) plans. Again, we make it easy to enroll. Let me elaborate on this.  People argue that we have to have a mandate because without a mandate, people will lose coverage, and if people lose coverage, only the sick enroll and healthcare expenses increase. I think the Senate actually has an opportunity to do something better. We can make it easy. Under this, we can imagine that someone is eligible to be enrolled in our program unless he calls us up and says he does not want to be.  This is what we do in When we--when I, when you, when any of us--turn 65, we are automatically enrolled in I turned 65, and I am on It is not a mandate. I can call them up and say that I do not want to. You have never heard anybody complain about it. It is just called making it easy.  Similarly, when a Fortune 500 company puts in a 401(k) plan, it has learned that if it asks somebody to sign all of the forms, and they can opt into its 401(k) retirement plan, it gets about 65 percent participation, but if they say: You are in unless you call us up and tell us you do not want to be--if they make it totally easy, they get 95 percent participation in that 401(k) program.  We know both from Medicare and from business that if you make enrollment easy, you have 95 percent participation. Now, that is so good in the setting of this because if we have all of those enrolled who are eligible to join the ObamaCare replace plan, we make that insurance pool large.  We call it a pool for a reason. If you pour a cup of water into an ocean, it does nothing to the level of the ocean. Similarly, if you have one person who is ill who is in a big pool of otherwise healthy people, it does nothing to the expense because the expense of that one person's illness is spread over many. So by making enrollment easy--fulfilling President Trump's pledge--just like the ocean with one cup of water, that one person who is sick, the expense spread out over many, the impact on any one person's premium is nil.  By the way, there is a lot of conservative support for this sort of concept. First let me just say that coverage is important. If we pretend that people having coverage is not important, it is just not true. I am a physician. I can tell my colleagues there are many conversations I have had where someone who was poorly insured or uninsured might need some critical medicine or critical procedure and we had to work, scramble, do everything we could to get her the coverage she needed to have sometimes a lifesaving procedure.  Rich Lowry is a conservative columnist for the National He had a column saying that the worst argument against replacing the Affordable Care Act is that coverage is not important. Coverage is important.  If we go on toward this kind of concept--make healthcare enrollment easy; you are in unless you are out--Jim Capretta, Joe Antos, and Stuart Butler have all spoken about using this concept. Nina Owcharenko and Bob Moffit of the Heritage Foundation wrote in Senator John McCain's Presidential plan in 2008 that it would be accompanied by a system of automatic enrollment of health insurance, either at the workplace--and then they go on. But they were praising the Presidential candidate's--but now Senator John McCain's--employment of let's make it easy to enroll.  By the way, President Trump kind of emphasized this. Just before he was inaugurated on January 15, he gave an interview to the Washington Post and he was talking about his proposed healthcare law. We have already mentioned the components that he said were in it. He wanted all covered, caring for those with preexisting conditions, getting rid of the mandates, and lowering premiums, but he added this: People under his law ``can expect to have great healthcare. It will be in a much more simplified form. Much less expensive, and much better.''  I like that: simplified.  Under ObamaCare, we have like 16 pages online that people have to fill out with all their W-2s with them in order to find out if they are eligible. The patients I saw in a hospital for the uninsured where median income may have been $16,000, people lived in perhaps public housing, they took public transportation to the public library in order to log on because they did not have a home computer, much less internet. That is not simple. That is why enrollment numbers are lower for lower incomes. We make it easy.  Let me just emphasize one more time: If we can get that bigger pool of people, premiums fall. So for my family member in San Francisco who can't afford that premium, if we get that pool bigger, premiums fall. Similarly for the insurance consultant here or my friends back home in Louisiana, if we can make that pool bigger by making enrollment easier, their premiums will fall.  I will just say that I call myself a kitchen table conservative. All those conservative families who voted for Donald Trump, who sit down at their kitchen table and they know they can't afford a $20,000 premium and already they are struggling with their car note, their house note; they have given up sending their kids to a private school; they are doing whatever they can to make ends meet. Under the un-Affordable Care Act, they are required to pay so much. When they heard President Trump say that he would lower their premiums, they saw that as a lifeline for their family budget. Their vote for President Trump was a cry for help: Help us with insurance premiums we cannot afford.  Now, as a kitchen table conservative myself, to those families who voted for Republican candidates over the last several elections but who absolutely know they need help with their health insurance, we have a solution for them.  But let me pause for a second. You don't have to be a conservative to care for this solution. In fact, people on the left have actually endorsed this concept as well.  I will end by saying this. As we come up with a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, it will not be a Republican solution and it will not be a Democratic solution. At its best, it will be an American solution--an American solution for that family at the kitchen table, struggling to pay their premiums, who can't do so now but know that they need coverage. In so doing, if we can fulfill President Trump's campaign pledges to cover all, caring for those with preexisting conditions, eliminating mandates, and lowering premiums by making enrollment easy through something called auto enrollment, we will have done our job.

9135,topic-id,376,"Mr.President, I rise to introduce two bills that will benefit the brave women and men who volunteer at our local firehouses: the Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act and the Volunteer Firefighters' Length of Service Award Program Cap Adjustment Priority I am pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, in reintroducing this bipartisan legislation.  Across our nation, volunteer firefighters play a critical role in helping to ensure the safety of our communities and the well-being of our neighbors. The State of Maine, for example, has approximately 11,000 firefighters in more than 400 departments. Because Maine is a largely rural state, more than 90 percent of those firefighters are volunteers.  Without these public-spirited citizens, many communities would be unable to provide emergency services protection at all, while others would be forced to raise local taxes to pay salaries and benefits for full- or part-time[[Page S3217]]staff. Often, communities seek to recruit and retain volunteers by offering modest benefits. The bills we are introducing today would support these efforts by helping to ensure that nominal benefits to volunteers are not treated as regular employee compensation.  The Volunteer Responder Incentive Protection Act would allow communities to provide volunteer firefighters and EMS workers with up to $600 per year of property tax reductions or other incentives, without those benefits being subject to federal income tax and withholding. This would ease the administrative burden that local departments sometimes face when they reward their volunteers. We also want to help first responders save for retirement. For years, local and state governments have provided their volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel with different forms of benefits, including Length of Service Award Programs, commonly known as These are pension-like benefits for volunteer emergency responders.  Our second bill, the LOSAP Cap Act, would help communities recruit and retain volunteer firefighters by increasing the annual cap on contributions to their retirement accounts to $6,000, and allowing for adjustments for inflation.  As we begin the complicated process of reforming our nation's tax code, I believe we should take care to protect those who serve this country with such bravery. That is why Senator Cardin and I have introduced these bills today, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting them.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,2121,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,25.0,July

All banks, large and small, should be well-capitalized and properly regulated, but that does not mean that our financial regulators must impose a ``one size fits all'' regulatory regime across the board without regard to the risks posed to the financial system by banks with fundamentally different business models and of vastly different sizes.  Some regulations that are appropriate or essential for larger banks may make no sense when applied to community banks. For example, current law requires community banks to demonstrate that they are in compliance with the Volcker Rule--which restricts proprietary trading and hedge fund investments by banks--even though community banks rarely engage in such trading. Even so, community banks must shoulder the burden of complying with this complex regulation. My bill would allow the regulators to exempt community banks from the Volcker  As the GAO has noted, smaller banks are ``disproportionately affected by increased regulation, because they are less able to absorb additional costs.'' These costs are significant. According to industry representatives, the cost of complying with regulations absorbs 12 percent of total bank operating expenses, and is two-and-a-half times greater for small banks than for large banks.  The cost of regulation puts community banks at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis larger banks. Over the past two decades, the share of the U.banking industry represented by community banks has declined from 40 percent to just 18 percent. Over the same period, the share of the market represented by the five largest banks has grown from roughly 18 percent to 46 percent. I am concerned that unnecessary regulation will accelerate these trends, and ironically, contribute to the further consolidation of the banking industry into a handful of ``too big to fail'' banks.  Community banks play an essential role in meeting the credit needs of their customers, particularly small businesses, homeowners, and farmers. Although community banks represent just 18 percent of total banking assets, they are responsible for half of our nation's small business loans. With small business formation at generational lows, it is essential that we preserve and protect their access to credit, as they are the major driver of job creation in our country. In addition, community banks provide three-fourths of our nation's agricultural loans, a line of finance that requires highly specialized knowledge of farming and a long-term perspective suited to agricultural cycles.  Regulators should be able to tailor their regulations to take the distinctive nature of community banks into account. My bill would allow regulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and burdensome regulations where it is in the public interest to do so. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,2121,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,25.0,July
9212,topic-id,482,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, I rise in support of H.1973, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, for several reasons.  Most importantly, this is a reasonable bill and is intended to help protect young athletes from abuse and preserve the sanctity of sports associated with the U.Olympic Committee, the organization responsible for preparing and training young athletes who might one day represent their country competitively all over the world.  Children deserve to fully enjoy the innocence of their youth--by exploring the curiosities of the world, taking pleasure in the arts, and participating in sports--free from hurt, harm, or danger.  Involvement in sports, and instruction and guidance from adult coaches, can positively influence a young person's growth and development, as well as his or her potential for future success into adulthood.  The sexual abuse of children and youth is intolerable in any text, and we must take appropriate measures to eliminate it from youth sports. Such exploitation betrays and harms young people, sometimes severely and irreparably.  Young people look to adults to protect them and keep them safe. We all have a responsibility to do so.  With H.1973, we have an opportunity to ensure that individuals abide by this duty. Existing Federal law requires certain professionals, such as[[Page H4576]]doctors, dentists, social workers, psychologists, teachers, and daycare workers, who regularly interact with children, to report suspected abuse to law enforcement.  While our discussion of this legislation today may focus primarily on sexual abuse, H.1973 will require adults who interact with young athletes, in connection to national governing bodies of various sports, to report suspected abuse of any kind.  The need for this legislation is best illustrated by an ongoing scandal of widespread abuse and exploitation of young gymnasts over the course of 20 years within USA Gymnastics, a prominent governing body of the U.Olympic  Many complaints of sexual and emotional abuse went unreported, allowing coaches, instructors, and doctors to repeatedly victimize gymnasts as young as 6 years old. The shocking failure of anyone to report accusations through law enforcement, or even keep track of complaints internally, made it possible for some of these predators to commit horrific acts at several gyms in several states.  For example, a cloud of allegations of abuse surrounded one particular physician in Michigan going back as far as 1997. Regrettably, allegations against him were not reported to law enforcement until recently. Following the first public complaint against him in 2015, more than 100 women have filed complaints accusing him of sexual abuse, and he now faces more than 20 criminal charges in both Federal and State courts.  While the USA Gymnastics scandal is unfortunate, let it be an example and incentive to prevent such pervasive abuse elsewhere.  Accordingly, I encourage my colleagues to join me and my chairman in supporting this important legislation.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

He was born on the Crow Indian Reservation in eastern Montana and traveled across the U.while pursuing his education. In 1939, Medicine Crow earned his master's degree from the University of Southern California, becoming the first member of the Crow Tribe to attain that credential. In 1943 he joined the United States While serving as an Army scout during World War II, Medicine Crow fulfilled the four requirements to become a war chief. While fighting against the German forces he led a war party, stole an enemy horse, disarmed an enemy, and touched an enemy without killing him. Later in life he served as the Crow tribal historian, received multiple honorary doctorate degrees, and spoke at venues across the He was the last Crow war chief, and his passing last April, at the age of 102, was a loss to our For his lifetime of service to the Crow Tribe, the State of Montana, and to United States, Medicine Crow was awarded the Presidential Medal of  The Billings Community Based Specialty Clinic located on Majestic Lane will be designated in honor of Benjamin Charles Mr.Steele is remembered by Montanans as a ranch hand, teacher, artist, and Bataan Death March survivor. Born and raised in Montana, he joined the U.Army Air Corps in 1940. After he was captured by the Japanese, Mr.Steele's sturdy fortitude helped him endure a 66-mile trek in the Philippines, a prisoner ship, and a forced labor camp. He was a prisoner of war in the Pacific Theater of World War II for a total of 1,244 days. Using charcoal to sketch on concrete, he withstood the harsh treatment in captivity and honed his artistic talents. His artistic expressions were captured on contraband paper, and some of the works he created in captivity were preserved and went on tour through the Nation after the war. In August of last year, we lost a warrior-artist when Mr.Steele passed away at his home in Montana at the age of 98.  The World War II generation produced many heroes. In 2016, Montana lost three of our greatest heroes when Thatcher, Medicine Crow and Steele completed their earthly tours of duty.

9137,topic-id,1131,"Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling Students This bill takes an important step toward addressing the student debt crisis in It would once again treat private student loans like nearly all other forms of private unsecured debt and permit these loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.  Student loan debt has reached an astronomical $1.4 trillion--more than double what it was in 2008. Student loan debt is now the second largest form of consumer debt in America, after only mortgage debt. The balance of student loan debt is larger than credit card and auto loan debt. Currently, around 44 million borrowers hold student loan debt, with an average balance of roughly $30,000.  This past weekend, the New York Times published an editorial that clearly and concisely describes the student debt crisis that we face. The editorial is titled ``Student Debt's Grip on the Economy,'' and I ask consent to place it into the As the editorial points out, ``student debt has become a drag on graduates' hopes and a threat to economic growth.''  This editorial reports that as college costs have continued to increase, wages have not kept pace. Students continue to take out larger amounts in loans to afford the rising costs of college. This crushing student loan debt has forced young people to delay making important life decisions like getting married and economic investments such as home ownership. We are also seeing an increase in the wealth gap between college graduates with student debt and those without student debt. The burdens of student debt are threatening the notion that being college-educated is enough to get ahead. As the editorial notes, ``the fallout from these burdens, afflicting those who are supposedly best prepared to face and shape the future, is not only a personal financial issue but also a social and economic one.''  These burdens are even more significant for students who have taken out private student loans. Federal student loans have fixed, affordable interest rates, and a variety of consumer protections including forbearance in times of economic hardship and manageable repayment options. Private loans, on the other hand, frequently have high, variable interest rates, and they lack the repayment options and protections that federal loans offer. In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that the outstanding private student loan debt in America was $165 billion, at least $8 billion of which was then in default. As it turns out, many students were steered into costly private student loans by for-profit colleges, often when the students still had eligibility for lower-cost federal loans.  One of those students is a woman named Marta, from Chicago, who wrote to me about her story and asked me to only use her first name. Marta came to the United States from Poland in 1994 with her family, hoping for a better life. She is a U.citizen now, and has a family of her own. As an aspiring designer, Marta wanted to enroll in a college that would help launch her career. So after meeting a recruiter at a college fair from the now-closing, for-profit Harrington College of Art and Design, she enrolled in the fall of 2004. At the urging of the recruiter, she signed the enrollment paperwork and began courses. Being the first in her family to attend college, she did not know the difference between private and federal student loans. The recruiter assured her that the paperwork was just part of the normal college enrollment process.  It was only after she graduated that Marta learned that in signing the paperwork the recruiter gave her, she had taken out a combination of federal student loans and much riskier and more expensive private student loans. She now has over $120,000 in student debt, the majority of which is in private student loans. The monthly payments are overwhelming and Marta worries about what this crushing debt means for her family's future. Thanks to high-interest rates, her private loans continue to grow despite doing her best to make her payments.  Marta enrolled in college to get a good career and widen her future opportunities. But she has been left with enormous debt from a failed for-profit college. And now she is struggling and needs a fair chance to get back on her feet. There are stories like Marta's in every corner of And it's time to do something about it.  Today I am reintroducing the Fairness for Struggling Students This bill would restore the bankruptcy code's pre-2005 treatment of private student loans.  Since 2005, private student loans have enjoyed a privileged status under the bankruptcy code: they cannot be discharged in bankruptcy except in extremely limited circumstances. Only a few other types of private unsecured debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy--criminal fines, child support, back taxes and alimony. In contrast, nearly all types of private unsecured debt, including credit card and medical debt, are dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Congress had no good reason to make private student loans non-dischargeable in 2005. It was a provision that was quietly slipped into a broader bankruptcy reform bill with little debate and no justification. There was no evidence that private student loan borrowers had abused the bankruptcy system to avoid repayment before 2005. But, since the law changed in 2005, lenders have been incentivized to extend expensive private student loans to students that the students cannot repay and that they can never escape. This is overwhelming for students and an impairment on our overall economy.  The Fairness for Struggling Students Act will make important relief available to students being crushed by private student loan debt, and will discourage private lenders from extending risky loans.[[Page S3218]]  This bill is supported by a large coalition of educational, student, civil rights and consumer organizations including the American Association of Community Colleges, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, American Association of University Women, American Council on Education, American Federation of Teachers, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, Center for Responsible Lending, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Demos, Empire Justice Center, NAACP, National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income clients), National Association of College Admission Counseling, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, National Consumers League, Public Citizen, The Institute for College Access and Success, UNCF, and Young  I want to thank the cosponsors of this bill, Senators Whitehouse, Franken, Blumenthal, Hirono, Warren, Reed, Wyden, Baldwin, Hassan, Kaine, and Murphy for their support, and I hope more of my colleagues will join us.  This is just one step of what we need to do to get control of the student debt crisis in our country. But it is a critical step, and it is long overdue.

9173,topic-id,824,"Mr.President, the Trump administration released its fiscal year 2018 budget this morning. For all the talk on the campaign trail of standing up for the forgotten Americans in this country, the President's budget takes aim at the exact programs that many rely on. From healthcare and food stamps to student loans and disability, President Trump's budget is nothing less than an assault on seniors, low-income Americans, children, and the disabled.  The President's budget calls for more than $3.6 trillion in cuts to Federal spending over the next 10 years, with more than $1 trillion of these cuts coming from some of the most vital programs in our Nation's social safety net. Nothing is more essential to our Nation's low-income, disabled, and elderly Americans than Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as But the President's budget slashes more than $600 billion from Medicaid, despite the President's repeated promises on the campaign trail to protect the program. More than 3 million people in my State--20 percent of the people who live there--currently depend on the Medicaid Program for healthcare, including 1.5 million children and more than 300,000 seniors and disabled people.  The budget cuts $193 billion from SNAP by making it harder for people to qualify for this assistance in putting food on the table. Forty-four million children, disabled, and low-income people around the country accessed food through the SNAP program last year.  Also weakened in the President's budget is the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant that helps States provide financial assistance to families who are literally struggling to survive. And the budget cuts about 20 percent of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, providing health insurance for poor children. Isn't that incredible? The President doesn't believe that is a priority--health insurance for poor children.  It is often said that the President's budget reflects our values, and this budget shows that President Trump clearly values tax cuts for the upper income individuals in America over the lives of poor and middle-class  The President's budget also includes historic cuts in nondefense discretionary spending. Over the next 10 years, President Trump proposes to cut domestic spending so significantly that spending on defense would exceed spending on domestic priorities by almost $300 billion. To pay for an increase in defense spending and to build his big, beautiful wall, the President would slash funding from programs essential to hard-working Americans--programs that support affordable housing, home heating bills, Meals on Wheels, student loans, clean drinking water, preserving the Great Lakes, early childhood education, and infrastructure.  Even medical research is on the Trump chopping block. President Trump has proposed cutting one-fifth of the budget for the National Institutes of Health, including $1 billion from the National Cancer President Obama, with Vice President Biden, with strong bipartisan support, put together a moonshot--a Cancer Moonshot--to do something significant in cancer research. President Trump's budget virtually eliminates it.  NIH has helped cut U.cancer death rates by 11 percent in women and 19 percent in men. It has helped ensure HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence. It contributed to the near eradication of polio and smallpox, but make no mistake, these changes didn't just happen. They occurred because of sustained Federal investment in medical research.  I salute my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Roy Blunt, the Appropriations subcommittee chair when it comes to For 2 straight years now, 2 fiscal years, he has given more than 5 percent real growth in NIH spending. I have praised him on the floor and back home and publicly over and over again. That Republican Senator, and many Democratic Senators, stood together because we believe in medical research. The Trump budget does not.  We cannot afford these devastating cuts, and we can't afford to sit on our hands and face the millions of families across America who count on us to have the right priorities. Clearly, the President's budget is far from a new foundation for American greatness. This budget would have a devastating impact on Americans most in need of a helping hand, on everything from healthcare to food access, to quality education and affordable housing.  They always say the President's budget is dead on arrival. This budget, I hope, will be dead on arrival. It doesn't deserve the light of day or a breath of life.  We need to come together, as we did in this year's budget, on a bipartisan basis, order the priorities that America sent us to prioritize, and then work together to pass it. I hope it is done on a bipartisan basis. That is what America wants, both parties to work together. We can do it. We did it for this fiscal year. We can do it for the next, but our first step in reaching an agreement is to make sure there is a sound rejection of President Trump's budget. His budget will not make America great again.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-23-pt1-PgS3102.txt,326,71 LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATION CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION,2017.0,23.0,July

In reality, this legislation only worsens the significant problem of wage theft. Violators of our wage and hour laws do not need another way to cheat workers out of their pay, but that is exactly what H.1180 gives them.  The problem of wage theft has reached epidemic proportions, and overtime violations are too common. All H.1180 does is give dishonest employers who want to steal workers' paychecks any number of smoke screens--like denying requested and hard-earned time off because it would be an undue burden to business operations--to hide behind.  Further, we know from experience that significant litigation over payment of wages owed under comp time programs in the public sector exist. Yet this legislation includes no additional funding for the Department of Labor to enforce or implement these provisions.  Even worse, this legislation is being considered while President Trump has proposed a severe 21 percent budget cut to It simply makes no sense to give unscrupulous employers another mechanism for stealing workers' hard-earned paychecks while providing no additional resources for employees who need help recovering their stolen pay.

9141,topic-id,1266,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Drone Federalism Act of 2017. ========================= END NOTE =========================   In recent years, small unmanned aircraft have emerged as a transformative new technology. These devices--more commonly known as drones--are highly capable, commercially available, and operable even by novice consumers.  The way that drones are flown in the daily life of our communities and in such great numbers has raised new challenges for safety, privacy, and security that demand cooperation between the federal, state, and local governments.  Today, drone operations present an astounding array of challenges. In just two years, over 2,500 drone incidents have been reported to the Federal Aviation Administration, or The most recent year of data, from October 2015 to October 2016, saw the number of incidents surge 166% over the prior year. In addition, there have been some[[Page S3220]]alarming reports. On February 26th, 2017, a drone crashed through the 27th floor window of a Manhattan apartment building in New York The next month, on March 28th, a drone crashed through the 23rd floor window of City Hall in Buffalo, New Drones have repeatedly interfered with medical helicopters. On May 1st, 2016, a medevac helicopter trying to land at Florida Hospital East in Orlando was forced to abort its initial landing because of a drone. On November 14, 2015, a helicopter leaving children's hospital in Louis, Missouri had to take evasive action to avoid a drone, banking 60 degrees. Drones also interfere with emergency wild fire fighting. On April 30, 2017, multiple drones filming the Opera fire in Riverside, California forced firefighting helicopters to suspend operations. This happened eight times in 2015, and another eight times in 2016, in California alone. Drones have also crashed into the Golden Gate Bridge, including twice last month. On April 1st, a drone flown almost two miles beyond line of site fell from the sky into a lane of traffic, only a few feet from the crowded sidewalk. Again on April 9th, another drone flown beyond line of site crashed one of the bridge's towers.  These incidents are occurring throughout the nation, but each state has faced its own challenges. Half of all reported incidents came from just five States: California, Florida, New York, Texas, and New  In fact, one-fifth of all drone incidents reported to the FAA occurred in What works for protecting urban areas will be different than what is needed in rural areas.  The current legal framework for managing the airspace, which evolved over a century of manned aviation, is a poor fit for these new challenges. Drones bear little resemblance to the manned aircraft that came before them.  First, drones intrude into the everyday life of our communities in a way that airplanes do not. Airplanes fly into and out of airports, and municipalities can try through zoning to minimize disruptions. Drones, on the other hand, can take flight from any location, can hover anonymously overhead, and are often used to film whatever aspect of public or private life may catch the operator's interest of the operator's.  Second, drones are seldom engaged in interstate commerce once they have been purchased. Short communication range and limited battery life means that commercially available drones are almost always operated locally, and are unlikely to be operated across state lines.  Third, there are far more drones than there are airplanes. Already, more than 750,000 drones have been registered, and the FAA anticipates up to 4 million drones by 2020. By contrast, there are little more than 200,000 manned aircraft registered in the United                           WHAT THE BILL DOES  The Drone Federalism Act would address the modern challenges of drone operations and provide a clear legal framework to regulate drones. The bill has three provisions.  First, the bill preserves the authority of State, Tribal, and local governments to issue reasonable restrictions on the time, manner, and place of drone operations within 200 feet of the ground or a structure. These could include speed limits, local no-fly zones, temporary restrictions, and prohibitions on reckless or drunk operators, for example.  There are regulations that the FAA must issue uniformly throughout the country to ensure the safety and efficiency of the national airspace. This bill does not interfere with that authority. However, the bill does require the FAA to consider legitimate state and local interests when exercising preemption, and to respect any reasonable additional low-altitude restrictions that state and local governments choose to impose.  Second, the bill reaffirms that the federal government will respect private property rights to the airspace in the immediate reaches above a property, including at least the first 200 feet. Neither Congress nor the FAA may authorize drone operations immediately over property without the owner's permission.  Third, the bill promotes cooperation between the levels of government by directing the FAA to partner with a diverse group of cities and States to test out different approaches and report on best practices.              STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATE DRONES  The Drone Federalism Act is consistent with the recent action taken by States to regulate drone operations. In response to drone incidents and the concerns of their communities, lawmakers throughout the country have identified the need for a variety of new approaches to managing drones. Indeed, at least 38 States are considering drone legislation this year, according to the National Conference of State  These proposals include: definitions of harassment and voyeurism, airport protections, penalties for interfering with emergency responders, protections against the delivery of contraband at prisons, bans on flights over football games, and definitions of aerial trespass, among others.  This exercise of the laboratories of democracy is appropriate. Our communities should not have to rely on an already overburdened federal agency to craft specific regulatory protections for every local context, supply on-the-ground enforcement agents, or pursue complicated civil cases in court for every infraction. Local police should be empowered to issue citations akin to a traffic violation for clear-cut infractions, without having to prove an action meets a vague tort law standards of negligence and harm. There should be no question that a State has a right to prevent drones from interfering with emergency responders or delivering contraband into prisons; to criminalize hit-and-runs, voyeurism, stalking, or harassment with a drone; to allow judges to deny drones to sex offenders.  Neither should there be any question that a State or municipality has a right to restrict the use of drones where it would be hazardous. Just as the federal government has banned drone operations over Federal Parks, States should have the option to protect State parks. Just as the Federal Government banned flights over sensitive areas, like the entire Capital region, cities should have the option to protect schools or other sensitive areas of their own. Just as the Federal Government can impose temporary flight restrictions over major sporting events or airshows, a county should have the option to protect its summer fairgrounds or holiday parade route.                               CONCLUSION  The Drone Federalism Act that I am introducing today, along with Senators Lee, Blumenthal, and Cotton, is a proactive, affirmative solution. It recognizes the federal interest in protecting the safety and efficiency of the national airspace, while also respecting private property rights, Tribal sovereignty, the powers reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment, and the general principle of local self-determination.  This bill will invite the democratic participation of government at every level, avoid the need for years of litigation about the scope of preemption, and enable effective local enforcement. It is incumbent on Congress to provide clarity and to guarantee all sides an equal voice moving forward.  This bipartisan bill is the way to do that.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,1332,WASHINGTON STATE BOY SCOUTS JAMBOREE TROOP 3218,2017.0,25.0,July
9142,topic-id,649,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce the Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act with my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Durbin, Tillis, and  Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana. In many instances parents, after exhausting other treatment options, have turned to CBD to as a last resort to treat their children who have intractable epilepsy. Anecdotally, CBD has produced positive results.  However, due to existing barriers and the fact that marijuana is a schedule I drug, rigorous research that is needed to better understand the long-term[[Page S3221]]safety and efficacy of CBD as a medicine, as well as the correct dosing and potential interaction with other medications, is lacking.  The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to both reduce these barriers and spur additional research to ensure that CBD and other marijuana-derived medications are based on the most up to date scientific evidence. It also provides a pathway for the manufacture and distribution of FDA-approved drugs that are based on this research.  It does this while maintaining safeguards to protect against illegal diversion.  First, the bill directs the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to complete a scientific and medical evaluation of CBD within 1 year. Based on this evaluation, the legislation directs the Department of Justice to make a scheduling recommendation for CBD that is independent of marijuana. This may include transferring the schedule of CBD to another schedule, or removing it from the list of controlled substances altogether. A scheduling recommendation for CBD that is independent of marijuana has never been done before.  Second, without sacrificing appropriate oversight, it streamlines the regulatory process for marijuana research. In particular, it improves regulations dealing with changes to approved quantities of marijuana needed for research and approved research protocols. It also expedites the Drug Enforcement Administration registration process for researching CBD and marijuana.  Third, this legislation seeks to increase medical research on CBD, while simultaneously reducing the stigma associated with conducting research on a schedule I drug. It does so by explicitly authorizing medical and osteopathic schools, research universities, practitioners and pharmaceutical companies to use a schedule II Drug Enforcement Administration registration to conduct authorized medical research on  Fourth, the bill allows medical schools, research institutions, practitioners, and pharmaceutical companies to produce the marijuana they need for authorized medical research. This will ensure that researchers have access to the material they need to develop proven, effective medicines. Once the FDA approves these medications, the bill allows pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and distribute them.  Fifth, the bill allows parents who have children with intractable epilepsy, as well as adults with intractable epilepsy, to possess and transport CBD or other nonpsychoactive components of marijuana used to treat this disease while research is ongoing. To do so, parents and adults must provide documentation that they or their child have been treated by a board-certified neurologist for at least 6 months. They must also have documentation that the neurologist has attested that other treatment options have been exhausted and that the potential benefits outweigh the harms of using these nonpsychoactive components of marijuana. The neurologist must also agree to monitor the patient for potential adverse reactions.  Finally, because existing Federal research is severely lacking, the bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to expand, intensify, and coordinate research to determine the potential medical benefits of CBD or other marijuana-derived medications on serious medical conditions.  The 2016 National Academy of Sciences report, titled ``The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research'' underscored the need to reduce research barriers, increase the supply of CBD and marijuana for research purposes, and address existing research gaps.  The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to do just this.  This bill is critical to helping families across the country as they seek safe, effective medicines for serious illnesses. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,1332,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,25.0,April

9245,topic-id,553,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today I rise in strong support of H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is about freedom, flexibility, and fairness. The freedom for workers to choose what is best for themselves and their families, more flexibility for men and women to balance work, life, and family, and greater fairness in how Federal policies treat workers and families.  Under the legislation, private sector workers who are eligible for overtime pay would be able to choose between cash wages or paid time off. This simple choice will help improve the lives of many hardworking  This option has long been available to government workers. More than 30 years ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to amend an outdated Federal law and provide public sector employees more workplace flexibility.                              {time}  1545  That is why comp time is a popular benefit enjoyed today by police officers, firefighters, and other State and local government employees. But the Federal Government still denies many private sector workers the same opportunity. This double standard simply isn't fair. It is time to level the playing field for those in the private sector.  Despite what we will hear from the other side of the aisle today, all we are doing is empowering workers with a choice. For some workers, more money in the bank may be the best choice for them. Nothing--I repeat, nothing--in this bill will take away that right.  But other workers, if given the choice, would seize the opportunity to turn their overtime hours into paid time off. There are single parents who need more flexibility to spend time with their children; students who are struggling to juggle college and a full-time job; and a growing number of individuals need more time to care for an aging relative.  Time is precious, yet Democrats in Congress think the Federal Government should decide how people use it. They think they know what is best for workers and their families. In the name of protecting workers, our colleagues and their so-called progressive allies have denied workers this choice for years. They continue to ignore the bill's strong protections, including several that are more robust than what is available in the public sector.  The bill preserves the 40-hour workweek, and comp time would accrue at the same time-and-a-half rate as cash wages. The legislation also requires a written comp time agreement between each individual worker and his or her employer, or between a worker's union and employer.  Additionally, workers can cash out their comp time at any time and for any reason. Employers who force their employees into a comp time arrangement would face costly penalties, and the Department of Labor would have full authority to crack down on bad actors.  Mr.Speaker, by providing more freedom and flexibility, we can improve the quality of life of many We have an opportunity to make a positive difference in people's lives simply by getting the Federal Government out of the way and allowing individuals to choose what is best for themselves and their families.  I want to thank Representative Roby for championing this effort, and I urge all Members to vote in favor of freedom, flexibility, and fairness for the American people by supporting H.1180.

This bill is giving workers the freedom to choose. I want to reiterate that.  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always big on giving women, in particular, the right to choose when it comes to abortions. This gives women and men both a right to choose when it comes to their time; and, to me, there is no more commodity more precious to us than our time.  I also want to say that our colleagues have said there are no meaningful rights that they don't already have. Well, Mr.Speaker, if the workers in the private sector already had these rights, we wouldn't be putting this law up for a vote.  Our colleague from Illinois, a few minutes ago, outlined all these wonderful benefits that the public sector employees have, and she is right. The private sector people would love to have the same rights that the public sector people have that are paid for by hardworking taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We have heard from our colleagues that we are just not doing enough for working people, and we have also heard from our colleagues that all employers are evil people.  I tell you, Mr.Speaker, it is astonishing to me that we have as many people working in this country as we do under all these evil employers. They must have run into just the worst people in the world. I don't ever run into people like that. Everybody I know that has employees is cherishing them because they need them, and they treat them right.  They have often said there are other things that we can do. But, Mr.Speaker, we have this bill in front of us, and it gives workers something that our colleagues cannot give them: the freedom to choose and to have more time.  Edward Everett Hale said: ``I am only one; but still I am one. I cannot do everything; but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.''  That is what this bill does. Congresswoman Roby has introduced a bill--and many people have signed on--that will do one thing for people in the private sector. It will give them the same rights that people in the public sector have, to turn overtime into comp time.  It is a pro-worker, pro-family proposal that will make a positive difference in the lives of many The Federal Government shouldn't stand in the way of more flexibility in the workplace.

It is the same story we have heard for years in an effort to deny workers the freedom to do what is best for them based on their own values. However, the concerns we heard have been addressed. This bill provides very strong worker protections to ensure the decision to choose comp time is voluntary. It gives workers a choice and puts them in control of their time.  Let's vote in favor of freedom and flexibility for American workers today. Let's give private sector employees the same choice that government workers have.

But he wasn't so much crazed as he was driven by a radical Islamic agenda, the same radical Islamic agenda that caused 30 million, mostly Muslim, Egyptians to rise up. Coming near the anniversary of that event in Egypt, the greatest peaceful uprising in the history of the world, the Egyptians said: We don't want a Muslim brother, we don't want a radical Islamist controlling our country.  It was rather tragic that the shooter--and I don't want to give him any more notoriety than necessary, so I won't mention his name--was not a lone wolf, as is so often supposed and we were led to believe repeatedly during the Obama administration. But as Reporter Patrick Poole indicates, he was yet another known wolf. The FBI knew he was and the local law enforcement knew who he was, which brings me to a point I wanted to discuss tonight.  Robert Mueller is the special prosecutor who now needs to resign. He was the FBI Director that had the FBI training materials purged so FBI agents could not know what they were looking for in a radical He changed the training. He purged it to please the Council on American-Islamic  As one intelligence officer said: We blinded ourselves of the ability to see our enemy.  That is what FBI Director Robert Mueller did.  When challenged in a hearing where I was questioning him over the pitiful investigation of the Tsarnaev older brother after Russia had notified us twice in the United States of his radicalization, after the second time, finally, ho-hum, Mueller's FBI not being adequately trained to recognize what a radical Islamist believes, how they act, what they do, what they are studying, what they are memorizing, what they wear, what their personal appearance is, they are not trained to recognize, they didn't know what they were looking for.                              {time}  2100  They didn't know what they were looking for. They go out. The best we can find out, they talked to Tsarnaev, and he said, ``No, I'm not a terrorist,'' basically.  So, not knowing what else to do, since Mueller had destroyed the proper training to recognize radical Islamists, they went and talked to his mother who assured them, ``No, he's a good boy; he's not a terrorist,'' and the result was people murdered and maimed at the Boston  The result of the FBI going after those who would try to teach others what real radical Islam was, the results of dumbing down the FBI and their ability to spot people who wanted to kill others in the name of Allah: people killed at Boston, people killed in And it wasn't any more the fault of guns in Orlando than it was the fault of a white truck in  It is the people who use those weapons to kill; otherwise, it is a matter of defense, the great equalizer. The truck is a great means of conveyance.  But Robert Mueller has created problems for this country, and there are a lot of people that are buried now. Perhaps they would, perhaps they would not be deceased if Robert Mueller had done his job and had been as concerned about finding radical Islamists in America as he was--as he told me, they didn't go to the Boston mosque where Tsarnaev surely gave evidence of being radicalized. That is not his words. I said: You didn't even go to the mosque to find out, to talk, to investigate.  The best he could do is come back and say: We did go to that mosque as part of our outreach program, part of the lovely sit down, chat, have some tea, whatever--I don't know what they had, water, whatever it was--make merry, chat. While Tsarnaev was plotting to murder many people, as many as he could at the Boston Marathon, Bob Mueller and his FBI are making merry at the Boston mosque that he did not even know who started it. I asked him that. He didn't know.  I said: Did you even know that al-Hamoudi started that mosque? No, he didn't know that. Al-Hamoudi is doing 23 years--23 years--in Federal prison for supporting terrorism. And as I understand, I had heard that that was more to the credit not of Mueller's folks, but of help from How ironic is that?  But I see that I have a friend here.

9085,topic-id,2663,"I thank my friend from Texas, a great, noble tribute.  I wish that it were I who was standing here to say glowing things about people that have been running the FBI; but President Trump as a candidate said he wanted to come drain the swamp, and the more we dig, the more it appears to be a swirling cesspool up here.[[Page H4849]]  We had a man who had been running the FBI who came before the Senate, a Senate committee and testified that he did a memo after talking to President Trump, that he had never felt the need to do a memo after talking to President Obama or President Bush or to take notes like he did; but he was afraid that Trump might lie sometime in the future, and so he felt it important to do a memo, to write some notes. That is what he said.  Rather incredibly, he didn't find a need to do a memo after Attorney General Loretta Lynch, according to him, told him what really has to be a lie. She knew that Hillary Clinton was being investigated for a crime. It was a criminal case, a criminal investigation. She directed FBI Director Comey not to use ``investigation,'' use ``matter.'' Well, it was an investigation, and to say anything other than that was a lie.  But how ironic that he was afraid Trump might lie in the future; whereas, he had an Attorney General that made him feel a little uneasy, but he didn't write any notes. So what about his credibility?  Well, he said he took those notes as a recollection refreshed. And those of us that have tried cases, been judges, you know, we know that past recollection recorded can be an exception to the hearsay rule. But if he signed an FBI employment agreement, which people are supposed to sign, it should have included these words: ``All information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remain the property of the United States of I will surrender upon demand by the FBI, or upon my separation from the FBI, all materials containing FBI information in my possession.''  That means that if an FBI agent, Director, FBI employee makes notes, makes a memorandum to refresh his recollection later, it is not a personal piece of property any more than what Sandy Berger stuffed in his socks was personal property to him. It doesn't matter that he prepared it. It was done while being paid by the FBI, on FBI time, regarding FBI matters. As FBI Director, he was talking to the  How ironic, also, we have no memos after President Obama made the basic statement that he didn't think Hillary should be prosecuted. We haven't heard any outcry from the great Director Comey about how wrong that was. What an obstruction of justice by President We didn't hear any of that.  I mean, that is about as direct as you can get when the President was talking on television and told the world, and the fact that you may say it out front to the world doesn't make it any less intimidating or directional than if you look somebody in the face one on one and tell them. It is not a defense to say it on television, and yet he wasn't concerned by that.  So we start looking a little deeper since it appears he wasn't being honest about being his personal property, and you would like to think that he had a good legal education, but Alan Dershowitz has made clear that the FBI--there is nothing wrong if the President tells him we are not prosecuting this individual for this crime. I am pardoning him here and now. He has the power.  All power that Director Comey has is derived from his boss, the So why would he go back and do a memo and consult or, I believe the more proper word is ``collude'' with others at the Justice Department about what the President said?  Because, make no mistake, if any of those individuals at the Justice Department who were colluding with James Comey after he met with the President, if they thought there was an obstruction of justice and they didn't report it as they did not, then they committed a crime. So why would they not report it?  It appears there can only be one answer. Surely they did not intend to commit a crime by misprision of a felony if they really believed it were obstruction. So it appears, since they clearly did not think that there was obstruction of justice in the President's use of the word ``hope,'' then they must have surely applauded James Comey's writing of a memo, writing of notes so that he could pull it out later and use it to go after the There can be no other reason that he did what he did.  He either committed a crime by not reporting obstruction as soon as he possibly could, or he was colluding with his colleagues to bring down the President of the United So, the more we find as we dig, the more of a cesspool it appears to be here in  Mollie Hemingway has done an extraordinary job today from The She goes through, she has an article: ``James Comey Has a Long History of Questionable Obstruction Cases.''  I wish I had remembered these, and I feel a bit guilty that I didn't realize at the time these things were going on, the miscarriage of justice that was occurring at the hands of James Comey and Bob  She brings up Frank Quattrone, ``a banker who Comey pursued relentlessly on banking-related charges without fruition. But while he couldn't find any wrongdoing or criminal conduct, he went after him for supposed `obstruction of justice' because of a single ambiguous email. Sound familiar?  ``Before he was indicted''--talking about Quattrone, before Quattrone was indicted--``Comey made fall statements about Quattrone and his intent. The first trial ended in a hung jury, but the second one got a conviction.  ``That conviction was overturned in 2006. Quattrone was so scarred by the harassment''--by Comey--``he began funding projects designed to help innocent people who are victims of prosecutorial overreach or other problems.''                              {time}  2115  ``He said his motivation for supporting such projects was that at the very moment he was found guilty in the second trial, he realized there must be innocent people in prisons who lacked the financial resources to fight for justice. He also started the Quattrone Center for the Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania Law  ``Quattrone has noted, with interest, the disparities in how he was treated by Comey for a single ambiguous email compared to his handling of Hillary Clinton's email server scandal,'' with thousands, tens of thousands of email.  How about Martha Stewart? ``You might remember Martha Stewart being sent to jail. You might not remember that James Comey was the man who put her there, and not because he was able to charge her for anything he began investigating her for. The original investigation was into whether Stewart had engaged in insider trading. They didn't even try to get her on that charge. Gene Healy wrote about it in 2004, warning about Federal prosecutorial overreach.''  By Comey, of course. He said, ``Comey didn't charge Stewart with insider trading. Instead, he claimed that Stewart's public protestations of innocence were designed to prop up the stock price of her own company . . . and thus constituted securities fraud. Stewart was also charged with making false statements to Federal officials investigating the insider trading charge--a charge they never pursued. In essence, Stewart was prosecuted for `having misled people by denying having committed a crime with which she was not charged,' as Cato Institute Senior Fellow Alan Reynolds put it.  ``The pursuit was described as `vindictive' in The New York Times and `petty and vindictive' in The Daily  ``But she still served a 5-month prison sentence.''  Stephen Hatfill, and this is one that really gets me to my core. I did not remember the outcome, and I feel guilty, but I was handling felony cases back in Texas at the time.  ``The FBI absolutely bungled its investigation into the Anthrax attacker who struck after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Carl Cannon goes through this story well, and it's worth reading for how it involves both Comey and his dear `friend' and current special counsel Robert The FBI tried--in the media--its case against Their actual case ended up being thrown out by the courts:  ``Comey and Mueller badly bungled the biggest case they ever handled. They botched the investigation of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that took five lives and infected 17 other people, shut down the U.Capitol and Washington's mail system, solidified the[[Page H4850]]Bush administration's antipathy for Iraq, and eventually, when the facts finally came out, made the FBI look feckless, incompetent, and easily manipulated by outside political pressure.  ``More from Cannon, recounting how messed up the attempt to convict Steven Hatfill for a crime he didn't commit was:  ``In truth, Hatfill was an implausible suspect from the outset. He was a virologist who never handled anthrax, which is a bacterium. Ivins, by contrast, shared ownership of anthrax patents, was diagnosed as having paranoid personality disorder, and had a habit of stalking and threatening people with anonymous letters--including the woman who provided the long-ignored tip to the So what evidence did the FBI have against Hatfill? There was none, so the agency did a Hail Mary, importing two bloodhounds from California whose handlers claimed could sniff the scent of the killer on the anthrax-tainted letters. These dogs were shown to Hatfill, who promptly petted them. When the dogs responded favorably, their handlers told the FBI that they had `alerted' on Hatfill and that he must be the killer.  ``When Bush administration officials were worried about the quality of the case Mueller and Comey had, the two men assured them. `Comey was ``absolutely certain'' that it was Hatfill,' Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said.  ``Such certitude seems to be Comey's default position in his professional life,'' Cannon wrote. He shouldn't have been certain in this case. After the six years the FBI spent destroying his life, they settled a $4.6 million lawsuit he filed and officially exonerated him.''  Good work, James Comey and Bob You ruined the life of a man with no evidence at all, but told the Bush administration, oh, we are absolutely certain this is the guy.  What about Scooter Libby, and Judith Miller? I didn't remember this: ``After pressuring John Ashcroft--I am reading through the article--``After pressuring John Ashcroft to recuse himself from the responsibility on the grounds of potential conflicts of interest, Comey gave Patrick Fitzgerald, his close personal friend and godfather to one of his children, the role of special counsel into the investigation of the leak of Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA employee. Some conflicts of interest are more important to Comey than others, apparently.  ``Fitzgerald immediately discovered that Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage was the leaker. Of course, the FBI and Department of Justice had known that all along, so Comey's push for a special counsel is . . . intriguing.''  There was no reason for a special counsel. The FBI knew it. The Department of Justice knew it. They pushed for one anyway. Comey was at the middle of it.  Mueller, you know, his close friend, of course, but Fitzgerald was the godfather of one of his children, for heaven's sake.  ``The 3-year investigation was a cloud over the Bush administration''--which didn't seem to bother Comey at all, oh, of course not--``and resulted in nothing but the jailing of a journalist''--who was protecting a source, even though they didn't need it. Wow, how mean-spirited--``. . . and a dubious prosecution of Scooter Libby for, wait for it, obstruction of justice. Comey was unconcerned about the jailing of journalists and never threatened to resign over this infringement on First Amendment freedoms.''  And it talks about Hillary Clinton in this article, but I am telling you, Mr.Speaker, this is a scary time in  You have this article from John Hinderaker, June 10, Power Line, quoting Senator Warner:  ``And so, in all of your experience''--he is talking to Director Comey--``this was the only President that you felt like, in every meeting, you needed to document, because at some point, using your words, he might put out a non-truthful representation of that meeting?''  Comey says: ``That's right, Senator.''  He goes on: ``. . . I had a one-on-one meeting with President Bush about a very important and difficult national security matter.  ``I didn't write a memo documenting that conversation either--sent a quick email to my staff to let them know there was something going on, but I didn't feel, with President Bush, the need to document it in that way, again, because of--the combination of those factors just wasn't present with either President Bush or Obama.''  This article goes on to point out that is simply not true. That was a lie.  And whoever remembered that a book named ``Angler'' was written by Barton Gellman, with Comey as his big chief source, went so far as to be able to quote the conversation after working with Comey, and in the footnotes from the ``Angler,'' it says: ``Quotations from the Bush-Comey conversations are taken verbatim from unclassified notes describing Comey's report of the meeting shortly afterward.''  But Comey's email that he says he just let them know that there was something going on, here is what he said in his email, because it was printed in ``Angler.''  ``The President just took me into his private office for a 15-minute, one-on-one talk. Told him he was being misled and poorly served. We had a very full and frank exchange. Don't know that either of us can see a way out. He promised he would shut down 5/6 if Congress didn't fix Told him Mueller was about to resign. He just pulled Bob into his office.''  Yeah, he didn't just say something was going on. He told him what happened. He memorialized that visit with a note, and then in the book, it is word-for-word, according to Mr.Comey, what was said, and it makes him to be out all American, clean, honest, upstanding, fine law enforcement officer, when it turns out he was anything but that.  ``The real pattern,'' as it says here at the end of the article is that, ``Comey is a snake in the grass who creates tendentious, self-serving memos that can later be used to cover his own rear end or to discredit presidents, but only if they are Republicans.''  Gellman's phrasing was clumsy in the article, but this is serious stuff that it turns out, oh, four members of Mueller's team have donated to Well, isn't that cozy? Comey closely coordinated with Mueller on Trump testimony. We heard from the FBI Director that he actually did collude with other members at the Justice  It is so clear. There are people at the Justice Department out to get President Trump, out to get Attorney General They are out to get every one of them, and just the way they did, the man they said there was no question was the culprit in killing people with anthrax, that was a lie.  And they don't care who gets hurt. It is time to dismiss the special prosecutor; see if we really need one because now we know that Comey manipulated the system exactly the way he manipulated it when he told John Ashcroft he should recuse himself so he could appoint Patrick Fitzgerald, give him the appointment, that is.  Enough is enough of Comey, of It is time to drain the swamp, and they will go down the drain when we do.

Sometimes it hasn't been all that civil, but it has been a place where the rules were supposed to be enforced.  I know there are all kinds of wild allegations being thrown around. People seem to enjoy throwing them at this White House, but I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to the President this week. This has been a very big week, as an article by Kaitlan Collins from The Daily Caller points out: our President hosting three foreign leaders this week in what could be a big moment for foreign policy. Well, this was dated April 2.  One guest that he invited that I am so grateful that President Trump invited was the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-It has been my privilege with some of our other colleagues, and I have had other occasions alone to visit with him in I am just so grateful he was invited because Egypt is doing everything it can. The leaders of Egypt right now are doing all they can to try to prevent an international caliphate that is dominated and enforced by radical  In years past, when I brought up that there are some radical Islamists who are wanting to create a new Ottoman Empire--and I think it is an indictment of some of our schools, both secondary and college level, that more people are not familiar with world history. So I referred some reporters to a map. Go look at a map, look at where the Ottoman Empire was, look at what countries were included in that empire, and look at what the Islamic State is trying to do, what al-Qaida had tried to do, and what radical Islam, with really Muslim Brotherhood playing a powerful role in trying to create part of that caliphate, you look at what they have done, advances made, and it is very clear that those who wanted a new Ottoman Empire that many thought was over 100 years or so ago, we would never see the rise of radical Islam controlling so much of north Africa and  Then, of course, during World War II, radical Islamists raised their heads. They had something in common with Many don't realize that radical Islamist leaders were allied with Hitler because they shared what? A common hatred for Jewish people. They both wanted Jewish people annihilated. They wanted a genocide. They wanted them wiped off the In the early days, the United States, to our discredit, did not do enough to help the[[Page H2780]]Jewish people who were the target of that genocide, both by radical Islamists but largely led by Hitler himself.  So when that great June uprising in Egypt that was completely peaceful by the Egyptian people--the only real violence was instigated by the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Muslim Brotherhood continues to this very day to plot and to strategize to try to take back over the country of With over 90 million people or so in Egypt with such a critical location, the Nile River running through Egypt, being right there at the Suez Canal, being right there at the gate of the Middle East, being at the gate to north Africa from the east, it is a critical linchpin for any radical Islamist who wants to start with a caliphate.  Of course, the true radicals, though they have some disagreements over what real radical Islam is, they all agree that to get back this worldwide caliphate, we actually must get Egypt back under radical Islamic control.  Having met President el-Sisi, visited on a number of occasions, even before he was President, this is a man who wants to do the will of the people. He is also a man who has 20/20 vision when it comes to looking at the Muslim  It was rather tragic when President Obama and two Republican Senators started putting pressure on the 30-plus million Egyptians who made clear that despite Morsi, the Muslim brother leader who allegedly was elected despite the claims of fraud in the election that were not followed up on because of the threats that were made by the Muslim brothers that if you contest this election, we will burn Egypt down.  But the 30 million after the election, once they saw Morsi was acting extra-constitutionally, he was taking powers that didn't belong to him, really kind of following the model of Chavez in Venezuela where, yeah, he got elected, and then he used that position to start knocking off and eliminating competition, pulling powers under himself. Morsi was doing that. And, of course, there is video of him taking marching orders from a radical Islamic leader. So some think he was more of a puppet at the whims of radical Islamic leaders.  But that was such an incredible day for the world, when 30 million Egyptians, moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, secularists, they went to the street. Some people are not aware, yes, there are Jews in There is a millennia of history there. But they went to the street, and as I have mentioned before, Mr.Speaker, the Pope there in Cairo has told me on more than one occasion just how deeply emotionally moving it was to have secularists, Muslims, and Jews come up to him and say there in the streets as they marched together peacefully: We are so sorry for the way you have been treated by the Muslim We are so sorry for the persecution that our leaders have inflicted upon you and Christians here in  What a great day for the world when they demanded, peacefully but demanded, the removal of the President who would be king, Muslim brother  And now we still have some in this country, former President Obama and others, who had such wrongheaded policies that put the world so much at risk by supporting Muslim Brotherhood, they complain that this President, our President Trump, doesn't know what he is doing. It appears to me he knows exactly what he is doing when it comes to radical Islam, to those who want an international caliphate, to those who are moderate Muslims, like President el-Sisi, who has actually had the courage to stand up, as I have not seen any national or international leader do, and tell a roomful of imams that it is critical that we get control of Islam back from the radicals who have hijacked it.  It did a disservice when the last administration kept saying the Islamic State, the radicals in Egypt, radicals in Libya, al-Qaida, that they are not Well, yes, they are. And that is why President el-Sisi had to make clear: We need to get our religion back. Baghdadi, who is head of the Islamic State, has made very clear that, yes, the Islamic State is Islamic, and if moderate leaders don't step up and rein in radical Islam, then this world is headed for disaster.  Though we had some disagreements here recently on other matters, I still think that the media attention that is given claiming Trump is this crazy guy, that Donald Trump puts the world at risk, they are so reflective of the comments that were heard about a guy named Ronald Reagan when he was  As I mentioned last fall in a private meeting with now President Trump, I said, you know, my study of American history seems to indicate that those Presidents who were considered by the media to be our smartest Presidents, when it came to foreign matters, foreign policy, they were some of the least effective.                              {time}  1245  In some cases, actually, terrible at foreign policy and foreign diplomacy, it seems that some of our most successful Presidents, when it comes to foreign policy, have been depicted as being just a little bit crazy.  And I mention to now President Trump, if he will remember back to the days of ``Saturday Night Live'' when it was funny, they did skits about President They enjoyed portraying President Reagan walking around as if he was in some daze or stupor, with his finger out asking where the red button is--``Where is the red button?''--like he was so anxious to start a nuclear war.  But when you analyze the history of our Presidents and their effectiveness at foreign policy, I think you actually end up seeing that, when the world is a little bit concerned about a United States President being just a little bit crazy--``That guy is crazy enough, he may start a nuclear war''--it is a fantastic help to diplomacy, so that when a President like Reagan or Trump says, ``This is it. Don't do this because I will draw a red line,'' they can't be sure that he won't launch a nuclear war.  So I hope that he won't take anything off the table. I think he has handled some of these issues very well. As he has said: I am not taking anything off of the table. I am not going to warn our enemies of exactly what we are going to do and when.  That is wise counsel in handling foreign diplomacy.  I am looking forward to the days ahead, because this week, in meeting with President el-Sisi, it sent a message to the world that President Obama refused to send, and that is we think we can work with President el- He has his hands full. Egypt has a tough road ahead because they are trying to come back from what had become a quite socialized government in A lot of people are on some form of welfare.  It is always difficult, as one of the Caesars found, when you try to move people off of bread and circuses and get them to working so that they will find out they have value, provide self-worth. Every individual has value in God's eyes, and the Founders knew that. So let's get them working. Most everybody can do something. And leaders like President el-Sisi are attempting to do that.  It was also an embarrassment for the United States, and those that are observing world affairs, to have noted that an incredible world event happened since President el-Sisi has been the head of the government in They opened a second lane to the Suez There were top leaders from most all of the more powerful nations in the world. They came to honor Egypt and their incredible accomplishment of opening a second lane. It didn't go all the way the distance, but it allows for so much more traffic through the Suez  I remember one conversation prior to that with President el-Sisi, when President Obama had promised Muslim brother leader Morsi: We will send you tanks. We will send you jets. We will send you money. We will send you Apache helicopters.  President Obama was more than happy to send powerful weaponry that the Muslim brothers could use to go after Christians to weaponize the Sinai, as Morsi did.  A lot of Americans had the wool pulled over their eyes, including some at AIPAC, who didn't realize, as they sent people around to support President Morsi, that: Oh, gee, we think he is a lot better than people are giving him credit for.  I knew who he was. I know what he was. But some of the top folks at AIPAC did not realize you don't want[[Page H2781]]to be supporting a Muslim brother President or leader anywhere.  And, in fact, we should do right here in the United States what Egypt did, and that is list the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Now, it is true in the United Some of their leaders have said, oh, no, we don't want to get to violence, because the indications are they believe that they are making so much progress, and they really did. Under the leadership of President Obama, the Muslim Brotherhood made vast strides in power in the United States without violence, so they didn't want to jeopardize that.  But as some of the documents that had been seized over the last 30 years make clear: Yeah, we will use peaceful means as long as we can; but, of course, at some point, when we are no longer successful in gaining the upper hand in America, we will have to support violence to do the final takeover.  But some people here get it. They understand the threat that the Muslim Brotherhood is.  It is great that President Trump invited Egyptian President el-Sisi to be here to meet with him. And, Mr.Speaker, I look forward to the day when we have enough time to have President el-Sisi stand right here where Prime Minister Netanyahu has stood at least, I think, three times and where other great international leaders have stood and have spoken to a joint session. I look forward to the day when we have President el-Sisi stand here. The man is a true hero for the world, for everyone except the Muslim  President Trump also welcomed King Abdullah of Jordan, King Abdullah, leader of a majority Muslim country. And, of course, those who have studied the Bible know that so many of the Biblical references actually are right there in  Some wondered why President Obama didn't get much encouragement from those around him to go ahead and do a status of forces agreement with We know that Iran was making so many of the IEDs, putting people and weapons inside the country of Iraq, while American soldiers were fighting, losing their lives, being maimed, losing arms and legs--our great heroes--carrying out the will of the U. It seemed that President George Bush pretty well had a status of forces agreement teed up. He probably could have finalized it. For all the criticism that some heap onto President Bush, he is actually a very gracious man. Look at the time he entertained people at the White House and was so gracious. People like Ted Kennedy that would walk right outside and trash him after he had been so gracious to him.  But he actually left a hanging curve ball for President Obama to hit after he came in as And from what I understood from people in the Bush administration, they thought this would help his Presidency come in and very quickly sign the status of forces agreement that should be easy to get done.  But one of the things--well, there were two main things, it seems, from what I can figure out, that stood in the way of the status of forces agreement. One was President Obama really didn't want to leave troops in Iraq, not even a small force, to help solidify what we had taken away from the radicals. And he didn't use good judgment, which has now cost the lives of tens of thousands--hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East because of his shortsightedness.  Another reason that there is no status of forces agreement was an element I didn't realize until I was talking to my friend Joel Rosenberg, a great author, a New York Times Best Seller author. Joel has done so much fantastic research into Israel, Egypt, and the Middle His novels reflect so much history that is accurate.  He was pointing out to me--and I had not seen it until he pointed it out and I started doing some research on it. But some of the crazies who think that the 12th imam, who was thrown in a well as a child around 10 years of age, is going to some day come back and take over and be the great Mahdi, the 12th imam, that unites the world caliphate and puts everyone under radical Islamic control of the Mahdi, the 12th imam, most of the 12th-ers believe, those who believe the 12th imam is coming back, some have said they have already seen him on short appearances.  There are prophecies that the 12th imam will first come back and take charge in a small town. I believe it is pronounced It is kind of like the Bible prophesied that the Messiah would be born in  Well, those who believe the 12th imam is going to come back--and, actually as I understand, they do believe in They believe he is going to fight at the right hand of the 12th imam, so they don't have anything close to the beliefs that Christians do and the orthodox Jews do. But the only way he can come back and begin the start of this reign, if he comes back to Kufa, there cannot be any infidel soldiers, infidels in the land, occupying the land.  So if the United States had an occupying force in Iraq, it is going to impede the ability of the 12th imam to come back and start the beginning of the worldwide caliphate that will fall in place thereafter. And, of course, he is supposed to emerge from chaos.  There were those in Iran at the top who thought--not rank-and-file people, but some at the top thought, look, he is supposed to come out of chaos. He will appear here in this small town and start the beginning of the accumulation of the world caliphate.  So, in Iran, if you were a crazy top leader in Iran that believed that is where the 12th imam is coming back, you could not allow the United States--that they consider infidels, the Great Satans--you could not allow the United States to have a status of forces agreement so that we had what they consider infidel soldiers. So it wasn't anticipation that Iran would fight so hard to keep America from agreeing to keep soldiers in Iraq, and part of that is because President Obama did not allow people who had studied radical  Now, he had Muslim brothers around him. That is what Muslim Brotherhood publication indicated in December of 2012, I believe is when that article came out, bragging about the six people that were in top positions, people like Imam Magid; and Elibiary, who was on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, the top advisory council for Secretary of Homeland Security Janet And I pointed out conflicts there that were disregarded and problems that his allegiance was not to us; it was for a more radical Islam, for the Muslim brotherhood at least.                              {time}  1300  Finally, when he tweeted out that the caliphate--the world caliphate is inevitable and Americans just need to get used to it, they finally decided to let him rotate off advisory council. But the Muslim brothers were bragging about the people they had in top positions that were advising President  There are some holdovers in positions who were not top Muslim brothers, but they are in positions that I hope this President will be able to root out. And I think it helps a great deal that he talks to President el-Sisi, he talks to President Abdullah, because some of these radical Islamists are also a great threat to King Abdullah in Jordan, and we need him keeping peace on the eastern side of  And then you also had the Chinese President come, and we have got to deal with China because they are a power and they own a lot of our debt.  But I appreciate what was reported this week. Ali Waked at Breitbart reported from Tel Aviv:  `` . . . Abdel Fattah Sisi's visit to the United States . . . will be an opportunity to undermine the Muslim Brotherhood's standing in Washington, a former Egyptian Ambassador to the United States said.  ``Abdel Raouf al-Ridi told Egyptian paper Alshorouk that `Egyptian-American relations are entering a new phase, and the degree of their success relies on Egyptian efforts.' ''  He went on to say: ` ``Presidents Trump and Sisi can break the ice created during the Obama administration,' he said. `Without doing injustice to Obama, he adopted the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood.' ''  He is talking about President President Obama would never admit that. Who knows whether he was taken in or really understood what he was embracing.[[Page H2782]]  But one other great thing that I want to express appreciation for is the President's steps on trying to stop illegal immigration into this country.  Mr.Speaker, as I have talked about a number of times, having spent so much time all night on the border, the drug cartels control traffic coming into America, and they have people that they are smuggling in through their coyotes who actually get paid to bring them in. That money goes to the drug cartels and they coordinate. The drug cartels, according to the Border Patrol, coordinate sending in these groups of illegal aliens in the United They knew, when they sent a big group in on one or more rafts, that all of our border patrolmen would have to flock to that area and start processing them, go through their checklist of questions, and that is when they could send massive amounts of drugs in.  So what President Trump is doing is a great favor to the United When he stops illegal immigration, he is not just stopping illegal immigration, he is stopping the ability to bring in drugs, making it more difficult. Oh, they are still coming, but it is a start. And I am grateful to the President for doing that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2779.txt,1801,WORKING FAMILIES FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,6.0,July

9211,topic-id,442,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, we are able to continue our efforts in protecting children by passing legislation to protect young athletes from abuse. The country was shocked at the revelations in recent years concerning the ongoing abuse endured by young athletes at the hands of their coaches and trainers in USA Gymnastics and USA These children were betrayed by people they trusted, by people they looked up to, and by people who had a duty to protect them.  That is why I am pleased to be on the floor here today in support of the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse This bill imposes a requirement to report child abuse for those authorized by U.sport national governing bodies, such as USA Gymnastics and USA Swimming, to work with minor athletes or members of these governing bodies.  As is the case with existing Federal mandatory reporting requirements, these individuals will be required to make a prompt report to law enforcement when they learn of facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an incident of child abuse. This provision will ensure that the malfeasance on the part of national governing bodies, like USA Gymnastics, in failing to report allegations of abuse to law enforcement, never occurs again.  The bill further strengthens existing civil remedies for victims of sexual abuse who wish to seek civil damages from their abusers. The bill clarifies that once a victim has established a harm occurred, the court will presume damages of $150,000. It relaxes the statute of limitations for victims. The 10-year period will now begin when the victim reasonably discovers the violation or harm, not when it accrues. It also extends the statute of limitations to 10 years after a legal disability is lifted. In other words, minors who are victims will have 10 years from the time they reach adulthood to file.  Finally, the bill expands the authority of the national governing bodies to develop practices, policies, and procedures to prevent sexual abuse, and clarifies the duties of the bodies in developing these practices.  Sports have always been a central aspect of American life. Sports teach our children about focus, teamwork, and leadership, and we should encourage our children to participate, to be a part of healthy competition; but, in doing so, we need to assure we keep these competitive atmospheres safe.  I am pleased to see that the U.Olympic Committee has helped to establish a new organization called the Center for Safe Sport, to prevent and respond to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of young athletes.

9331,topic-id,285,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Police officers and military veterans have much in common: Both wear uniforms, both protect and serve, and both face great physical risk in executing their duties. It is understandable, then, that many military servicemen and -women seek employment as police officers upon returning to civilian life.  Similarly, police departments are seeking men and women who are physically and mentally fit to assume these roles, who are used to working in teams, and who have experience making quick decisions under stress. To a police department, a military veteran may be a perfect fit.  In recent years, we have strived for community-oriented approaches to policing. A community-oriented approach requires officers not just to enforce laws, but to wear many other hats, like first aid provider, social worker, counselor, crisis manager, and peacemaker. If there is a problem, we expect the police to solve it. The knowledge, skill, and abilities military veterans bring to police departments enhance the departments' problem-solving mission.  H.1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017, is good legislation introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Hurd). The bill authorizes grantees who receive grants under the Community Oriented Policing Services program at the Department of Justice, commonly known as COPS, to use them for prioritizing the hiring and training of military veterans.  When military veterans return from deployment and enter civilian life, it is important we recognize their sacrifices by assuring they can obtain employment and support their families. This bill helps to ensure veterans can do just that.  Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Hurd for introducing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

9079,topic-id,480,"Mr.President, I want to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues that April is National Sexual Assault Awareness We commemorate it each year to bring public awareness to the staggering problem of sexual violence.  Tens of thousands of people in the United States and hundreds of my fellow Iowans annually fall victim to this heinous crime. Sexual assault occurs at least every minute and a half, according to law enforcement statistics. These same figures reveal an increase in rape cases since 2011, contrary to claims by the former Obama administration that the violent crime rate had declined in recent years. But up to two-thirds of sexual assaults are never reported to police, say crime victim advocates. This means that the average perpetrator strikes multiple times before being brought to justice. Equally as troubling, the incarceration rate is less than one percent of all sexual assaults reported to law enforcement.  The FBI ranks rape as one of the two most violent crimes, second only to murder in its effects. Survivors suffer not only physical consequences, but sometimes life-shattering emotional effects as well. According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network, as well as the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, post-traumatic stress disorder is typical. Depression or even suicide is not uncommon. The healing process is often slow and painstaking.  Today, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to commemorate Sexual Assault Awareness Month and honor the survivors of this heinous crime. I thank Senators Feinstein and Ernst for joining me as cosponsors of the resolution.  During my time as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have made crime survivors rights a top priority. Two years ago, we passed, and the President signed, major legislation to benefit the survivors of human trafficking. Last year, the President also signed the House version of a survivors' bill of rights that our committee reported as part of the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act and we approved legislation to extend programs that support the analysis of sexual assault evidence by the Nation's crime labs.  Supporting and protecting survivors of sexual violence will continue to be a focus for our committee in 2017. Last month, I convened a hearing to examine allegations that dozens of young athletes experienced sexual abuse at the hands of coaches, instructors, and others. I recently joined our committee's ranking member, Senator Feinstein, in introducing the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse The bill's purpose is to ensure that sexual assault allegations by young athletes will be reported and investigated promptly. This year we will also make it a priority to extend and update programs that are authorized under the Trafficking Victims Protection  Mr.President, I will close by reaffirming my support for survivors of sexual violence and expressing my continued commitment to advocate for them.

9134,topic-id,797,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017. I thank Senator Franken for supporting and working with me, since the 112th Congress, on this important bill to help our Nation's family farmers.  This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court case Hall v. United In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled a provision that I authored in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act did not accomplish what we in Congress intended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 corrects this unfortunate result and restores Congress's original intent. The bill clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts, under chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, may treat capital gains taxes owed to the government, arising from the sale of farm assets during the bankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will give family farmers a chance to reorganize successfully and remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power over a plan's confirmation.  Congress created chapter 12 in 1986 as a temporary measure to provide a specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005, Congress made chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. Between 1986 and 2005, we learned what worked and did not work for family farmers reorganizing under chapter 12. In particular, family farmers faced serious problems when they needed to sell land to fund their reorganization plan. For example, a family farmer might sell portions of the farm in order to generate cash and pay creditors. Unfortunately, in most of these cases, the family farmer is selling land with a low cost basis, because it has likely been held in the family for a very long time. As a result, the family farmer gets hit with a substantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue  Under the bankruptcy code's priorities structure for claims, taxes owed to the IRS must be paid in full, unless the IRS agrees otherwise. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs cash to pay creditors and reorganize. Since the IRS has the ability to require full payment, it essentially holds veto power over the confirmation of a family farmer's chapter 12 plan. In many instances, the effect is that a family farmer will not be able to have a plan confirmed. This is a harsh result and does not make sense if the goal is to give family farmers a fresh start. Recognizing this problem, Congress amended the bankruptcy code in 2005 to provide that in these limited and particular situations, the taxes owed to the IRS would be stripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This removed the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for family farmers to reorganize under chapter 12.  Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that despite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language we used failed to accomplish the intended result. To be clear, the Hall case was about statutory interpretation. There is no question about what Congress was trying to do; rather, the question is, ``Did Congress use the correct language?'' My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of certain tax liabilities owed to the government. Justice Breyer noted this point in his dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.1882, 1897 (2012) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place. The rules have changed and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 does this and provides the help needed for family farmers.  This bill adds a new section 1232 to the bankruptcy code. This new section, along with other conforming changes, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, practitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated during bankruptcy. I'm pleased that the bill we're introducing today will help family farmers who are facing hard times.  In the wake of the Hall decision, this bill ensures that what Congress sought to do in 2005 actually occurs. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2017 provides the help that may one day be needed for the hard working family farmers across our great                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,457,WORKING FAMILIES FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,July
9251,topic-id,244,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to speak as well on the Working Families Flexibility  Over a period of time, a lot of the rules and regulations that this body has passed, it becomes apparent they are one-size-fits-all and lack common sense. I am glad to be a cosponsor of this bill which gives people the flexibility, if they work more than 40 hours in a week, they can take the cash if they need the cash. But for some people, either because of life circumstances or because they are just less materialistic, they don't want that cash. They would rather spend time with their family.  I think particularly in today's world where so many people live in two-parent families in which both people work, a lot of people would love to spend a day with their children instead of having their children in daycare. I think it is right that people should have the freedom to do that. We recognize for government employees we frequently have comp time in which if they work more than 40 hours a week, they can come back, spend more time with their family, or maybe just spend more time on recreation.  It is high time we give that freedom to people in the private sector, high time to put family first, and we all have to remember that even though some people always want more money, some people say there are other things in life that are more important.

9289,topic-id,772,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize TechNet for its indispensable role in promoting the innovation economy and to congratulate the organization on its 20th anniversary.  TechNet is a national, bipartisan network of technology CEOs and senior executives that represents more than 2 million employees in the fields of information technology, e-commerce, advanced energy, biotechnology, venture capital, and finance. Over the last two decades, TechNet has advanced public policies and private sector initiatives that have helped to strengthen our Nation's position as the global technology leader and to create jobs and opportunities for millions of TechNet has been at the forefront of championing research and development, broadband connectivity, entrepreneurship, cyber security, tax reform, education reform, high-skilled immigration, and many other issues.  TechNet was founded in 1997 by two giants in the technology industry: John Doerr and John  John Doerr's technology career began in 1974 at Intel, where he held roles in engineering, marketing, management, and sales. He later founded Silicon Compilers, a VLSI CAD software company, and cofounded @Home, a nationwide broadband cable Internet service. In 1980, John joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, KPCB, and has since supported some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, including Google's Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt; Amazon's Jeff Bezos; and Inuit's Scott Cook and Bill John avidly supports entrepreneurs seeking to create the ``next big thing'' in mobile and social networks, education, and economic development. Ventures sponsored by John have created more than 300,000 new jobs. Outside of KPCB, John also supports entrepreneurs who focus on the environment, public education, and alleviating global poverty. John serves on the boards of Amyris, Google, and Zynga, as well as several private technology ventures.  John Chambers spent 8 years with Wang Laboratories and 6 years with IBM before joining Cisco in 1991 as senior vice president, worldwide sales and operations. Over the course of 20 years at Cisco, he helped grow the company from $70 million, when he joined, to $1.2 billion when he assumed the role of CEO, to $47 billion when he stepped down as CEO in 2015. He is now executive chairman of the board for Cisco, where he counsels Cisco's leadership on company strategy, digital transformation, and strategic partnerships. John has received numerous awards for his leadership, including being named one of the Best-Performing CEOs in the World in 2015 by Harvard Business Review and receiving the Edison Achievement Award for John has also been named one of Barron's' World's Best CEOs, one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People, and the Best Boss in America by 20/20. In addition, John has been widely recognized for his philanthropic leadership and his active role in corporate social responsibility initiatives. He served on President Bill Clinton's Trade Policy Committee and on President George Bush's National Infrastructure Advisory Council, Transition Team, and Education  As chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, I commend John Doerr and John Chambers for their continuing efforts to keep America's technology industry at the forefront of the global economy. I honor them for their significant contributions to the tech industry.  In February of this year, I unveiled my innovation agenda for the 115th Congress and discussed several priorities to strengthen and secure America's place as the global leader in innovation. TechNet shares many of these priorities, including spurring high-tech investment and enhancing America's competitive workforce.  Our Nation is in need of workers with training in science, technology, engineering, and math--or STEM disciplines. We need to encourage our rising generation to focus on hard science and quantitative skills and to provide opportunities for Americans already in the workforce to develop expertise in these fields. Enhancing our competitive workforce also means improving the process by which high-skilled individuals in other countries come to the United States to fill crucial positions for which there is a shortage of American labor. As we endeavor to reform our high-skilled immigration system, we need to ensure that this system is not manipulated to undercut domestic wages or displace American workers. We need to reward good actors who use the system as it was intended and close off the ability of bad actors to profit by sending American jobs overseas.  TechNet provides our Nation an invaluable service as it continues to champion policies that promote the innovation economy. As a leader on tech and innovation issues here in the Senate, I look forward to working with TechNet and the rest of the tech community to ensure that the United States remains the global technology leader. I congratulate TechNet on its first 20 years and wish the organization the best of luck in its next 20 years.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2484-2.txt,1351,AN IMPRESSIVE MILESTONE,2017.0,24.0,April

9013,topic-id,572,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment is about tackling a problem that, frankly, affects every single one of us in every single one of our districts, and that is storm water.  Most of us probably don't think about it very much, but, frankly, when rain falls--it does a lot of that in the Northwest--and flows through our streets and off the shoulders of our highways, it picks up all sorts and kinds of pollutants. We are talking, frankly, about some really nasty stuff: toxic chemicals like arsenic and flame retardants, as well as oil and pesticides.  Stop and think. The single largest contributor of water pollution in the United States of America is storm water runoff--up to 80 percent in some places.  Toxic storm water runoff harms our rivers and our lakes and our waterways. But it not only harms our environment, it harms our businesses that depend on clean water, like the shellfish industry of Washington State which employes, literally, thousands of people.  In Puget Sound, the largest estuary in America, storm water runoff literally can kill a salmon in a few hours. Well, salmon and other fish are a way of life in Washington, to the tune of a $30 billion, with a B, economy.  Salmon also serve as a vital resource of immeasurable value. For the 19 federally recognized Tribes in the Puget Sound, salmon is their way of life. They are called the salmon people.  If we fail to address the problem posed by storm water, these resources will continue to decline, and our communities will continue to pay an avoidable price.  So what are we doing right now to stop this from happening? The answer is: a few things, but nowhere near enough.  If we are going to truly address the problem, the Federal Government needs to do the basic, and that is set an example. The good news is that Congress has recognized this in the past, because about 10 years ago this body passed a law which requires Federal agencies to reduce storm water runoff when they develop or redevelop property. That is a commonsense requirement, but we can't stop there.  Research shows that the most cost-effective and efficient way to reduce storm water runoff is through what is called green infrastructure, or low-impact development, things like rain gardens and permeable pavement and green roofs.  You probably won't be surprised when I share that the largest storm water research center in the United States of America is in my district at our land-grant university, Washington State University's extension campus in So I am a witness to the promise and the potential of this approach.  This amendment simply provides funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to determine to what extent they are using these technologies and techniques to comply with the requirements already imposed by  Mr.Chairman, if we are going to help communities and businesses impacted by toxic storm water runoff, it is crucial that the Federal Government set the example and lead the way. So I ask you to join me as responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and ensure that Federal agencies are using the latest and most efficient technology to manage storm water runoff.  Finally, I want to extend my deepest appreciation to the chair of the committee, my friend from Idaho, and the ranking member from Ohio very, very much. I urge adoption of this amendment.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-26-pt1-PgH6428-2.txt,2040,THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET,2017.0,26.0,July

9160,topic-id,1424,"Mr.Speaker, it is now 7 months since the start of the 115th Congress, and 6 months since Republicans have controlled all the levers of power of our government, and all we have seen are broken promises.  Donald Trump and our Republican colleagues in Congress ran on a platform that included healthcare for everyone, massive investments in infrastructure, tax reform, and a dramatic increase in jobs.  On all four of these, there has been zero progress, zero legislation sent to the President, and zero effort to work with Democrats to achieve any of those objectives.  Donald Trump promised voters that he would be ``the greatest job President that God ever created.''                              {time}  1015  Yet neither he nor the Republican congressional leadership have put forward a comprehensive jobs bill. Instead, he and his Republican allies in the Congress have proposed budgets that would slash investments in education, infrastructure, and research, all areas that directly help our economy create jobs.  In fact, jobs that the President claimed to have saved are going overseas. Forecasters are now predicting slower economic growth, and manufacturing average weekly earnings have[[Page H6471]]only grown half as fast as earnings across the private sector as a whole over the past 6 months.  When it comes to healthcare, it hasn't just been the broken promise of insurance for everyone. It has been a nonstop roller coaster of legislative proposals, all of which would strip coverage away from tens of millions of Americans, raise costs, and deny coverage for those with preexisting conditions.  On tax reform, all we have seen is a one-page outline and a budget proposal with reconciliation instructions setting up a process for jamming a partisan tax reform bill through That is a nonstarter, because to be successful any tax reform legislation must be bipartisan, as was the 1986 tax reform under President Reagan and Speaker O' To top it all off, we considered and are considering this week an appropriations minibus without even having had a budget on this floor some 88 days after it was due. The Republicans promised regular order. In fact, they are pursuing no order. Republicans haven't even bothered to pass a budget, which is what we are supposed to do in the House before moving to appropriations.  So, Mr.Speaker, at the 6-month mark, we have only seen gridlock, no progress, chaos, and broken promises. Even some Republican Members--and perhaps many Republican Members--are growing as frustrated as the American people their party has failed.  Representative Steve Womack from Arkansas said late last month that: ``We'd better get our act together. We're not governing right now. We are stuck.''  And Representative Tom Reed of New York said: ``The fact that we are not getting to these issues--healthcare, budget, tax reform--is frustrating. We came here to move the needle.''  So what I am saying has been said by my Republican colleagues as well. Perhaps Representative Tom Massie put it most succinctly when he tweeted about his Republican colleagues: ``They confuse activity with progress.''  Republicans, Mr.Speaker, have failed to address the challenges facing the American people, and they have done nothing to improve the lives of those working hard to make it in  We should be considering legislation to create jobs and grow the economy. We should be working to improve and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not replace it. That would be consistent with some three-quarters of Americans who believe that is what we ought to be doing. We should be working in a bipartisan way to reform our Tax Code and promote competitiveness for our American businesses that are competing in world markets.  Growth, job creation, as well as fiscal sustainability, that is what we should be seeking in a tax bill. We should be investing in infrastructure that lures jobs back home from overseas. And, Mr.Speaker, we should be returning to regular order and an open process that Republicans have abandoned to the detriment of legislation and to our country. There have been more closed rules in this 7 months than have occurred in my 36 years in the Congress of the United  Mr.Speaker, the American people need a better deal, a better deal than they have gotten over the last 7 months. Seven months into this Congress, it is clear that House Republicans are not on the side of working people. In the words of New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most conservative columnists at The New York Times, last week he said this: ``Republicans offer nothing but negativity, detachment, absence, and an ax.''  Democrats, on the other hand, are offering the American people, as I said, a better deal, one focused on helping all of our people--Make It In America--better jobs, better wages, and, yes, a better future. It is what Democrats have always done when Democrats have been entrusted to lead. There is a history, a track record to back it up.  Mr.Speaker, I want to show my colleagues that rhetoric is cheap--or talk is cheap, as we say--but performance is really what we ought to look to. I want to bring some charts here to the attention of our colleagues--and, indeed, to the American people as well--to what Democrats have always done.  This chart, number one, shows that Democrats perform better on economic growth. Now, that is easy to say, but this graph shows exactly from Truman to Obama, the blue. You can see under Eisenhower, economic growth was about a third, or maybe 40 percent. Kennedy-Johnson and Johnson much greater than Nixon and Nixon-Carter, greater than either Nixon or Nixon-And Carter, to the surprise of many, had just about the same GDP growth as Reagan, of which my Republican friends proudly talk. And then what happened under Bush I? Then what happened under Clinton? Up, GDP growth. Under Bush II, down; under Obama, up.  That is not campaign rhetoric. Those are the statistics that show that the economy has performed better under  Now, Democrats perform better on the stock market, the stock market whom, Mr.Trump, likes to point to today. It is doing well. Why? Because the Obama economy, as you just saw, was doing well and the expectations were good.  If you look at this chart, things were better on the stock market under the Truman, greater growth in the stock market, Eisenhower less. Kennedy-Johnson, Johnson up; Nixon down. Nixon-Ford--Nixon-Ford had negative growth in the stock market, and then Carter, growth. And, yes, Reagan and Bush I had growth, but guess what. Then Clinton had better growth. And then guess what. Bush II, again, like Nixon-Ford, negative growth in the stock market.  What did that mean? That meant 401(k)s were worth less for retired people, and their security was less secure because the stock market went in the tank. And then what happened under Obama? The stock market went up.  Now, lastly, I wanted to show this statistic. And this is a stark statistic because it shows that, under Democratic Presidents, every segment, every wage level in America saw appreciation. Now, this only goes back to 1967.  So if we go to the lowest quintile, it went up higher under Democrats than Republicans in every quintile. And guess what. The highest quintile did better under Democrats, just as the lower quintile did better. But what you see is everybody did better. The only negative, of course, was under Republicans, where the second quintile went down over their years in office.  So if you compare all of these, Mr.Speaker, it is not campaign rhetoric. It is not rhetoric on this floor, but it is economic facts, economic statistics. Economic reports show that, when we promised a better deal, we delivered a better deal.  So as we look back on the past 6 months of Republicans' broken promises and failures to govern, let's remember there is, indeed, a better deal to be had. Democrats are ready to work with our Republican colleagues and with the administration to make progress.  Mr.Speaker, I have been here 36 years, and one of the things I am proudest of, my Republican colleagues, many of them say: ``Hoyer will work with us in a way to compromise and make progress for our country.'' But if our Republican colleagues continue to be unwilling to work in a bipartisan way, we are going to offer a clear and proven alternative--a proven alternative.  I hope my Republican colleagues will return from the August district work period ready to ensure that the American people get a better deal and work with us constructively to get them that better deal.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgH6470-3.txt,566,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,27.0,July
9252,topic-id,422,"Mr.Speaker, freedom to make less. What could be wrong with that? Freedom to make less.  Now, I am an employer, and I tell my employees, you have the freedom to either work for time and a half or just take comp time. One employee says: Well, I will work for comp time. The other employee says: Mr.Boss, you know, I need that money. Well, the person I will choose to work will be the person who will do it for comp time.  I don't know whether there is a provision to pay FICA on comp time or not in this bill, but I presume there is not. I presume there is an extraordinary saving to the employer, an incentive to the employer to choose the employee who doesn't need the extra money. Maybe their spouse makes a lot of money. Maybe not.  This is the freedom to make less bill, and I rise in opposition to it as I did when it last came to this floor. Instead of requiring employers to provide their workers with overtime, as currently amended, this bill would allow them to replace overtime with comp time.  Now, I have run a business. Most businessmen would not say it was a business because it was a law office. But I had employees, and I had to pay them. I wanted to pay them. I needed to pay them. When they worked overtime, I needed to pay them overtime. In other words, this bill provides if you work more than 40 hours a week, instead of getting time and a half for overtime, your boss can tell you no. Instead, you get paid time off, but you don't get to choose when you get to take it.  Now, if you only have one employee, that is not a problem because they have a choice. But if you have two employees and one employee makes the choice, as I pointed out, of getting comp time, such a deal for the boss.  And, yes, probably a pretty good deal for the person who can afford to just take comp time and doesn't need that time and a half.  The problem is, of course, as the previous speaker on our side said, we are having trouble getting people to a wage on which they can live and support themselves and their families. They need that time and a half.  And while we say it is voluntary and their choice, as a practical matter, as I have just pointed out, it is not.

While the national average has steadily declined in recent years, the unemployment rate for young veterans ages 18 to 24 has skyrocketed to 13 percent, more than double the rate it was at this time last year.  We need to do more for the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our freedom and our safety. That is why I introduced the American Law[[Page H4211]]Enforcement Heroes Act: to provide an outlet for these heroes to continue their service right here at home.  My district is home to more than 4,600 Active Duty and 45,000 military veterans who have served or supported Joint Base San Antonio, Laughlin Air Force Base, and Fort Bliss, among others. They often tell me about their struggles to find good jobs once they leave the military.  This bill incentivizes State and local governments to hire veterans as new law enforcement officers by giving preference when applying for grants through DOJ's COPS Office which fund academy and field training along with promoting community collaboration. It is modeled after an expired program called Troops to COPS, which helped about 1,000 veterans in the late 1990s.  We owe our freedom to these men and women and must do a better job facilitating their transition into meaningful civilian careers. Ultimately, we should be doing everything we can to help those who have served our Nation in one uniform continue to do so in another one right here at home.  In commemoration of both National Police Week and Military Appreciation Month, this bill will better serve our veterans and be a win for communities nationwide.

9265,topic-id,362,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility  There is nothing in this bill that provides any flexibility to working families. In fact, Mr.Speaker, we all seem to have names for this bill, but mine is that it should be called the employer flexibility act because that is what it really does. It gives employers flexibility to not pay for time worked. It is a smoke-and-mirrors promise that ultimately helps employers but hurts workers.  The choice between overtime pay and comp time is a false choice for workers, Mr.We know what happens in the reality of the workplace. The vague promise of time off in the future is often never realized, and many hourly workers may feel compelled by employers to forfeit their overtime pay to accept comp time.  Workers do need more flexibility, more money, and more control over their lives, but this bill is a cruel joke on workers. At a time when America's working families are strapped for both time and money, this bill takes time away from families and offers them less money in every paycheck. In the end, there is no guarantee that employers will let their employees take the time off when they need it.  Here is the story of Camilla, from my home State of This is what she wrote:       It was my first job out of college. I was given comp time      in lieu of overtime pay. I worked so much overtime that, in      just over 6 months' time, I had accrued 2 weeks of comp      time. When I scheduled my time off, I was told I could not      take the time off, as I had not worked there for a full      year. I had already purchased airfare. I ended up quitting      my job.  zMr.Speaker, I urge our Republican majority to go back to the table and return with legislation that provides real flexibility to American families: raise the minimum wage; ensure that hourly workers have paid sick leave; make sure that families don't suffer from pay discrimination. That is what the American people expect us to be working on. Not false choices in the name of flexibility.

9001,topic-id,462,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also rise in opposition to this amendment.  I respect the gentleman from Michigan, particularly because he is from the Great Lakes region, too, and we need him as a strong voice for our Great Lakes, but I do think that cuts to these particular accounts really are counterproductive, for the following reasons.  First of all, the most important step any country can take to deal with the deficit is to grow the economy. This particular budget, this particular set of accounts, particularly the Army Corps of Engineers, has the type of construction and building accounts that produce income. They produce income for people who do the work, but they also improve our ports.  If you look all around Michigan, if you look at the Soo Locks, if you look at the assets just in our region of the country, the progress that a region can make, because it improves its ports and attendant roads and rails and so forth, creates opportunity for companies to locate and to grow.  We just had a phenomenal announcement in the city of Toledo this week by the Cleveland-Cliffs company. We have been working for 30 years to improve the port to connect rail and to have east to west, north to south highway improvements. By golly, it worked with a $700 million investment by the private sector. It was just so exciting to bring ore from Michigan and Minnesota into the lower lakes. It was really quite incredible.  So these dollars yield results. They don't happen in one year. They take a while to happen, but they happen.  I also oppose the gentleman's amendment because there are $62 billion of backlogged projects at the Army Corps of Engineers alone. I don't know if you saw the stories about the Department of the People are lined up to get into the national parks through those turnstiles, trying to get into our national parks.  We need to improve those parks. We need to make sure that we are doing things like dealing with the Forest Service so that the underbrush is cut out and that our forests aren't burning up all over the country.  We have such a maintenance backlog across this Nation, and with budgets of this size, we don't want to be in a position where we under account for the funds that are being spent.  So to reduce funding for critical oversight in the administrative departments of these very large agencies, I think is not wise. In fact, it is penny-wise and pound-foolish in the end.

However, let me be plain. This rider is worse than any of those previous versions, and it will not gain the Democratic votes necessary to become law. It actually is a roadblock in the way of us moving our bills forward.  This rider would exempt the repeal of the clean water rule from laws that would otherwise apply, including the Administrative Procedure Act, essentially allowing the President to act unilaterally, the executive branch to act unilaterally without any input from the public. That doesn't sound like America to me.  The Administrative Procedure Act was a Republican idea to make sure that government is accountable to its citizens and that their input be considered. People have come to expect this in their own communities.

I would like you to know that that account, in this bill, is cut $986 million below last year's level, and that is a deep concern because that is the part of our economy that is growing.  Ten percent of the jobs produced in the energy sector are in renewables, and we actually employ more people in solar and in wind energy than we do in coal extraction.

Not only has the Saudi family used its vast oil wealth to promote an extremist ideology, including in madrassas and mosques in South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, its grip on power is made possible through corruption and the systematic denial of fundamental rights, including the brutal oppression of women and girls, human trafficking, and the exploitation of foreign labor.  After criticizing the Saudis during the Presidential campaign, earlier this week, President Trump and his family basked in the opulent glow of Saudi family royalty. According to press reports, just prior to their arrival, the President's son-in-law finalized a $110 billion sale of American weapons to the Saudis; yet neither the President nor his advisers, who danced with Saudi sheiks in a grand palace, voiced any concern that Saudi Arabia is a police state whose citizens have no opportunity to change their government, where criticism of the Royal family is not tolerated, and where arbitrary arrest and torture are common, nor with the Saudis' repeated misuse of U.military equipment against innocent civilians in  In fact, standing next to the Saudi Foreign Minister at a joint press conference, Secretary Tillerson rightly called on the Iranian Government to restore freedom of speech and assembly for its people so they can ``live the life that they deserve.'' But do the Saudi people not deserve such rights? He made no such appeal to the Saudi monarchy.  Secretary of State Tillerson has also made clear that the values and individual rights that Americans have long believed are what makes the United States the great country that it is and which are in fact universal values enshrined not only in our Bill of Rights, but also in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will take a back seat to our ``national security and economic interests.'' In that sense, the administration is modeling itself after China and Russia, which, given President Trump's admiration for ``strong'' leaders like President Putin and Secretary Tillerson's background as he head of the world's largest oil company, should surprise no one.  According to a press report, Secretary of Commerce Ross found it ``fascinating'' that there were no protests during the President's visit to Saudi ``Not one guy with a bad placard,'' he said, apparently oblivious to the fact that protests are prohibited and any protester would have been immediately arrested.  I know I am not the only one here who finds it hard to fathom that a President who has condemned terrorism, as he should, says virtually nothing about the Saudi royal family's own support for extremism that breeds terrorism, and nothing about the Saudi regime's gross mistreatment of its own citizens. In fact, the President's daughter, who purports to speak on behalf of the White House, publicly praised the Saudi regime's progress on women's rights, ignoring the fact that every woman she met with--none of whom were women's rights activists--required the permission of a male relative to participate.  America's values, including the defense of human rights, are a source of our strength, our durability, and our leadership in the world.

It is indefensible that the Federal government currently restricts American citizens and legal resident from traveling to a country 90 miles away that poses no threat to us, unless they engage in certain activities and not others. For example, an American biologist can go to Cuba to study threatened species of migratory birds. That same American cannot take his family on a trip to visit Cuba's national parks. Why? Because one is defined as scientific research and the other is defined as tourism.  At a time when U.airlines and cruise ships are flying and sailing to Cuba, does anyone here honestly think that preventing Americans from traveling is an appropriate role of the Federal government? Why only Cuba? Why not Venezuela? Or Russia? Or Iran, or anywhere else? It is a vindictive, discriminatory, self-defeating vestige of a time long passed. This bill would end these Cold War restrictions on the freedom of Americans to travel. It would not do away with the embargo.  We are told that the Trump Administration is conducting a review of U.policy toward That is to be expected of a new administration. We have also heard a rumor, and I hope it is only a rumor, that in return for the votes of certain Senators or representative on health care legislation, promises may have been made by the White House to impose further restrictions on the normalization of relations with I hope that is not the case. I hope the review produces a policy based on what is in the U.national security interest and on what is in the interests of the American and Cuban people, an overwhelming majority of whom want closer relations. And I hope the policy reflects the bipartisan majority in Congress that supports expanding our engagement with Cuba, as evidenced by the bill we are introducing today.  I and others who have traveled to Cuba many times over the past 20 years, who have met with Cuban officials, with Cubans who have been persecuted for opposing the Castro government, and with many others, have requested meetings with top White House officials before the review is completed and any final decisions are made.  Every one of us wants to see an end to political repression in The arrests and physical mistreatment of dissidents by the Cuban government are deplorable, just as they are by other governments including some, like Egypt's and Turkey's, whose leaders have been feted at the White House, or, in the case of Saudi Arabia, have feted President Trump and his family. Americans can travel freely to Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and every other country, except  The issue is how best to support the people of Cuba who struggle to make ends meet, and who want to live in a country where freedom of expression and association are protected, and where they can choose their own leaders in a democratic manner.  Anyone who thinks that more economic pressure, or ultimatums, will force the Cuban authorities to stop arresting political dissidents and embrace democracy have learned nothing from history. For more than half a century we have tried a policy of unilateral sanctions and isolation, and it has achieved neither of those goals. Instead, it has been used by the Cuban government as an excuse for repression to protect Cuba's sovereignty. It has hurt the Cuban people, not the Cuban government. And it has provided an opening for our adversaries and competitors, like Russia and China, in this hemisphere.  Change is coming to Cuba, and we can help support that process. There is already visible, tangible evidence that the changes in U.policy initiated by President Obama are having positive effects for the Cuban people and for our security and economic relations with Cuba, even though critics, particularly those who have never been to Cuba, prefer to deny it.  But most importantly, the bipartisan bill we are introducing today is about the right of Americans, not Cubans, to travel. Any member of Congress, especially those who have been to Cuba, should support the right of their constituents to do so. American citizens are our best Ambassadors to Cuba, and it is wrong for the United States government to be imposing restrictions[[Page S3223]]that have no place in the law books of a free society.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-25-pt1-PgS3215.txt,1383,PROTECTING YOUNG VICTIMS FROM SEXUAL ABUSE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,May

9310,topic-id,702,"Mr.President, I rise today to honor the wonderful life and extraordinary work of Trish It is with a heavy heart that I note the passing of my dear friend and esteemed ally in our national effort to defeat Alzheimer's disease.  Many of our colleagues in this Chamber not only counted Trish as a friend but also greatly respected her as a champion in the war against an international enemy--Alzheimer's disease. It is through our work shedding light on this horrific disease, creating a roadmap for a cure and strategies for prevention, that Trish and I developed an enduring friendship. She and I shared the experience of having our beloved mothers claimed by this cruel and merciless illness. We knew the ravages of Alzheimer's on our loved ones firsthand and vowed that other people should not have to experience such suffering.  The impact of her mother's illness motivated Trish and her cherished husband George to dedicate much of the past two decades to fighting Alzheimer's disease. Together they raised funds, founded and led the innovative UsAgainstAlzheimer's organization, committing their time, energy, personal resources, and passion to bring Alzheimer's disease out of the shadows and to advocate for the policies and research needed to stop this disease and prevent it from occurring in the future.  Trish was a multidimensional force of nature. Creative, caring, and compassionate, she was a devoted daughter and caregiver to her mother. She was a loving mother to her two children, Alissa and Tyler, their spouses, and four grandchildren. And, as so many of us here know, she was completely dedicated to her husband George, a man of enormous talent and business acumen.  My wife Susan and I have been privileged to call Trish and George treasured friends for more than 20 years. To say that George and Trish were ideal partners does not fully capture their love story. They were soulmates, complementing each other perfectly and creating a powerful, enchanting, and dynamic duet. Many of us have tales of our interactions with Trish and George, witnessing firsthand Trish's indefatigable spirit, perseverance, and leadership. Simply put, you never wanted to tell Trish ``maybe'' or ``no,'' particularly when the issue was Alzheimer's disease.  This was compounded by the fact that Trish was a master communicator and humorist. She did not mince words and knew how to convey a message, often delivered with memorable one-liners. A gifted writer, she authored novels, sitcoms, and op-eds, with many of her recent pieces calling attention to the great threat of Alzheimer's disease. I had the honor of playing the role of her mother's doctor on stage in Trish's award-winning play, ``Surviving Grace,'' which shines a spotlight on Alzheimer's impact not only on the patient but on their family members as well.  It was right here in the Senate that Trish began her professional career as a speechwriter to Senator Harrison Williams of her home State of New Therefore, it is particularly fitting that the Senate pause to recognize this remarkable woman and her many accomplishments across so many fields.  In closing, it is difficult for me to comprehend that Trish has passed away and that we will no longer hear her powerful voice, her luminous laughter, her one-liners, experience her creativity, and benefit from her passionate conviction that we must keep fighting to defeat Alzheimer's. The indomitable memory of Trish Vradenburg--an amazing, creative, and pioneering woman--motivates us all to live to the fullest and to accelerate our work so that we can soon reach the day when Alzheimer's disease is found only in the history books. In these ways, her inspirational legacy lives on as George continues their important work with Trish in his heart, in her family's love, and in her friends' and colleagues' admiration.  This was a great woman whom we have just lost, a champion for finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, and I am so honored to be able to speak in the U.Senate to tell the Nation of the work of this great woman.  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

The water that is discharged into my area comes out of Lake Okeechobee and goes into the Treasure Coast of It puts people out of business, kills sea life, sea grass, manatees, and fish.

My amendment increases the Aquatic Plant Control Research Program within the Army Corps of Engineers' Engineer Research and Development Center, or ERDC, by $500,000 above the appropriated level.  The Aquatic Plant Control Research Program is the only federally authorized research program directed to develop the kind of technology for management of nonindigenous aquatic plant species, like these toxic blooms.

9216,topic-id,436,"Mr.Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to express my admiration and deep appreciation for the gentlewoman from Indiana for her leadership on this most important bill.  This gives us a chance to do something, which is to give a voice to those victims who have suffered in silence and yet had the courage to come forward and allow others to appreciate the depth of the impact that they have suffered, as well as an opportunity for us to assure that this kind of pattern doesn't repeat itself again.  We know it is a pattern because we have, as has been aptly demonstrated by the speakers before me, stories of young women who have been victimized because they enter a trusting relationship--one between a coach and a person in which that power dynamic is so unique, the young person putting their future in the hands--which is exploited by that person superior in the relationship.  So we now have chance to assure that that trust is not further impacted. But it is not just that relationship; it is the long-term implications of it which are so damaging.  Working with the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, we have come to appreciate victims and how the psychological impacts, including things like substance abuse and other kinds of psychological disorders, last for years, and by the courage of coming forward, it does not necessarily end that impact on them.  In fact, it is not just situations like coach and athlete. All kinds of trusting relationships can create a dynamic--one including something that I am currently working on, massage parlors--in which individuals who put themselves in a compromising position find themselves assaulted.  Most recently, I introduced the Duty to Report Act, addressing that kind of a violation of that trusting relationship.  These are examples of opportunities for us to address, once and for all, the implications of people who are allowed to move from one situation to another when reports come forward and stop. We call that pass the trash.  Today, it is time for our body to put forward the kind of legislation that will assure that there is a duty to report so, along with due process, there can be an internal investigation to assure and reporting requirements so that these individuals are not able to victimize future young athletes, future people who put themselves in the position of trust.

My amendment is a simple 10 percent cut to administrative expenses of the U.Army Corps of Engineers, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Department of the Interior, and Department of These savings would be used to reduce the deficit.  Our national debt stands at $20 trillion, and growing. Our unfunded liabilities add another $100 trillion to $200 trillion to the Federal debt, and that is only a guess. Our deficit last year was over $500 billion. That is not sustainable. It jeopardizes our future and must be taken seriously. Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it. Talk is cheap. We must now be responsible, before it is too late.  I come from the world of private business and know the importance of having our fiscal house in order. I also know that being fiscally responsible starts with small steps, which, when added together, make a big impact.  Early in my career, I worked at Chrysler at the time when Lee Iacocca was CEO and went through the first loan guarantee. His famous fiscal savvy and focus helped save Chrysler, which was destined for bankruptcy. If not for Iacocca taking strong but necessary measures, a great Michigan company would have been lost.  Lee Iacocca understood that fiscal responsibility starts on a small scale. He once said if he had a manager who couldn't cut administrative costs by 10 percent, he needed a new manager.  Mr.Chair, that is what I propose today, a 10 percent cut to administrative costs of government agencies, which is a small step that, when combined with others like it, could yield back results and big savings for taxpayers. Moreover, these cuts would restrain an overactive government bureaucracy.

The sweat, labor, and king sugar of the Caribbean people have shaped this and other nations. Our rebellion, innovation, and ingenuity, as well as our independent intellectual intensity, have benefited this and other countries.  As one of the pillars of American patriotism and democracy, Alexander Hamilton was born in Nevis, and raised and educated on the island of Croix, where he learned the theories and financial methods of the English, Danes, as well as the West African counting system that created not just the foundation of our financial system, but our Federalist ideas.  During that same time, Caribbean financiers assisted the American Revolution and gave courage through the example of the tremendous victory of the Haitian people over the French, British, and Spanish armies.  But the contributions of Caribbean Americans to the making of America didn't stop with those heroics. The massive migration of Caribbean people to the United States of America, during the early 20th century, gave us another opportunity to make our impact upon the liberation process that was taking place in this country through politics and the arts.

This program in the Virgin Islands Department of Health gives at-risk pregnant women and families necessary information, resources, and skills to raise children who are physically, socially, and emotionally healthy and ready to learn.  In June, Republicans in the House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee introduced a bill reauthorizing this program. The legislation, which has yet to receive a hearing, included a 5-year reauthorization, but did not expand funding to meet the growing needs for services. It also included serious modifications to the way the program is run, which advocates fear could have harmful unintended consequences.  Home visiting programs are a critical opportunity to reach at-risk pregnant women and new mothers. The first few years of life are the most rapid period of brain development, and home visiting programs provide support to vulnerable families in the earliest stages of their child's life.

9037,topic-id,577,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, my amendment would simply restore the funding cuts to the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account just to fund at the same levels it was funded last year. That is $986 million. And I will tell you where we find those funds and take it from in a minute. It takes them from two programs: the fossil fuel energy and research account and the nuclear weapons account.  So we should invest in our future for energy efficiency and renewable energy rather than throwing more money at the past and into nuclear weapons.  Fossil fuel research and development is a dead end for America, for our economy, for the clean air that we need, and for our water. Continuing to fund fossil fuels, whether it makes them marginally cleaner or not, is simply throwing money at the past rather than the future.  Regardless of how clean we make fossil fuel extraction, it is never as clean or, more importantly, as sustainable as renewable energy, and definitely won't be as cheap or sustainable as clean energy.  I am the proud sponsor of a bill for our country to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, but to be able to do that, we need the investment in research and development.  Frankly, investing in nuclear weapons when we already have enough nuclear capabilities to destroy every man, woman, and child on this planet seven times over is simply wasteful. Nuclear weapons receive over $10 billion, while renewable energy receives a measly $986 million.  I was talking to one of my constituents a little while ago, Nancy Cronk from Colorado, and she agreed that we simply spend too much on potentially having the capability of destroying the world through nuclear weapons, rather than investing in a renewable energy future.  We don't live in Cold War times. We don't need Cold War-level spending for facilities that the military hasn't used in over 20 years.                              {time}  2045  We should be following the advice, in this case, of the Department of Defense and focusing on the renewable energy account, which helps fund national labs like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in  The most recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's economic impact alone shows it totaled over $800 million nationally. In addition, CU Boulder and NREL jointly operate the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute, which is located in Colorado, which helps advance renewable energy science, engineering, and analysis through industry partnerships and education.  That is the future of our country, Mr.Chairman, and the future of the world. And by undercutting our investment in our future and throwing money at the past, and being able to kill every man, woman, and child seven times instead of six times, we are losing the forest through the trees, and we are making our country less secure, not more secure.  The Building Technologies Offices, NREL, and many others receiving funds under this account do amazing work to pull us into the 21st century, like using 3D printing for wind blades. Not only that, their work helps save consumers money because of energy efficiency.  In fact, an estimate shows that from 2009 to 2015, the work of the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy program has saved consumers more than $543 billion and reduced carbon pollution by 2.3 billion metric tons.

We talked about the jobs and technology transfers that come out of that fund. We also talked about its need for energy independence in our future.  I hope the chairman is willing to work on finding other agreeable funding sources to hold that account harmless and plus it up.  I want to highlight a couple of other important projects funded from the EERE account, large and small. One example is the EERE's Vehicle Technologies Office which awarded $500,000. It doesn't sound like a lot, but it makes an enormous difference on the ground for the Clean City Coalition to support Project FEVER, to foster the development of Colorado State's acceleration of plug-in electric vehicles, which are in extremely high demand.  The Clean Cities project helped to develop a comprehensive electric vehicle strategy, including supply readiness and implementation. The project has already saved over 7.5 billion gallons of petroleum.  These are just some of the many projects that we should be focused on because they are truly our future.

We are merely restoring the Fossil Energy Research & Development program back to the levels of 2017--merely back to the levels of 2017.  We must put it in perspective. It is still $300 million less than it was under President  Let's also put it in perspective. As I showed earlier on the chart, the consumption of fossil fuels make up 81 percent of all the country's energy consumption; 81 percent fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and oil. But the level of research is only at 18 percent of the money that we have currently.  Now, I just heard a minute ago someone say this is pretty balanced. Look, I may be just an engineer, but I don't think 18 percent is the equivalent of 81 percent. There is something wrong with that.  I am not here to argue that America shouldn't be investing in renewables and nuclear. That wouldn't be appropriate. But the reality is that America and the entire world will be relying on fossil energy for years to come.  The Energy Information Administration estimated that by 2040, fossil energy is still going to make up 78 percent of the world's consumption. So shouldn't it be America's goal to lead the world, to have that mantle of leadership, to develop the technologies that we can export to other countries around the world that are going to continue to use coal and gas and oil in the cleanest and most efficient way? Shouldn't we, again, be that global leader on this?  But we can't do this without leadership.  Mr.Chairman, let's consider the history of this, the fossil research from the Federal Just remember the threat years ago, back in the eighties, we had of acid rain. It was the research in our Federal labs all across America that reduced the emissions of SOx and NOX gases and addressing cleaned up acid rain and reduced it.  The reduction in CO2 emissions around the globe and around America have come as a result of fossil fuel research. On a per capita basis today, we are now emitting--on a per capita basis, this is the lowest level of CO2 emissions we have had in over 50 years, thanks to fossil fuel research.  And the shale gas revolution that made America the biggest producer of gas in the world, it originated in our Federal laboratories in research. That is just part of where we have been.  Now go into the future. Someone said this is a fuel of the past. How can it be when the R&D money--look what they are working on in our labs all across America, virtually in every one of our districts across this country. We are doing a carbon capture, utilization, and storage. We are doing chemical looping. They are studying and understanding methane hydrates.  You talked earlier about rare earth elements are being detected now in coal seams all across  What about oxy-combustion?  All of that is coming out of current research, fresh research that we will be able to export around the world so that other countries will be able to burn their coal more cleanly.  So, look, Congress should not be in the way, picking winners or losers, and it shouldn't jeopardize the work of our laboratories. If we are serious about reducing emissions, Congress should be putting more money into this program, not reducing it.  In an ideal world, the funding level for R&D should be much higher. As I said, under President Bush it was $300 million more than it is today. But I understand the fiscal constraints we have.  So let's utilize our domestic energy source, energy supply in the most efficient and clean way possible. We do that through our research from our Federal laboratories.

As kids, the notion was that, if you hid under a half-inch plywood piece of desk under a thermonuclear attack, you would be safe. It is not a particularly rational idea, but not much more rational than our current nuclear posture.  For decades, Presidents and Members of Congress from both parties have worked together to prevent the use and spread of nuclear weapons and materials. Starting with President Reagan's leadership, American Presidents have reduced the size of America's nuclear arsenal from its Cold War peak. In fact, Republican Presidents have cut the arsenal far more aggressively than their Democratic counterparts, yet this year's Energy and Water bill doubles down on an outdated Cold War strategy by unnecessarily diverting precious resources to build new nukes.  It remains unclear how these weapons will solve 21st century national security threats such as terrorism, cyber attacks, or global warming.  Rather than wasting dollars to keep up the status quo, we must find ways to replace the U.nuclear arsenal while maintaining a force capable of deterring nuclear attack against the U.and its allies.  In 2013, the Pentagon determined that the U.could reduce its deployed strategic nuclear force by one-third below its current levels and still meet security requirements. According to the former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military utility of U.tactical nuclear weapons, such as the B61, is practically nil.

9332,topic-id,542,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes Act of 2017. I want to thank the author of the bill, Mr.Hurd, for bringing it forward.  This measure has the laudable goal of recognizing our brave men and women who have served in the armed services, but it also helps to protect our communities through community-oriented policing.  I support H.1428 for several reasons. To begin with, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, also known as the COPS Office, is responsible for advancing community policing by law enforcement agencies through information and grant resources.  The COPS Office promotes community policing with a commitment to building trust and mutual respect between police and the people in the communities they serve by awarding grants to law enforcement agencies for the hiring of law enforcement officers for community policing.  Through the COPS Hiring Program, funds are provided directly to law enforcement agencies to hire or rehire career law enforcement officers to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention activities. To date, more than 129,000 officers for over 13,000 agencies have been funded via the COPS Hiring Program, which was first established 23 years ago under President Bill Clinton in 1994.  The COPS Office began supporting military veterans through the COPS Hiring Program and currently gives additional consideration to law enforcement agencies that commit to hiring our veterans. Although we have not had hearings to discuss the import of providing incentives through this program for the hiring of veterans as new law enforcement officers by State and local law enforcement, we believe the bill is well designed and well intentioned.  The bill prioritizes grant applications of law enforcement agencies that will use grant funds from the COPS Office to hire veterans, thereby giving preference to those agencies when applying for grant funds. The intent is to assist law enforcement agencies in attracting well-qualified, service-oriented people who have already served America through their military service.  Another positive purpose of this legislation is to provide our brave veterans the opportunity to continue to serve their country and respective communities upon completion of their military service. Military service provides vital leadership traits that can be valuable in assisting military veterans in their effort to succeed in law enforcement careers, and we need to take advantage of that.  Veterans with combat experience have obtained skill sets that relate to law enforcement work, such as discipline, loyalty, ethical standards, and integrity; physical fitness; firearms and tactical skills; the ability to respond appropriately under stress; and experience working with diverse populations.  Those who have served in the military often have a desire to continue to serve others, and a career as a law enforcement officer allows veterans to continue serving others through community policing, where we need them so much. A career in law enforcement also provides veterans with long-term stability, gives a sense of accomplishment and pride, and offers a career where their dedication to protecting and serving the public can be applied.  Finally, measures such as H.1428 will help ensure our communities are protected through community-oriented policing.  Accordingly, we support passage of H.1428, the American Law Enforcement Heroes  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

In the early 1870s, the Three Creek Area's premier cattleman, Joseph Scott, was the first to use a 71 brand after purchasing it from a Nevada rancher. The 71 Livestock Association took its name from that brand in homage to  In 1905, local ranchers requested that the Federal Government look into creating a forest reserve to protect grazing and other resources on the range. Less than a year later in 1906, with Gifford Pinchot as the first Chief of the Forest Service, President Theodore Roosevelt signed into law a forest reserve in The creation of the forest reserve sparked a partnership between the Three Creek Ranchers and the U.Forest  In December 1917, the ranchers of Owyhee and Twin Falls Counties came together to form the 71 Livestock Association with Joe Hawes as the first chairman. Noteworthy, the 71 Livestock Association started with both woolgrowers and cattle producers, which created a stronger partnership and greater collaboration among all range users and managers.  In the early 1930s, livestock producers in the West were concerned with deterioration of the range due to uncontrolled grazing and wanted to better protect the public lands. Due to that concern, Congress passed the Taylor Grazing Act in 1934, and the 71 Livestock Association created its first constitution and bylaws. The Taylor Grazing Act established grazing boards, and the 71 Livestock Association had three members on Idaho's very first grazing advisory board.  The 71 Livestock Association has seen many changes and has evolved to make conditions better on the range. In its formative years, they helped create a system for grazing as the main enforcement body on the forest reserve in As the Bureau of Land Management began managing the range in southwestern Idaho and Elko County, NV, they helped to allocate range to its members and to help install key infrastructure like fences, pipelines, roads, phone service, electrical power, and even a tax levy for the Three Creek  From its inception, the 71 Livestock Association has experienced many challenges from jackrabbit infestations, plant poisoned cattle, severe winters, environmental lawsuits, endangered species, National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, regulations, and range fires. In addition, they have lived through the Sage Brush Rebellion and the Jarbridge Shovel Through it all, they have been instrumental at bringing together ranchers and Federal, State and local agencies to discuss and resolve issues with a spirit of cooperation.  Today the 71 Livestock Association has been at the center of rangeland fire management. In their true spirit, the 71 Livestock Association pitched in to help with the rehabilitation and reclamation of the land and helped create and develop the Rangeland Fire Protection Associations, By being first on the scene, the RFPA have been instrumental in helping to stop fires before they develop into larger uncontrolled range fires.  Because of its success and standing in the region, the 71 Livestock Association has seen members go on to represent constituents of southern Idaho in the Idaho State Legislature--notably, the late Noy Brackett, his son Bert Brackett, and the late George  The 71 Livestock Association serves as a role model for Idaho and the Nation on how to innovate and collaborate on land management issues. Today they remain focused on advancing their mission of ``bettering conditions on the range.'' Congratulations to the 71 Livestock Association on a successful 100 years of operation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgS3138.txt,1896,BRING BIPARTISANSHIP BACK TO BORING,2017.0,24.0,May
9314,topic-id,790,"Mr.President, I wish to thank my dear friend, my colleague from Georgia, for making such an outstanding statement in his own inimitable fashion--sort of a Paul Harvey of the Senate, if you will--and I know that he would never lie on the Senate floor. He might stretch the truth a little, but just a bit. I thank him so much for his testimony on behalf of our next Secretary of  The Senate will soon vote on the confirmation of Governor Sonny Perdue, the President's nominee for U.Secretary of  The Department of Agriculture is made up of 29 agencies and offices, and it employs nearly 100,000 men and women who work in all 50 States and around the globe. The Department provides leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, scientific research, and related issues that impact every American every day.  Throughout our Nation's history, our farmers and ranchers and business owners in rural America have survived drought and disease and floods and tornadoes and whatever else Mother Nature throws at them. We just had a big prairie fire in Yet, year after year, they produce the safest, most abundant and affordable food and fiber supply in the world.  Today, however, our producers from across the country are facing tough economic times, with multiple years of low prices. These same producers now need a strong market for whatever they produce. During this critical time, the importance of trade for the agriculture industry cannot be overstated. We have to understand within the administration, within this Senate, and with our colleagues in the House, that, yes, it is important to export things that we make, but it is also equally important to export things that we grow.  On top of all of this, our farmers and ranchers and rural businesses have been burdened by regulations from agencies across the Federal I have heard time and again, as has my distinguished colleague who is the Presiding Officer, that the costly and hard-to-understand regulations have and are endangering the ability of our producers to even stay in business.  Members of the Agriculture Committee have a lot of work to do over the next 2 years, including regulatory reform and recommending to our new Secretary what he can do in that regard but also the reauthorization of the farm bill. We intend to do that work in the bipartisan fashion that has served us so well in the past. I will make the statement--I have the privilege of being chairman of the Agriculture Committee--that we are the least partisan committee in the Senate, and today that means a lot. It also means we work well with our distinguished ranking member, Senator Deborah Stabenow from  But, now, more than ever, agriculture needs a voice, an advocate, and a champion at the highest levels of government, and Governor Perdue has been nominated to serve in exactly that role.  As has been said, he is from He was raised on a farm and practiced as a veterinarian before returning to his home county to work in the grain business. He was elected to serve in local and State government, including two terms as the distinguished Governor of the State of  During his confirmation hearing--and I want to underscore that his confirmation hearing was unique in the Senate in that there were no attacks on the nominee--Governor Perdue knew the answers to the questions that he was going to be asked. He didn't have to be briefed. The Governor demonstrated a real understanding of the challenges that now face the agriculture industry and the willingness to work together to find solutions.  The Agriculture Committee received many letters in support of his nomination, including support from six former U.Secretaries of Agriculture, representing both Republican and Democratic Presidents, and another from nearly 700 organizations across the agriculture and food value chain.  Last month, the Agriculture Committee voted by voice vote to report Governor Perdue's nomination to the full Senate--a voice vote.  Our farmers and ranchers have been long waiting for this important role to be filled. Once Governor Perdue becomes Secretary Perdue, I know he will put the needs of farmers, ranchers, and others in rural America first, and lead us in both the House and Senate to implement a productive trade policy and economic recovery in rural and smalltown  So I urge my colleagues to join in bipartisan support for Sonny Perdue's confirmation as Agriculture Secretary and for being the champion for farmers and ranchers and growers and consumers.  I yield the floor.  Mr.President, after a careful counting of the Members present on the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

9247,topic-id,978,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Let me say how grateful I am for the leadership of Chairwoman Foxx in the Education and the Workforce She and her staff have been instrumental in advancing this bill.  I also want to thank my friend, my colleague from Alabama, Bradley Byrne, who serves as the chair on the Workforce Protections He has been a champion for commonsense policies in the workplace, and I appreciate his hard work.  Mr.Speaker, today's workforce is more diverse than ever, especially as it concerns working parents. More than 70 percent of mothers today work outside of the home; and that is different from 50 years ago, when that number was less than 30 percent.  But while the workforce has changed quite a bit, our policies and laws that govern the workplace have not. As a working mom myself, I understand all too well how challenging it can be to balance career and family. Ask any working parent, and they will tell you just how precious their time is. They will tell you that they just need one more hour in the day to be able to take care of their family and all of those responsibilities that come with it.  I always say, Congress can't legislate another hour in the day, but we can update our laws to allow more choice and fairness in how employees use their time. That is why I am proud to bring to the floor H.1180, the Working Families Flexibility  Mr.Speaker, this bill does three important things: it removes outdated and unnecessary Federal restrictions on the use of comp time in the private sector; it provides flexibility for working moms and dads who need more time to spend taking care of their family responsibilities; and it demonstrates how commonsense conservative principles can help Americans in their everyday lives.  Here is how it works: an hourly wage employee would be able to voluntarily enter into an agreement with their employer to put a portion of their accrued[[Page H3041]]overtime towards paid time off instead of extra cash. An employee could simply use the time-and-a-half overtime that they earned to take a paid hour and a half off of work instead of the extra money if that is what they wanted.  Ask yourselves: Should a working dad be forced to use up all of his vacation time in order to get involved in his child's school?  Should a military mom, with her husband deployed, have to dip into her sick leave to make sure her kids have the support they need?  Should someone with aging parents who require extra care have no option allowing them to devote more time and attention to their loved ones when they need it most?  Under the Working Families Flexibility Act, those working moms and dads could have the option of using their accrued overtime toward paid time off, allowing them to take care of these responsibilities without losing the paycheck that they count on.  Mr.Speaker, for anyone who works in the public sector, this comp time system probably sounds familiar. That is because, since 1985, government employees have had access to comp time benefits.  Why should the rules be different? If it is good enough for the government employees, why is it not good enough for the private sector?  H.1180 fixes this disparity by allowing for greater choice and fairness over how workers use their time. I have sponsored this bill for three straight Congresses now, so I am well aware of the criticism from the labor unions and their allies. They try to say this bill is somehow antiunion or antiworker. This is simply untrue. Of course, the truth is, many Big Labor groups will reflexively attack any proposal that would change a single word of the Fair Labor Standards Ironically, labor unions themselves can, and often do, negotiate similar agreements for their members already.  So I want to just go over a few of these criticisms quickly. Critics of this bill, as has already been stated in this debate, will tell you that it will somehow result in employees working longer hours for less pay. That is not true. The decision to receive comp time is completely voluntary. An employee who prefers to receive cash payment for overtime hours is always free to do so.  Workers can withdraw from a comp time agreement whenever they choose. An employee who changes their mind or just can't work out with their employer when to use compensatory time can say, ``You know what? I would rather have the cash payments that I accrued in my overtime,'' and the employer must provide that within 30 days.  All existing protections in the Fair Labor Standards Act are maintained, including the 40-hour workweek, and how overtime compensation is accrued.  Critics of this bill also say that it will allow employers to control when workers take their comp time. That is also not true. It is up to the employee to decide when to use his or her comp time. It is their time.  My time is running out. There are other myths, and I hope during this debate that we will be able to go through what is myth, and what is fact, and I am happy to address that at any time.  I want to thank again the chairwoman for her support, for her willingness to move this bill through committee.  We have got big issues in this country to deal with right now: health care, funding the government, tax reform. And as we continue to work on those issues--and we will--nothing should stop us from doing what we can right now to help make life a little easier for moms and dads. The Working Families Flexibility Act does that by helping Americans better balance the demands of family and work. After all, this is their time.

Employers found to have coerced employees would be liable to those employees for double damages.

And the idea is very simple: that after 40 hours of work, which is a reasonable time in most industrialized countries in the world, that people then get overtime pay. It is something that helps strengthen families and is good for workers to have money in their pockets.  But the idea here, under the guise of flexibility--which is a really nice word--is it allows employers to deny extra hours to workers who want overtime. Instead, they can pick those who are willing to work long hours without pay for promises in the future that they would be able to have comp time, that they would be able to make it up at a time of their boss' choosing. Oh, they say over a negotiation, but go ahead and try and negotiate with your employer about that.  While the majority argues that providing comp time to private sector workers creates parity between the public and private sector, workers in the public sector have many more protections than workers in the private sector right now.  Union density in the public sector is five to six times the union density of the private sector. Workers represented by unions have far more bargaining power than unrepresented workers, greatly increasing the potential for employer abuse of comp time and decreasing the employees' ability to defend themselves from such abuses.  Workers in the public sector have more job security, higher wages than their private sector counterparts. This means public sector workers are less likely to be putting their jobs at risk. So this is just a bad idea, hurts workers, hurts families, hurts the longstanding idea of the 40-hour workweek.  ",CREC-2017-05-02-pt1-PgH3038.txt,1588,THE PRESIDENT IN SAUDI ARABIA,2017.0,2.0,May
9119,topic-id,604,"Mr.Speaker, on May 16, a group of peaceful protesters gathered at a public park outside the Turkish Ambassador's residence in northwest Washington, D.They came from a variety of backgrounds--Armenian, Kurdish, Yazidi, and more--but they shared a common concern about developments in Turkey, including the crackdown on political opposition and free speech in that country and Turkey's continued denial of the Armenian genocide.  About a mile away, Turkey's President, Tayyip Erdogan was received warmly by President Trump at the White House, with no mention of Turkey's human rights abuses and growing authoritarianism. The protesters felt, and rightly so, that they had to exercise their First Amendment rights and raise their voices in dissent, the very dissent which has been violently squelched by Erdogan in his own country.  What happened next was a chaotic and violent confrontation that left 11 people injured, 2 of whom required hospitalization. Tensions were already high, with pro-Turkish counter-protesters outside the residence scuffling with protesters.  When Erdogan and his entourage arrived, the situation quickly spiraled out of control. As he exited his car, observing the protests, Erdogan can be seen on video speaking briefly to his security detail, and soon thereafter, several of these men, some of them armed with handguns, rushed past D.police officers to violently confront protesters, causing several injuries.  The images that you see to my right are indelible and bloody. A Kurdish woman was put in a choke hold and told by the dark-suited man who attacked her that he was going to kill her. Protesters, men and women alike, were knocked to the ground and assaulted with kicks to the face and torso.  This was not a scuffle. It was a full-fledged assault by professional thugs on a peaceful protest. Such scenes have become common in Turkey, where state-sponsored violence and repression have become the chief instrument to cement Erdogan's power.  Selahattin Demirtas was, until recently, the leader of the Kurdish HDP party and someone I had the honor to meet 2 years ago, and now he sits in prison as prosecutors seek to sentence him to 143 years of confinement.  Turkey has become the world's leading jailer of journalists, most recently adding French photojournalist Mathias Depardon, held in solitary confinement and without charge, to the ranks of 81 journalists currently imprisoned.  Mr.Speaker, Erdogan cannot export the violent repression he visits on his own citizens to our streets. The violence of May 16 can't go unanswered or forgotten.  Yesterday the House unanimously passed 354, condemning the attacks and calling on the administration to pursue justice and hold those who carried out these attacks responsible, whether they be Turkish or not.  This is a good start, but it cannot be the end. The D.police department is carrying out an investigation into the attacks, and ultimately they will require cooperation from Turkish authorities in identifying those responsible. Nothing that Turkey has done so far indicates that that cooperation will be forthcoming, and indeed, rather than show even the slightest contrition after their security forces assaulted Americans, authorities in Ankara instead summoned the U.Ambassador to lodge a complaint against the United States and police officers who sought to keep the peace. The message from Turkey is as clear as day: We can do as we please whether at home to our own citizens or on your own American soil.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here today to affirm that we will not allow Turkey to beat innocent protesters on the streets of our Nation's capital. We will continue to pursue justice and to make clear that America will always stand up for the right of peaceful and free expression.[[Page H4652]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4651-4.txt,1635,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,7.0,May
9061,topic-id,553,"Mr.President, last night, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.  This was a very good first step. Mr.Rosenstein has done the right thing. I applaud his decision for both its correctness and its courage. A special counsel was much called for in this situation. Former Director Mueller is the right kind of individual for the job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead. Additionally, as special counsel, Mr.Mueller must have broad latitude to pursue the Russia investigation. In the appointment order, it stipulates that the special counsel is authorized to investigate ``any matters that arose or may arise directly from this investigation.'' That is a really important power, given recent reports about an active FBI investigation into General  I am heartened by the news of Mr.Mueller's appointment, but it in no way diminishes the need for Congress to play an active role in helping to get to the bottom of recent events. Intelligence Committee Chairman Burr and Ranking Member Warner should still pursue the congressional investigation into these matters with just as much vigor. That investigation has been proceeding in a bipartisan way, and it absolutely should continue as such.  We should still seek testimony from Mr.Comey in both the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees to discuss the events surrounding his dismissal and be given access to memos and transcripts or tapes of his conversations with President Mr.Comey was central to the events of the past few weeks. We still need to hear from him. I thank the bipartisan leadership of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees for requesting both the records and public testimony of Director  Congress, specifically the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, should still be given access to any transcripts or related summaries of the President's meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador, during which reports have alleged he may have divulged highly sensitive intelligence.  Finally, there is still a great need as before for the next FBI Director to be someone who is nonpartisan, independent, fearless, and of unimpeachable integrity. A career politician of either party or anyone who suggests a lack of impartiality, should not be considered. The appointment of Mr.Mueller is a great first step toward getting the Russia investigation back on solid ground, but these other things also need to happen: Mr.Comey testifying; the White House turning over to Congress the relevant tapes and transcripts, if they exist; and the selection of an independent, impartial FBI  Later this afternoon, the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, will brief all 100 Senators at the request of the two leaders, the majority leader and myself. He can brief us on a great many things, including the events of Mr.Comey's dismissal and the status of the Russia investigation.  While the briefing itself will not take place in a public setting, I hope that much of what we learn today can be shared with the American public.  So in the interest of getting all the facts, we in Congress look forward to hearing from Mr.Rosenstein this afternoon. It is a sign that while we wholeheartedly applaud the appointment of a special counsel, we in Congress must continue to do our jobs as well.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgS3024-2.txt,1036,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,18.0,May

That is important in and of itself. Until now, we have read these reports with a healthy dose of skepticism, waiting for Mr.Comey to confirm or to refute their veracity.

9224,topic-id,1591,"Mr.President, first I want to talk about infrastructure. This week, the administration is laying out a few ``proposals'' on infrastructure. So far, it has been a major disappointment. President Trump pitched a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan in his campaign and continued to mention it in the days after the election. We Democrats welcomed the idea.  One of my first conversations with the President after he was elected was about infrastructure.  I said: You called for a trillion-dollar infrastructure program.  He said to me: At least that.  I said: Sounds good to me. Let's work on it.  We have made overtures to the White House saying we would be willing to work with the President on infrastructure. I said it to the President directly several times. Democrats have been pushing for new money for infrastructure for a very long time. We even put out our own proposal, a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, hoping it would spark a discussion.  We Democrats continue to welcome a serious and constructive dialogue on this issue, but unfortunately the President continues to disappoint. We sent our plan several months ago, and we have heard nothing for those months. Now the President seems to be intent on pushing forward an infrastructure plan on his own, one with few details, that is mostly private sector driven--that means tolls--and with minimum investment, and that would ignore a huge section of our infrastructure. The President doesn't seem to be talking to anyone but a few people in his inner circle. Some of them are financiers. Of course, they have been financing private sector infrastructure for a long time, but that is not the way we have worked in America since Henry Clay, a former--not quite a We didn't have any then, but he was a Whig--the predecessor party--and he came up with this idea of internal improvements. I remind my dear friend, the majority leader, Mr.Clay was from  Internal improvements were supposed to connect what was then the east coast with the far West--Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio--with roads over Appalachia, and ever since, we have had bipartisan support on the Federal Government building infrastructure and putting in the dollars for it but not from President Trump, at least thus far.  The President's plan is a recipe for Trump tolls from one end of America to the other. That is not what the American people are crying out for. They don't want more tolls. They want us to rebuild our crumbling water systems, bridges, schools, roads, broadband, not finance new tollroads.  Unfortunately, the President surrounds himself with bankers and financiers. These are folks who used to work at investment banks. They look at infrastructure as an investment to be made by corporations in the private sector, but infrastructure has never been a business investment.  Infrastructure has been something the government has invested in for decades and even centuries because the benefits of infrastructure have great--what the economists call externalities. The benefits for having a good highway is not just for the people who use the highway, but if a factory locates nearby because it can get its goods there more frequently and quickly, that is a benefit. A road itself might not generate short-term profits, but a factory might locate nearby and bring jobs and economic vibrancy to an area. The private sector might not build high-speed internet all the way out to the house at the end of the road if there isn't a profit there, but our rural people are as entitled to high-speed internet as our people in urban areas and, I might add, there are large parts of my city, New York City, where that last mile isn't done because there are poorer residents and it is less profitable.  That is why there has always been the role of government to stimulate infrastructure investment, to provide support for necessary maintenance and construction which the private sector would ignore. To connect that house at the end of the road to high-speed internet so children living in it can learn, thrive, and benefit in a global economy benefits America, even if someone isn't making a huge profit immediately from the building of that broadband. It is the same with the highway, the same with the bridge, the same with water and sewer, the same with the school with internet.  The bottom line is, if the President wants to sit down with Democrats, of course we want to do it, but if he continues to take this path with a plan cooked up by Wall Street advisers, it will not succeed or it will result in such a small measure that it will not be effective.  Again, I say to the President--there is talk, I read in the newspapers--they want to do this by reconciliation, no Democratic votes, just 52 Republican votes in the The same problem they had with healthcare, the same problem they are having with tax reform, will repeat itself with infrastructure if you don't do it in a bipartisan way.  Our colleagues constantly remind us that ObamaCare didn't work because it was done by one party, but now they are letting Trump lead them to do the same thing on just about every major issue. It is a formula for failure President Trump is advocating. He hasn't been down here in Washington that long. It is up to our Republican colleagues to teach him that working in a bipartisan way is the only way you can really get things done.  So my view is, we need bipartisanship, but the President might not get--just remember that many Republicans are very negative, initially at least, with a private sector-driven infrastructure bill because they represent rural areas.  Here is what a Republican Senator from Wyoming, Mr.Barrasso--fine man--said: ``Funding solutions that involve public-private partnerships do not work for rural areas.''[[Page S3255]]  My friend, the Republican Senator from West Virginia, has said: ``As a person who represents an almost all-rural State . . . I'm concerned about how we are going to be able to incent the private dollars to go to the less-populated, less-economically developed areas of our country, because the investments are just as important.''  The bottom line is this, an investment bank infrastructure plan like the one the President is proposing is a sure loser in A Goldman Sachs infrastructure plan just will not work, except for a few. It would turn over a public good to the whims of private finance, who will not build infrastructure where America needs it. They will build it where they can make a buck, and that means tolls paid by working Americans and middle-class That means rural areas will not get the support they need. That means any project that can't generate user fees or taxes--like repairing our schools or water sewer systems--will not get done.  There is no free lunch. When the private sector wants to finance infrastructure, they naturally--that is our free enterprise system--want to get repaid, but who is going to repay them? The average American: the truckdriver who is scratching out a living, the salesman or saleswoman who is scratching out a living, the family who is going on vacation and has to stop every 30 miles for another big toll, the small business that depends on roads to get the goods to and from that business location.  If the President truly wants to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure, he has to approach this issue in a bipartisan way. There are several Republicans who don't want the Federal Government to spend any more money on infrastructure, but the majority of Senators of both parties probably do. The President needs to sit down with Democrats and work something out if he wants to get something done. He hasn't sat down with He doesn't seem to want to. There are even reports that the President is considering doing infrastructure on reconciliation. That means just Republican votes, a huge mistake.  Republicans have been tied in a knot here in The President has been tied here in a knot in Washington because he insists on going at it alone.  Look at the entire Trump administration agenda. President Trump ran against both the Democratic and Republican establishments--a populist, if you will, but he has thrown his lot, since he has become President, with hard-right conservatives and is now pursuing an agenda entirely through the partisan process Republicans once decried--healthcare, reconciliation; taxes, the same. Now infrastructure? The one area where we kept the President out of it, the appropriations process worked swimmingly well. Leader McConnell and I, Senators Cochran and Leahy, and the House Members got together in a bipartisan way and we worked it out. We each thought we had some victories. It worked, but I had to stand at this desk and tell our Republican colleagues to keep the President out of it because it will bullocks everything up. Fortunately, they did. Maybe we can do that again.  I would say to the President: Mr.President, you can spend your entire first-term agenda trying to jam through partisan bills. That would be a shame because America needs to get moving again. On infrastructure, this is an issue where we really have some common ground. That is why Senate Democrats put forward a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would create millions of jobs and actually fix our crumbling roads and bridges, invest in every corner of America, with particular attention to rural  We stand ready and willing to work with the President on that plan or something similar that actually achieves what he promised on the campaign trail.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3254-3.txt,1036,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,6.0,May
9238,topic-id,1136,"Mr.President, tomorrow will be President Trump's 100th day in office. This week, we Democrats have spent each day highlighting how this President has broken or failed to fulfill promise after promise to the working men and women of America on issue after issue--on jobs and the economy, on healthcare, and on draining the swamp.  Earlier today, my colleagues talked about how the President's budget is another example of his tendency to promise one thing and then do another. Despite promising to address the issues of education, infrastructure, and scientific research, the President's budget takes a meat ax to the funding for NIH and NSF, vital school programs, and transportation grants.  This morning, I want to touch on a few examples of the broken promises that characterize the President's first 100 days, broken promises to the working men and women of  In the campaign, he ran as a populist against both the Democratic and Republican establishments. He is governing from the special interest-laden hard right--far, far away from where the American people want him to go.  In the President's scramble to show some progress before his 100th day, he has rushed to make progress on the wall, healthcare, and taxes. This desperate sprint has only left these three efforts more damaged than before.  First, on the wall, we were progressing nicely on a bipartisan agreement to keep our government open and running until the President stepped in to muck up the process by insisting on funding for his wall on the Mexican border. This is a huge broken promise. Every time he mentioned this wall on the campaign trail, he insisted that Mexico would pay for it. This week he demanded that the American taxpayers pay for it and threatened to shut down the government over it. The Americans know that $50 billion--if that is what the wall will cost--is far better spent laying broadband throughout America, rebuilding our roads and bridges--doing things that help Americans, not some ideological issue. Thankfully for the American people, the President failed.  Second, on healthcare, breaking his promise of insurance for everybody and lowering costs yet again, the President's healthcare bill rose from the dead and moved further to the right. It is hard to think of a bill worse than the first, but TrumpCare 2.0 has all the terrible aspects of round one, with even more cruelty placed on the American people. TrumpCare 2.0 would still leave millions without coverage, raise rates dramatically on 50- to 64-year-olds, and also take us back to the day when insurance companies could deny coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Once again, the President failed.  Finally, the President's tax plan was another huge broken promise. As a candidate, Trump promised to lower taxes for middle-class Americans, but his Secretary of Treasury can't even guarantee the plan will do so. The President could have worked with Democrats on taxes, but he chose to focus on the wealthy instead of the middle class.  To be clear, the President's tax plan is a wish list for billionaires, not a serious proposal. The Trump tax plan is designed to cut Trump's taxes, those of his Cabinet, and those people of his wealth, not the taxes of the middle class.  Thankfully, this plan is yet another dead-on-arrival Trump proposal that has been panned by both Democrats and The Trump tax plan pretty much sums up the dynamic of the first 100 days--promise for the working class; deliver for the wealthy. Frankly, it is why he has made such little progress.  These three actions this week, in the President's rush to try to prove that the 100 days isn't as bad as everybody is saying--the wall, TrumpCare, and the Trump tax plan--have made our point that his 100 days have been a failure better than we ever could.  President Trump could have chosen to spend his first 100 days working with Democrats to find consensus on issues like jobs, trade, outsourcing, and infrastructure--issues on which we have some common ground. I told him many times that if he governed from the middle, his Presidency would have some success. Instead, he abandoned his campaign populism in favor of a hard-right, special interest-driven agenda and chose to go at it alone without consulting or so much as considering the minority party. That is why he has been unable to make any progress on healthcare. That is why he has been unable to make any progress on his wall. That is why he has been unable to achieve any significant piece of legislation. In fact, of the 10 pieces of legislation the President promised in his first 100 days, he has achieved none of them. These are the bills the President promised to get done in his first 100 days--not a one.  The President's achievements to date consist of Executive orders--something he repeatedly derided during the Obama administration as an ineffective way to govern--and several bills passed under the Congressional Review Keep in mind that many of these Executive orders simply direct Federal agencies to study issues. They are messaging tools that don't achieve anything. And many of the CRAs only benefit powerful special interests.  Compared to Franklin Roosevelt's first 100 days in which FDR passed 76 pieces of legislation, this can hardly be considered a record of effectiveness. And the contrast between the President's boasts and his actual record through the first 100 days is even starker when you consider just how much this President promised to deliver all these things. There is an air of unreality when he says it is the best 100 days ever--compared to Franklin Roosevelt? Come on, give me a break.  In fairness, candidates make a lot of promises. That is the nature of campaigning. We know that. But this President has made particularly outlandish promises to working Americans, summed up by a line he said in his campaign. He said to his supporters: ``I will give you everything.''  President Trump promised working Americans a cherry pie, but after 100 days, he has delivered only crumbs. If the President wants his next 100 days to be better than his first, he needs to abandon the ``my way or the highway'' approach, abandon his special interest-driven, pro-wealthy agenda, and start pursuing policies that actually help the middle class and those struggling to get there. We are willing to work with him if he does. But if he stays on his current path, abandoning the working people of America for the very wealthy, the next 100 days will be just like the first: a series of broken and unfulfilled promises and very few results for America's working families.

9019,topic-id,520,"Mr.Chairman, this is going to be something that the ranking member and I happen to disagree on.  Poison pill riders--I have always liked that term, ``poison pill riders.'' What they are are policy changes. If they are policy changes you like, they are policy changes. If you don't like them, they are poison pill riders. So when they had the majority, they put what we considered poison pill riders in their bill, but they were policy changes, and that is what we do in some appropriations bills.  But I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I have been debating this issue for, I don't know, probably 10 years. While the change in the administration means that we are able to reduce the number of the issues we needed to address in this bill, some issues warrant continued congressional attention--WOTUS is one of them.  My reason for opposing the Obama administration's WOTUS rule remains the same. The rule would greatly expand Federal jurisdiction over the Clean Water The Supreme Court has twice ruled that the definition used under the Clean Water Act of navigable waters was hard to define and told them that they need a new definition.  Well, the EPA's design on a new definition is, okay, we will just control everything. So everybody thinks that those waters that are now under control of the Clean Water--I mean, of the WOTUS rule written by the Obama administration were unregulated before. They were not unregulated. They were regulated by the States, and the States did a good job of regulating those things.  But now the Federal Government has come in and taken control of all of those We think, and the courts have ruled, that this is too broad a definition of what they intended and what the Clean Water rule states.  Nobody wants dirty water--nobody. But what we want is a rule that separates what the Federal Government has the authority to control and what the States have the authority to control.  President Trump moved quickly on this issue by issuing an executive order in February, and a few weeks ago, the EPA and the Corps announced the first step in a two-step process: a proposed rule to rescind the WOTUS rule and recodify the previous regulatory text.  The second step will be a second rulemaking to reevaluate the definition of waters of the United States in a manner consistent with the Supreme Court decision.  The provision in this bill is supportive of these efforts. First, it provides clear authorization to withdraw the Obama administration's rule. Second, it clarifies what rule will be in effect if the WOTUS rule is withdrawn, specifically, the same rules that were in effect immediately prior to the promulgation of the final WOTUS rule. And third, it does not affect the Trump administration's ability to develop a new rule, one that will provide more clarity and certainty for the regulated community while staying within the legal bounds provided by the Supreme  For these reasons, I have to oppose this amendment, and I strongly oppose this amendment.

9033,topic-id,312,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment--not just opposition to this amendment, but strong opposition to this amendment.  This bill fully funds the request of $10.2 billion for weapons activities, which is, as the gentleman stated, an increase of $921 million over fiscal year 2017.  I have got to tell you, from his comments, you would think we were growing the nuclear stockpile. The reality is we are decreasing the size of the nuclear stockpile currently under the new START program. But even having done that, we have to fund the modernization of our nuclear stockpile, and it is one of my highest priorities in this bill.  The activities the gentleman proposes to cut are the primary reasons the Energy and Water bill is being included as a division in the Defense minibus, because maintaining the nuclear weapons stockpile is essential to our Nation's national security.  The increase provided in this bill to weapons activities is needed to extend the life of four nuclear warheads and to address the continued deterioration of the infrastructure at the Department of Energy's nuclear sites. These investments are long overdue and must be funded if our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent, regardless of the size of that nuclear deterrent.  I would say that the Department of Defense is carrying out a nuclear posture review that will inform future funding needs. Until that concludes, there is no change in our Nation's nuclear defense requirements, and Congress, I believe, must fully fund those requirements if our Nation is to have a credible nuclear deterrent.  Increases are also needed, as I said, to address the aging infrastructure at the Department of Energy's nuclear energy sites.  Mr.Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment that the gentleman from Illinois is offering and would encourage my colleagues to vote against it.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

This is part of that requirement by the Department of Energy so that they can assure the President that our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. Modernizing these nuclear weapons makes sense.  Now, we can sit and argue whether we need all these nuclear weapons or not--I happen to think we can get by on quite a number fewer nuclear weapons--but we still have to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile that we currently have and let the Department of Defense do their Nuclear Posture Review and make a determination of what ought to be the ultimate number of nuclear weapons we have, but, as long as we have this, we have got to make sure they are safe and they are reliable.

9039,topic-id,398,"Mr.Chairman, I am not opposed to the I actually like the program. But we had to make some difficult decisions, and our highest priority is maintaining our nuclear stockpile and making sure that our defense activities were fully funded.  Secondly, it was making sure that the Army Corps of Engineers was fully funded at the WRDA level that our colleagues here on the floor always insist on. That means we had to make some difficult decisions within the Department of EERE, we did the best we could.  But when the gentleman says, you know, we are not living in the Cold War anymore, so we don't need the nuclear weapons and stuff and we don't need these facilities and stuff, you are right, we are not living in the Cold War anymore. It is scarier times right now than it was in the Cold  You never need those facilities until you need those facilities, and you better have had them by then. That is the problem. It is not looking forward.  So I oppose this amendment because we have done our best within the weapons activities to make sure that we do what our Nation requires, and that is to make sure that we have a safe, reliable, and secure nuclear stockpile.  And we ought to let the Defense Department come out with their Nuclear Posture Review and tell us what they believe we need as a weapons system, altogether, when that review comes out.  I oppose it also because it takes money for the arguments made by my friends from West Virginia, because it takes money out of the fossil energy research. As they said every time I have asked the Department of Energy, ``What do you think the amount of energy we are going to consume over the next 20 or 30 years that comes from hydrocarbons, coal, and natural gas, is going to be in the future,'' it is actually a larger part, not a smaller part.  And while I have been to NREL, I think NREL is a great lab. They do some incredible work out there. We want to support them. We want to make sure that they stay open and that they can do the job that we have asked them to do and that our other labs can also.

For me, this morning, July 28, could be the beginning of a new spirit in the House of Representatives because of what happened last night in the Since we are talking about healthcare for veterans, I want to just take a moment to talk about healthcare for all  Last night, we saw a remarkable thing happen. We have had a poisonous atmosphere around healthcare in the United States for the past 7 years. We are the last industrial country on the planet to provide healthcare for the people who count on us for that kind of help and support. We can now give that up.  I hope we can take the majority leader at his word that he sees no further use in trying to beat this bill to death and that we can work together to improve it and get on to other things which we are so in need of.  But I do want to say that I appreciate very much the votes last night. I think Senator McCain showed, once again, that he is America's hero. And Senators Murkowski and Collins certainly are heroines of mine and I think let us know that women in positions of power can be counted on.  So, yesterday, in the Rules Committee, the majority passed a martial law rule granting themselves fast-track authority so they could get anything through, which I think scared even the  I read some news reports claiming this was a major victory. It was not a victory for either side fighting viciously over how we want healthcare to be given to our citizens, but it was certainly a victory for the American people, hundreds of whom stood last night here on the Capitol Grounds outside of the Senate begging to be able to continue their healthcare.  Imagine somebody with cancer, going through all of the pain and agony they have to go through, and wondering every day what in the world we are going to do here. Are they going to be left without healthcare, left without care that they can afford?  So I think, without a doubt, this is a good morning for all of us who are in the Congress of the United States to get together and to do better work. And I know of no agency, frankly, that[[Page H6527]]needs more attention than the Veterans  My personal experience with them has been somewhat like Whack-a-Mole: we think we have something settled and then suddenly we don't. We have to be advocates for every veteran in our district, directly to the VA, personally, oftentimes simply to get the most simple kind of treatment done for our veterans.  It is my wholehearted wish, and has been for some time, that we will get the Veterans Administration out of the building business, where they are abysmal failures, and let them concentrate on healthcare for veterans, which is their number one issue.

9068,topic-id,4924,"Mr.President, in addition to the Ministerial of the Arctic Council, as I mentioned, the eyes of the world are on this--clearly on the important issue of U.S.-China relations.  We had the recent President Trump and President Xi meeting in Mar-a-Lago, and this week Madam Fu Ying, who is one of the top Chinese Foreign Minister officials, is going to be in Washington to meet with a number of us. It is something I believe this body needs to focus on more, this important issue of U.S.-China relations.  Our country faces a lot of significant national security challenges around the world. In my view, however, the most significant long-term, geostrategic challenge we face is not ISIS, not al-Qaida, not Iran, Russia, or even North Those are very serious and immediate concerns, but the most significant long-term challenge we face as a country is the rise of China and the threat it poses to the post-World War II international order, led by the United  This has been made clear in a series of writings by the well-known and respected Harvard professor, Graham Allison, beginning 2 years ago in 2015. In an article in The Atlantic magazine, he started to write about what he called the Thucydides Professor Allison is set to publish a book this month on the same topic. In the book, he writes that the defining question of global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape the Thucydides  I have had the privilege over the last few weeks to review the book, and I believe it will be a ``must read'' for those who care about the long-term security and economic interests of the United  What is he talking about? What is this issue, the Thucydides Trap? Why has Professor Allison been so focused on writing about it and addressing it?  Thucydides is the famed Greek historian. Many actually view him as the father of all history, who wrote an epic historical work about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and In that 30-year war, which devastated both of those Greek city states, the rising power, Athens, challenged the established order of the ruling power,  The ``Thucydides Trap'' is the term Professor Allison describes when he talks about the strategic dilemma and danger that occurs when a rising power threatens a ruling power in the international system. As his new book explores, in the last 500 years when this has happened--because it does happen a lot in history, and he reviews the last 500 years--of the 16 times this has happened in the last 500 years, 12 of those times ended up having extensive war between the two countries. That is not good. Those are not great odds. Indeed, in his Atlantic article just 2 years ago, he concludes by saying that because of the seismic shifts and friction that is occurring between China and the United States, war between these two countries is more likely than is recognized at the moment. That is not good news.  There is some good news on this because it is not just Harvard professors who are talking about this, such as Professor Allison, who is talking about the Thucydides Trap; so, too, are the  I, with a number of Senators, had the opportunity a few years ago, when President Xi Jinping visited the Senate, to meet with him. I went down to the Senate floor to talk about some of the issues, some of the ways in which we need to think about the long-term challenges with regard to the United States and The article in the Atlantic had just come out, so I talked about it, the Thucydides Trap, and how we need to avoid it. Then I literally walked into a meeting with the President of China and some other U.In his opening remarks, he talked about the Thucydides Trap and how China and the United States need to avoid it. So that is the good news. At least on that issue, we are on the same sheet of paper.  There is other good news, and that is that this body--the U.Senate--in many ways, is the ideal place where we should be discussing, debating, developing, and, yes, implementing the kind of long-term strategic policies we need to address as a country and develop with regard to the rise of  In ``The Federalist Papers,'' Madison talks about one of the important roles of the Senate, with its Members having 6-year terms and having significant powers in foreign policy, is to be able to ensure stable and lasting relations between the United States and other nations. Indeed, perhaps more than any other part of the Federal Government, this institution--the U.Senate--has the opportunity to act and think and debate and implement policies--strategic policies--for the long-term interests of our  Contrary to some conventional wisdom, where we only hear about American ``short-termism,'' in terms of long-term foreign policy issues, our country actually has a history of developing long-term strategic frameworks that address significant challenges to America's security and economic interests. Just think of the Monroe Doctrine in the 19th century or George Kennan's strategy of containment in the 20th century, dealing with the threat posed by the rise of the Soviet Union and global communism. These were long-term, successful strategies for the United States in response to significant challenges facing our Nation, in part developed here in the U.Senate and implemented here, and we can do it with regard to the challenges we are facing now with  So as we work with the executive branch on developing an American strategy to address the rise of China and to avoid the Thucydides Trap, how should we be thinking about it? What principles should we be focused on? Let me suggest four that we should be focused on as a nation.  First, we must recognize and emphasize that the United States is an Asia-Pacific power; second, we must strengthen, deepen, and expand our comprehensive alliances with the Asia-Pacific region; third, we must engage with, not try to contain, China; and fourth--and perhaps most importantly--we must renew America's strength, particularly the economic power and vitality of this great Nation.[[Page S2817]]  I will turn to each of these principles in a bit more detail. As I mentioned first, America is an Asia-Pacific power, and we must push back on narratives or counterstrategies being developed in the region that talk about Asia for Asians, which are veiled attempts to try to exclude the United States from this dynamic region in the future, in the orders being developed in the Asia- Just look at this map. Geographically, we clearly are an Asia-Pacific nation. A few of us, about a month and a half ago, had the opportunity, when Prime Minister Abe was visiting, to have breakfast with him, and I reminded the Prime Minister at the breakfast that not only are they a key ally of ours in the Asia-Pacific, but for me, as an Alaskan, they are also a neighbor. Just look at this map. I reminded the Prime Minister that my hometown of Anchorage is actually closer to Tokyo than it is to Washington, DC, and having just gotten off the plane from Anchorage, I can tell you it is a lot closer.  When we think of our forces, whether in Alaska or Guam or Hawaii, we look at this map, and on U.territory, Alaska forces, based in my great State, are, for the most part, closer to the Korean Peninsula than forces based in So, clearly, geographically, we are an Asia-Pacific country.  Of course, American history has been embedded in the Asia-Pacific for centuries. During World War II, the United States led the effort to win the war in the Pacific after the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Alaska, which was bombed, invaded, and occupied by the forces of Imperial Many Americans are not familiar with that history of the war.  It is not just geographic proximity and the battles we fought to win World War II in the Asia-Pacific, just as important, in terms of our heritage as an Asia-Pacific nation, are the policies we implemented after World War II because it is now clear the United States has underwritten the peace, prosperity, and security of this entire region through our continued military presence, our alliances, and our economic engagement and power in the region.  No country has done more than the United States to make the Asia-Pacific the world's most dynamic and economically vibrant region, and it has been the policies of our great Nation over 70 years that have led to that. By the way, no country has benefited more from the established order that we put forward and established in this region than China, with the rise of China, in many ways, helped, encouraged, and moved forward by the peace and prosperity we brought to the region.  Let me provide just one example of how the U.military forces in the region have played the key role in helping keep the relative peace. Our enduring naval presence has helped to keep the sealanes, where all of this transportation and commerce and economic growth has occurred, in the Asia-That has been the U.Navy, for decades, doing that. As I mentioned, all nations of the region--ours included--have benefited from this order, and from our policies, and our commitment and our sacrifice. All nations--including and particularly true, China has.  So we must flatly and completely reject policies being developed in the region or in Washington that forget our geography and our history. The United States is an Asia-Pacific power. The United States is the preeminent Asia-Pacific power, but many of America's core national interests are at stake in the region, and we will be an enduring presence in this part of the world for decades and centuries to come.  Second, with regard to how to address the rise of China and the principles we need to think about, we must continue to strengthen, deepen, and expand our comprehensive set of alliances in the Asia-Pacific region that have been built over decades. Now, the United States faces many global challenges, but one of the most critical strategic advantages that we have as a nation, in terms of security, is that we are an ally-rich nation and our adversaries and potential adversaries and competitors are ally-poor. Just think about it. Look at this map. Look through and think through all of the countries that are either treaty allies of the United States or wanting to get closer, and then think of other countries, including China, Russia, North Korea, Iran--all ally-poor. This is particularly the case in Europe and the Asia-As I mentioned, these alliance systems have been built over decades by Democratic and Republican administrations, and what we need to emphasize now is we should not squander them.  It is also the case--and we are seeing and hearing about it literally almost every day, whether it is countries like Russia or, yes, China that are constantly looking for opportunities to create schisms and tensions between the United States and its longstanding allies. We need to resist that, we need to be aware of that, and we need to focus on our allies. As Winston Churchill famously said, the only thing worse than going to war with allies is doing so without them. With regard to the Asia-Pacific, we have an opportunity to not just deepen existing alliances with critical countries like Japan and Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Philippines, and Thailand, we also have a unique opportunity to expand our alliances in the region of the Asia-Pacific with countries like Vietnam and  In my first couple of years in the Senate, I have had the opportunity to travel in the region several times--in fact, every time I go home, I travel in the region--and meet with many of the leaders in the Asia-Pacific when they come to Washington or when we are in the region. It is clear to me there is a deep interest in many countries to strengthen their economic and security relationships with the United This is driven, in part, by the role we have played over decades as the force in the region that has kept the peace and promoted prosperity, but this is also driven by concerns of almost every country in the region about China's increasingly aggressive actions, particularly in the South China Sea, where, despite pledges from senior Chinese leaders not to militarize that part of the world--not to militarize that critical crossroads of commerce for the entire world--they clearly are doing it. For a country that in many ways is renowned for taking the long view--for having the ability to see around the corners of history--China's actions are having the effect of driving more and more countries into the American sphere. We should seize this opportunity, while recognizing that the productive work, the hard work of maintaining our alliances in the region takes time, takes patience, perseverance, respect, and consistency.  To be honest, I was a bit concerned--and I gave some speeches last year about this--that given some of last year's campaign rhetoric, the Trump administration would not emphasize the importance of our allies and not undertake the hard but necessary work of deepening and expanding key strategic relationships, but I think, to the contrary, they are off to a very good start. The Secretary of Defense, General Mattis, in his first trip overseas as the new Secretary of Defense, could have gone anywhere, including NATO, the Middle East, where we have critical strategic interests, but he chose to go to Japan and Korea to cement these critical alliances. The Vice President just got back from a 10-day trip to Japan, to Korea, to Australia, and to Indonesia, with stops in the States representing the Asia-Pacific, including my home State of Alaska and Hawaii, along the way.  I had a good discussion with the Vice President recently over dinner. We talked mostly about this and how focused he and the administration were on maintaining and deepening our alliances in the region, but still we can always improve, especially in terms of making sure we are coordinating closely with all of our allies on critical decisions and that we keep surprises, especially on sensitive strategic issues, to a minimum with regard to our allies. In this regard, President Trump's recent statement that South Korea would have to pay for the THAAD missile system that we are deploying in South Korea, after the U.had previously stated we would pay, was an unforced error that I hope the administration will be learning from.  Of course, this body, the U.Senate, also has an important role to play, not only in emphasizing and helping maintain our alliances by meeting with leaders around the world and working with them but also in bolstering the capabilities of our partners in the region, economically and militarily.[[Page S2818]]  Right now, there are initiatives that are doing just that, coming out of the Armed Services Committee on which I sit. One is the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative, led by Senator McCain, which would do that--increase our capabilities with our partners in the region to deepen our alliances.  Our alliances clearly matter. They matter in our long-term strategy to address the rise of But, of course, so does our relationship with That is the third principle I would like to discuss.  We must continue to engage with China, not seek to contain it, as some have argued. In fact, when we look at the U.relationship with China, ever since Secretary of State Kissinger and President Nixon in the early 1970s began having discussions with China's leadership, America's policy toward China has always been about engaging. It has never been about containing, as our strategy was with regard to the Soviet  Of course, it has taken different forms. We had the One China policy, which we are still focused on, and the Taiwan Relations Act, which was developed by this body in the U.Senate in the late 1970s. We had recently initiated by President Bush and continued by President Obama the strategic economic dialogue where senior leaders in the United States and China met every 6 months. I had the opportunity to participate in that as an Assistant Secretary of State under Secretary of State Condoleezza  There are all kinds of different approaches to our engagement. In my view, the most strategic concept since the One China policy was the policy developed during the Bush administration by former Deputy Secretary of State Bob Zoellick, who went on to be the president of the World What he called the responsible stakeholder model was very well-received initially in 2006. He laid it out in a big speech, then went to China and focused on this.  Essentially, the essence of that strategy was that China has greatly benefited from the U.S.-led international order, from the U.S.-led international system; therefore, it is in China's interest to become a responsible stakeholder in that system, to strengthen the international system that has so greatly enabled its own economic success.  In the early days of the strategy, when it was launched, there was a lot of promise. I remember having the opportunity to go to China with Secretary Paulson when he was leading the strategic economic dialogue in the Bush administration. We would meet with all the leadership of China, from the President on down. At that time, every leader in these meetings used the term ``responsible stakeholder.'' They talked about it; they talked about this American concept as a framework for our relationship.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working out so well now. Chinese officials no longer talk about being a responsible stakeholder. In fact, on many military and economic issues, they seem focused on undermining the US-led international order. Professor Allison's book mentions this specifically, where he says an increasingly powerful China is unraveling the American-led order, throwing into question the peace that generations in the region have taken for granted.  When we look at the long arch of history with regard to China, this notion that maybe they wouldn't accept this idea of becoming a responsible stakeholder in our system that we created--that might not happen. Indeed, this was foretold by one of the wisest men in Asia, Lee Kuan Yew, who was the father of Decade after decade as he built that country into an economic powerhouse, American leaders--military leaders, political leaders, Presidents, Democrats, Republicans--would meet with Lee Kuan Yew to get his advice and wisdom.  I had the opportunity as a young National Security Council staffer to be invited to a meeting with Lee Kuan Yew when I was in Singapore--one of the most interesting meetings of my career--with Deputy Secretary Bob Zoellick and our Lee Kuan Yew talked about Asia and about America's role for 2 hours.  But in another book about Lee Kuan Yew by Professor Allison, he was asked about whether China would accept this idea of being a responsible stakeholder in the American-led international order. His answer was: Of course not.  Why not? How could they aspire not to be 1 in Asia and in time 1 in the world?  When asked about this concept of being a responsible stakeholder in this system which has benefited them, Lee Kuan Yew was complimentary of the concept that the Americans were trying to lay out, but he said: China wants to be China and, as such, not an honorary member of the West and their international system.  So even though it is clear that the responsible stakeholder framework is not working with China, we still need to stay engaged at all levels--senior leaders, economic officials, military leaders. I want to compliment the President on how he started the relationship with President Xi They seem to be off to a good start.  At the same time, we need to continue to look at different concepts, different frameworks of how we continue to engage with Let me suggest one idea that I have termed ``true reciprocity.''  As China has rejected the responsible stakeholder model, it is also clear they are increasingly rejecting the idea of a reciprocal relationship with the United States across a number of sectors. Let me give a couple examples.  We look at issues like intellectual property theft. The United States has been raising this issue for decades. As a matter of fact, I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with former President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, and senior Chinese officials in the Oval We talked about this issue. The President pounded the table on this issue. The Chinese committed not to steal our intellectual property. Yet that continues unabated, now often through cyber attacks.  We look at foreign direct investment, how Chinese companies invest in Europe and the United States, how they are buying companies such as advanced robotics, biotech, media, high-tech companies, internet companies. But if an American company or a Western European company wanted to do the same in China, we know what the answer would be. It would be no.  This lack of economic reciprocity extends beyond the trading relationship. I attended a briefing a few weeks ago in the Senate by the Asia Society, which is putting out an important strategy document with regard to China--ideas for the Trump administration, a very thoughtful policy recommendation piece.  One thing they noted in terms of diplomacy: Right now in Beijing, our U.Ambassador is typically getting only deputy minister-level access, deputy minister-level meetings, while back here we give much higher access to ministers to the Secretary of This was essentially confirmed by former President Obama's own Ambassador, former Senator Max Baucus, who, in a remarkable exit interview about his time as Ambassador to China--a job he loved--talked about how, in many ways, in terms of reciprocity, we were too weak, not firm enough, pushed around. These are his quotes. It was an interview that actually didn't make a lot of news but was quite remarkable--how we had no strategy to deal with this, how we needed to draw our own redlines.  As we develop a long-term strategy toward China to avoid the Thucydides Trap, we need to institute an engagement policy which looks at true reciprocity. I will be speaking about this more in the coming weeks, and I am going to be offering legislation with regard to reciprocity in the economic and trade relationship. But I will say, diplomatically speaking, this should be a no-brainer. If our Ambassador in Beijing gets only deputy minister-level access to Chinese officials in China's capital, then that is what we should provide China's Ambassador here. It is simple, easy.  The final principle we need to focus on in developing our long-term strategy to address the rise of China is the imperative to renew America's strength, particularly the economic power and vitality of the United We have to be strong at home again, and we haven't been.  I have a chart here that says it all. Over the last, really, 10 to 15 years, we have a lost decade of economic growth. We have not been able to hit 3 percent GDP growth in almost 15 years. Some[[Page S2819]]have called this the new normal; this is what we should expect. But in many ways, when we look at this chart--Republican, Democratic administrations--the 3-percent line here is not a great number. It is an OK number. The traditional numbers of economic growth are closer to 4 percent for our country. But literally, in almost 15 years, we haven't hit it--not once. President Obama was the first President who never hit 3 percent GDP growth in a year, ever.  This is not a healthy economy, and in many ways people are starting to question the American dream, the idea that each generation will be better. We have to get back to a strong economy. I certainly hope the Trump administration will be focusing on this. I know that many Members of this body are focused on this issue.  Last quarter we didn't have a good start with the new administration--0.7 percent GDP growth, less than 1 percent growth. Economic growth, even more than military might, in many ways is the coin of the realm in We must get back to a robust economy.  Many experts at home and abroad say we can't do it. They say our demographic challenges are too great, but I disagree. If we look at U.history, every time we are dismissed, every time someone talks about the decline of the great American engine of growth, whether in the 1930s or in the 1970s or beginning in the 1980s when Japan was going to overtake us--every time that has happened and the naysayers are out there, the U.economy comes roaring back. It is critical that we do this now.  We have so many strategic advantages, even relative to China, with regard to our economy. So many of our challenges, in my view, are self-inflicted problems that we can solve.  Strong economic growth--at least about 3 percent--will more closely bind our allies to the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.  Strong economic growth will help us rebuild our military, which has been drastically cut over the last 8 years. Strong economic growth will be critical to tackling our challenges at home, such as skyrocketing deficits and debt levels and crumbling infrastructure. Perhaps, most importantly, strong economic growth will enable us to view the future, including the rise of China, with confidence and not fear.  Our great Nation succeeds when we look to the future with opportunity, not with trepidation. In Professor Allison's upcoming book, currently titled ``Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap,'' he notes that fear was the driving force that propelled Athens and Sparta into the Peloponnesian ``What made war inevitable,'' Thucydides tells us, was the rise of Athens and the fear this instilled in  In the 12 of 16 cases he reviews in his book where a rising power challenged an established power leading to war, fear was a key driving force that often precipitated war. The more our policies at home can renew America's strength, vitality, and confidence, the more likely in my view it is that we will develop clear, long-term foreign policies that can help us avoid the Thucydides  I have had the opportunity in my career to view the U.S.-China relationship over the past two decades from a variety of different lenses and perspectives. Over 20 years ago, I was deployed as a young marine infantry officer as part of an amphibious task force to what later became known as the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis, defending U.interests in the region and those of our ally  Later, I was an NSC staffer and an Assistant Secretary of State under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and I spent a lot of time in China working on these issues. I became a State of Alaska official, traveling for my State as the commissioner of natural resources and energy. I have traveled to China to pursue the promise of better economic relations. China is now the 1 market for my very export-oriented State, for Alaska exports. Now, as a U.Senator, I am focused on this issue and cochairing the U.S.-China working group with my good friend Senator Daines and getting out to the region as often as possible.  I have seen the promise, opportunity, and challenges of the U.S.-China relationship as it has matured over the last 20 years, and I have deep respect for China, its history, and all that it has recently accomplished. I know some of the leaders there and consider them colleagues.  This body, the Senate, and our country need to do more to focus on how to make sure that the rise of China is compatible with U.economic and national security interests and, most importantly, with the interests of the people we represent.  I have laid out some core principles this evening on how we might begin to develop a coherent, long-term strategy and address the challenges and opportunities of China's rise. I hope my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--will work together over the years on this incredibly important issue. There is so much at stake and a lot of work to do by many in the governments, the private sector, and the military--both in the United States and in China and in the countries of the region.  The gravitational pull of history might be working against us. There is a lot riding on how we address this preeminent geostrategic issue.  Let me conclude by reading how Professor Allison, in his book, sums up the challenge. He states:       The return to prominence of a 5,000-year-old civilization      with 1.4 billion people is not a problem to be fixed. It is a      condition--a chronic condition that will have to be managed      over a generation. Success will require not just a new      slogan, more frequent presidential summits, or additional      meetings of departmental working groups. Managing this      relationship without war will demand sustained attention,      week by week, at the highest levels in both governments. It      will require a depth of mutual understanding not seen since      the Henry Kissinger-Zhou Enlai conversations that      reestablished US-China relations in the 1970s. Most      significant, it will mean more radical changes in attitudes      and actions by leaders and the public alike than anyone yet      has undertaken. To escape Thucydides's Trap, we must be      willing to think the unthinkable--and imagine the      unimaginable. Avoiding Thucydides's Trap in this case will      require nothing less than bending the arc of history.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-08-pt1-PgS2816.txt,2290,"DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017.0,8.0,May
9260,topic-id,688,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.1180 for a simple reason: the Working Families Flexibility Act does not give working families more flexibility. In fact, it gives them nothing.  The bill contains no meaningful rights for workers that they don't already have. Instead, it is employers who get the flexibility and the power to withhold overtime pay in exchange for a false promise of comp time in the future.                              {time}  1615  This bill takes the simple idea that workers should be paid when they work overtime and creates a more complicated system in which employers can pressure their workers to accept comp time instead of cash and then refuse to give them that comp time until it is convenient.  Even the American Sustainable Business Council opposes the bill, and I include their letter in the                                              American Sustainable                                             Business Council,                                                   April 24, 2017.

The misleadingly named bill, as introduced by      Representative Martha Roby, is the wrong way to encourage      employers to offer work-life benefits to their employees.       This bill would create a major liability on the balance      sheet of small businesses whose employees have ``banked''      away their overtime comp hours. This liability then becomes a      scheduling and accounting challenge when employees decide to      trade in banked hours, requiring business owners to make      unexpected shifts in personnel assignments and paychecks.      Obviously, small businesses with fewer resources and      employees would be even harder hit by these onerous      logistical challenges than larger corporations.       It is important that more supporting measures are taken to      ensure the success of small business. In the spirit of      pursuing pro-business legislation, the Working Families      Flexibility Act proves itself to be anything but flexible for      employees and even more burdensome for employers. The sheer      volume of tracking requirements has the potential to result      in improper penalties being assessed by various government      agencies. The bill will stymie, not foster, economic activity      in the private sector.       In addition, this bill would create headaches for any      employer who must track banked hours across multiple      employees and make the required organizational      rearrangements. These factors could put business owners in      the position of making uncomfortable decisions regarding      their employees which could, in turn, lower the morale of      their workforce.       Current law does not deny employers and employees the      ability to develop mutually beneficial flexible scheduling if      they so choose, which makes this an unnecessary new law. If      Representatives Roby is truly concerned about creating      flexibility for working families, there are other, less      onerous options.       The Healthy Families Act, for instance, would provide      workers the right to earn up to seven earned paid sick days      each year to recover from illness, to care for a family      member, to seek routine medical care, or to manage other      unpredictable necessities of day-to-day life. Employers who      provide this type of leave already would not have to provide      additional sick time. This method is a more predictable and      easier approach to implement for employers.       ASBC is a growing national coalition of businesses and      business organizations committed to advancing policies that      support a vibrant and sustainable economy. ASBC represents      over 250,000 businesses and more than 300,000 business      professionals, including industry trade associations, local      and state chambers of commerce, microenterprise, social      enterprise, green and sustainable business, local and      community-rooted business, women and minority business      leaders, and investors.

Long hours and high demands caused already insufficient safety standards to deteriorate even further.

One hundred and sixty-eight men tragically died in the blaze and the resulting carbon monoxide poisoning. The miners had minimal safety training, and the mine lacked even basic safety precautions, such as exit signs.

When you are on the tractor day in and day out, from sunrise to sunset, you have a lot of time to think, and over these past 2 weeks, I have been thinking a lot about the important role Mr.Perdue will play in strengthening rural  A lot has changed in the 100 years since my grandparents homesteaded our farm. New technology and improved equipment has made us more efficient producers, but a consolidation in the marketplace has taken its toll on rural communities. The shrinking number of family farms has depopulated rural communities like the one I grew up in.  Today, a combination of consolidation and low commodity prices is taking its toll on family farmers and ranchers. Commodity prices are low across the board. In fact, in some cases, markets are below the cost of production. At the same time, we have seen rising input costs. The price of fertilizer and seed is increasing at the same time that we have seen prices decrease. To make matters worse, the big[[Page S2480]]guys use tough times like this to sweep up the family farms and ranches and add to their bottom lines at the expense of hardworking folks who are trying to keep their operations in the family.  The next Ag Secretary needs to work with Senators from rural States like Montana to identify ways to reverse this trend of consolidation because when a family farm goes under, the ripple is felt across the community as schools lose funding, and the local grocery stores and hardware stores lose customers.  Yet this is not the first time rural America has stood nose to nose with adversity. We had adversity in the dirty thirties, and we fought through the high interest rates of the 1970s. I know folks in rural America will overcome adversity once again, but in order to do so, we need an Ag Secretary who will ensure that we are supporting rural communities, not pulling the rug out from underneath them. This means pushing back against the draconian budget cuts that have been put forward by this administration.  The proposed budget slashes 21 percent from the That is nearly $5 billion. These budget cuts undermine important resources in rural America across this country and in  The proposed budget also guts the Farm Service Agency--a one-stop shop where farmers and ranchers sign up for critical ag initiatives. If cuts are made to the Farm Service Agency, farmers and ranchers will likely be forced to travel greater distances to get the assistance they rely on to create jobs in communities like Havre and that they rely on to put food on the tables of this country.  The proposed budget also eliminates the rural Water & Wastewater Loan & Grant When communities cannot access the resources they need to update critical water and watershed infrastructure, rural families suffer. Quite frankly, the White House's budget will be a nail in the coffin for rural  The USDA budget needs to reflect the needs of rural communities. That means increasing resources for farmers and ranchers and improving access to high-speed broadband for schools, businesses, and families. It also means boosting overhead support and loans for mom-and-pop businesses. The next Ag Secretary needs to fight for a USDA budget that works for rural families. Once Mr.Perdue is confirmed, I urge him to take the initiative and fight against these damaging cuts that will hurt rural  In addition to the USDA budget, we are a year away from the expiration of the farm bill. Over the past 6 months, I have traveled across Montana and have met with folks to discuss their priorities for the next farm bill. With wheat prices at a decade low and with ranchers experiencing an incredible plunge in cattle prices, it is critical that we construct a farm bill that works for family farms and ranches. I do not believe the next farm bill will solve all of the challenges we are facing today, but it should give certainty to farmers and ranchers who could be a bad storm or a cold winter away from losing their livelihoods.  Once Mr.Perdue is confirmed, I will be asking him to take an active role in this debate to ensure that the next farm bill meets the needs of family farmers and ranchers. I urge Mr.Perdue to help me educate folks in this body and in the White House that the safety net is more than a talking point.  Preserving the safety net in the next farm bill will ensure that a bad year does not wipe out family farms and ranches across this country. Families in rural America want a fair opportunity to succeed, and the farm bill should be a tool that works for small-scale producers, not just for the big guys.  Finally, I urge Mr.Perdue to work hand in hand with us westerners to make sure we are responsibly managing our forests. Breaking through the management gridlock in our national forests will reduce fire risks and will put folks back to work.  I have been a long supporter of collaborative efforts to increase active forest management, improve recreation opportunities on our public lands, and preserve these special places for future generations. Republicans and Democrats have worked together to propose important reforms that end fire-borrowing and fund our response to forest fires like we fund other natural disasters. These are the kinds of solutions we need to increase active forest management and put folks back to work in the woods, and I look forward to the next Ag Secretary joining our efforts.  The USDA has a lot on its plate, and rightfully so. There are major issues facing our farmers and ranchers in rural communities and national forests, and it is time to tackle these issues head-on. I think Governor Perdue is a standup man. I appreciate our open and honest conversations about the need to work together to strengthen rural America, and I am more than willing to give him a fair shake, but I will be honest. These problems are too great to ignore through the honeymoon period. I expect Governor Perdue to hit the ground running so we can invest in rural families, improve opportunities for farmers and ranchers, and break through the gridlock that plagues our national forests.

Under our legislation, Americans will no longer be forced to buy insurance they don't want or can't afford. Employers will no longer be faced with the choice of reducing worker hours or not hiring more employees simply to avoid the Federal Government's heavy hand.  Our bill also repeals the burdensome ObamaCare taxes. Taxes have consequences. When you raise taxes on everything from lifesaving medical devices, such as pacemakers, to health insurance itself, which ObamaCare did, it is no surprise that these things get less affordable. Our goal with this bill is to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible for all Repealing ObamaCare taxes is one part of that.  Stabilizing the rapidly collapsing ObamaCare markets is another part. Premiums on the exchanges are spiraling out of control, and insurers are fleeing the marketplace. The Better Care Act will help stabilize the markets and check premium increases.  The Better Care Act provides funding to help States implement solutions to help make healthcare more affordable for their low-income and high-risk residents.  Giving States flexibility was an important priority for us in drafting the Better Care ObamaCare, of course, took the opposite approach, attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all solution on every State in the But the problem with that is that it is pretty much impossible for a massive Federal bureaucracy to hand down one comprehensive solution that will somehow meet the needs of everyone in this country, not to mention that top-down, one-size-fits-all solutions are seldom the most efficient or affordable. Bureaucracy costs money, after all.  Our goal in drafting the Better Care Act was to make sure the States had the flexibility to address the needs of their specific populations. So we provide a State innovation fund to help them meet the particular needs of their residents. We also empower States by simplifying the waiver process by which they can seek relief from some of ObamaCare's demands and by allowing them to encourage a greater variety of healthcare solutions. We give States more flexibility when it comes to meeting the needs of their residents who rely on  In addition to giving States the flexibility to design affordable healthcare solutions and to encourage innovation, our bill also provides help directly to Americans who are most in need. The Better Care Act provides advanceable and refundable tax credits to Americans making from zero to 350 percent of the Federal poverty level. The credits are adjusted to ensure that those in the most need get the most help.  Among other things, these credits will provide help to low-income Americans around the country who currently receive no healthcare assistance. In many States, thousands of Americans are unable to qualify for Medicaid but don't earn enough to get ObamaCare subsidies. That leaves these families with no assistance when it comes to purchasing health insurance. The Better Care Act fixes this.  The Wall Street Journal reports: ``The Senate bill would extend eligibility for premium subsidies to about 2.6 million more adults with income below the federal poverty line, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation.''  Since ObamaCare became law, I have heard from so many South Dakotans struggling under the law's mandates and the massive healthcare costs it has imposed. This bill is going to bring them relief. No more ObamaCare mandates, protection for those with preexisting conditions, more affordable premiums, a more stable insurance market, assistance for low-income families, more flexibility to contribute to health savings accounts, increased flexibility for States to meet the needs of their Medicaid populations, more funding for hospitals that provide care to low-income South Dakotans, relief from ObamaCare taxes and, for the first time ever, 37,000 South Dakotans living below 100 percent of the poverty level will have assistance in getting health insurance on the individual market. This bill will give South Dakotans and all Americans access to better and more affordable healthcare.  The Better Care Act is the product of weeks of dialogue and collaboration among the Members of our conference, and I am particularly grateful to Senators Alexander, Enzi, and Hatch, who have helped provide outstanding leadership throughout this process.  As I said earlier, Republicans made the American people a promise. We promised we would provide relief to the millions of Americans suffering under ObamaCare, and this bill delivers on that promise. I hope we will have the opportunity soon to vote for this legislation because it is time to give the American people access to real healthcare reform.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

9125,topic-id,1747,"Mr.President, I am back for my weekly ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, which, given the theme of the week in Washington, it is going to focus on the health consequences of what is going on in climate change. It is timely to do so because just recently the National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning for the Southwestern United In California, San Diego County set a record at--hang on--124 degrees.  As a result of this heat, the National Weather Service warned of ``a major increase in the potential for heat-related illness and even death.''  In Phoenix, AZ, it got up to around 120 degrees. It got so hot that flights had to be grounded at the Phoenix airport because the hot air was too thin for the jet engines to get enough bite on the air for the planes to fly safely. The emergency rooms saw patients coming in with burns caused by walking barefoot on hot pavement or touching their cars that had gotten so hot in the sun that they were burned. There were several heat-related deaths reported in the Las Vegas area and in  This heat wave problem is not going away. ``Heat waves like the one we are seeing in the Southwest are becoming much more frequent,'' said Robert Kopp, director of the Coastal Climate Risk and Resilience Initiative at Rutgers  He went on to say: ``Looking forward, we expect the amount of extreme heat on the planet to continue increasing even more'' with obvious health effects.  It has gotten deadly serious in many places. In the 2003 European heat wave, there were more than 30,000 deaths across the continent, and the 3-day 1995 Chicago heat wave killed more than 700 people.  We need to pay attention. As Mr.Kopp concluded, ``that calls for a major rethink of the systems that we rely upon.'' This is not normal any longer.  This week also saw the publication in the Providence Business News of an article by Nitin Damle called ``Climate Change's Dire Health Consequences.'' Nitin Damle is a physician in Rhode He is a leader of our medical profession in Rhode Island, and he just recently was the President nationwide of the American College of  In the Providence Business News, he writes:       The medical community is witness to the health effects of      climate change now and not in some distant future. There are      five categories of health effects that will affect not      thousands but millions of people in America and around the      world.  First, as we just talked about what we saw in Arizona and in Southern California, he goes on to say:       An increase in global temperature and frequency of heat      waves will expose people to a risk of heat exhaustion      (dehydration, headaches, weakness, nausea and vomiting) and/     or heat stroke (high fever, stroke, confusion and coma). The      most vulnerable will include the elderly, with multiple      heart, lung and kidney conditions, multiple medications and a      poorer ability to regulate their body temperature.  But Damle went on to say:       Children will be at risk due to their inability to thermo      regulate, as will laborers who work outdoors and the      homeless. History tells us that there have been 7,400 annual      deaths between 1999-2010 in the United States, 15,000 deaths      in France in 2009, 70,000 deaths in Europe in 2003 and 15,000      deaths in Russia in 2010 from heat waves.  Respiratory effects are another health consequence that Damle elucidates here.       Respiratory effects from particulate matter and ozone      result in exacerbation of asthma and other chronic lung      conditions.  He continues:       Fifty-five percent of the U.population tests positive      for allergens and 34 million people have asthma. The      increased length of the pollen season and growth of allergen-     producing weeds, grasses, mold and fungus will lead to more      exacerbations of asthma and chronic lung conditions at an      annual cost of $56 billion per year with visits to the      emergency room and hospital admissions.  I was at a conference recently and saw a presentation by Kari Nadeau, who is the director of the Sean Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research at Stanford University and the Naddisy Foundation Professor of Medicine and  I am going to borrow a few of her slides that relate to the asthma and allergen concerns. Let me start with this graph, which shows asthma prevalence nationwide and asthma prevalence in Rhode  In Rhode Island, we run a little bit higher for the experience of asthma than nationwide, and this is an issue that is important to us. It comes home to roost. Nadeau used this slide. This was exposure to extreme heat and precipitation events associated with increased risk of hospitalization for asthma. This was a study that was done in As the temperature went up, and there was extreme heat or precipitation, and asthma hospitalizations went up as well.  She showed a graph from another study in New York that of the ED visits, or emergency department visits, related to ozone or related to smog, which is a well-known asthma trigger[[Page S3795]]and the estimated increase in ozone-related emergency department visits for children in New York from the 1990s to 2020s resulting from climate-change-related increases in ozone concentrations. As the ozone concentrations went up, up went the ozone-related emergency department visits.  The dark blue shows places where the emergency department visits went up 10 percent; the lighter blue, 7.8 to 9 percent; the even lighter blue, 6.6 to 7.7 percent; and in these counties, up 5.2 to 6.5 percent.  Globally, we see that pollen counts go up in conjunction with increasing carbon dioxide. In 1900, there were about 280 parts per million of pollen production, and we hit 370 parts per million in 2000. I take it back. At 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide, there were 5 grams per plant of pollen production. At 370 parts per million of carbon dioxide, pollen production increased to over 10 grams per plant. We are over 400 now. We are headed for 720 parts per million. At that point, we have more than quadrupled the pollen output.  We are seeing this happen not only in terms of the amount of pollen output that can trigger asthma but also the length of the pollen season. The months in which people who have asthma are vulnerable are extending themselves. Here, it is nearly 27 extra days. Here it is 24 extra days, 17 extra days, 19 extra days, 14 extra days, 13 extra days. We went through the middle of the country and saw over and over that the ragweed pollen season is getting long, and it is worse for asthma sufferers.  Another thing we have associated with climate change and with the dry drought spells has been wildfires. Wildfires, for obvious reasons, put a lot of stuff--ash and things--up into the air. In this monitoring map of California, when the wildfires were going on, you could see these spikes in asthma activity.  Here is before the fire. Here is during the fire activity, and here it falls back down afterward. The risks for asthma climbed dramatically during that period. The wildfires present yet another climate-related risk for people who have asthma. And here are the wildfires in California, shown to increase asthma, as determined by the emergency department visits. The emergency department visits climbed based on various risk factors. So when you are seeing folks having to go to the emergency department for asthma, that has gotten pretty serious. There is a lot of support for Damle's assertion that this is a concern we should pay attention to.  He goes on to list another category of concern: exposure to infectious disease from vectors such as mosquitos and ticks. He says it has and will continue to escalate.       There is a documented increase in cases of dengue,      chikungunya, West Nile virus and  He goes on to say:       We will likely see a resurgence of malaria in certain areas      of North  Other illnesses come from other consequences of climate change.  He goes on to report:       An increase in heavy downpours and flooding in America and      the world will lead to an increase in waterborne diseases      such as Coli and other bacteria (salmonella, typhoid and      cholera), parasites (Giardia) and viruses (Hepatitis A and      Norwalk) with an impact on millions of people around the      world.  He goes on to cite extreme weather events, which create stress, anxiety, and depression. Hurricane Katrina, he reports, led to 32 percent of people affected by the hurricane suffering from post-traumatic stress.  He continues:       We know that there will need to be a global effort to      reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and the      developed countries need to take a leading role developing/     implementing and moderating the success of those mitigating      measures.  He concludes:       We need to reenter the Paris agreement and move forward at      the local and State levels for the benefit of our patients.  He is a respected doctor in Rhode He is a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown Also, he was recently the president of the American College of  I know my colleagues don't want to listen to any of this stuff about climate change because the fossil fuel industry controls them so much that they cannot even say the words, in many cases, ``climate change'' on the floor of the Senate, but for crying out loud, you have the former president of the American College of Physicians talking about the health effects; you have a prominent researcher at Stanford University talking about the health effects; and you have the National Weather Service warning about dangerous health effects from climate-related heat in the When are we going to finally get around to having a serious discussion about this?  It is great that we had a little pause on this wretched healthcare bill. I couldn't be happier to be rid of it for a while, and I am hoping we can be rid of it for good, but it is probably going to come back. We will have to hammer a few more stakes into the heart of this zombie before we are rid of it, and then we can move on to a serious bipartisan healthcare bill.  There is good work to be done on healthcare. There is good work to be done on climate change. But we have to take the wretched special interest politics out so we can get to serious business.  With that, I yield the floor.

9059,topic-id,370,"Madam President, Team Wyden will shortly lose one of its stalwarts, but before John Michels of my Portland office takes his well-deserved retirement after two decades of service to the people of Oregon, I want to take just a few minutes to recognize his many, many contributions.  John joined my office in the late 1990s through a work-study program run by the Department of Veterans He had previously worked in construction, and he served as a jet engine mechanic in the U.Navy before coming to my office, so suffice it to say that he was no stranger to long hours and tough assignments.  As a member of Team Wyden, John put his shoulder to the wheel to help other veterans when backlogs, bureaucracy, or red tape held up the care or the recognition they had earned. In his years of service, John has managed thousands of cases for Oregon constituents struggling with one Federal agency or another.  John has also always been a practical soul and has a passion for tinkering and fixing things. He brought these skills to bear as our resident IT expert and computer whisperer in  Anybody who has worked in the government can tell you it can be tough. The pace can be grueling, the cynicism can be frustrating, and the bureaucracy can be maddening, but as John will attest, there are few more rewarding experiences than helping a veteran receive overdue recognition or bringing a new VA facility to a rural community or ensuring seniors and people with disabilities receive the Social Security benefits they so richly deserve.  John is not the type of person to trumpet his service from the rooftops, but he has an enormous heart and a passion for public service. The bottom line is that John has found ways to help me help countless people across  Now, as John knows, we never really let anybody leave Team Wyden, so I am sure we will still call upon his wealth of knowledge and experience. In the meantime, I want to thank him for all the help he has provided over these past two decades.

9338,topic-id,1251,"Mr.President, I want to recognize Les and Eva Aigner, two brave Oregonians who lived through the horrors of the I want to honor Les and Eva in the Senate today and share how they survived Nazi atrocities and went on to live in Portland, OR, where they have taught countless young men and women about the dangers of intolerance and hate.  Eva Aigner, nee Speigel, was born in 1937 in Kosice, Czechoslovakia, where she lived with her sister, mother, and father. Two years after her birth, Eva's father lost his business license due to growing anti-Semitism, prompting the family to move to There they hoped they would be safe from Nazi extremism, but even in Hungary, as a Jew, Eva's father struggled to find work.  As time went on, new laws forced Eva and her family to wear the yellow star, and Eva and her sister were soon unable to attend school due to growing intolerance. Soon after, Eva's father was taken to a forced labor camp where he was killed. Eva and her remaining family members were then taken to the Budapest ghetto where the Nazis selected Eva's mother for deportation to a concentration camp.  The remaining children, including Eva and her sister, as well as the sick and the old who were unable to work for the Nazi war machine, were taken to the Danube in the middle of the night to be shot. Eva and her sister only managed to survive because their mother escaped from the deportation train and bribed a guard to spare their lives. From there, they were taken back into the Budapest ghetto where they hid, without food or running water, until the Russian soldiers liberated the ghetto on January 18, 1945. The rest of Eva's extended family, who remained in Czechoslovakia, with the exception of one cousin, did not survive the  Like Eva, Leslie ``Les'' Aigner was born in In his case, the small town of Nove Zamky, on June 3, 1929. He had two sisters--one older, one younger. The Aigners moved to Hungary in the early 1940s to escape the growing Nazi threat, settling in Csepel, on the outskirts of Since Jewish children were not allowed access to higher education, Les went to a trade school to become a machinist. Eventually, it became unsafe for Les to even walk to school, and his devoutly religious family stopped attending synagogue for fear of attack. Les's father was soon taken to a labor camp, and his 16-year-old sister was taken to a paper mill to do forced labor. Les, his mother and his 8-year-old sister were then forced into the Budapest ghetto before being taken to Upon arrival, the Nazis selected Les's mother and sister for the gas chambers and took Les to the camp.  Les spent 4 months in He worked in the kitchen and survived by stealing food. During his imprisonment in the concentration camp, Les was injured after a guard threw a pitchfork through his foot. While Les was in the hospital with an infection from this injury, a Epstein warned Les that the Nazis planned to execute prisoners who were no longer able to walk. At Epstein's urging, Les limped out of the hospital in the middle of the night to avoid being taken to the gas chamber. Epstein, a prisoner himself, saved Les's life that night.  Les then exchanged his clothing with another prisoner who wanted to stay with his father in Auschwitz and was transferred to Landsberg, a sub-camp of He performed hard labor for several months and was then transferred again to Kauffering Camp, where he contracted typhus before being sent to Dachau on the so-called Death  By the time he arrived, Les weighed only 75 pounds. He was finally freed by American soldiers on April 29, 1945. It took over a month of treatment before Les was able to walk on his own. When Les finally regained his health, he made his way back to Budapest, where he reunited with his father and older sister. Most of their other family members had been killed.  After the war, both Eva and Les began to rebuild their lives in They finished school and joined the workforce, Les as a machinist and Eva as an office worker at a collective fur company. In 1956, Les and Eva where introduced to one another by Eva's colleague, who happened to be a distant relative of Les and Eva quickly became engaged and were married only 59 days later. When the Hungarian Revolution began against the communist regime, Les and Eva, along vat Les's father and stepmother, fled to Austria and then the U.S., eventually settling in Portland,  Starting over in a new country was challenging, but the Aigners carried on and made a life in Portland, finding work and starting a family. Les continued to work as a machinist, and Eva worked as a cosmetologist, eventually opening her own salon. Eva's mother came to live with them in Portland as well. Les and Eva are the proud parents of their daughter Sue, and their son Rob, who blessed them with four wonderful grandsons. They are waiting to welcome their first great-grandchild.  Les and Eva rebuilt their lives, but they never forgot the horrors they had endured. As Holocaust deniers became increasingly vocal in the 1980s, the Aigners began telling their stories publicly and speaking out against discrimination and intolerance. They have worked with the Holocaust Memorial Coalition since its inception in 1994. Eva was even the vice chair of the project to build the Oregon Holocaust Memorial, which she said was the proudest achievement in her life besides giving birth to her children.  Many of my colleagues in the Senate have heard me speak about my own family's experience fleeing the Nazi regime during the We lost family and loved ones on Kristallnacht and at Tolerance, inclusiveness, and compassion are issues my family takes very seriously. That is why I am so deeply honored to be able to recognize the Aigners today and to pay tribute to the invaluable work that they do.  At a time when hate and intolerance seem increasingly pervasive in our social and political discourse, it is now more important than ever that we remember the horrors that so many people endured at the hands of the Nazi regime, the death and pain they suffered in the name of hate, discrimination, and fear. In Eva Aigner's own words, ``Discrimination can start with little things. It can start with as much as racial jokes or religious jokes. It can start with just small hatred which can grow. . . . The way to fight is to educate the young people. To let them know what discrimination can do. And how innocent people can get killed and go through such terrors . . . and have their family pulled apart.''  We must not forget; we must educate. We must educate ourselves and each other so that nothing like the horrors of the Nazi regime will ever happen again. Les and Eva Aigner have dedicated their lives to exactly that, and that is why I am so incredibly grateful to honor them today, for their strength, their compassion, their generosity, and their willingness to educate and make Oregon, our country, and our world a more tolerant, safer, and better place.  For that reason, I offer both Les and Eva Aigner my deepest affection and warmest thanks for using their voices to teach generations to come to never, ever forget.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-27-pt1-PgS4418.txt,1247,TRIBUTE TO LES AND EVA AIGNER,2017.0,27.0,May
