                        PENDING CRISIS IN AFRICA

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the 
impending crisis in Africa. More than 20 million people in Yemen, South 
Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria face starvation and famine, according to 
the U.N. Secretary-General.
  At a time when the mainstream media and the Washington press corps is 
obsessed with President Trump, they remain silent when there is a 
mounting disaster that could make the Syrian refugee crisis look like 
child's play.
  All four of these countries have weak or failing governments, and 
each is in the midst of a seemingly endless conflict perpetrated by 
evil terrorist groups, such as Boko Haram, al Shabaab, and al-Qaida.
  Pouring the billions of needed dollars into the region will help stop 
the coming famine, but it will take American leadership working with 
partners in the region willing to take a stand to rid their continent 
of these terrorist threats.
  I will continue to bring light to the imminent crisis in Africa, and 
I urge my colleagues to focus on this critical issue.
