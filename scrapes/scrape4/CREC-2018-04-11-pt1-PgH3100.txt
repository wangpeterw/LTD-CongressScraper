   RECOGNIZING THE PATRIOTISM AND GENEROSITY OF AL KATZENBERGER, JR.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. Bost) for 5 minutes.
  Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the patriotism and 
generosity of Al Katzenberger, Jr., a true friend to southern Illinois 
and its veterans.
  After Memorial Day last year, a thunderstorm blew through Mound City 
National Cemetery in Pulaski County.
  The 50 cotton flags that make up the Avenue of Flags of the cemetery 
were no match for the 70-mile-per-hour winds. Every flagpole was 
destroyed at this center of pride for our local community.
  Upon hearing the news, Alfred, who served in the U.S. Navy for over 
40 years, decided to take action. He donated 50 new flagpoles worth 
over $12,000.
  It is selfless acts like this that help make our community stronger.
  To Alfred, we say: Thank you for your decades of service to our 
Nation and your continued dedication to honoring our Nation's veterans.
