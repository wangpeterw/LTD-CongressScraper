                      DON'T MAKEAMERICA SICK AGAIN

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after years of attacking the 
Affordable Care Act, Republican's repeal plan will havecold, hard 
consequences for millions of Americans; not just the millions on the 
insurance exchange, but also those of ourconstituents who receive 
insurance through their employer coverage.
  Beginning now, on a State-by-State basis, hospitals, doctors, patient 
advocates, and faith groups will be stepping forwardto express the 
negative impacts of repealing the Affordable Care Act.
  The Affordable Care Act has improved Americans' lives in the areas of 
healthcare coverage, consumer protections, costs, andquality.
  Millions will lose health coverage. The individual insurance market 
will be in shambles. Hospitals in our States will losebillions and the 
economy will be hurt.
  Without health insurance, people with chronic diseases will lose care 
and become sicker. Without healthcare coverage, peoplewith chronic 
diseases die.
  It is bad for patients, budgets, and the healthcare system as a 
whole. Every major law that has passed Congress needs tohave oversight 
revisions to make sure it is as effective as intended.
  Congress can amend any law, but doing so in a way that will cause 
millions of Americans to be without insurance is justwrong.
  No repeal without a replacement.
