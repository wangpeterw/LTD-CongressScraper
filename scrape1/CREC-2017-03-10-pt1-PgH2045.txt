                    AN EXERCISE IN SMOKE AND MIRRORS

  (Mr. LAWSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. LAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan to repeal and 
replace the Affordable Care Act is an exercise in smoke and mirrors.
  This proposal would give tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans while 
burdening the hardworking families with higher healthcare costs. The 
Republican plan also allows soaring new healthcare costs for our 
seniors and shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund, endangering 
seniors and disabled Americans who depend on Medicaid coverage. This is 
completely unacceptable to Floridians.
  We need to hear from the Congressional Budget Office about what this 
bill would really mean in numbers. The American people deserve to 
understand what the Republicans are trying to do with their health 
care.
  I will continue to fight to ensure that Floridians with preexisting 
conditions don't have to worry about losing their healthcare coverage, 
and that young adults can stay on their parents' insurance until they 
reach age 26, and that we are going to do all we can to make health 
care affordable and accessible for all Americans and not just for a 
select few.
