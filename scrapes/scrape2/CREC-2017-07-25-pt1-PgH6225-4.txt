               CELEBRATING ESTES PARK'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of Estes Park, Colorado--the gateway to 
Rocky Mountain National Park and one of the many treasured mountain 
towns in our beautiful Second Congressional District of Colorado.
  Over 150 years ago, pioneers of the mountain west settled in Estes 
Park. Homesteaders came from all walks of life.
  In April of 1917, the formal incorporation of the town of Estes Park 
took place, ensuring our community could continue to serve the growing 
needs of those living in and visiting the beautiful valley.
  Since its incorporation, Estes Park has been a vital community 
partner in growing the outdoor recreation economy, playing host to 4.5 
million visitors to Rocky Mountain National Park, making it the single 
most popular tourist attraction in our entire State. The iconic Stanley 
Hotel and the Historic Park Theatre are just a few of the iconic 
landmarks in Estes Park.
  Estes Park's ZIP Code is 80517, and on August 5, 2017--8/5/17--Estes 
Park will have its official centennial celebration--80517. I am 
incredibly proud to represent the community of Estes Park and its 
citizens in Congress, and I am thrilled to celebrate the 100th 
anniversary of Estes Park.
