                HONORING THE MEMORY OF NICK LITTLEFIELD

  (Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening with a heavy heart to 
honor the memory of Nick Littlefield, a dear friend and dedicated 
public servant who passed away last week.
  Few in our country could match Nick's career. From the stages of 
Broadway to classrooms at Harvard Law School, to courtrooms in New York 
City, and eventually to the Halls of this Capitol as an aide to my late 
uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy, Nick did it all.
  Always guided by the simple principle that our laws should help 
protect our citizens, his fingerprints can be found on landmark 
legislation such as the Children's Health Insurance Program, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family Medical Leave Act, and the 
1996 minimum wage increase.
  Every day that he arrived at his Senate office, he brought a 
contagious enthusiasm for his work and extraordinary empathy for the 
people he served. Even while battling the multiple system atrophy that 
ultimately cost him his life, he considered himself ``not entirely 
unlucky'' to have this disease because it allowed him to ``truly 
sympathize'' with those who had disabilities.
  Nothing was ever more important to him than his family. In this 
difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with Nick's incredible 
wife, Jenny, as well as his stepchildren Frank, Tom, and Kate.
