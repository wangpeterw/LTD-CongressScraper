  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.
  The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a very, very important 
public health bill, H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. This 
legislation funds a 5-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, known as CHIP, along with a 2-year extension of community 
health centers and numerous other critically important public health 
programs.
  This bill will deliver quality healthcare and peace of mind to 
millions of Americans. The patients and families helped by this 
legislation are our neighbors and our friends. More than 8 million 
children receive CHIP-funded coverage, and more than 25 million 
patients are served by our community health centers and other important 
programs.
  This 5-year funding of CHIP marks one of the longest extensions of 
the program since it was created 20 years ago. The policy we are 
considering mirrors the bipartisan policy that has been introduced and 
voted out of our sister

[[Page H8457]]

committee in the United States Senate.
  Funding for these important programs expired September 30. The 
committee worked on a bipartisan basis well before this deadline to try 
and reach a bipartisan agreement on a range of policies to offset the 
costs of this very critically important funding extension.
  Three times, at the request of the Democrats, we delayed committee 
action--three times. We tried to find offsets that were agreeable as we 
have always been able to do before. Unfortunately, that was not the 
case this time. These delays meant Congress went past the deadline of 
September 30.
  While States still have rollover CHIP funds available and the next 
wave of community health center funds won't go out until next year, we 
cannot wait any longer. Patients cannot wait any longer. Patients need 
care, these critical programs need funding, and we must move forward.
  In my district alone, there are 12 federally qualified health center 
organizations, with 63 delivery sites. They leverage $41 million in 
Federal money in order to serve more than 240,000 patients in Oregon's 
Second District. These health centers--and I have visited many of 
them--are prevention and public health in action, often serving as the 
main provider of care for people for hundreds of miles around.
  We are also extending the National Health Service Corps and the 
Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program. Now, Mr. 
Speaker, these are really important workforce programs that place 
qualified providers into some of the most underserved areas of our 
country.
  In addition to community health centers and the workforce programs, 
this bill extends the funding for the Special Diabetes Program and the 
Family-to-Family Health Information centers, the Personal 
Responsibility Program, and the Youth Empowerment Program. These 
locally based, patient-centered organizations provide comprehensive 
services to those most in need.
  Moreover, this legislation eliminates 2 years of the across-the-board 
cuts to Medicaid allotments called for under the Affordable Care Act, 
ObamaCare. We delay those cuts for disproportionate share hospitals for 
2 years. Medicaid DSH funding represents an important component of many 
State Medicaid programs and is particularly relied upon by many States 
to help provide additional resources to key safety net providers.
  Now, while this relief is only temporary and does not address the 
larger structural challenges under ObamaCare, it would give Congress 
time to explore what budget-neutral approaches there might be to 
allocate existing DSH dollars on a more equitable and fair basis. In my 
State alone of Oregon, hospitals have told me this relief in this bill, 
just for them, represents $6.8 million over the next 2 years that they 
can use to help low-income people get access to hospital care.
  Now, in paying for this package--and this is the area where we have 
the most disagreement with the Democrats--we have taken a fiscally 
responsible approach, like using existing funding streams for 
prevention and public health efforts, ensuring high-dollar lottery 
winners are removed from the Medicaid program so its limited resources 
can be prioritized for the most vulnerable, and stopping individuals on 
the Affordable Care Act's exchanges from gaming the system.
  The bill also asks Medicare's wealthiest 1 percent, people who are 
retired and making $40,000 a month--not a year, a month--to pay about 
$135 more for their Medicare just on parts B and D that is already 
subsidized by 75 percent, just a little more so we can fund children's 
health insurance for 5 years.
  While it was not ultimately possible, unfortunately, to reach 
consensus on some of the policies to offset the new funding in this 
bill, there is broad bipartisan agreement on the core policies 
contained in this legislation, and I believe there is bipartisan 
support for many of the reasonable and fiscally responsible offsets 
contained in H.R. 3922.
  Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. This is long-overdue 
legislation. It reflects the good work done by your House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to put politics aside 
today and ensure these vital programs get the funding extensions they 
need. We are over the deadline. It is time to act.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.R. 3922, a 
partisan bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, 
or CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health 
programs.
  It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan 
bill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop 
a bipartisan compromise, but House Republicans chose to spend the first 
9 months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They 
failed, but now House Republicans are using the reauthorization of CHIP 
and community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the ACA.

  Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: if Republicans can't repeal the ACA 
outright, they will cripple it any time they can.
  This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million 
children and the care of families all around the country that use 
community health centers. They are risking that care because this 
partisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law.
  By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and 
community health centers will not be reauthorized until the end of the 
year, and that is extremely unfortunate.
  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers, 
and all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill. 
These programs have traditionally been bipartisan, but the bill before 
us extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the 
Affordable Care Act and undermining Medicare.
  In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it 
strips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the 
Prevention Fund, which pays for immunization and vaccines, lead 
poisoning prevention, opioid treatment, and many other important 
programs; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs. 
Democrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we 
reject the way Republicans are paying for them.
  Mr. Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money, 
countless alternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for 
months. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a 
robust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and 
it was paid for in a commonsense way.
  My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare 
Advantage Plans. This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the 
Office of the Inspector General, but Republicans rejected it in the 
Rules Committee. They wouldn't even allow it to come before the full 
House for a vote. And why is because they would rather use 
reauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as another way to 
sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
  I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ``no'' vote.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, before I call on my next person to say 
something here, there are 17,000 children in Mr. Pallone's district and 
14 health centers that, if he votes ``no,'' he will be voting against.
  By the way, the offset he recommended, people who are watching this 
need to know, would violate statute and it would be a PAYGO violation. 
That is why it was not acceptable.
  See, this is the problem we faced. We delayed three times at their 
request only to be offered up a pay-for that violates statute and 
violates our PAYGO rules. We could not accept that. We have to operate 
within the law like everyone else in America.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Burgess).
  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the 
time, for the recognition.
  Let me just say, I want to thank members of the Health Subcommittee, 
both sides of the dais, who have worked hard on this legislation, and 
it is unfortunate that it was not brought to the floor of the House in 
the month of September.

[[Page H8458]]

  From a subcommittee perspective, we were ready. We had our 
legislative hearings in June. We were delayed one time when the whole 
House recessed after the shooting of the Members at the baseball 
practice, but we rescheduled for 2 weeks later, and we had a successful 
hearing. We had a good hearing; a lot of facts were laid out. We came 
up with commonsense legislation that was offset in a responsible way. 
The offsets are not draconian.
  We have before us a bill today that will, in fact, fund some of the 
Nation's most important public health programs. It does fund the State 
Children's Health Insurance for 5 years, one of the longest extensions 
for this program since its inception in 1996. It will ensure that 
children and families who rely on this program will continue to receive 
the access they need. It also includes, in a fiscally responsible way, 
to delay the harmful ObamaCare-mandated cuts to safety net hospitals, 
who also provide care to underserved patients.
  Now, think about that for a minute. We are accused of undermining 
ObamaCare, but here is a cut that ObamaCare mandates to your safety net 
hospitals across the country--not just in Texas, but across the 
country--and we are replacing that today in a fiscally responsible way.
  It provides funding for community health centers, an important key 
part of healthcare in communities across the country. It will help the 
Americans who rely on these vital health services.
  Not only does the bill provide assistance for underserved 
populations, but it does so without adding to the national debt. The 
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called this a responsible 
health package, noting that the $18 billion cost is fully offset, with 
savings beyond the 10-year budget window.
  Other groups have also been supportive: Texas Hospital Association, 
Texas Health Resources--for me back home--Children's Hospital, and a 
number of healthcare organizations.
  We have data from MACPAC, whose job it is to advise Congress on 
Medicaid and CHIP policy; and MACPAC has advised us that, under current 
law, there are no new Federal funds for State Children's Health 
Insurance for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Unless Congress acts to 
renew funding, all States will experience a shortfall in CHIP funds for 
2018, which means, if someone is contemplating a ``no'' vote on this 
bill, if you are contemplating a ``no'' vote, you do need to be aware 
that if you live in the States of Arizona and Minnesota, you ran out of 
money in October of 2017; North Carolina, same situation. Oregon runs 
out next month. Vermont runs out next month. You need to think about 
your ``no'' vote before you apply it.

  Every single U.S. territory, with the exception of Puerto Rico, ran 
out of money in the month of October.
  So those are a few facts that people do need to bear in mind, if they 
vote ``no'' on this bill, what the actual implications of that are.
  Yesterday, during debate on the rule, I heard a lot of discussion 
about taking money out of the Prevention Fund. It doesn't take money 
out of the Prevention Fund, but it does provide discretion for some 
prevention and public health dollars. It takes it away from the 
executive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health 
programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, like 
community health centers.
  So we are fulfilling our Article I responsibility. We shouldn't just 
be giving everything to the administration to decide how to spend 
money, whether it be a Democratic or Republican administration. This is 
the right thing to do.
  I am proud of the work done by our subcommittee. I think our 
subcommittee staff has performed admirably on both sides of the dais.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill. It is time to act, as 
our chairman has said.

                              {time}  0930

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Eshoo).
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill, the so-called 
CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. First of all, we are a month late and 
many dollars short. It was the majority that brought it up late. We 
didn't have anything to do with being late.
  Secondly, we are playing political games with the lives of 14 percent 
of the children in my congressional district who receive their health 
insurance through the Children's Health Insurance Program and the five 
federally qualified health centers in my congressional district. They 
provide medical, dental, and mental health services to almost 55,000 of 
my constituents every year.
  Reauthorizing these historically bipartisan programs is critical to 
the health and safety of not only my constituents but millions of 
others across our country.
  Today, the Republican majority is holding them hostage by insisting 
to fund these programs by means-testing Medicare beneficiaries, kicking 
individuals who purchase their health coverage on the marketplaces off 
their insurance, and gutting the Public Health Prevention Fund 
established in the Affordable Care Act.
  Remember, the Republicans have set their budget based on eliminating 
the Affordable Care Act. My State of California will run out of funding 
for CHIP sometime between now and December. This has never happened 
before in the history of this program.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California.
  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, the community health centers in my district 
have told me about the difficult decisions they have to make because 
Congress has not reauthorized their funding, including layoffs of 
physicians and closing clinics' doors. We are playing with people's 
lives here.
  If we can't find the funding for these important bipartisan programs, 
then we don't deserve to be Members of Congress. I cannot support a 
bill that hurts people instead of helping them.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to 
respond.
  Mr. Speaker, my friend, and she is my friend from California, 
obviously was not aware of the fact that it was her party, her leader, 
who asked us on three occasions to delay bringing this to the floor, 
including you could look at the CQ article from October 23 where Mr. 
Pallone says he hopes it doesn't come to the floor.
  This was a bipartisan agreement not to bring it until we could try to 
work these things out. We were all trying to figure out how to get this 
done.
  When it comes to Medicare, remember, we are talking about people 
making $40,000 a month paying $135 a month more. We can fully fund 
children's health insurance for millions of children.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), the conference chairwoman.
  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his 
tremendous leadership on the reauthorization of CHIP, including many 
vital public health programs.
  CHIP provides healthcare coverage for some 9 million children--more 
than a million in Washington State. We all need to remember how 
important this program is for the health of some of the most 
vulnerable.
  Some States, like mine, are expecting to run out of CHIP funding 
soon. It is crucial that we move forward now.
  This bill also reauthorizes the Teaching Health Center Graduate 
Medical Education program, providing funding for 2 years, with a robust 
increase. This not only preserves current programs like the Spokane 
Teaching Health Center, but it also provides funding for the creation 
of new programs in communities that need them.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a real difference to those who need 
healthcare, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, it is the ultimate absurdity for my colleague, the 
chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, to suggest that somehow 
I control when a bill comes to the floor of the House of 
Representatives.
  The only reason that the Republicans ever delayed bringing this vote 
to the floor is because they know and I know that, if this bill is 
partisan, it will

[[Page H8459]]

never become law. It will go to the Senate, and it will sit there, and 
the only way that it is going to become law is if it is a bipartisan 
effort that actually accomplishes something and gets most people to 
support it.
  We could keep listening to the other side all day say: Oh, the 
Democrats delayed the vote. The Democrats delayed the vote.
  The vote shouldn't be held today. The vote should be delayed today 
because this is going nowhere. This bill is going nowhere. They know 
it. You want to keep saying it? You can say it all day for the next 
hour, but it is the ultimate of absurdity.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene 
Green), who is the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member for 
yielding time to me.
  I rise to oppose H.R. 3922. I got elected to Congress to expand 
access for healthcare. I am not a doctor, I am not a nurse, but as 
Members of Congress, we can do as much damage as someone who isn't a 
doctor or nurse by legislation that we see today.
  And while I strongly support extending funding for the Children's 
Healthcare Insurance Program and federally qualified health centers, 
delaying cuts to disproportionate share hospital payments, advancing 
our other bipartisan healthcare programs, this legislation includes 
offsets that undermine access to cover these services.

  Again, my goal in Congress was to expand healthcare, and this bill 
restricts that access. Two-thirds of Medicaid dollars go to children. 
If you cut Medicaid, you are cutting those children's benefits. This 
bill cuts children from Medicaid, and it gives money to the children 
who are less poor on CHIP. We need both programs. We don't need one or 
the other.
  Both CHIP and FQHCs are bedrocks of our healthcare system, providing 
health insurance to almost 9 million lower-income children serving on 
the front lines by providing high-quality primary and preventative care 
to more than 25 million Americans.
  Congress let funding for these programs expire last month, the first 
time in our history, since the 1960s, that the FQHCs and the CHIP 
program were not bipartisan. That is the step this House is making 
today by doing this.
  It should be bipartisan because it has always been bipartisan. 
Unfortunately, instead of bipartisan negotiations looking for a 
compromise, the process was derailed. The bill cuts, again, Medicaid. 
Two-thirds are children, to help poor children, and limit their access.
  The Prevention Fund funds the Centers for Disease Control. We have 
any number of future illnesses that we need the CDC to have the ability 
to fight that, and here we are, cutting vaccinations in our 
communities. We are cutting infectious disease detection and 
prevention.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and let's expand 
access and not restrict it.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I would point out there are about 50,000 
kids that Mr. Green may be voting against today in the Houston area if 
this goes down and we can't get this over to the Senate and work it out 
with them. Twice he has voted to cut the Prevention Fund and use it for 
other purposes.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey 
(Mr. Lance).
  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. This 
package is the product of our work on the Energy and Commerce Committee 
under the leadership of Chairman Walden. This legislation accomplishes 
the very important goals of reauthorizing the Children's Health 
Insurance Program, renewing funding for community health centers, and 
extending critical resources for Medicaid in Puerto Rico.
  One of the first votes I cast in Congress was for CHIP, creating a 
fiscally responsible health program that now serves 8.5 million 
children in the United States.
  I continue to support community health centers and the work they do 
in areas like Dover and Somerville, New Jersey, in the district I 
serve.
  We also cannot forget about the many families and children in Puerto 
Rico, who also benefit from the Medicaid program. That is why I have 
teamed up with Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon, to make sure low-
cost Federal healthcare continues to be made available to our American 
children in Puerto Rico.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation and for the United 
States Senate to act as soon as possible.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Engel).
  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the situation we are 
in today. Historically, CHIP and community health centers have been 
bipartisan priorities. We are talking about programs that provide 
healthcare for millions of American children and serve some of our 
country's most vulnerable citizens.
  Yet my Republican colleagues have inexplicably taken these programs 
hostage, tucking into this bill new attempts to undermine Medicare, 
sabotage the ACA, and strip hardworking Americans of their health 
insurance, not to mention they are trying to extort these harmful 
policy changes a month after they let CHIP and community health center 
funding expire. This is absolutely unconscionable because, make no 
mistake, these cuts will hurt the same Americans who depend on CHIP and 
community health centers.
  My Democratic colleagues and I care deeply about these programs. That 
is why we have sounded the alarm for months, not just yesterday, for 
months, and urged the majority to stop wasting time on ACA repeal and 
get to work on renewing these lifelines for American families.
  Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that didn't happen, and I am 
disappointed by what is happening now. I urge my colleagues to vote 
``no.''
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Olson), a very important member of our committee.
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time to me.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly encourage my colleagues to 
support the HEALTHY KIDS Act. There are many reasons to support this 
bill, but, most importantly, it extends the Children's Health Insurance 
Program, CHIP, until 2022.
  CHIP ensures that children with incomes too low for Medicaid get 
basic health insurance. Close to 400,000 children in Texas rely on CHIP 
for access to quality healthcare services. We must act now.
  Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left a path of destruction across 
Texas. It put a major strain on our communities and resources that has 
resulted in moments of uncertainty.
  The bottom line is, we must act now. This bill responsibly provides 
children in need with the proper resources to live a healthy life 
without adding to our country's deficit.
  Mr. Speaker, again, I strongly urge my colleagues to act now. Vote 
for this bill.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the ranking member of our Oversight 
Subcommittee.
  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, as one of the authors of the original bill 
20 years ago, I rise to express deep disappointment that the House has 
not been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on how to fund the 
extension of CHIP.
  The September 30 deadline has long passed, and now 9 million children 
and families are waiting anxiously for us to figure this out. My home 
State of Colorado is likely to run out of CHIP funding in January, with 
termination notices going out to worried families in the next few 
weeks.
  Yet here we are with a partisan bill that asks us to pay for low-
income children's insurance on the backs of seniors and the most 
vulnerable.
  The bill also cuts the Affordable Care Act, which could result in 
668,000 people enrolled in ACA plans losing their health insurance. 
Nobody should have to lose coverage in order for others to keep it. 
This is a false choice, and it is out of step with what the American 
people have been calling on us to do. Only the 115th Congress could 
find a way to make the CHIP bill partisan.
  Irrespective of what happens today in this vote, I urge my colleagues 
to get together across the aisle, across the Capitol, find a way to 
reauthorize this important bill in a way that doesn't cut benefits for 
other people. Let's

[[Page H8460]]

truly give kids these benefits that they need, and let's move on with 
our business.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), an incredible advocate for children and 
healthcare in America.
  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to serve on this great 
committee under the chairman's leadership.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important bill, which 
incorporates my bill, the Community CARE Act, which reauthorizes 
funding for community health centers for the next 2 years.
  Community health centers have a proven track record of providing 
high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare to approximately 25 million 
Americans, including 7 million children, and 300,000 veterans each 
year. There are over 100 million coordinated and integrated patient 
visits through the 1,400 community health centers across the country.

                              {time}  0945

  This bill will reauthorize CHIP for the next 5 years. This program is 
vital for the roughly 360,000 children on CHIP in Florida alone.
  Additionally, this bill provides clarity for CHIP buy-in programs, 
such as the one we have in Florida. This sets the rules of the road and 
will ensure that 12,000 children in Florida's CHIP buy-in program will 
continue to have access to CHIP.
  Mr. Speaker, let's get this done now for our children. I urge passage 
of this important piece of legislation.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, the truth is that Republicans are 
holding the Children's Health Insurance Program, 9 million kids, and 
the Community Health Center program, 15 million people, hostage to 
wreak even more havoc on our healthcare system and make children and 
seniors sicker and undercut Medicare.
  Paying for children's health insurance on the backs of seniors is 
simply a disgrace. This bill would increase Medicare part D and part B 
income-related premiums, charging higher income seniors the entire 
cost. This is a structural attack on Medicare, and that is why the 
AARP, which supports the Children's Health Insurance Program, opposes 
this bill. Imposing a 100 percent premium is unfair because these 
seniors already pay more, and it will drive many out of Medicare 
altogether, undermining its solvency.
  To make matters worse, the Republican income threshold is not based 
on current income, but on a 2-year period. So, for example, seniors' 
income is volatile, and if you sold your home, you could get a massive 
premium penalty, even if you used the money you got from selling your 
home to buy in to assisted living and that money wasn't available.
  Income-related premiums are simply unnecessary. There are many other 
ways to pay for the CHIP program without using Medicare as an ATM. 
Democrats have offered reasonable alternatives, but Republicans opposed 
all of them.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Before I call on my next colleague, I just want to point out that, in 
Ms. Schakowsky's district, all we are talking about here is seniors 
making $41,000 a month--a month--would pay an extra 135 bucks so we can 
fully fund children's health insurance, community health centers. All 
these programs in here are funded. We use the Prevention Fund, which is 
not allocated out in the out-years. It is just a pot of money you can 
use for prevention and wellness. We actually use that to fund this as 
well.
  This is why we have been unable to reach agreement with the 
Democrats. It is sad they have made this partisan.
  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa).
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of the people 
of the San Joaquin Valley in favor of H.R. 3922.
  The people of the valley whom I represent in California did not send 
me here to put the lives of children at risk. I have made a commitment 
to improve access to healthcare for families that I have the honor to 
represent here in the House. I will continue to meet that commitment. 
The question is: Will Congress do the same and extend the Children's 
Health Insurance Program?
  My congressional district has perhaps the largest percentage of 
children who qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program in the 
entire country. The coverage is vital to families throughout my 
district, but it is particularly important to communities like Gustine, 
Planada, Chowchilla, and Biola, where these healthcare clinics provide 
such important, valuable healthcare to these children and their 
families.
  Approximately 71 percent of the children in my district receive their 
medical coverage through the combination of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program and Medicaid. We cannot let this end.
  This bill is not perfect, to be sure, but these children cannot be 
put at risk with further delays in funding for the important programs 
that this bill extends. I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. Castor), the vice ranking member of our committee.
  Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, for decades now in America we 
have worked together to make sure that kids can see a doctor and get 
the care that they need. Working with pediatricians, families, and 
advocates back home, we have reached a historic point where almost all 
kids across the country have health insurance coverage.
  The Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, or known in Florida 
as Florida KidCare, or Healthy Kids, has been an important piece of 
this historic coverage level. CHIP simply is vital for families, 
millions of hardworking families, so that their kids can get the 
checkups, the immunizations, sometimes the critical care that they need 
so they can be healthy and well.
  Now, I chair the bipartisan Children's Healthcare Caucus. We educate 
and advocate so that kids across America are healthy and well. So it is 
especially disappointing this year that my Republican colleagues failed 
to act before CHIP expired.
  See, they were consumed all year long with ripping health coverage 
away, decimating the Affordable Care Act, and radically changing health 
services provided under Medicaid. In doing so, they let our kids down; 
they let our families down. And then, at the 11th hour, after the 
program expired, they come up with a very partisan bill rather than the 
bipartisan bill that has been the historic backbone of Children's 
Health Insurance.
  Don't take it from me. A lot of the advocates across the country, 
like pediatricians, obstetricians, gynecologists, March of Dimes, say: 
Please don't fund CHIP based upon harmful cuts; don't have cuts 
negatively impact the health of women, children, and families. 
Pediatricians say: Don't jeopardize other important child health 
policies in the process.

  Let's go back to the drawing board as soon as possible, over the 
weekend, next week; bring it back to the floor next week, so that 
families and kids get the care that they need.
  This bill today, unfortunately, is simply a delay.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, there they go again: delay, delay, delay; 
and vote against kids, vote against their hospitals, and vote against 
their doctors. That is why we couldn't get agreement.
  I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).
  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, which extends the State Children's Health 
Insurance Program, SCHIP, for another 5 years.
  In 1997, Congress created S-CHIP in partnership with the States to 
meet the healthcare needs of lower income kids. Last year, nearly 
100,000 Hoosier kids received health insurance thanks to this critical 
program. I am proud that this legislation will continue to protect 
vulnerable children in the Eighth District of Indiana.
  This bill also extends 2 years of funding for federally qualified 
health centers, family-to-family health information centers, and other 
important public health programs. This funding provides important 
healthcare services, resources, and information for families in the 
Eighth District and across America.

[[Page H8461]]

  I urge my colleagues to support passage of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY 
KIDS Act.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Vermont (Mr. Welch).
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, speaking to my chairman, Chairman Walden, I 
accept your commitment and your leadership on insuring children, but I 
am speaking to you because I reject the argument that, in order to fund 
a health insurance program that all of us support, we have to 
compromise health programs that benefit many other people, including in 
Vermont. Let me just give an example.
  The prevention program in Vermont is really helping people stay well. 
We had $922,000 that was spent on immunization programs for our kids. 
We had $377,000 for lead poisoning prevention. Lead poisoning is 
brutal. We had $372,000 for heart disease prevention and control, and 
we had over $209,000 for diabetes and prevention control.
  So I acknowledge your commitment. I acknowledge the urgency with 
which your side and our side supports CHIP. But why is it that, if we 
support it, we don't pay for it? And instead of paying for it directly, 
coming up with ways to eliminate waste in the healthcare system, we 
take away our ability to immunize, to prevent lead poisoning, to reduce 
heart disease? That is my question. The answer for me would be that we 
go where the waste is.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman from Vermont an additional 30 
seconds.
  Mr. WELCH. The answer to me would be that our committee engages in 
addressing the waste in healthcare, including high prescription drug 
costs, rather than take it out of good programs.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I appreciate the gentleman's sincerity. We work well together on lots 
of issues. He has also voted to use this Prevention Fund for other 
purposes in the past, as have I.
  We don't touch the Prevention Fund for 2018, and there is $400 
million left in 2019, and billions thereafter for the very important 
programs the gentleman has articulated. We don't use all the money. We 
leave money behind for these other purposes.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  The bottom line is, when you start cutting money from the Prevention 
Fund, you are cutting prevention programs for kids, adults, the 
disabled, and, most importantly, the opiates.
  CDC spends a significant amount of money from the Prevention Fund 
dealing with the opiate crisis, so don't tell me that somehow this is 
okay. You are taking money away from opiate prevention. You are taking 
money away from kids programs like lead poisoning and vaccines. It is 
unbelievable how much is actually going to be lost from the Prevention 
Fund because of this bill.
  I am not interested in what happened in the past. I want to know what 
is going to happen in the future. We have an opiate crisis. Don't take 
money away from the Prevention Fund that is used to deal with that 
crisis.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I do think it is important to note that my 
friend, and he is my friend from New Jersey, has twice voted to use 
this Prevention Fund for other purposes, including the 2012 middle 
class tax cut.
  I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).
  (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot today on the floor 
about the children's component of this bill, the S-CHIP. It is a good 
program. It covers about 45 percent of the low-income children in 
Texas. It is a very worthwhile program and needs to be reauthorized and 
funded.
  I also want to talk about the community health centers. In Ennis, 
Texas, there is the Nell Barton Hope Clinic Annex. Nell Barton was my 
mother.
  The Joe Barton Family Foundation purchased a building for the Hope 
Clinic, which is a federally funded health center that is primarily 
located in Waxahachie, Texas. Every day, several dozen low-income 
people go to the Nell Barton Hope Clinic. Over the course of the year, 
several thousand people go to the Hope Clinic in both Ennis and 
Waxahachie. This bill reauthorizes those health centers for 2 years.
  Now, my friends on the Democratic side, I am not sure what they are 
complaining about. This is a program that funds healthcare for children 
and for low-income people through the community health centers. It is 
fully offset, and funding is increasing, Mr. Speaker, not decreasing, 
but it is doing so in a way that it is offset. What is the big offset?
  I hope we vote for this bill when it comes up for a vote later today.

                              {time}  1000

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to talk about this use of the Prevention 
Fund. Democrats have never supported the type of drastic cuts to the 
Prevention Fund that is in this proposal today. In fact, when faced 
with such cuts, we voted ``no'' nine times. In the two cases where we 
voted in favor of using some of the Prevention Fund as an offset, 
neither cut placed the CDC programs and efforts at risk as this 
legislation does today.
  The Republican proposal would cut the Prevention Fund nearly in half 
and leave a $400 million hole in funding for prevention and health 
programs within the CDC's budget beginning in 2019. This cut would be 
devastating to local, State and Federal efforts to protect the Nation's 
health.
  Unlike my Republican counterparts, what they contend, this cut to 
these programs would not be made up in the annual appropriations 
process, as evidenced by the proposed cut of $198 million to the CDC in 
the House Republican fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill, and the 
decrease of $580 million in CDC funding since 2010 when adjusted for 
inflation.
  Again, you talk about opiates, you talk about children's health 
programs. These would be drastically cut because of what they are doing 
today to the Prevention Fund.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan, I would just point out that when Democrats joined Republicans 
in voting for the 2012 middle class tax cut, we used $6.3 billion out 
of the Prevention Fund they now say they never touched, yet they have.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. Walberg).
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3922. I 
want to thank Chairman Walden and Dr. Burgess for their leadership in 
bringing this bill to the floor today.
  The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorizes and funds a number of 
programs important to my constituents, including the State Children's 
Health Insurance Program, community health centers, and the Teaching 
Health Center Graduate Medical Education program.
  H.R. 3922 will continue CHIP for 5 years, allowing this successful 
Federal-State partnership to provide health coverage for low-income 
children and pregnant women. It also extends funding to federally 
qualified health centers for 2 years, a key component of the healthcare 
safety net; and helps address our increasing health provider shortages 
by investing in the education and training of future health 
professionals.
  Of importance, this legislation is fully paid for with responsible 
policies, such as measures to allow States to disenroll lottery winners 
from Medicaid and prioritize the most vulnerable.
  I am proud of the good work that was done by the Energy and Commerce 
Committee to advance this legislation to the floor, and I encourage my 
colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill and to ensure the programs are 
available for the people who depend upon them.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. Matsui).
  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922.
  Mr. Speaker, the uncertainty that we have created for our community 
health clinics and their patients is unacceptable. Each day it is a new 
threat. Most

[[Page H8462]]

of the year it has been TrumpCare's severe cuts to Medicaid, which 
health centers and their patients rely upon. Today it is a lack of 
extension of the critical grant funding. Tomorrow or the next week, we 
will be back to ripping Medicaid away to pay for the Republican's tax 
cuts.
  We have always extended CHIP and community health center funding on a 
bipartisan basis, but, unfortunately, the bill before us today is not 
bipartisan. The Prevention Fund, which would be slashed in this bill, 
funds programs that are critical to children and families who rely upon 
CHIP and community health centers. Many times these programs are even 
run out of our community health centers and could not exist without the 
Prevention Fund. These are things like childhood asthma prevention, 
vaccines, and lead abatement.
  It often takes someone going above and beyond a simple doctor's visit 
to provide families with the resources they need to stay healthy. We 
need to invest in these services. We cannot strip this funding from 
critical prevention programs that children and families rely on. We 
cannot allow programs like Medicare and Medicaid to be attacked and 
raided.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3922.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, once again, my dear friend from California 
has twice voted to use these Prevention Funds for other things. By the 
way, when we use them for community health centers, they are doing this 
work on the ground, helping people with opioid addictions and other 
healthcare issues.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. Carter).
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding 
and for his outstanding leadership on this very important committee.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues to put politics 
aside for the sake of the 232,000 children in my State of Georgia and 
the 8.9 million children across our Nation who are counting on us to 
reauthorize CHIP. Twelve States will run out of CHIP funding before the 
end of this year. So the idea of waiting around another 2 months before 
acting on CHIP is simply unacceptable.
  Let's be clear why we are here today. Instead of having this 
discussion 2 months ago, we had to delay the Energy and Commerce 
Committee markup of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, the CHIP bill, 
because the other side of the aisle refused to even consider reasonable 
offsets to pay for the program.

  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: How was that 
objection related to fighting for the middle class?
  Even President Obama supported the change for high-income Medicare 
beneficiaries in his annual budget.
  How are we supposed to look parents in the eye back home and tell 
them that we choose politics instead of choosing to relieve their 
concerns about coverage?
  Mr. Speaker, let's do our job and let's reauthorize CHIP.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. McNerney).

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3922.
  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we authorize CHIP and community 
health centers, but slashing essential public health funding is not the 
right way to do it.
  Treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75 percent of our Nation's 
healthcare spending, and many of these diseases can be prevented. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 3922 does not do that at all. This bill cuts in 
half the ACA Prevention and Public Health Fund that plays a critical 
role in preventing and treating chronic diseases, including keeping 
kids healthy.
  The massive cuts to this funding will be devastating to my Central 
Valley of California district. My district has the largest number of 
tuberculosis cases in California for children under 5 years old. 
Children in this age group are more likely to develop life-threatening 
forms of TB since their immune systems are less mature. Public 
officials in my district are relying on funding from the Prevention 
Fund to address TB outbreaks.
  It is troubling that Republicans are using CHIP reauthorization to 
take core public health services away from kids. It is also 
frustrating, but not surprising, that the Republicans are making 
another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. This legislation 
is robbing Paul to pay Peter, and I urge my colleagues to vote against 
it.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, sabotaging the Affordable Care Act; what we are doing is 
putting off planned cuts to our hospitals that take care of low-income 
people that those cuts called for under the Affordable Care Act. We are 
putting those off so they can serve these low-income people. That, in 
their language, is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.
  On the issue of using the Prevention Fund, my friend from California 
who just spoke, has twice voted to use the Prevention Fund, including 
for tax cuts in 2012 and for the 21st Century Cures Act last year. Now 
we are using it for community health centers and children's health 
insurance programs. This is an appropriate use of a fund that gets 
replenished by law every year.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto 
Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), whose constituents and herself have 
suffered such damage, such destruction as a result of the hurricanes.
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act.
  I wanted to begin by first thanking Chairman Walden and Dr. Burgess 
for their leadership in moving forward this critically needed 
legislation. I am particularly thankful for those in the leadership and 
all of my colleagues in the Energy and Commerce Committee for including 
a $1 billion allocation to temporarily address Puerto Rico's impending 
ObamaCare-created medical cliff, while also providing another year of 
the disproportionate share hospital relief.
  To put things in perspective, when we arrived in this Congress during 
January of this year, more than 1 million Puerto Ricans were facing the 
imminent possibility of losing their healthcare coverage due to a 
funding shortfall resulting from ObamaCare's disparate application to 
the island.
  We moved quickly during the appropriations bill, and they allocated 
$295 million to improve that situation. In this bill, we are allocating 
$1 billion for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. This is an important 
step, but we still need to secure a permanent and equitable solution to 
Puerto Rico's longstanding Medicaid inequalities, and that means 
changing the FMAP for the island.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. Velazquez).
  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for 
yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the historic 
damage of Hurricane Maria, this legislation shortchanges the island's 
long-struggling healthcare system at exactly the time that Puerto Rico 
most needs our help.
  This legislation provides a measly sum of Puerto Rico's Medicaid 
system. Even before Hurricane Maria made landfall, Speaker Ryan had 
committed to help resolve Puerto Rico's looming Medicaid crisis, yet 
this bill provides just $1 billion. We have no assurance or guarantee 
that the next emergency supplemental will provide appropriate funds to 
address this problem.
  The fact is that our fellow citizens have been shortchanged by the 
disparity in Medicaid funding. This forced the government of Puerto 
Rico to borrow money to provide healthcare. So if you wonder where 
Puerto Rico's financial crisis stems from, you can look right here at 
the U.S. Congress. Yet the amount included in this bill is far from 
sufficient to address even this year's shortfall. For the Puerto Rican 
people who have already suffered so much, this funding level amounts to 
an insult.
  If ever there were a time to channel aid to the island's healthcare 
system and fix the systemic problems that we sought in the system 
underfunding, this is it.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from New York.

[[Page H8463]]

  

  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, there are a litany of reasons to oppose 
this bill, but let's make it clear: one of them is that it will not do 
enough for the people of Puerto Rico. These are U.S. citizens. They 
have fought, shed blood, and died in every major conflict. Now they 
need our help, and this bill does not supply it. Reject this bill. Vote 
``no.''
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  How cynical what we just heard. How cynical.
  Ms. Velazquez has 43,000 children in CHIP, $2 billion in DSH cuts in 
her district, 43 health centers, and she is going to vote against $1 
billion for the citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands because 
that is not enough.
  Yes, we need to do more, so her answer is vote ``no'' today and deny 
$1 billion.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. Norman).
  Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3922. 
Listening to my Democratic friends, it was said right by Chairman 
Walden. It is cynical, and it is amazing that they could vote against 
this bill.
  Not only does this bill reauthorize public health programs vital to 
Americans who need them most, but it does so in a fiscally responsible 
manner. Reauthorizing CHIP for a 5-year period was an important 
priority of children's healthcare providers in my district, but doing 
so while saving billions is an impressive feat.
  On top of that, providing funding for community health centers will 
drastically improve rural health in South Carolina's Fifth District. 
This bill is proof that the American people can trust their government 
to provide essential services to citizens who cannot provide for 
themselves, without saddling our children and grandchildren with debt.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague, Chairman Walden, 
for his impressive efforts in striving toward a greater government.

                              {time}  1015

  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), who is a member of our committee.
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, this moment is a bit hard to stomach. It is 
hard to stomach yet another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care 
Act, in the words of our colleagues, while extolling the virtues of 
public health programs by cutting grace periods down to 30 days that 
will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing access to their 
insurance.
  It is hard to stomach a $1 trillion tax cut being proposed for 
wealthy adults at the same time that our Republican colleagues are 
telling us that we can't afford to care for sick kids. It is hard to 
stomach the indifference shown in this Chamber over the course of the 
past month as CHIP lapses and panic sets in amongst families whose 
lives depend on this program.
  It is hard to stomach an idea that the only way to give them care is 
to somehow take it away from somebody else, by gutting the Public 
Health Fund in the midst of an opioid epidemic or scapegoating patients 
who struggle to afford the monthly premiums and sometimes fall behind.
  Why is it always those patients who are asked to sacrifice?
  It is always those communities that are asked to do more with less.
  Why do we somehow create a false choice on this floor today that 
leads 9 million families to an impossible choice tomorrow?
  For those families, CHIP is not a privilege or a line item in the 
budget, it is a lifeline. They deserve the same decency and the same 
urgency that our Republican colleagues showed the wealthy in their tax 
plan yesterday.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Wow. We are fully funding CHIP for 5 years. We are fully funding our 
community health centers for 2 years. We are taking care of programs 
for our citizens who have diabetes. And the pay-for that they are 
objecting to most is we are asking the wealthiest seniors in America, 
those making $40,000 a month, to pay $135 more for their Medicare so we 
can do this work that is so important.
  How ironic. How cynical. This is a pay-for that has been used before 
for other programs. President Obama himself suggested in a budget that, 
instead of the top earners, the $480,000 a year, a couple making over 
$800,000 a year pay a little more as we do here, take it all the way 
down to $80,000 a year.
  We didn't do that. We just said, if you are making $480,000 a year, 
roughly $40,000 a month, you will pay $135 more. They will not vote for 
that cut to fund children's healthcare. We will.
  That is what is going on here. This is where we could never get them 
off dead center to make this bipartisan. It is a tragedy this is not a 
bipartisan bill as it always has been. I, three times, delayed moving 
this forward, including crossing the deadline of September 30, to try 
to find common ground that would be bipartisan, and we could never get 
there because they would never yield in a way where we could find 
common ground.
  So we must go to the Senate from here and we must get our work done 
for the American people.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).

 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 

  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this 
legislation because it presents us with a choice that we should not 
have to make. I take a backseat to nobody in this institution in terms 
of fighting for children and families.
  But we live in the United States of America, the greatest Nation in 
the world. I reject the notion that we have to rob Peter to pay Paul 
or, in this instance, jeopardize the future of Medicare and steal $6 
billion from critical prevention programs to pay for children's 
healthcare. They are all equal priorities, and we shouldn't have to 
sacrifice the health of one population to pay for another. It is that 
simple.
  The changes that the bill makes to Medicare may sound innocuous--and 
I have great respect for the chairman--but the reality is they will 
threaten the future of Medicare.
  Means testing Social Security is a good sound bite, but it is a very 
slippery slope. I'm not worried about whether wealthy families can be 
able to afford to pay for increased Medicare premiums, but I am worried 
that these changes will result in wealthy people abandoning the program 
in large numbers, which would worsen the risk pool and ultimately 
increase the costs for middle- and lower-income seniors. It would 
fracture completely the universal nature of Medicare and put the entire 
program at risk. It is an unwise proposal that should be rejected.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I get a time count, please, on how much 
each side has remaining?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds 
remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Doggett).
  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program 
began as a truly bipartisan initiative, but now it is being overwhelmed 
by Republican indifference. So low is it on their priority list that 
they let the law expire. Three States have already required emergency 
funding, and 400,000 Texas children are at risk if this program is not 
continued.
  In the face of this crisis, their response is: We won't put another 
new dollar into this program unless we take it from Medicare 
beneficiaries.
  Why should we begin calling on those who rely on Medicare to pay for 
non-Medicare purposes?
  It is wrong.
  The second way they propose to fund this bill is by reducing funding 
for public health and prevention, whether it is for Zika and West Nile 
virus, where I live down in Texas, or it is for the opioid crisis, 
which is affecting our State like every other one.
  Sure, we are glad to hear President Trump do a tweet and give a 
speech. But he did not add any new dollars to fight this opioid crisis. 
We need bold action, and it is not by reducing the Prevention and 
Public Health Fund. It is by supporting our children.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I will just point out that the gentleman who 
just spoke has voted to cut the Prevention Fund before to use it for 
other purposes.

[[Page H8464]]

  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).
  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support fully funding the 
CHIP Act, but to oppose to the Republican bill.
  Because of the reduction in the grace period, we are forcing 
Americans to go into their own pocket. Although this bill will 
reauthorize CHIP, it fails to show compassion for the low-income 
families and children who do not have access to critical healthcare, 
and it is a matter of life and death.
  CHIP's impact is overwhelmingly felt in communities of color. 
Together, CHIP and Medicaid help cover 52 percent of Hispanic and 54 
percent of all Black children nationwide.
  As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect our Nation's 
children. We need to support the millions of families who rely on this 
vital program. This is not the right way. We need to work together in a 
bipartisan manner to pass an important piece of legislation like CHIP 
and not take away from our children but support them.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 2\1/2\ 
minutes remaining. The gentleman from Oregon has 45 seconds remaining.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to stress again that one of the pay-fors that the 
Republicans don't talk about much is the fact that they are reducing 
the grace period from 90 days to 30 days. So if someone misses a 
payment on their insurance, they currently have 90 days to make up for 
it. Under this bill, they will only have 30 days.
  Now, the CBO estimates that over 500,000 people will lose their 
health insurance and have to reapply for next year because of this 
reduction in the grace period. I know my colleague from the other side 
says: Well, that is too bad because they have the responsibility to pay 
it.
  But the fact of the matter is that a lot of people have a hard time 
paying their monthly premium, and we should not be passing legislation 
that ends up with half-a-million people losing their health insurance.
  Again, this is a way to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. The 
Affordable Care Act is trying to make more people covered, and has 
succeeded in covering 95 percent of the people in this country.
  Why in the world would we use a pay-for that cuts back on half-a-
million people who would lose their health insurance?
  I want to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, we did not have to be here today. 
We could have done a bipartisan bill without sabotaging the Affordable 
Care Act. That is what concerns me most, Mr. Speaker. The Republicans 
tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They failed, and now they are 
trying to repeal it piece by piece.
  The pay-fors that are in this legislation are unfair to the American 
people. The Prevention Fund is used for opiate prevention and used for 
kids for various programs. Don't cut back on that to pay for these 
other things.
  The grace period--half-a-million Americans are going to lose their 
insurance because of the cutbacks in the grace period--another effort 
to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
  Lastly, and probably even most important, again, the Republicans are 
going against the Medicare program. They are trying to make cuts in the 
Medicare program and restructure the Medicare program in a way that I 
believe will hurt the Medicare program, reduce the amount of people in 
the insurance pool, and ultimately lead to higher costs for middle 
class and lower-income seniors and the disabled in the Medicare 
program.
  I urge my colleagues: Don't let the Republicans continue to sabotage 
the Affordable Care Act. We could have done this on a bipartisan basis. 
Passing this bill today does nothing for the Children's Health 
Initiative or for community health centers because this bill is going 
nowhere. It will end up in the Senate. The Senate will not take it up, 
and we will be waiting around until Christmas to actually find a way to 
fund these programs and put these programs at risk. Vote ``no.''
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, let's get this back where it belongs. We are 
fully funding the Children's Health Insurance Program for 5 years and 
community health centers for 2 years. The only sabotage of the 
Affordable Care Act going on here today is stopping cuts for hospitals 
in our districts that serve low-income people that would otherwise 
occur under the Affordable Care Act. We do that for 2 years.
  The Democrats don't think seniors making $40,000 a month--$40,000 a 
month--should pay an extra $135 for their part B and part D Medicare so 
we can take care of our community health centers and children who need 
health insurance.
  We delayed this bill coming to the floor at a bipartisan request to 
find a bipartisan solution that was elusive, sadly. We have never had 
this problem before, but we have it today. We must act.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Community 
Health and Medical Professionals Improve Our Nation (CHAMPION) Act of 
2017 (H.R. 3922).
  While I support reauthorizing funding for the Children's Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP), the Federally Qualified Health Centers 
(FQHCs), and various other important public health programs, I oppose 
this bill because it cuts funding for public health, puts families at 
risk of losing their health insurance, and weakens Medicare.
  The health of children and expecting and new mothers is something 
that we can all agree on. In my home state of Minnesota, CHIP funding 
is essential for providing healthcare to 125,000 low income children 
and 1,700 expecting and new mothers. Minnesota also depends on FQHC 
funding with over 190,000 people receiving care from one of the more 
than 70 community health centers in my state last year.
  Unfortunately, House Republicans have turned these bipartisan issues 
into an opportunity to divide us. The offsets included in this 
legislation are unacceptable to me and to Minnesota families.
  Once again, Republicans are using this legislation as yet another 
opportunity to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by cutting $6.35 
billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund over the next ten 
years. This fund, created by the ACA, directly funds our nation's 
prevention, preparedness, and response capabilities.
  If these Republican cuts become law, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention would be forced to provide less funding to cities, 
states, and tribes to rapidly address public health crises. This money 
includes funding for vaccines, flu prevention, and addressing the 
opioid epidemic. When my home state of Minnesota had to recently deal 
with a serious outbreak of measles, our community health officials 
utilized these federal resources to rapidly contain the spread of 
disease. Simply put, this irresponsible offset leaves American 
communities more vulnerable to, and unprepared for, outbreaks of 
disease.
  In addition, this bill takes aim at yet another ACA provision by 
shortening the 90-day grace period for individuals to pay premiums 
before their insurer can terminate their coverage. The current grace 
period allows low and moderate income families experiencing temporary 
financial difficulties to remain covered by their health insurance. 
Shortening this grace period from 90 days to 30 days would cause nearly 
700,000 Americans to lose their health care and bars them from 
purchasing health insurance until the next season.
  I am also concerned by the provision that introduces means testing to 
Medicare. A key strength of Medicare is its universal nature. All 
Americans pay into Medicare and all Americans should receive at least 
some benefit from it. This provision breaks that guarantee and sets a 
dangerous precedent for the future. I am also concerned that it could 
weaken the Medicare risk pool and increase costs for the taxpayer.
  Mr. Speaker, even the Majority concedes that this bill is unlikely to 
pass the Senate due to the partisan nature of its provisions. 
Republicans need to stop playing games and reauthorize these programs 
before Minnesota faces a critical December 1 deadline to continue 
coverage for children and expecting mothers.
  I urge my colleagues to vote against this measure and instead to work 
together to fund CHIP and community health centers.
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to the bill being considered on the floor today, H.R. 
3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act. Unfortunately, this deceitfully 
named measure to reauthorize the Children's Health

[[Page H8465]]

Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers (CHCs) will 
reauthorize these programs through FY19--but does so by kicking 
thousands of Americans off private insurance.
  Like many of my colleagues, I strongly support CHIP, CHCs, and other 
critical public health initiatives. However, the bill in its current 
form was drafted as yet another attempt by Republicans to undermine the 
Affordable Care Act in order to justify its repeal. The bill is 
misguided in its attempt to cut $6.35 billion over ten years from the 
Prevention and Public Health Fund in order to fund the extension.
  H.R. 3922 also reduces grace periods from 90 to 30 days, putting more 
than 688,000 low- and moderate-income individuals at risk of losing 
their state Marketplace coverage for simply paying their premiums in 
the second of third month of the existing grace period. This grace 
period is essential to low-income households that are barely making 
ends meet. By reducing the current grace period, Republicans are 
exposing thousands of families to risk due to a lack of health 
coverage. It is frankly disgraceful that we would even consider 
undermining these important public health programs in such a manner.
  Mr. Speaker, CHIP, CHCs, the National Health Service Corps, and other 
programs funded under this measure are vitally important to our nation 
and the public health of our citizens. As the first registered nurse 
elected to Congress, I understand the critical need for proper long-
term funding of our public health centers and programs. However, these 
cuts to the Prevention and Public Health Fund represent a purely 
political move by the GOP to undermine the ACA. I oppose this 
controversial offset, not my support for health centers across America. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure so that we can find offsets 
driven by policy, not politics, in order to sufficiently fund our 
health centers and promote public health for all.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on House consideration 
of H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, which would reauthorize the 
State Children Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP).
  As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I am 
well aware of the work that went into creating this important program.
  I joined with members of the bipartisan Children's Caucus to champion 
the worthy goals of S-CHIP.
  Congress and President Clinton responded to the needs of 10 million 
children in the United States who lacked health insurance, S-CHIP was 
created in 1997 to insure children in families with too much income to 
qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford private insurance.
  I voted for the S-CHIP program when it came to the floor for a vote 
as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
  I worked tirelessly along with other members of the House to make 
sure the S-CHIP program was created.
  I voted to extend the life of the program when Congress reauthorized 
S-CHIP in 2009 under the Children's Health Insurance Program 
Reauthorization Act and again when it became part of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.
  The program represented a grand bargain that allowed Democrats and 
Republicans to agree that healthcare for the nation's children was a 
laudable and achievable goal.
  H.R. 3922, Championing Healthy Kids Act, is not a reauthorization of 
the S-CHIP program it is political theater at its worse.
  The leadership of the House is betraying all that this body has done 
for 20 years to sustain and improve S-CHIP.
  The bill before the House is political theater and not real 
legislating--a partisan attack against Medicare that has no place in a 
real bill about healthcare for children.
  I am a strong supporter of S-CHIP and would vote for that program any 
day it is brought to the House Floor.
  This imposter S-CHIP bill is not worthy to be considered by this 
body.
  The motion to recommit this bill should be supported so that the 
offensive offsets could be removed so that the bill can be brought back 
to the full House for consideration.
  After weeks of negotiations to reauthorize the Children's Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP), Community Health Centers (CHCs) and other 
important public health programs, which have always been bipartisan 
priorities, House Republicans have decided to bring a partisan bill to 
the Floor.
  This bill will only further delay the reauthorization of these 
programs, many of which expired on September 30th.
  The bill passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee at the 
beginning of October with no Democratic support.
  Democrats in Committee instead offered a package that invests in our 
children and safety net providers, and does not sacrifice the nation's 
health.
  Democrats have made it clear for weeks that the pay-fors in this bill 
are problematic.
  Rather than working toward a bipartisan agreement, Republicans 
revised their bill to include even steeper cuts to public health 
programs, in addition to undermining the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
  The bill includes woefully inadequate funding for Medicaid programs 
in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are facing 
unprecedented demands on their health care systems following the 
devastation caused by Hurricane Maria.
  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello last week requested $1.6 
billion annually to deal with the state's underfunded Medicaid program 
that is expected to be further strained by the short- and long-term 
health implications of the natural disaster.
  The approximately $1 billion over two years in Puerto Rico Medicaid 
funding included in the Republican bill is not only insufficient, but 
it would also require Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to match 
those dollars at a time of increased demand and revenue collapse in 
both territories, exacerbating delays in recovery.
  This bill also seeks to cut $6.35 billion to the Prevention and 
Public Health Fund (PPHF).
  The Prevention Fund was created by the ACA to make national 
investments in prevention and public health, to improve health 
outcomes, to enhance health care quality, and reduce health care costs.
  It has been used to increase awareness of and access to preventive 
health services, such as cancer screenings, tobacco cessation and 
childhood vaccines--as well as concentrating on preventing chronic 
disease to help more Americans stay healthy.
  Cutting these funds will have a devastating impact on public health 
initiatives at the federal, state and local levels.
  Republicans are also shortening the grace period for missed premium 
payments from ninety days to thirty, which would result in up to 
688,000 people losing health coverage.
  House Republicans are insisting that in order to provide some of our 
most vulnerable Americans with coverage, it must be paid for by 
cancelling the health insurance of other Americans after a single 
payment is missed.
  While Republicans are pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy that 
explode the deficit, when it comes to health coverage for children and 
low-income Americans, Republicans are insisting that it be paid for at 
the cost of weakening our health care system and pushing other 
Americans off health insurance.
  States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will 
soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if 
CHIP is not reauthorized.
  Republicans' decision to advance a partisan bill rather than a 
compromise has very real consequences for families across the country.
  In 2016, 35,626,329 children in the United States had healthcare 
coverage under S-CHIP or the Medicaid Child Program.
  In 2016, although the state of Texas had 38 percent of our children 
covered under the S-CHIP program, there were still 9.2 percent children 
without health insurance coverage.
  Paying for this package by weakening health care in America:
  Shortening the grace period for missed premium payments will cause up 
to 688,000 Americans to lose their health coverage.
  Cutting $6.35 billion from the Prevention Fund will have a 
devastating impact on public health initiatives at the federal, state 
and local levels.
  Requiring Medicare means testing of 100 percent for beneficiaries 
making over $500,000. This provision will take away a benefit American 
seniors have paid into their entire lives.
  These offsets are even more egregious since they are being considered 
just one week after House Republicans began the process of passing tax 
cuts for the wealthy that is not offset and will add $1.5 trillion to 
the deficit.
  Instead of reauthorizing these programs, House Republicans wasted 
time attempting to repeal the ACA.
  There are better ways to pay for S-CHIP that do not put the guarantee 
of Medicare at risk our nation's seniors.
  1. Reduce tax expenditures for the top 1 percent of income-earners--
Our current tax code imposes higher tax rates on income earned through 
hard work while providing preferential treatment to unearned financial 
gains and allowing billions of dollars of stock profits and other 
capital gains to pass tax-free to heirs of multi-million-dollar 
fortunes. Reducing the benefit of these tax expenditures would help 
rebalance the tax code so that it stops favoring wealth over work. CBO 
has determined that 17 percent of the benefits of major ``tax 
expenditures'' go to households in the top one percent of income 
earners at a cost of more than $1.5 trillion over ten years. We could 
reduce this benefit to pay for needed national priorities.
  2. Cancel the tax break for corporate jets--Repeal tax breaks such as 
those for corporate jets, which are allowed a faster depreciation

[[Page H8466]]

schedule than passenger and freight aircraft. Based on past Joint 
Committee on Taxation estimates, repealing the tax break on corporate 
jets alone would raise $3 billion over ten years.
  3. Restrict deductions for egregious CEO bonuses when employees don't 
get a raise--Repeal the exemption to the $1 million limit on 
compensation for CEOs and other specified corporate employees that a 
publicly traded corporation can deduct as a business expense, unless 
their workers are getting paycheck increases that reflect increases in 
worker productivity and the cost of living. Based on Joint Committee on 
Taxation estimates, just limiting the deductibility of excessive CEO 
compensation would raise $12 billion over ten years.
  4. Close loopholes in the U.S. international corporate tax system 
that encourage companies to invert, and ship jobs and profits 
overseas--Prevent U.S. companies from ``inverting'' and pretending that 
they are based in other countries purely to reduce their taxes. Enact 
proposals that would limit the ability of corporations to reap 
substantial tax benefits by shifting operations, capital, intellectual 
property, and jobs overseas for tax purposes or to shelter their 
profits from U.S. taxation in foreign tax havens. Based on estimates of 
past proposals, over $500 billion over ten years could be raised under 
such proposals.
  5. Close the ``carried interest'' loophole taxing hedge fund 
managers' compensation at lower capital gains rates--End the loophole 
which allows certain investment managers at hedge funds and private 
equity firms to pay capital gains tax rates (up to a maximum of just 20 
percent) on income received as compensation for services they provided, 
rather than ordinary income tax rates up to 39.6 percent that all other 
working Americans pay on the compensation they receive for their labor. 
Past estimates show closing this loophole would raise over $19 billion 
over ten years.
  States have begun to use emergency funding, cut benefits, and will 
soon begin sending disenrollment notices to thousands of families if 
CHIP is not reauthorized.
  It is time for the House Leadership to stop playing politics with 
health insurance coverage for our nation's most vulnerable children and 
pass a clean S-CHIP bill.

     the legal authority to execute an assignment of such rights) 
     under any group health plan or other third-party coverage for 
     health care; and

  Mr. CLYBURN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to dispense with the reading.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from South Carolina?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order against the 
motion to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's point of order is reserved.
  Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from South Carolina is recognized 
for 5 minutes in support of his motion.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have reserved a point of 
order against this motion.
  Let me be clear about what this means. The Republican leadership does 
not want a vote on providing proper CHIP funds to our United States 
territories, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
  There may be a point of order against this provision, but it is the 
same point of order that applies to the Republicans' bill.
  Do you know what that means?
  They waive the point of order for their bill, but they will not waive 
the point of order for this bill.
  I won't take up too much time, Mr. Speaker. I just want the body to 
know that the Republican leadership is, once again, rigging the game in 
favor of the majority.
  This isn't about hurting me and the Democratic Members of this body, 
no. This hurts the people who are already struggling in Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands.

                              {time}  1030

  To my friends on the other side of the aisle, you may hide behind 
procedural tactics, but the fact remains that doing so denies our 
United States citizens living in the territories the proper funding 
that the Governor has requested to recover
  Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not 
kill the bill nor send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will 
immediately proceed to final passage as amended.
  It has been 34 days, Mr. Speaker, since Republicans allowed the 
Children's Health Insurance Program and Community Health Centers to 
expire. These proven programs insure 9 million children and serve 27 
million people.
  The bill before us is the latest in a long line of cynical attempts 
by President Trump and Republican Leaders to sabotage and undermine the 
Affordable Care Act. We ought not be funding efforts to treat 
infectious diseases like the flu and measles by taking away the funds 
needed to prevent those illnesses from occurring in the first place.
  Mr. Speaker, this bill turns on its head that adage, ``an ounce of 
prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' Instead of joining President 
Trump's campaign to sabotage the ACA, the Members of this body, 
Republicans and Democrats, should join to reauthorize CHIP and CHCs for 
5 years, fully paid for without robbing Peter to pay Paul.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of 
order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is 
withdrawn.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion 
to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, today, Members of this House can deliver 
peace of mind to parents of over 8 million low-income children who 
depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program. The House can extend 
funding for important public health programs, including resources for 
the critical work community health centers do in our communities and in 
my district and yours. This bill will help deliver much-needed 
healthcare resources to our friends and fellow citizens in the Virgin 
Islands and in Puerto Rico.
  Yet we have heard complaints about how this package is paid for. 
Well, let us be clear how this bill funds healthcare for kids and 
important public health priorities like community health centers.
  In paying for this package, we have taken a fiscally responsible and 
reasonable approach. Our bill funds kids' healthcare by allowing States 
to dis-enroll lottery winners--these are winners making $80,000 or 
above--from the low-income Medicaid program. We ensure high-dollar 
lottery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so that those 
resources can go to Medicaid-eligible, low-income people in our 
districts.
  Our bill directs funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund 
to finance important prevention and public

[[Page H8473]]

health needs, like funding the National Health Service Corps, Teaching 
Health Center Graduate Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health 
Information Centers, and community health centers. If these are not 
important programs for prevention, wellness, and public health, I don't 
know what are.
  Our bill before us today, which I predict will have bipartisan 
support, directs funds from the Prevention Fund for important public 
health priorities that have long had bipartisan support. We are using a 
bipartisan fund to pay for bipartisan healthcare support for health and 
wellness, which was its intent from the beginning.
  Most recently, nearly every House Republican and Democrat supported 
this idea just a year ago. Just a year ago, when we passed the 21st 
Century Cures Act, we said: Here is a health and wellness fund and a 
Prevention Fund that makes sense for cures, make sense for, we believe 
today, our community health centers, and for Children's Health 
Insurance.
  Our bill also asks the wealthiest among us, the 1 percent of 
beneficiaries, those making $40,000 a month, over half-a-million 
dollars a year--that is an individual--to pay a little more to help 
fund health insurance for low-income children. I think they are willing 
to do that, and I think we should be as well.
  On multiple budgets, President Obama said this is a reasonable way to 
pay for other priorities. That was bipartisan. It is bipartisan today.
  These reasonable pay-fors have been opposed by some in the Democratic 
leadership. Some House Democrats want to use children's healthcare and 
funding for community health centers as a bargaining chip for a bigger 
end-of-the-year goulash, yet kids and our frontline providers can't 
wait any longer.
  In just a few weeks, States like Minnesota run out of funding for the 
Children's Health Insurance Program. At the request of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, we have agreed to postpone it time and 
again, but time has run out. The negotiations did not end as we all 
hoped they would.
  But we can't wait any longer. It is time for this House to deliver 
peace of mind to the families that rely on these critical programs. It 
is time to vote ``yes.''
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to 
recommit and to approve the underlying bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and mentor, the 
gentleman from South Carolina, for his kind words and for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, we deal with important issues every day in this House, 
but there are few issues as meaningful to so many lives as the 
Children's Health Insurance Program.
  At this time the divisions in this House mimic those in our nation.
  And on many issues, those divisions can be challenging to bridge.
  One of my top priorities as a new Member of this body is to help 
bridge those divides, instead of widening them.
  I hope that my colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--will tell 
me if I fall short on that commitment.
  One of the few things that does not divide us is the importance of 
children's healthcare and the CHIP program.
  When it was signed into law 20 years ago, this landmark legislation 
meant so much to me.
  First, as a mother of then 9-year-old, Alyssa, and 11-year-old, Alex 
I deeply understood the fear a parent could feel with a sick child and 
no insurance.
  But also because at that time, I was the Deputy Secretary of Health & 
Social Services for Delaware.
  And I had the honor of helping implement the law and seeing thousands 
of children who had never had healthcare get the coverage they 
deserved.
  From the 600,000 children across the nation who were the program's 
first enrollees in 1998 to the nearly 9,000,000 children in 2016.
  Kids across this country owe their yearly check-ups, their 
immunizations, and their doctor's office lollipops to this program.
  And in Delaware we owe a big debt to the CHIP program, Medicaid, and 
the Affordable Care Act.
  Today, 97 percent of Delaware's children obtain medical coverage 
because of these programs.
  In 1997, the legislation passed in a Republican Congress with a 
Democratic President, highlighting how this truly was not a partisan 
issue.
  That's why it's disappointing to me that we aren't moving forward on 
renewing the Children's Health Insurance Program with that same 
reasonable, bipartisan approach.
  The bill before us today forces us to choose between healthcare for 
children and healthcare for other vulnerable populations.
  Choosing between prevention and healthcare for kids is unacceptable--
particularly in a nation as great as ours.
  I have spoken to many of you over the past 10 months.
  I know that the people I have met in both political parties know--in 
their hearts--that we should not play games with the healthcare of our 
children.
  I know that it may seem hard to oppose one's party leadership. But 
today I ask you to consider whether this is one of those rare times . . 
. those rare subjects . . .
  Where we can come together to stand up for the those in need . . .
  And to stand up for a clean reauthorization of the Children's Health 
Insurance Program.
  That's what our motion to recommit does.
  Let's step back and consider whether we can use our common desire to 
deliver healthcare to our children, as a moment to surprise the public 
. . .
  To set a new tone for how we deal with one another . . . and how we 
address issues on which both of our parties fundamentally agree.
  Please join with me on this vote to put our children first--they're 
watching.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is 
ordered on the motion to recommit.
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule 
XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 
5-minute votes on the question of passage of H.R. 3922, if ordered, and 
approval of the Journal, if ordered.
