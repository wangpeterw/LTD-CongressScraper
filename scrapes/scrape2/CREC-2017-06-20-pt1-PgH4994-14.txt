            By Mr. GRAVES of Missouri:
        H.R. 2957.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
        Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 (General Welfare) and 
     Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 (Commerce) of the 
     Constitution.
        The bill makes several changes to the way hospitals are 
     regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
     (CMS). This includes transaction between hospitals, CMS, and 
     third parties, which constitutes commerce. Further, Medicare 
     is considered to be constitutional as part of providing for 
     the general welfare and therefore any changes to Medicare 
     would fall under this provision as well.
