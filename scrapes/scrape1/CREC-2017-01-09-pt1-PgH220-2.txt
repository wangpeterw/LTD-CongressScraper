                  COMMENDING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day to commend the law enforcement officers 
throughout our Nation who answer the call to serve their communities. 
Law enforcement officers face increasingly difficult circumstances 
while working to serve and protect the public. It is a dangerous job, 
and often it is a thankless job.
  Just last week, Pennsylvania mourned the loss of a 23-year-old 
Pennsylvania State Police trooper who was shot and killed while 
investigating a domestic incident.
  Our officers put on their uniforms each day knowing that they can be 
in harm's way at any moment. They answer the calls in times of 
distress, they follow the rules, and they wear the badge proudly.
  We must remember that our officers are mothers and fathers, sons and 
daughters, and husbands and wives. They are human, and they arguably 
have one of the most difficult jobs in America. So today, and each day, 
let's honor our brothers and sisters in blue. Let's thank them for the 
important work they do to keep us all safe.
