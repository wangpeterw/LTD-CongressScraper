                        BUILD BRIDGES, NOT WALLS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speaker, 2017 was a year marked with 
division and distraction, a disservice to Americans seeking solutions 
to real challenges facing our Nation.
  My hope is that the new year provides an opportunity to move away 
from divisive discourse and toward constructive dialogue and real 
outcomes. This year, we can take real steps to strengthen Medicare and 
Social Security, as well as ensuring access to quality and affordable 
healthcare for all Americans.
  This year, we can promote job growth and success for all Americans by 
making smart, targeted investments in education and scientific 
research, as well as preparing our workforce for the 21st century.
  This year, we can commit ourselves to building a foundation for a 
stronger America by making investments in our Nation's roads, 
waterways, infrastructure, and communities.
  Madam Speaker, as we consider the State of the Union, this Congress 
has two choices: build walls or build bridges. Bridges lead to better 
healthcare, to better jobs, to a better economy to make America great 
again, and again, and again.
