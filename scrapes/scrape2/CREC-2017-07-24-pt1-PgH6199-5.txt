RECOGNIZING THE 27TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT

  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of the 27th 
anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was signed 
into law on July 26, 1990.
  This landmark, bipartisan civil rights legislation enables people 
with disabilities, including me, to experience more inclusive and 
fulfilling lives.
  The prohibition of discrimination on the basis of a disability has 
helped to promote equal opportunity, full participation, independent 
living, and economic self-sufficiency.
  Mr. Speaker, it is true that we have made incredible progress since 
1990, but we still have work ahead. Too many people with disabilities 
still lack access to affordable housing, public transportation, 
education, healthcare, and employment. Full access and inclusion 
remains a fundamental aspiration, but it is not yet a reality.
  Mr. Speaker, we must remain vigilant in defending the intent of the 
ADA so that future generations can live in an inclusive, accessible 
world, where the unique talents and abilities of individuals with 
disabilities are innately recognized.
