URGING THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION TO ENFORCE THE FLIGHT SAFETY 
                                  LAW

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speaker, each year we are reminded of 
the day that Continental Flight 3407 crashed in western New York. This 
tragedy forever changed our community and stole the lives of husbands, 
wives, sons, daughters, sisters, and brothers.
  In their grief, the families of Flight 3407 bravely turned their loss 
into a powerful force for change. With their leadership, Congress 
enacted strong and landmark aviation safety reform legislation. That 
reform exactly aligned with what the National Transportation Safety 
Board concluded: that the crash was avoidable, and that pilot error and 
failed training procedures were the causes.
  We have new leadership at the Federal Aviation Administration, and I 
strongly urge him to swiftly enforce the flight safety law. We, the 
members of the western New York delegation and the families of Flight 
3407, will be watching closely.
