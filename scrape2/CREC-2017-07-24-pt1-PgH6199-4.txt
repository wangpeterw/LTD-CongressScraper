            HAPPY 40TH ANNIVERSARY TO LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Log Cabin 
Republicans as it celebrates 40 years of advocating and advancing 
equality and justice for LGBT Americans. Formed by a small group of 
LGBT conservatives in California, Log Cabin Republicans emerged to 
defeat what is known as the Briggs Initiative, a measure prohibiting 
gay teachers from teaching in public schools.
  This measure was rejected, thanks to the tireless work of this 
organization and President Reagan with his forceful opposition to the 
discriminatory policy.
  Since then, Log Cabin Republicans have expanded their presence and 
created over 50 chapters across our great Nation, including in my 
hometown of Miami. Together we have won many great victories and have 
taken a historic stride toward equality with the repeal of Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell, and the legalization of marriage equality.
  Mr. Speaker, as a proud ally of the LGBT community, I commend Log 
Cabin Republicans for advancing our principles of limited government, 
individual freedoms, and personal responsibility to create a more 
inclusive party that ensures fairness and equality for all Americans.
  Happy 40th to LCR.
