of 97.
  J. Robert Miller was a legend in agriculture, agriculture education, 
and Kentucky politics. He served as Kentucky's Commissioner of 
Agriculture from 1957 to 1971 during the Louie Nunn administration. 
Before that, J. Robert was an agriculture teacher at Tompkinsville High 
School and always an active, lifelong farmer.
  Growing up in 4-H and FFA, my earliest memories include Robert 
Miller. He was a mainstay at Monroe County area livestock shows and FFA 
banquets, always helping out and offering advice to present and future 
farmers.
  J. Robert Miller was a great man who had a positive influence on 
countless Kentuckians
