               ENDING DACA IS CONTRARY TO AMERICAN VALUES

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, by ending DACA, President Trump 
made our immigration system less fair and just for our young people.
  These DREAMers study in our schools and work on our Main Streets. 
They are Americans, and the United States is their home. It makes no 
sense to deport them simply because of the actions of their parents. 
This decision is so contrary to our American values that even business 
leaders and faith leaders called on the President not to do it.
  My grandmother came to this country from Jamaica as a domestic worker 
and, for a period of time, was undocumented. She did this so that my 
father could become the first member of our family to go to college. He 
repaid his mother and this country by becoming a doctor and working in 
some of the poorest neighborhoods near where I grew up. My father 
pursued the American Dream and, in turn, contributed to the greatness 
that is America.
  Kicking these DREAMers out won't create jobs or make our 
neighborhoods safer. That is why we must pass the Dream Act. It is the 
right thing to do for our economic competitiveness, military readiness, 
and public safety.
  We have legitimate disagreements on how to fix our immigration 
system, but let's not hold our DREAMers hostage. It is time for 
Congress to pass the Dream Act now.
