               NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Law 
Enforcement Appreciation Day.
  Law enforcement officers courageously put their lives on the line to 
protect our homes, our businesses, and our schools. They are truly the 
unsung heroes of our communities. We are grateful to the men and women 
in blue who service the front line of defense here at home.
  Today and every day, we must stand with our members of law 
enforcement and their families to honor the sacrifices and the 
contributions they make to ensure that our families remain safe.
  I also especially thank the United States Capitol Police force, who 
work each day to ensure that Members, staff, and visitors to the 
Nation's Capital are safe and secure.
  Let us not forget to honor the service and sacrifice of all who serve 
in law enforcement, especially in New York State: our New York State 
Police, the New York State Park Police, county, city, and village 
police forces, and, of course, corrections officers throughout the 
great State of New York.
