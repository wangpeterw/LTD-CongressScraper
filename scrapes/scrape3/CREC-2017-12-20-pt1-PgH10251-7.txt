                CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF DORIS JACKSON

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of 
Doris Jackson, who will be retiring after more than 33 years of service 
to the U.S. House of Representatives. Doris began working as a cashier 
in the Cannon Cafe in 1980 and eventually became a supervisor.
  After more than three decades, there have been many changes as 
Members and staff have come and gone, but Doris' smile has remained 
ever present. I know that I speak for every Member, staffer, and intern 
who has had the privilege of knowing Doris when I say that we will miss 
her witty sense of humor and her willingness to give encouragement to 
everyone she meets.
  In retirement, Doris plans to spend more time with family, especially 
her grandchildren, and to stay active in her community by volunteering 
at her church.
  Mr. Speaker, Doris has dedicated her life to serving us as we strive 
to serve our constituents. On behalf of our congressional family, I 
wish Doris the best of luck in the next exciting chapter in her life.
  Congratulations, Doris.
