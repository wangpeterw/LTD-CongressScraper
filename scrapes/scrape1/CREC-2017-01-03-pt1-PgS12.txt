                     CONGRATULATING SENATOR SCHUMER

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I close by saluting my colleague, the new 
Democratic leader, Senator Schumer. He and I were roommates for a long, 
long time before we got our separate apartments--grew up and got our 
own places. I have come to know him, his family, and his political 
career. I am looking forward to working with his leadership team in the 
U.S. Senate. I think his statement today speaks for all the Members of 
the Senate Democratic caucus.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.
  (The remarks of Mr. Moran pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 5 
are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
