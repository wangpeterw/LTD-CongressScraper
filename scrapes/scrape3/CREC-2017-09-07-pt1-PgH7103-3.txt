               BRINGING ATTENTION TO MONTANA'S WILDFIRES

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the 
wildfires devastating Montana. My heart goes out to those affected by 
Hurricane Harvey. The disaster has shown the very best of our country, 
neighbor helping neighbor.
  That spirit is alive and well in Montana, too, as we face a massive 
disaster. Drought conditions are severe. Over 40 wildfires continue to 
rage, and more than 900,000 acres have burned so far.
  As we speak, ash rains down on our homes and our schools, poor air 
quality threatens the health of Montanans, particularly our children 
and our elderly, and our livelihoods are at risk.
  This photo was taken just a few weeks ago from the south summit of 
Mount Sentinel as fires raged towards the town of Lolo, Montana.
  Sadly, this image is not unique. I met with leaders and firefighters 
at five wildfires this summer and witnessed the destruction firsthand.
  Mr. Speaker, I hope this image and others from back home will make my 
colleagues more aware of the fires, the devastation they have caused, 
and the need for relief in the Treasure State.
