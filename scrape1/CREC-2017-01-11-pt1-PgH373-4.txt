            HONORING THE LIFE OF PAULSTEWART ``STU'' SHANER

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to honor the life 
of a friend, Paul Stewart Shaner, known as ``Stu''around Oroville. He 
passed away just recently, December 13, at the age of 76.
  A resident of Oroville, California, since age 5, Stu was a prominent 
member of the community known for his civic engagementand a true 
passion for his small town, the one I grew up in as well.
  While poor eyesight prevented Stu from joining the military, he went 
out of his way to serve in many other ways, servingveterans, serving 
his community, and making veterans feel treasured. He served his 
community in so many different ways, it isnot hard to think of Stu as 
the main fiber of our town of Oroville.
  One of Stu's life goals was to erect a memorial park for veterans in 
Oroville. He worked very hard to accomplish this,serving as co-chair 
for the Veterans Memorial Park for over a decade.
  When you heard from Stu, you heard from him. He was going to get this 
done, and we were all determined to be helpful forhim. He was 
relentless. The new park is under construction this very moment.
  In the words of everyone who knew Stu, he was one of the good guys 
who loved his family, his town, and the veterans whoserved his country.
  God bless Stu Shaner's family. We will miss him.
