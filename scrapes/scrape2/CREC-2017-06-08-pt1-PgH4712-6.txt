                  HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND DODD-FRANK

  (Mr. TROTT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. TROTT. Mr. Speaker, during my first term in Congress, I had the 
opportunity to join Habitat for Humanity on one of their builds back in 
Oakland County, Michigan. It was a lot of fun and time well spent.
  Earlier this year, I met with Habitat and heard about their struggle 
to provide affordable homes under the regulations imposed by Dodd-
Frank. Habitat for Humanity relies on the generosity of so many: not 
just volunteers who build the home or donate to their cause, but those 
who provide professional services free of charge.
  Of course a home needs to be appraised before a loan is approved, and 
many times professional appraisers volunteer their services. Under 
Dodd-Frank, however, that is not allowed. Dodd-Frank mandates that 
appraisers receive customary and reasonable compensation for their 
services. This means Habitat can no longer accept donated services. In 
fact, Habitat told me that the complex Dodd-Frank rules have tripled 
the cost of loans.
  That is why I introduced the HOME Act; and I urge my colleagues to 
support the act, as it is part of the CHOICE Act we are considering 
later today. Let's make sure Habitat can continue its important 
mission.
