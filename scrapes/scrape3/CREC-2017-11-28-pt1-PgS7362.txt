                                 ______
                                 

SENATE RESOLUTION 343--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND 
            REPRESENTATION IN ARIZONA V. MARK LOUIS PRICHARD

  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 343

       Whereas, in the case of Arizona v. Mark Louis Prichard, Cr. 
     No. 17-711443, pending in the Justice Court of Pima County, 
     Arizona, the prosecution has requested the production of 
     testimony from Julie Katsel, an employee in the Tucson, 
     Arizona office of Senator Jeff Flake;
       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the 
     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) 
     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to 
     represent current or former employees of the Senate with 
     respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
     relating to their official responsibilities;
       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United 
     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no 
     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate 
     may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from 
     such control or possession but by permission of the Senate; 
     and
       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or 
     in the possession of the Senate may promote the 
     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action 
     as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That Julie Katsel, an employee in the Office of 
     Senator Jeff Flake, and any other current or former employee 
     of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may be 
     necessary, are authorized to testify and produce documents in 
     the case of Arizona v. Mark Louis Prichard, except concerning 
     matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
       Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to 
     represent current and former Members, officers, and employees 
     of the Senate in connection with the production of evidence 
     authorized in section one of this resolution.
