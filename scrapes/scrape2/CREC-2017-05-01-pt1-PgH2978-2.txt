                    HONORING BRAZOSWOOD HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the Brazoswood 
High School band was awarded one of the highest honors: the Sudler Flag 
of Honor by the John Philip Sousa Foundation.
  The Sudler Flag of Honor is given to distinguished high school bands 
that have demonstrated particularly high standards of excellence in 
concert activities over a period of several years. There is a 7-year 
minimum process, with countless documents, recordings, letters of 
recommendation, and performances at not only the State but the local 
level as well.
  Of the nearly 50 Sudler Flags that have been awarded since 1983, 
almost 30 of them have gone to Texas high school bands. The Brazoswood 
Buccaneer Band is the most recent addition to this prestigious group, 
and they are the only band to have been awarded the Sudler Flag in 
2017.
  My sincere congratulations to the students; the alumni; the band; Mr. 
Brian Casey, the band director; and the principal, Rita Pintavalle, on 
this outstanding achievement.
