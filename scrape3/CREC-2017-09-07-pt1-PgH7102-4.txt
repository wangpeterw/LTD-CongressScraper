                      DACA AND PROTECTING DREAMERS

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, when DACA was 
launched in 2012, it allowed nearly 800,000 young people to come out of 
the shadows and live without the constant fear of being deported. Some 
came here as infants in their parents' arms. Some know no other 
language but English, and they know no other country but America. And 
all of them simply seek a better future.
  DACA helped breathe life into their American Dream. DREAMers are our 
neighbors, our friends, and our colleagues. They grew up here. They 
have done absolutely nothing wrong. They are in school, they are 
working, and they are contributing to the American economy.
  And now, they must fear deportation once again. That is not the 
American Dream; that is not who we are.
  I hope that all of my colleagues will take that to heart so that we 
can finally pass the Dream Act and keep these Americans out of the 
shadows, contributing to our economy, growing their lives, and helping 
live and be the American Dream.
