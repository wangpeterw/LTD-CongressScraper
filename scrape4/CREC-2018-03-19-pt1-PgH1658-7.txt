      CELEBRATING MS. BETTYE JEAN WILSON FRANKLIN'S 90TH BIRTHDAY

  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Ms. Bettye 
Jean Wilson Franklin's 90th birthday.
  Ms. Franklin was born March 18, 1928. She is a native of Fort Worth. 
Ms. Franklin attended and graduated from the historical I.M. Terrell 
High School. Her passion for education inspired her to work for the 
Fort Worth Independent School District for 27 years until she retired 
in 1990.
  But it is her everlasting commitment to her faith that is well-known 
among her friends and family. Ms. Franklin has been a faithful member 
of the Saint James Baptist Church for the last 77 years, where she 
contributed in various capacities, including her participation in the 
senior choir for 52 years.
  In addition, she serves her community as a member of the Greater Fort 
Worth Area Negro Business and Professional Women's Club, and the Fort 
Worth Zeta Amicae Auxiliary of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority.
  Ms. Franklin is also a member of the Eastern Star Southern Beauty 
Chapter 446, and served as Grand Secretary of the Masonic Grand Chapter 
Order of Eastern Star of Texas for 13 years.
  She is the proud mother of two daughters, a grandmother of four 
grandchildren, and the great-grandmother to her seven great-
grandchildren.
  Happy 90th birthday, Ms. Franklin. I wish you continued health and 
happiness on this milestone occasion.
