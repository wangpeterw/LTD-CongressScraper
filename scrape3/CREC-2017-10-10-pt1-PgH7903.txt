CELEBRATING THE MIAMI LIGHTHOUSE FOR THE BLIND LEARNING CENTER AND PRE-
                               K PROGRAM

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Miami 
Lighthouse for the Blind on its new Lighthouse Learning Center and Pre-
K program.
  The Miami Lighthouse has served south Florida since 1931, offering 
life-changing programs and resources for those who have visual 
impairments. President Virginia Jacko and her staff are making history 
once again with the Lighthouse Learning Center.
  The Miami Lighthouse is partnering with Miami-Dade County Public 
Schools to provide a comprehensive learning program for pre-K students 
using an evidence-based curriculum to support and empower visually 
impaired students to achieve their potential. Children in this program 
will receive the training they need to perform at the same level as 
their sighted peers by the time they enroll in school.
  Mr. Speaker, it fills me with great pride to recognize Virginia Jacko 
and the entire staff at the Miami Lighthouse for the Blind for their 
tireless work in launching this wonderful learning center in the heart 
of Little Havana, located in my congressional district.
