        REPUBLICAN TAX GIVEAWAY INCREASES DEBT BY $2.1 TRILLION

  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Congressional Budget 
Office revealed that the Republican tax giveaway to corporations and 
the wealthiest Americans will increase our debt by $2.1 trillion.
  Over the next 10 years, our debt will equal 105 percent of our gross 
domestic product, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal 
Budget.
  And the Republicans' idea to close this gigantic increase in the 
deficit is to make massive cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and 
Medicaid. They want seniors to sacrifice their retirement security and 
their dignity in order to pay for a Republican tax giveaway.
  President Trump's budget for fiscal year 2019 cuts $500 billion from 
Medicare, $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social 
Security disability insurance, and that still isn't enough to balance 
the budget. So they will, of course, continue to propose cuts to 
education, veterans, working people, and other critical resources for 
families across America.
  This is shameless. The American people are going to see right through 
this. A gigantic tax cut for the richest people in this country, the 
most powerful corporations, and now the Republicans are trying to make 
seniors pay for it by cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. 
Shame on them.
