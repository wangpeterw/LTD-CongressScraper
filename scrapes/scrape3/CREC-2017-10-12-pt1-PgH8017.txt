                         GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, we are now a few days after the most 
violent and largest massacre in modern American history in Las Vegas, 
Nevada.
  Many that you encounter has a story, amazingly, about who was there 
during that week. They obviously were not at that site, but they may 
have been in Las Vegas for work or otherwise. It will be on the minds 
of Americans for a long time.
  Just this past Monday, I stood with Sheriff Acevedo, my chief of 
police, my sheriff, my constable; mothers who have lost loved ones and 
children; and a woman who had been abused and her significant other 
carried around a heavy weapon to scare her, threaten her, and abuse 
her.
  Why we can't have gun safety regulation, I don't know, but I believe 
after Sandy Hook and after Pulse nightclub, we must pass real gun 
safety legislation. We must ban assault weapons, ban the bump stocks. 
We must have universal background checks.
  Madam Speaker, it is a shame that we cannot save lives. We need gun 
safety now, not money in your pockets.
