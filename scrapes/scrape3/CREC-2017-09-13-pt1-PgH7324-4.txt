                    PEDIATRIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, since I spoke on this 
floor last September in honor of Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, more 
than 10,000 children have been diagnosed with cancer and approximately 
1,200 have died due to this deadly disease.
  Pediatric cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related deaths 
for children in the United States. In our country alone, nearly 1 out 
of every 285 children will be diagnosed with cancer. For those who 
survive the disease, the vast majority experience health complications 
related to the cancer diagnosis for the rest of their lives.
  Despite these startling statistics, progress has been made. The 21st 
Century Cures Act and the RACE for Children Act have been signed into 
law. These bills incentivize innovation and will help us move closer to 
cures.
  Even with these advances, the fact remains that only 4 percent of the 
National Cancer Institute's budget supports childhood cancer research. 
Before he lost his battle with cancer, 7-year-old Jonny Wade from 
Jerseyville told me that 4 percent is not enough. I agree with my 
friend Jonny; 4 percent is not enough.
  We must continue to fund research and support innovation to ensure a 
future where no child--no child--ever has cancer.
