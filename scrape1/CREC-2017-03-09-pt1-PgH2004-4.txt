               RIGHT TO TRY POTENTIALLY LIFESAVING DRUGS

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, many Americans, including my constituents, 
fight a terminal illness. Many of them cannot access potentially 
lifesaving drugs because of the lengthy and bureaucratic Food and Drug 
Administration's approval process.
  Last month Congressman Fitzpatrick and I introduced the Right to Try 
Act, which is a bill that would provide the option for terminally ill 
patients to receive drugs that have passed the FDA's basic safety 
testing but are still working their way through the lengthy government 
process to receive final approval.
  In 2014, my home State of Arizona passed a similar right-to-try law 
with nearly 80 percent of the vote, thanks to the heroic efforts of my 
friend, the late Laura Knaperek. She successfully fought to pass right-
to-try at the State level even as she was battling a cancer that would 
ultimately claim her life. I sponsored this bill in memory of Laura and 
many others who have championed this legislation around the country.
  Right-to-try has passed in 33 States, and it needs to be enacted at 
the Federal level. Our bill gives Americans that right to try. I am 
grateful for Congressman Fitzpatrick's partnership on this vital issue. 
I call upon my colleagues to pass this legislation in the House.
