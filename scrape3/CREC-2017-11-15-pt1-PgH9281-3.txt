       ``(1) Individuals, businesses, and other organizations have 
     varying degrees of legal protection when providing 
     information to the agencies for strictly statistical 
     purposes.
       ``(2) Pledges of confidentiality by agencies provide 
     assurances to the public that information about individuals 
     or organizations or provided by individuals or organizations 
     for exclusively statistical purposes will be held in 
     confidence and will not be used against such individuals or 
     organizations in any agency action.
       ``(3) Protecting the confidentiality interests of 
     individuals or organizations who provide information under a 
     pledge of confidentiality for Federal statistical programs 
     serves both the interests of the public and the needs of 
     society.
       ``(4) Declining trust of the public in the protection of 
     information provided under a pledge of confidentiality to the 
     agencies adversely affects both the accuracy and completeness 
     of statistical analyses.
       ``(5) Ensuring that information provided under a pledge of

     information disclosed in identifiable form to anyone not 
     authorized by this subchapter nor have that information used

     access to, and uses made of, such information.
       ``(b) Use of Statistical Data or Information.--Data or 
     information acquired by an agency under a pledge of

                    ``PART C--STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY

     ``Sec. 3575. Findings

       ``The Congress finds the following:
       ``(1) Federal statistics are an important source of 
     information for public and private decision-makers such as 
     policymakers, consumers, businesses, investors, and workers.
       ``(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek 
     to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the 
     ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve 
     higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.
       ``(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the 
     willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. 
     Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and 
     therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the 
     economy.
       ``(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of 
     the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau 
     of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will 
     improve their ability to track more accurately the large and 
     rapidly changing nature of United States business. In 
     particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better 
     ensure that businesses are consistently classified in 
     appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce 
     statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the 
     entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and 
     correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.
       ``(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and 
     Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94-472), which 
     allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic 
     Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on 
     foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed 
     industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries 
     with no increase in the data collected from respondents but 
     also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation 
     of valuable data products.
       ``(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of 
     business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of 
     Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
     continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for 
     respondents to statistical surveys.

Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson 
Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.


                             General Leave

  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include 
in the Record extraneous material on the bill under consideration.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Texas?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the sponsor of the 
bill and my friend, the Speaker of the House.
  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the 
gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Foundations for 
Evidence-Based Policymaking Act.
  First, I want to thank the sponsors of the bill. I want to thank Mr. 
Farenthold. I want to thank Mr. Kilmer. I want to thank Chairman Gowdy.
  Blake Farenthold and Derek Kilmer were the key drivers of this 
measure, and they made it stronger by incorporating their OPEN 
Government Data Act.
  Trey Gowdy and his staff--I don't know where he is. He is probably 
working on his hair. Trey Gowdy and his staff--especially Katy Rother--
spent countless hours working with our team--especially Ted McCann--and 
others to turn the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking's vision 
into legislation. All the members of this Commission did incredible 
work.
  I want to especially thank Senator Patty Murray for her willingness 
to

[[Page H9289]]

work together on this issue. We may be on different sides of the aisle, 
but there is one thing that we passionately agree on, and that is what 
the government does, it should do it well. The taxpayer's money should 
always be protected, and that is exactly why we came together to write 
this bipartisan legislation.
  So what does this bill actually do? It protects privacy. It improves 
transparency. It ensures that Federal agencies are protecting the data 
collected by the government.
  The American people deserve to know and they deserve to understand 
exactly what data the government is actually collecting. They deserve 
to know that the strictest safeguards are placed on that data.
  The driving purpose of this legislation is very simple: we are 
requiring Federal agencies to prioritize evidence when they are 
measuring a program's success.
  Go figure.
  Here is what we are talking about. Let's just take poverty, for 
example. Instead of measuring success based on inputs, instead of 
measuring success based on how many programs we have created, how much 
money we are spending, how many people are on those programs, let's 
measure success based on results: Is it working? Are people getting out 
of poverty? Are the goals and objectives of these bills and these laws 
actually being achieved or not?
  By directing agencies to do this, no longer will ``we don't know'' be 
an acceptable answer when asked if a program is actually working.
  It is really just kind of crazy, but so much of what government does, 
government doesn't actually see whether or not it is actually 
succeeding at doing it. So we have got to get off of this input effort-
based system, this 20th century relic, and on to clearly identifiable, 
evidence-based terms, conditions, data, results, outcomes.
  With this bill, we are asking the Federal bureaucracy to step up its 
game. We are asking ourselves: How can we improve the lives of our 
fellow citizens by better understanding the programs that we put in 
place? How can we make sure that the money that is being spent on 
behalf of the hardworking taxpayers, who send the money here in the 
first place, is being spent wisely, efficiently, effectively?
  We need results, not just effort. This is just good, commonsense 
policy, and it is going to mean a real sea change in how we solve 
problems and how government actually works.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I thank the sponsors 
for all of their hard work.

                              {time}  1445

  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as 
amended, would establish a framework to support greater access and use 
of government data.
  I want to thank Representatives Derek Kilmer and Blake Farenthold for 
their work on the OPEN Government Data Act, which is the basis for 
title II of this bill. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan, Senator 
Murray, and Chairman Gowdy for their bipartisan work on this issue.
  This bill would require that agencies make data ``open by default'' 
and develop a plan for building evidence in their agencies.
  The bill would require that the Office of Management and Budget 
develop a Federal catalog and inventory of agency data assets and that 
each agency designate chief evaluation officers and chief data officers 
who would work to ensure that agencies utilize data effectively.
  The goal of this bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive 
branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence. 
This is not always the case. For example, take the Teen Pregnancy 
Prevention Program. Funding for that program was recently cut even 
though there is significant evidence that it works well.
  If we are going to demand more and higher quality evidence from these 
Federal agencies, it is imperative that Congress and the executive 
branch advance policies supported by that evidence.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I am here today to support H.R. 4174, introduced by 
Speaker Ryan and of which I am an original cosponsor.
  The American people deserve an efficient and effective Federal 
Government. I think we can all agree on that. Taxpayers have the right 
to know their money is being spent wisely. All too often, 
decisionmakers throughout the Federal Government make choices without 
sufficient evidence and data to inform them and guide them in making 
those decisions.
  In the previous Congress, Speaker Ryan and Senator Patty Murray 
introduced the bicameral and bipartisan Evidence-Based Policymaking 
Commission Act of 2016. The Commission was charged with studying and 
making recommendations related to access and use of evidence to support 
effective policymaking. Believe it or not, they finished in about a 
year.
  The Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking released their report 
September 7 of this year. The Commission made 22 recommendations on how 
to improve how evidence is accessed, produced, secured, and maintained 
by the Federal Government.
  On September 26, 2017, the House Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform held a hearing entitled ``Recommendations of the 
Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking.'' At that hearing, four 
members of the Commission explained the intent of the recommendations 
and the need for more evidence to improve policymaking.
  According to Dr. Ron Haskins, the co-chair of the Commission, 
evidence showed that many of the Nation's social programs produced 
modest to no impacts.
  H.R. 4174, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 
2017, addresses several recommendations from the final report issued by 
the Commission.
  The bill lays the groundwork for critical examination of what is 
working and what is not working in the Federal Government. Policy 
decisions should be based on facts. Those folks of my generation will 
remember Sergeant Joe Friday in ``Dragnet:'' ``Just the facts, ma'am.''
  That is what we are trying to get ahold of here.
  According to the Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking, too 
little evidence is produced in the Federal Government to meet this 
need. The Commission also found cumbersome and idiosyncratic data 
access procedures create confusion, impose unnecessary costs, and are a 
barrier to evidence building.
  Additionally, according to the Government Accountability Office, 
agencies' continued lack of evaluations may be the greatest barrier to 
their informing managers and policymakers and constitutes a lost 
opportunity to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of limited 
government resources.
  These barriers are standing between the taxpayers and the effective 
government that they had paid for and that they deserve.
  H.R. 4174 removes some of the barriers the Commission identified and 
encourages agencies to expand the use of evidence in decisionmaking.
  First, each agency will need to designate a chief evaluation officer 
and submit annual evidence-building plans to Congress and the Office of 
Management and Budget. This bill also establishes an advisory committee 
to review, analyze, and make recommendations on how to expand access to 
and use of data for evidence building.
  It also includes the OPEN Government Data Act that Representative 
Kilmer and I introduced. The OPEN Government Data Act addresses the 
Commission's recommendation to expand access to information about data. 
The OPEN Government Data Act requires Federal agencies to develop a 
comprehensive inventory of Federal data and increases access to 
specific data assets that are appropriate for public release. This 
isn't personally identifiable, confidential, private, or classified 
information.
  It also establishes an open-by-default standard for Federal data, 
meaning data will be available under an open format and open license, 
and it will be

[[Page H9290]]

in a machine-readable format. We are going to crowdsource some of this 
evidence building. We are going to let the private sector or nonprofits 
or whomever access this data, find ways to use it, build data, and, 
again, get more bang for the taxpayer's dollar.
  The bill further improves data management and collection by codifying 
the position of chief data officer and clarifying the CDO roles and 
responsibilities.
  Finally, H.R. 4174 establishes a process by which statistical 
agencies can access data, ensure effective and consistent privacy 
protections, and develop methods to reduce the sensitivity of data. 
This will expand opportunities for use of the data by the evidence-
building community.
  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017 was 
reported favorably out of the House Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform.
  I come back to the bottom line on this: Americans expect policymakers 
to make decisions based on facts. And decisions based on facts are 
better decisions that will save taxpayer money and be good for America. 
H.R. 4174 will help make these expectations a reality.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time.
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).
  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
  Imagine you are a coder and you have a great idea for an app that 
predicts the weather or identifies traffic flows or helps people 
navigate the social service system. You know how to code the app, but 
you can't afford to set up your own system to collect the data--the 
weather data or the traffic data or what have you.
  Now, imagine you build the app and you can pull data that the 
government is already collecting so you can build the app and use the 
data. It turns out that you have got something that is either good at 
predicting the weather or helping commuters or helping folks navigate 
the social services system or whatever and it grows into a business. 
You can actually employ people. You can put people to work. A project 
that may have started as a hobby could become your life's work.
  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, and specifically 
title II of this bill called the OPEN Government Data Act, will 
actually help make stories like that become a common thing. This bill 
gives entrepreneurs and innovators huge amounts of publicly funded data 
so that they can innovate and come up with applications that we haven't 
even thought of yet.
  It also means that government agencies can share data more easily and 
ultimately provide services more effectively. Most importantly, it 
allows citizens to participate in their government by making government 
more transparent and accountable.
  Mr. Speaker, data is the spark that drives innovative ideas, and I 
drafted the OPEN Government Data Act with Representatives Farenthold 
and Senators Schatz and Sasse to support new startups by providing 
innovators with the legal elbow room to use public information and 
public data and to create jobs. It reduces the burden to entry by 
lowering the cost to access and format data. It will open new business 
opportunities.
  Making more government data public will pump up the data analytics 
boom currently driving new innovation, and I expect that access to this 
data will lead to things that we haven't even thought up yet.
  I am proud to work with Speaker Ryan, Chairman Gowdy, and Senator 
Murray to incorporate that bill into this broader legislation. It will 
help us measure how government programs are actually working or not.
  Establishing a data inventory will help government officials 
understand what data they have so that they can use it, and they don't 
duplicate work that is already getting done.
  Making the government's data searchable and accessible will help 
public servants make better decisions, and it will help the public and 
the press hold government more accountable.
  Let me give you an example. Mr. Speaker, I represent more military 
veterans than just about any Member of this body. Like many of us, I 
was horrified to learn several years ago that the Department of 
Veterans Affairs was struggling to provide the services and treatments 
that were earned by military veterans. Now imagine if the House 
Veterans' Affairs Committee or the Government Accountability Office or 
even the VA had access to some of the data around wait times earlier. 
The pain caused to veterans and their families could have been avoided.
  Imagine if the leaders of the Veterans Administration knew that 
newspapers were going to have access to that data, whether it be the 
Kitsap Sun in my district or The New York Times or whoever. Imagine 
that they were looking at that data, too.
  It is time for government to move into the 21st century and start 
using the data it is collecting to improve the services it is 
providing.
  Let me just speak briefly about what this bill does. This gets a 
little wonky, but I actually think it is pretty important. This 
legislation sets up a way for everyone to use the government's data. We 
spent a long time working to make sure that the terms used in the bill 
didn't trap government policy in this year or this decade. We hope that 
this legislation will act as a building block for future technologies 
and applications of Federal data.
  We included some important pieces to ensure that data is not only 
available, but that it is easily used. Data has to be machine-readable. 
Many of us, I think, have gone on the internet and gotten a data set in 
PDF form that you can't really do anything with. It is so annoying. It 
is pretty obvious that in 2017 you should be able to use your computer 
to find what you are looking for.
  Data has to be open format, and data should be malleable. 
Professionals inside and outside of government should be able to use 
that data in various ways. Government data should be provided under an 
open license. If the government owns the data, that means the people 
paid for it, and they should be able to use it for free.
  Let me quickly talk about what this bill doesn't do.
  The bill does not take away safeguards that protect personal privacy, 
national security, and intellectual property. The legislation would not 
affect existing contracts, so the government is not going to go to 
a contractor and say: Oh, by the way, your data is now free and 
available to the public.

  Importantly, the bill does not alter the government's need to pay for 
private data rights in the future when it identifies private data that 
it may want to access and have ownership of. This bill only applies to 
data that is owned and controlled by the Federal Government. It does 
not provide an advantage to one sector or technology over another.
  Mr. Speaker, let me just say in closing, for the past 2 years, 
several of us have worked on this issue and with experts throughout the 
private and public sector to get this bill past the finish line. I am 
proud to stand here today in support of a bipartisan bill that can move 
our economy forward, that can improve efficiency in our government, and 
can help citizens get more involved in our democratic republic.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues' support of this bill.
  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), who is on the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee.
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4174, the 
Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2017.
  I am pleased to see the bill's sponsors and the Speaker move forward 
with the reforms proposed by the Commission on Evidence-Based 
Policymaking.
  H.R. 4174 aims to create and use technology to assess and solve 
problems; in other words, to make sure tools exist to gauge whether 
programs work to best serve the American people. It is about utilizing 
the data we already have to find out what works, what doesn't work, and 
what could work for some changes.
  The bill requires agencies to develop evidence-building plans, key 
outcomes and return investment for the money the taxpayers pay, and 
creates the position of a chief evaluation officer. Imagine that, we 
have to actually create a position to evaluate because we

[[Page H9291]]

aren't doing it effectively now. It establishes an advisory committee 
to study the Commission's recommendation that Congress create a 
National Secure Data Service. It includes the OPEN Government Data Act, 
which ensures that government aggregate data is available to consumers 
in a usable format.
  As my colleague said on the other side of the aisle, to make the data 
malleable, to make the data open format so that, in fact, people can 
assess not just in government agencies, but out in the public what the 
data is saying about the programs that they pay for that we fund.
  Finally, the bill also creates procedures to share that data across 
Federal agencies and to require protection of individual data that 
makes up all that aggregate data.
  All of these provisions are critical to setting our government on a 
path toward better serving the people in this country. Washington can 
no longer assess quality based on how much money we dump into programs, 
how many people we enroll--outcomes that don't tell us whether or not 
they are succeeding. This can only be done with quality, accessible 
data.
  By allowing key data to be connected and reported, we can build 
evidence to determine what does and doesn't work. More importantly, the 
American people can see the evidence of what does and doesn't work 
rather than just bureaucrats in Washington.
  I would also like to point out how the reforms are working here to 
lay the foundation for government and Congress to create new policies 
that apply this information in novel ways.
  This act, in its call for transparent, efficient, and well-designed 
data systems, dovetails with other efforts in Congress for transparency 
and sharing data.
  A bill I am working on, the College Transparency Act, would do just 
that for student data and outcomes data from colleges and universities 
to better enable students and families to make more informed decisions 
on one of the most important part of their lives: what postsecondary 
education they pursue and what the outcome will be.

                              {time}  1500

  This bill, and my bill, streamlines and updates higher education 
information. It is time to utilize and make meaning out of all the data 
we currently have and provide that to the taxpayers.
  The Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act and the College 
Transparency Act both share a few critical goals of the Commission on 
Evidence-Based Policymaking:
  First is the protection of the privacy of individuals that may be 
reflected in the data. That is the first priority.
  Second is the recommendation that information be more readily shared 
across agencies. Agencies actually will share what they already know 
about programs.
  Third is that agencies develop a strategy to share this data with the 
public who pays for those programs.
  These provisions are fundamental to responsibly and effectively 
utilizing the data that the taxpayers pay for. The Foundations for 
Evidence-Based Policymaking Act sets in motion these commonsense 
policies that will increase the return on investment for the taxpayers 
and the outcomes of our programs.
  The compartmentalization of data the government already collects and 
barriers that prevent the reasonable sharing of it represent a 
significant missed opportunity for the government to provide value to 
taxpayers.
  It amazes me that we had to create a commission to tell us to share 
this data. Taxpayers have already paid for it. Why aren't we already 
using it?
  Long term, these plans are essential. I urge my colleagues to support 
the bill.
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.
  Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.
  This is a good government bill with bipartisan, bicameral support 
that will give Americans access to the data that they have paid for, 
will give lawmakers access to the data they need to make decisions, and 
will give policymakers and leadership in the executive branch the data 
they need to make better decisions to save taxpayers money and to do a 
better job at the things that we are trying to do in government.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 4174, as amended.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
