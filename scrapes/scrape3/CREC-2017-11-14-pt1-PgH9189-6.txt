  RECOGNIZING MAGLOCLEN AND THE REGIONAL INFORMATION SHARING SYSTEMS 
                                PROGRAM

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize MAGLOCLEN,

[[Page H9190]]

the Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement 
Network, and the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program.
  Last month, I had the opportunity to tour the MAGLOCLEN site in my 
district in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. As one of six regional 
centers, they serve Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, 
New York, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania, as well as 
England and parts of Canada. Their work is integral to keeping local, 
State, and Federal law enforcement agencies informed and equipped with 
the tools they need to do their jobs and to keep us safe.
  MAGLOCLEN and Regional Information Sharing Systems have supported law 
enforcement agencies for a combined 40 years. In 2016 alone, in 
Pennsylvania, MAGLOCLEN saw 299 requests for criminal investigative 
research assistance.
  MAGLOCLEN's holistic approach embodies the best of what an integrated 
information sharing system can offer to other local, State, and Federal 
law enforcement agencies.
  Mr. Speaker, we are proud of the work MAGLOCLEN does operating on 
behalf of the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program in my 
district. We are here to support them and their mission to support our 
law enforcement community.
