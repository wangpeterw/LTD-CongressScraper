                     CELEBRATING NATIONAL 4-H WEEK

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, the first week of October marks the 
celebration of an organization very near and dear to my parents' 
hearts, as well as many friends. It is National 4-H Week. It is a time 
to reflect on the importance of youth development and mentoring within 
our communities. 4-H was founded to be focused on youth within rural 
and agricultural areas. It teaches essential skills and the importance 
of community service.
  Today, 4-H has evolved into a global network covering over 50 
countries. As the Nation's largest youth leadership organization, 4-H 
exemplifies the kind of learning, engagement, and leadership that is 
needed in our country. Their many programs focus on health, science, 
agriculture, and citizenship in a positive mentoring environment. The 
experience teaches young people leadership lessons, as well as the 
value of practical skills and hands-on learning.
