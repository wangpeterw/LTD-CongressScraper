                    COMMEMORATING AMERICAN EAGLE DAY

  (Mr. ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I am proud once again to rise and 
join in commemorating June 20, 2017, as American Eagle Day and to 
celebrate the recovery and restoration of the bald eagle, the national 
symbol of the United States.
  On June 20, 1782, the eagle was designated as the national symbol of 
the U.S. by the Founding Fathers at the Second Continental Congress. 
The bald eagle is the central image of the Great Seal of the United 
States and is displayed in the official seal of many branches and 
departments of the Federal Government.
  The bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of freedom and the democracy of 
the United States. Since the founding of the Nation, the image, 
meaning, and symbolism of the eagle have played a significant role in 
art, music, history, commerce, literature, architecture, and culture of 
the United States.
  The bald eagle's habitat exists only in North America. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in celebrating June 20, 2017, as American Eagle 
Day, which marks the recovery and restoration of the bald eagle.
