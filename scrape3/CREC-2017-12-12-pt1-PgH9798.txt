              HONORING THE ALSTON FAMILY OF MENA, ARKANSAS

  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly 
remarkable family from the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas.
  The Alston family from Mena was recently named Arkansas Farm Family 
of the Year. The Holly Springs Homestead, run by Luke and Deedee 
Alston, is a diverse farm of Angus cattle, chicken houses, and a large 
variety of fruits and vegetables grown at its location in Polk County.
  Not only is the family--which includes sons Ryan and Drey--active in 
traditional farming, but the Alstons are also a leader in Arkansas 
agritourism, with a variety of crops bringing families to the Holly 
Springs Homestead. Their work supports the Polk County economy and 
brings pride to their friends and neighbors.
  I send my congratulations to the Alston family on this prestigious 
honor, as well as all the county farm family winners across Arkansas.
