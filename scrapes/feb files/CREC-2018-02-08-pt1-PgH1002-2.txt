     share a religious faith or practice.''.

     this section shall apply--

       ``(3) Increased federal share.--
       ``(A) Incentive measures.--The President may provide 
     incentives to a State or Tribal government to invest in 
     measures that increase readiness for, and resilience from, a 
     major disaster by recognizing such investments through a 
     sliding scale that increases the minimum Federal share to 85

     for assistance under this Act for the purpose of protecting 
     the health, safety, and general welfare of the buildings'

     guidance to State and Tribal governments regarding the 
     measures and investments, weighted appropriately based on 
     actuarial assessments of eligible actions, that will be 
     recognized for the purpose of increasing the Federal share 
     under this section. Guidance shall ensure that the agency's

     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-28) and the Medicaid 
     program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.). 
     Such study shall include an analysis of the following:
       (A) The characteristics of States in which the State agency 
     responsible for administering the State plan under such title 
     XIX has a contract with such a specialized MA plan and that 
     delivers long-term services and supports under the State plan 
     under such title XIX through a managed care program, 
     including the requirements under such State plan with respect 
     to long-term services and supports.
       (B) The types of such specialized MA plans, which may 
     include the following:
       (i) A plan described in section 1853(a)(1)(B)(iv)(II) of 
     such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-23(a)(1)(B)(iv)(II)).

     programs for the delivery of long-term services and supports 
     under such title XIX through a managed care program:
       (i) Which populations of individuals are eligible to 
     receive such services and supports.
       (ii) Whether all such services and supports are provided on 
     a capitated basis or if any of such services and supports are 
     carved out and provided through fee-for service.
       (E) As practicable, how the availability and variation of 
     integration arrangements of such specialized MA plans offered 
     in States affects spending, service delivery options, access 
     to community-based care, and utilization of care.
       (F) The efforts of State Medicaid programs to transition 
     dually-eligible beneficiaries receiving long-term services 
     and supports (LTSS) from institutional settings to home and 
     community-based settings and related financial impacts of 
     such transitions.
       (G) Barriers and opportunities for making further progress 
     on dual integration, as well as recommendations for 
     legislation or administrative action to expedite or refine 
     pathways toward fully integrated care.

[[Page H1040]]

     furnishing those services, whether Medicare reimbursement is 
     being received for those services, and, if so, through which 
     codes those services are being reimbursed.
       (2) Whether, and the extent to which, longitudinal 
     comprehensive care planning services would overlap, and could 
     therefore result in duplicative payment, with services 
     covered under the hospice benefit as well as the chronic care 
     management code, evaluation and management codes, or other 
     codes that already exist under part B of the Medicare 
     program.
       (3) Any barriers to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, 
     hospice programs, home health agencies, and other applicable 
     providers working with a Medicare beneficiary to engage in 
     the care planning process and complete the necessary 
     documentation to support the treatment and care plan of the 
     beneficiary and provide such documentation to other providers 
     and the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative.
       (4) Any barriers to providers, other than the provider 
     furnishing longitudinal comprehensive care planning services, 
     accessing the care plan and associated documentation for use 
     related to the care of the Medicare beneficiary.
       (5) Potential options for ensuring that applicable 
     providers are notified of a patient's existing longitudinal 
     care plan and that applicable providers consider that plan in 
     making their treatment decisions, and what the challenges 
     might be in implementing such options.
       (6) Stakeholder's views on the need for the development of 
     quality metrics with respect to longitudinal comprehensive 
     care planning services, such as measures related to--
       (A) the process of eliciting input from the Medicare 
     beneficiary or from a legally authorized representative and 
     documenting in the medical record the patient-directed care 
     plan;
       (B) the effectiveness and patient-centeredness of the care 
     plan in organizing delivery of services consistent with the 
     plan;
       (C) the availability of the care plan and associated 
     documentation to other providers that care for the 
     beneficiary; and
       (D) the extent to which the beneficiary received services 
     and support that is free from discrimination based on 
     advanced age, disability status, or advanced illness.
       (7) Stakeholder's views on how such quality metrics would 
     provide information on--
       (A) the goals, values, and preferences of the beneficiary;
       (B) the documentation of the care plan;
       (C) services furnished to the beneficiary; and
       (D) outcomes of treatment.
       (8) Stakeholder's views on--
       (A) the type of training and education needed for 
     applicable providers, individuals, and caregivers in order to 
     facilitate longitudinal comprehensive care planning services;
       (B) the types of providers of services and suppliers that 
     should be included in the interdisciplinary team of an 
     applicable provider; and
       (C) the characteristics of Medicare beneficiaries that 
     would be most appropriate to receive longitudinal 
     comprehensive care planning services, such as individuals 
     with advanced disease and individuals who need assistance 
     with multiple activities of daily living.
       (9) Stakeholder's views on the frequency with which 
     longitudinal comprehensive care planning services should be 
     furnished.
       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the

     such additional requirements before the first day of the 
     first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first 
     regular session of the State legislature that begins after 
     the date of enactment of this Act. For purposes of the

     as the Secretary determines is necessary for the tribe, 
     organization, or tribal consortium to take the action to 
     comply with the additional requirements before being regarded

       ``(A) the child is placed in a child-care institution that 
     is a setting specified in paragraph (2) (or is placed in a 
     licensed residential family-based treatment facility 
     consistent with subsection (j)); and
       ``(B) in the case of a child placed in a qualified 
     residential treatment program (as defined in paragraph (4)),

     is placed in a qualified residential treatment program, if 
     the assessment required under section 475A(c)(1) is not 
     completed within 30 days after the placement is made, no

     the Comptroller General shall evaluate the extent to which 
     children in foster care who also are subject to the juvenile 
     justice system of the State are placed in a facility under 
     the jurisdiction of the juvenile justice system and whether 
     the lack of available congregate care placements under the 
     jurisdiction of the child welfare systems is a contributing 
     factor to that result. Not later than December 31, 2025, the 
     Comptroller General shall submit to Congress a report on the 
     results of the evaluation.

                            Motion to Concur

  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.
  The text of the motion is as follows:

       Mr. Frelinghuysen moves that the House concur in the Senate 
     amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to 
     H.R. 1892.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 734, the motion 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) and the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. Lowey) each will control 30 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to present the Senate amendment to 
the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 1892, a bipartisan, 
bicameral bill outlining the funding for the next 2 fiscal years and 
funding for the government through March 23, providing much needed 
emergency supplemental funding for disaster recovery, and raising the 
Nation's debt ceiling.
  This legislation will help our Nation move forward without the threat 
of a shutdown or default and with greater budget scrutiny. This bill 
will also allow us to move past the destructive cycle of continuing 
resolutions, which undermine the appropriations process and promotes 
only more uncertainty and doubt about our government's and this 
Congress' ability to function and to meet the needs of those we 
represent.
  I am pleased that this legislation includes an agreement reached on a 
bipartisan basis by House and Senate leaders on spending caps for both 
fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019.
  Especially important is a substantial increase in funds for national 
defense. Our Nation faces multiple security challenges and increasingly 
aggressive, not to mention well equipped, adversaries. We must be 
prepared to meet these challenges, and we must take care of our men and 
women in uniform who truly do the work of freedom.
  After years of reduction in military funding and months of 
uncertainty caused by continuing resolutions, it is time we provide our 
Armed Forces with what they need to rebuild and keep our Nation safe.
  The agreement also outlines investments in important bipartisan 
domestic priorities such as fighting the opioid abuse epidemic, 
supporting veterans, and rebuilding and renewing our infrastructure 
around the Nation.
  These top line spending levels will enable us to get to work 
immediately on our 12 appropriations bills to wrap up the fiscal year 
2018 and quickly turn our attention to fiscal year 2019.
  This legislation also includes a short term continuing resolution, 
our last for this year, which will fund the Federal Government through 
March 23. This will maintain programs and services that all Americans 
depend on until all of the annual appropriations bills can be enacted. 
I look forward to working with our Senate counterparts to negotiate and 
complete all of these bills ahead of that deadline.
  In addition to these critical pieces of government funding, this 
legislation also provides $89.3 billion in emergency disaster funding, 
funding that has been urgently needed since this House passed its 
version in December. This funding will provide the residents of Texas, 
Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Western States with the 
resources to rebuild their lives after last year's historic and 
devastating natural disasters.
  Lastly, this bill increases the debt limit through March 1, 2019, so 
we can pay our bills and avoid the economic damage of a default.
  Mr. Speaker, the Senate has just passed this bill, and now it is up 
to this House to do the same and to send this legislation to the 
President for his signature.
  I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill and reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  It is a basic constitutional responsibility of Congress to fund the 
Federal Government and Republican majorities in the House and the 
Senate are just turning the process into an embarrassing spectacle, 
running from one crisis directly into the next.
  It has been clear for 9 months that a bipartisan budget agreement 
would be needed to enact appropriations law, yet it has taken five 
continuing resolutions, two lapses in funding, countless hours of 
effort to take even this first step toward full-year funding bills, 
more than 4 months into the fiscal year.
  I am pleased with many aspects of the budget agreement. Increasing 
statutory spending caps would allow the Appropriations Committee to 
write responsible, bipartisan spending bills that will invest in this 
Nation's families, communities, and national security.
  I am also pleased the legislation would provide funding for families 
and communities in Texas, Florida, California, Puerto Rico, and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands to rebuild their lives following natural disasters.
  Unfortunately, this legislation cannot be considered in a vacuum. The 
Speaker of the House's refusal to commit to considering bipartisan 
legislation to protect teenagers and young adults from deportation is 
unjustifiable and maddening.
  DREAMers are sons, daughters, parents. They are students and 
teachers. They serve with distinction in our Armed Forces. They pay 
taxes and contribute to their communities.
  President Trump and the Republican majority hold the lives and 
futures of these children and young adults in their hands, yet their 
only concern seems to be how much they can extract and exchange for 
doing what a decent human being should do simply because it is right.
  I cannot vote in good conscience to provide Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement, the very funding that could be used to deport the 
DREAMers. I cannot vote to continue the appropriations process while an 
unthinkably tragic fate hangs over the head of 1.6 million young 
people.
  I do hope that in the weeks ahead a bipartisan bill for DREAMers can 
pass the Senate and enough pressure can be brought to bear on House 
Republicans to act. History will condemn these Republican majorities if 
they fail to do what is right.

  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), a member of our 
Appropriations Committee.
  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, West Virginia is literally 
ground zero in the opioid epidemic. Our overdose rate is not just a 
little bit higher than the national average of the No. 2 State. It is 
actually 33 percent higher than the No. 2 State. So when we passed the 
21st Century Cures legislation, dedicating $1 billion to fight this 
horrific epidemic, it gave us hope; it gave me hope.
  And that hope was particularly strong in rural States like West 
Virginia, that finally we might see real resources where it really 
counts, in rural

[[Page H1067]]

communities. But unfortunately, many of the worst-hit States like mine 
ended up receiving only a minimal amount of funding.
  Let me give you an example. A more populous State received five times 
more funding than my State, but my State's overdose rate was five times 
higher than the more populous State.
  This bill, like every bill, has parts I like and parts I don't like. 
One of the issues I have fought for is making sure the now $6 billion 
we are putting towards fighting the opioid crisis will actually get to 
the places where it matters most.
  We must use a formula based on per capita statistics to ensure funds 
go to the hardest hit States and smaller States where the crisis and 
the need is the greatest.
  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, and having a direct hand 
on how the $6 billion will be targeted, I have been reassured that 
rural States like mine will not be shortchanged and--we will work to 
make sure the language in our funding bill makes it abundantly clear to 
the Federal agencies that actually set the allocation formulas--we want 
resources flowing to where they count most.
  I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and his predecessor Chairman 
Rogers for their commitment and leadership to helping.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).
  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding to me.
  Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House is supposed to be the Speaker 
of this entire House. And the entire will of this House on the 
Democratic side and Republican side is to pass a DACA bill but we are 
running out of time.
  Instead of following the bipartisan consensus of the majority in this 
House, this Speaker is yielding to the will of the majority party's 
anti-immigration fringe unilaterally, and that fringe is led by this 
President. If we continue to bend to this fringe, this body, this shiny 
beacon on a hill, this hopefulness in this country will go dark.
  The Senate was able to pass the bipartisan agreement due to the hard 
promise of Leader McConnell and the good work of our Democratic 
leadership as well to allow--simply allow--the body to vote on a DACA 
bill. We, however, have no such commitment on this side.
  22,000 dreamers in the State of New Jersey: they are doctors, they 
are lawyers, they are connected to their churches, they are parents, 
they are teachers, they are business owners. I spent time in a church 
where a Christian, tithe-paying immigrant was taken from his family and 
put in detention. He was not a threat to anyone.
  My constituents did not send me here to deport young people who are 
American and know no other country.
  I ask you, I beg you, I implore you: Do your job. Save these 
DREAMers, and until we do, I urge a ``no'' on this vote.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), a member of the Committee on 
Appropriations.
  Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, we have a choice today.
  I want to compliment the work that the committees have done to reach 
an agreement on these funding levels. I am not here to quibble with 
those funding levels.
  What I am here to ask for is a chance. If this is the people's House, 
we deserve an opportunity to address these issues. I have never said 
this is a bad deal. I have just said this is an incomplete deal. It is 
incomplete because we haven't had the commitment that we need to 
address critical issues that are important to our communities. We have 
addressed some in this: opioids, community health centers. Those are 
important issues in all of our communities.
  But we haven't addressed issues that are important to everyone. Like 
Leti Herrera who was my guest to the State of the Union who lost her 
sister in December, who is scared, who wants to know when her 
priorities are going to be our priorities. She wants to know when we 
are going to bring up these issues.
  And I can tell her, the Senate has a commitment; they are going to 
talk about these issues. But the people's House has not said that we 
are going to talk about these issues. We are going to say, well, when 
the President signs off, then we will have a conversation. He doesn't 
have a card that votes in these machines. He has a voice. He should be 
consulted. He doesn't have a voice in the people's House. He doesn't 
have a vote here with me and you.
  All we want is a commitment to bring up a bipartisan, bicameral bill 
that addresses these issues. All we want is a chance. All we want is an 
opportunity to address these issues that are important to our 
communities.
  Please, please, please give us that opportunity to have that 
conversation.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I have the right to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.

                              {time}  0500

  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I also 
thank her for her outstanding statement of values and what our country 
is about. I thank her for her extraordinary leadership.
  I thank all of our colleagues for the unity that we have had over the 
months when we were having this debate about what this bill would look 
like.
  I want to, again, read a letter that Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Clyburn, and I 
sent to the Speaker last night--I guess this night, because I think it 
is very important for people to understand the simplicity of our 
request, the fairness of our request to the Speaker.
  It says: ``In the spirit of bipartisanship, we write to again 
reiterate our sincere desire to ensure that the government remains open 
and that the priorities of the American people are properly addressed. 
As you know, Democrats have been clear that we support a budget 
agreement that ensures that our men and women in uniform have the 
resources they need to protect our country and that America's middle 
class and working families have the tools they need to succeed. As part 
of this agreement, we have always expected that the House and the 
Senate would address the issue of DACA and our DREAMers.
  ``Most of our Members believe that the budget agreement is a 
reasonable compromise to address America's military strength and 
critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting 
NIH, moving forward to resolve the pension crisis, caring for our 
veterans, making college more affordable, and investing in childcare 
for working families.''
  Indeed, that is what the fight has been about all along. We have had 
to fight the resistance on the Republican side to invest in the 
domestic agenda. So I was pleased to hear some of our Republican 
colleagues talk about some of the things in this bill that we, on the 
Democratic side, insisted upon being there.
  So, Mr. Speaker, we are writing again to request that you make a 
public statement regarding the scheduling of a vote on the DACA bill. 
That is our request. That is the request of the House Democrats that 
Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn sent this letter last night: ``Our request is 
that you publicly state that you will schedule a vote to consider the 
bipartisan Hurd-Aguilar bill and any other DACA bills that you wish to 
consider under a Queen of the Hill rule.
  ``We strongly believe that Members of the House and their 
constituents deserve the same dignity that Leader McConnell has 
extended to Members of the Senate'' by stating that he will allow a 
vote on this issue.
  We asked him for his immediate attention to this issue, but we did 
not receive that back.
  I said earlier that America is the greatest country that ever existed 
in the history of the world.
  Aren't we proud to be Americans?
  And what is America?
  America is a country of great people of beautiful diversity that have 
changed over time from the days of our Founders. ``E pluribus unum,'' 
they said. They could never imagine how pluribus it could be, how many, 
how

[[Page H1068]]

many different people. Yet they established a Constitution that enabled 
everyone the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It 
is a beautiful thing. Our country has become a more diverse country 
over time, but still, e pluribus unum.
  In this vote today, we are just saying to pay respect to the fact 
that we are a nation of immigrants, constantly reinvigorated by 
newcomers coming with their hopes, dreams, aspirations, courage to make 
the future better for their families.
  That is what America is about. That is what the optimism of our 
Founders was based on, that every generation would take responsibility. 
So these newcomers have made America more American.
  Then who is America?
  America is our great Constitution of the United States, a great 
Constitution, which we take an oath to support.
  And what else is America?
  America is a great patrimony, this beautiful land that God has given 
us to be stewards of. It is important to know that our country is our 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and our territories.
  In respect for that, I am very pleased that, in this bill, we were 
successful in the negotiations to get more funding for the territories, 
especially Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, an increase over what 
was in the original disaster bill.
  But there are other things that are important to note that are in 
this bill. Again, opioids, mental health, National Institutes of 
Health, these are Democratic priorities that we fought for. That is why 
this took so long to come to fruition, because there was a resistance 
on the Republican side to invest on the domestic side.
  So they have been increasing the defense number, which we go along 
with, but wanted commensurate increase on the domestic side, 
recognizing the domestic side for us and our budget--appropriators know 
this better than anyone--includes security functions, Homeland 
Security, the State Department, Veterans Affairs, antiterrorism 
activities of the Justice Department.
  So there is much security on the domestic side. That is why we 
insisted on increasing the number, and that did happen. That did 
happen. That is why I am able to say in this letter that there are many 
good things in this legislation.
  But for some reason, sometimes I think the Speaker thinks he is 
Speaker of the White House, not the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives. We should have the opportunity--I touched a nerve 
there, I hear--to have this House, the people's House, work its will, 
not be the recipients of something that might--as he said: Well, if it 
passes with 60 votes in the Senate and the President approves, then 
maybe I will bring it to the floor.
  That is not a commitment.
  Just let me say again what an honor it is for any of us to associate 
ourselves with the aspirations of the DREAMers in our country. They are 
so magnificent. They are a model of patriotism to our country, and all 
they wanted was the recognition of the Speaker of the House that they 
are worthy of that.

  In any event, I thank the various speakers who were presiding the 
other day. I thank the speakers for their courtesies extended. I thank 
the Chair, too, Mr. Speaker.
  But here it is: Yes, I was one of the four principals with the White 
House negotiating on this legislation. A lot of it came our way.
  Do you know why?
  Because nobody wants a shutdown.
  This is a good bill. It doesn't do everything, but it is a 
compromise. But the one thing and the one message to allay fear, to 
build confidence, to honor the vows of our Founders that we could have 
done is to say: We, the United States of America, in this people's 
House, want to assure you that we will allow the House of 
Representatives to work its will.
  Let the chips fall where they may, but give us a chance to allay the 
fear that is in the hearts of these DREAMers and their families and to 
remove the tears from the eyes of the Statue of Liberty observing what 
is happening here.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to 
close.
  A fifth CR--a fifth CR--while one party controls all levers of 
government, shows the Republicans' inability to govern.
  Even more upsetting is their refusal to put a bipartisan DREAMer bill 
on the House floor. While there are provisions in the Senate amendment 
that Democrats support, we implore our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle to do what is right and to permit a vote on a bipartisan 
DREAMer bill.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.
  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.
  A few hours ago, the Senate passed this agreement with a very big 
bipartisan vote: 75 percent of the Senate Democrats, 68 percent of the 
Senate Republicans, Republicans and Democrats coming together on a true 
compromise measure. I think that is a thing to celebrate.
  It accomplishes what so many of us had been fighting for. First and 
foremost, this agreement accomplishes getting the resources that we 
need to rebuild our military. Also, this includes long-delayed disaster 
funding to aid recovery from the hurricanes and the wildfires; money to 
fight opioids, something that knows no partisan boundaries; and the 
extension of important healthcare programs.
  This agreement will also allow us to step off this carousel of short-
term funding bills that do nothing but hurt our military and stymie our 
ability to focus on other important agenda items. And I think that has 
been noted here tonight.
  You know, most Americans are not even awake yet, or maybe they are 
just getting up for the first shift. By the time they catch up with the 
news this morning, they will see one of two things, depending upon what 
choice we make here right now.
  Either Congress will have done its most basic responsibility: funding 
the government and taking care of our brave men and women in uniform. I 
really believe that that is what the majority of this people in this 
body want to see happen.
  Or they will see a second needless shutdown in a matter of weeks. 
Entirely needless.
  Republicans will deliver more than our share of votes this morning. I 
urge my friends in the minority to stand with us on this bipartisan 
bill.
  My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we 
can make law is a sincere commitment. Let me repeat. My commitment to 
working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a 
sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem.
  Once we get this budget agreement done--and we will get this done, no 
matter how long it takes for us to stay here--we will focus on bringing 
that debate to this floor and finding a solution. But we cannot do that 
unless we pass this budget agreement.
  Our military can no longer be held hostage in this process. So, for 
this morning, let's honor our troops. Let's do our most basic job and 
let's pass this bill.
  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, after much 
consideration, I will reluctantly vote for this legislation. The 
bipartisan agreement included $6 billion to combat opioid abuse and 
improving mental health, $2 billion for research at the National 
Institutes of Health and $4 billion for college affordability. The 
measure extends one of my legislative priorities, the Children's Health 
Insurance Program for 10 years.
  Since Hurricane Harvey's landfall in last August, I have worked 
tirelessly with the Texas Governor, the Texas Congressional delegation, 
local mayors, county commissioners and police and fire chiefs to 
identify and meet the needs of impacted Texans. The agreement increases 
overall disaster relief from $81 billion to $89 billion which means it 
will increase Texas's share of that relief and to significantly 
increase the funding for critical Army Corps flood management projects 
that help Texas to take necessary measures against future flooding 
events.
  Additionally, I have fought hard for many years to fund the needs of 
our veterans, and our transportation infrastructure. This bill provides 
$4 billion to reduce the VA healthcare maintenance backlog. There will 
be $20 billion to invest in infrastructure, including programs related 
to rural water and wastewater, clean

[[Page H1069]]

and safe drinking water, rural broadband, energy, innovative capital 
projects, and surface transportation.
  The agreement includes funding for child care, including the 
bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant program and funding for 
student-centered programs that aid college completion and 
affordability, including those that help police officers, teachers and 
firefighters.
  Mr. Speaker, I will vote yes on this bill because the measure also 
closes the Medicare Part D ``donut hole'' for seniors in 2019. I will 
continue to work to make sure that Congress follows through on this 
deal, and that Texas' 30th District gets what it needs to move our 
communities, our state and the Nation forward.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain the importance of the 
pending legislation, which extends the Continuing Resolution passed by 
Congress on January 26, 2018 but expired at midnight, February 8, 2018, 
by an additional six weeks, or until March 23, 2018.
  This crucial legislation rests upon three pillars.
  First, the legislation before us provides $89.3 billion in aid to 
respond to the damage caused by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and 
the wildfires in California.
  Second, the Continuing Resolution pending before us is necessary to 
finalize and implement a bipartisan and bicameral budget agreement 
gives parity to defense and non-defense discretionary funding and 
provides $117 billion more funding for needed non-defense investments 
in the areas of education, public health, infrastructure, community 
development, and disaster relief than proposed under the Trump FY 2018 
budget.
  Third, I will be advocating for a nay vote on the Previous Question 
in order to bring to the floor a crucial legislative fix for debate and 
vote that will provide permanent legal residence and a path to 
citizenship to the more than 800,000 Dreamers, including the 124,000 
who live in Texas, whose lives have been turned upside down because of 
this Administration's cruel, unwise, and reckless termination of DACA, 
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
  And in connection with legislation to protect Dreamers, I will insist 
that the Administration rescind the revocation of Temporary Protected 
Status (TPS) for Haiti, El Salvador, and Honduras, or failing that, TPS 
for those countries be extended by congressional legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, 44,800 residents of Texas are TPS holders from El 
Salvador (36,300), Honduras (8,400), and Haiti, who combined are 
parents of 53,800 U.S.-born children in Texas and 14,000 of whom have 
home mortgages.
  These TPS holders are integral members of the Texas's social fabric, 
having lived in Texas an average of 20 years, and contribute an 
aggregate $2.2 billion to the Texas economy.
  This legislation provides $89.3 billion in emergency supplemental 
appropriations to help states, communities, businesses, and individuals 
respond and recover from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the 
California wildfires.
  This amount represents a doubling of the woefully inadequate $44 
billion disaster relief package proposed by the Administration and a 
substantial increase over the $81.1 billion disaster relief funding 
approved by the House.
  Ever since the widespread and catastrophic destruction of Hurricane 
Harvey occurred, I have been working closely with Senator Cornyn and 
other federal, state, and local officials, along with my colleagues in 
the Texas congressional delegation to secure the help necessary for the 
areas affected by Hurricane Harvey recover and rebuild.
  The $8 billion increase in disaster relief funding reflected in this 
legislation is due in strong part to the efforts of Senator Cornyn, 
with whom I worked very closely to ensure that the interests of Houston 
and Harris County were promoted and protected.
  I have witnessed firsthand the pain of storm-weary Houstonians who 
lost their homes, their belongings, and in many cases their jobs.
  Right now, at this very moment, hundreds of thousands of Texans--in 
Port Arthur, in Port Aransas, in Rockport, in Houston and Harris 
County--remain homeless or are living in substandard homes with blue 
tarp roofs and infected with mold.
  They are struggling and hurting.
  So this is personal to me.
  That is why right now my highest priority is to ensure that funding 
that has been made available expeditiously gets in the hands of local 
governments so that relief can deliver the resources and services so 
desperately needed.
  That is why I am working with the Texas General Land Office 
Commissioner and have advocated for the immediate release of the $5 
billion that was approved in September 2017 and wrote the HUD Secretary 
to expedite promulgation of the proposed regulations necessary to 
release the funds, which finally were published this week in the 
Federal Register for notice and comment.
  And that is why on September 6, 2017, ten days after Hurricane Harvey 
struck, I introduced the first Hurricane Harvey disaster recovery 
legislation.
  I was joined by 44 colleagues in introducing H.R. 3686, the 
``Hurricane Harvey Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2017,'' which 
provides $174 billion in disaster relief for the areas affected by 
Hurricane Harvey, the worst superstorm ever to strike the mainland 
United States.
  The $174 billion in funding provided by H.R. 3686 represents a 
comprehensive response commensurate to the challenge; specifically that 
legislation would provide relief in the following amounts:
  1. Housing and Community Development Fund: $50 billion
  2. FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $35 billion
  3. Army Corps of Engineers--Construction: $15 billion
  4. Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies: $13 billion
  5. Public Transportation Emergency Relief Program: $33 billion
  6. Small Business Disaster Loans Program: $2 billion
  7. Emergency Conservation Activities: $650 million
  8. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $321 million
  9. National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $50 million
  10. Legal Services Corporation: $10 million
  11. Army National Guard: $10 million
  12. Army Corps of Engineers--Civil Investigations: $150 million
  13. Coast Guard: $450 million
  14. National Park Service Historic Preservation Fund: $800 million
  15. EPA Environmental Programs and Management: $2.5 billion
  16. EPA Hazardous Substance Superfund: $7 million
  17. Leaking Underground Storage Tank Fund: $15 million
  18. State and Tribal Assistance Grants: $600 million
  19. Employment and Training Services: $100 million
  20. Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund: $2.5 billion
  21. Airport and Airway Trust Fund: $90 million
  22. Federal-Aid Highways Emergency Relief Program: $6.5 billion
  Although, the disaster relief funding provided in the legislation 
before us is not as robust as the package I have proposed, it is a 
significant improvement over what was initially offered by the 
Administration and will provide much needed assistance to disaster 
victims in desperate need of help.
  I wish to thank the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, in 
particular T-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart, and 
Energy and Water Appropriations Ranking Member Kaptur for including in 
the legislation before us the following beneficial measures that I 
requested, including:
  1. Authority to establish and implement a $1 billion pilot program to 
provide small business disaster recovery grants, modeled on H.R. 3930, 
the ``Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act,'' 
legislation I introduced on October 3, 2017 and is co-sponsored by 16 
of our colleagues.
  2. $75 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Investigations 
account, which is to be used in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, 
Irma, and Maria, and can be used to finance the $3 million Houston-Area 
Watershed Assessment Study.
  3. This is a highly successful conclusion to the multi-year struggle 
I waged to secure House approval of this project and funding with the 
Jackson Lee Amendments to the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for 
Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, and 2018.
  4. The bill also includes helpful legislative language to ensure that 
in awarding CDBG-Disaster Relief funds to states, the Secretary of HUD 
should to the maximum extent practicable award grants to units of local 
government and public housing authorities that have the financial and 
administrative capacity to manage a grant awarded under the program.
  5. The bill also includes a provision for which I advocated expressly 
providing that religious nonprofit organizations and houses of worship 
have the same opportunity to qualify for disaster assistance as their 
secular counterparts.
  Let me describe briefly some of the major provisions contained in 
this disaster relief funding package before us:
  FEMA Disaster Relief Fund: $28 billion to provide critical funding to 
assist the ongoing federal disaster response to allow up to $4 billion 
to be provided for Community Disaster Loans (CDLs).
  Emergency Food Assistance Program: $24 million to provide an 
additional 35 million pounds of food for food banks in states affected 
by natural disasters.
  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children (WIC): $14 million.

[[Page H1070]]

  $7.6 million to repair 12 Food and Drug Administration sites damaged 
by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, including repair of scientific 
equipment such as those used to test foods for chemical contamination.
  Economic Development Assistance Programs: $600 million in additional 
funding to provide grants to communities directly impacted by Hurricane 
Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as others disasters declared in 2017.
  This funding will support immediate relief efforts and longterm 
recovery projects, including repairing and replacing basic 
infrastructure needs that are vital for local economic recovery.
  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: $400 million, with 
$100 million allocated for improving weather forecasting capabilities 
and data collection efforts to better protect lives and property in the 
wake of future hurricanes, and with $200 million for fishery disasters 
causing severe economic harm in coastal communities following 
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.
  National Aeronautics and Space Administration: $81 million to repair 
facilities damaged at the Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers.
  Legal Services Corporation: $15 million for mobile resources, 
technology, and disaster coordinators necessary to provide storm-
related services to the population in affected areas.
  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: $17.39 billion, including $15 billion 
for flood control and storm damage reduction construction projects and 
$135 million for high priority Investigation studies for risk reduction 
from future floods and hurricanes.
  Of this $135 million, $75 million is to be allocated for the Army 
Corps of Engineers' Investigations account, which is to be used in 
areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and can be used 
to finance the $3 million Houston-Area Watershed Assessment Study I 
have worked to secure and which has been previously approved by the 
House.
  The bill also included $608 million to finance needed federal 
dredging projects, such as Houston Shipping Channel and $810 million to 
prepare for and mitigate future flood, hurricane, and other natural 
disasters.
  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will receive 
$28 billion allocated to the Community Development Fund to repair 
homes, support local business, and rebuild infrastructure while 
mitigating future risk.
  Also included in the legislation is authority for HUD to adjust 
Section 8 voucher funding for public housing agencies adversely 
affected by disasters in 2017.
  Mr. Speaker, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, located in my 
congressional district, will benefit from the $10.3 million to repair 
Transportation and Security Administration facilities, security 
equipment, and access control equipment at airports damaged by the 
hurricanes.
  The Texas Gulf Coast will benefit from the $835 million allocated to 
the U.S. Coast Guard; $4 million of which for site assessments to 
determine environmental compliance and restoration needs.
  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will receive $23.5 billion 
for the Disaster Relief Fund to support response and recovery efforts.
  Other important provisions in the FEMA appropriations:
  1. Ensure that religious nonprofit organizations are given the same 
opportunity to qualify for certain disaster assistance as their secular 
counterparts.
  2. Extend the period of time that local government revenue loss as a 
result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria can be considered for the 
purpose of Community Disaster Loans.
  3. Authorize the President to increase the federal cost share for 
certain disaster assistance from 75 to 85 percent if recipients have 
taken steps to make themselves more resilient against disasters.
  The Environmental Protection Agency will receive $6.2 million for the 
Superfund program to help repair damage sustained to remedies at 
Superfund sites; $7 million for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank 
program to repair damage to storage tanks to prevent spills and 
contaminants from leaking into the environment; and $50 million for 
debris removal and technical assistance to inspect and clean up 
hazardous waste facilities.
  Department of Labor: $100 million for disaster response economic 
recovery through the Dislocated Worker National Reserve.
  Department of Health and Human Services:
  1. $200 million for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
  2. $50 million for National Institutes of Health;
  3. $650 million for Head Start; and
  4. $162 million for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency 
Fund, including $60 million for Community Health Centers and $20 
million for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration.
  Department of Education will receive $2.7 billion for Hurricane 
Education Recovery, including:
  1. $2.46 billion to restart operations at elementary and secondary 
schools;
  2. $100 million for institutions of higher education, and students at 
those institutions;
  3. $25 million for education services for homeless children; and
  4. $35 million for Project SERV for education-related services to 
help students recover from traumatic events, including natural 
disasters.
  Notably, this legislation forgives loans made to four Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities in response to Hurricane Katrina.
  Also notably, the CR allocates $14 million for the Government 
Accountability Office to conduct oversight and evaluate distribution 
and use of disaster funding across agencies to ensure responsible use 
of taxpayer funds.
  Department of Veterans Affairs: $4.1 million to repair damages to the 
Veterans Benefit Administration Office in Houston, Texas and the Puerto 
Rico National Cemetery.
  Department of Transportation: $30 billion to repair damaged 
infrastructure and help communities recover from natural disasters.
  Federal Highway Administration will receive $1.3 billion and the 
Federal Transit Administration will receive $330 million, both for 
their Emergency Relief Programs.
  Mr. Speaker, there is much more work to be done in my city of 
Houston, and across the areas affected by the terrible, awesome storm 
that will be forever known simply as Hurricane Harvey, and by 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
  But the disaster relief funding package before us today represents a 
solid start toward completing the necessary work that must be 
undertaken to restore the affected communities to their previous 
greatness.
  As I conclude, I am remembering a heroic DREAMER, Alonso Guillen, who 
came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, and died in my congressional 
district when his boat capsized while he was rescuing survivors of the 
flooding caused by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area.
  There is no heart in ending DACA and leaving the fate of 800,000 
young persons in limbo and constant fear of deportation from the only 
country they have ever known, and the only nation to which they have 
ever pledged allegiance.
  The way to end this crisis is to bring H.R. 3440, the Dream Act of 
2017, to the floor right now and vote for it so it can pass both houses 
of Congress with a veto-proof majority.
  A Dreamer seeking to earn her college degree and aspiring to attend 
medical school to better herself and her new community is not a threat 
to the nation's security.
  Law abiding but unauthorized immigrants doing honest work to support 
their families pose far less danger to society than human traffickers, 
drug smugglers, or those who have committed a serious crime.
  President Obama was correct in concluding that exercising his 
discretion regarding the implementation of DACA enhances the safety of 
all members of the public, serves national security interests, and 
furthers the public interest in keeping families together.
  According to numerous studies conducted by the Congressional Budget 
Office, Social Security Administration, and Council of Economic 
Advisors, DACA generates substantial economic benefits to our nation.
  For example, expanding DACA is estimated to increase GDP by $230 
billion and create an average of 28,814 jobs per year over the next 10 
years.
  That is a lot of jobs.
  In exercising his broad discretion in the area of removal 
proceedings, President Obama acted responsibly and reasonably in 
determining the circumstances in which it makes sense to pursue removal 
and when it does not.
  Because of President Obama's leadership and visionary executive 
action, 124,000 undocumented immigrants in my home state of Texas have 
received deferred action.
  91 percent of these immigrants are employed or in school and 
contribute $6.3 billion annually to the Texas economy and $460.3 
billion to the national economy.
  Instead of wasting time scapegoating DREAMERS, we should instead 
seize the opportunity to pass legislation that secures our borders, 
preserves America's character as the most open and welcoming country in 
the history of the world, and will yield hundreds of billions of 
dollars in economic growth.
