                       NATIONAL AGRICULTURE WEEK

  (Mr. SMITH of Nebraska asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
National Agriculture Week and the farmers and ranchers who have made 
Nebraska's Third District the top producing agriculture district in the 
country.
  One in four Nebraska jobs is tied to agriculture. The hard work and 
innovative practices of our producers have made our State a leader in 
feeding the world.
  For too long the heavy hand of the Federal Government has threatened 
agriculture's future. Thankfully, we have seen important victories 
under the Trump administration, including the beginning of the end for 
the EPA's dangerous waters of the U.S. rule, or WOTUS.
  Nebraska's farmers and ranchers are committed stewards of our natural 
resources and take many steps to keep our water resources clean. 
President Trump ordered a reset on WOTUS, agreeing farmers and ranchers 
deserve better than to have Washington bureaucrats controlling the 
water puddles and irrigation ditches on their land.
  As founder and co-chairman of the Modern Agriculture Caucus, I will 
continue to promote policies designed to get the government out of the 
way and

open more markets around the world for Nebraska producers.
