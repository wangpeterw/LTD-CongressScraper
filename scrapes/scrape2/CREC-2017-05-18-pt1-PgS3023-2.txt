                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, the source of all our praise, we magnify Your Name. We 
place our trust in You, for You are our helper throughout life's 
seasons.
  Be mindful of our Senators and bless them. Keep them on the path that 
leads to life. May Your peace stay with them, guarding their hearts and 
minds.
  Lord, give them the wisdom to practice integrity in all of their 
conduct. Keep them from stumbling and slipping as You prepare them to 
stand before Your presence with great joy.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
