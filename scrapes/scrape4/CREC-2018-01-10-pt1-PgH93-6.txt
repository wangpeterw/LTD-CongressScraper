                 HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS S. MONSON

  (Mr. CURTIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a beloved 
worldwide leader, Thomas S. Monson, who served as the president and 
prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints until his 
passing last week.
  From an early age, President Monson led a faithful life serving those 
most in need and seeking out those who often went unnoticed. His loving 
service spanned over half a century.
  On a personal note, while I was mayor of Provo, our historic 
tabernacle burned down in a tragic fire. The devastating loss of such a 
treasured building in our community was palpable.
  But President Monson had the unmistakable foresight to know that 
something even more remarkable could one day stand in its place. I will 
never forget the audible gasp from thousands of church members when 
President Monson announced that, from the ashes of the tabernacle, a 
new temple would be built in its stead.
  Today, that temple stands as an extraordinary reminder of his 
unmatched leadership that led us from loss and sorrow to hope and joy.
  My wife, Sue, and I express our deepest condolences to President 
Monson's family and the many members of the

church around the world that grieve at the loss of this important 
leader.
