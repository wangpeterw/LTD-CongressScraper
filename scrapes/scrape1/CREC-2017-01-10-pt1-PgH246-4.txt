                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express strong opposition to 
any attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In North Carolina, 
more than 552,000 people have gained affordable health care through the 
Affordable Care Act. One of those residents is Mrs. Darlene Harris of 
Charlotte, North Carolina, who was born with a hole in her heart. Each 
and every breath she has taken has been a miracle.
  When her heart was beats away from rupturing, her husband's insurance 
saved her life. Following his death, Darlene tried to cope without that 
insurance, gambling with her own life. Thanks to the ACA, she is free 
from that awful burden.
  A repeal of the Affordable Care Act would condemn millions of 
hardworking Americans and their loved ones to the nightmare of the past 
when preexisting conditions were not covered. It is imperative that we 
not ignore the pleas of our fellow Americans. It has and will continue 
to save the lives of our family, neighbors, and friends. I urge my 
colleagues to absolutely object to any repeal of the Affordable Care 
Act.
