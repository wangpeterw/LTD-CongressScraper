2614,topic-id,145,"Madam Speaker, I know our time is short. I just want to say that this bill signifies our staunch support for life, and in spite of what has all been said, it just simply prevents taxpayer funds from being used to pay for abortions.  For years our government has had a patchwork approach to this issue. However, this bill, H.7, would create a clear and unified policy across all Federal agencies.  Our Founding Fathers set forth in the Declaration of Independence ``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.'' One of those unalienable rights is life. Therefore, it follows that the right to life of each human being should be preserved and protected.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman from Tennessee has expired.

2697,topic-id,161,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, or the SCRUB  This legislation establishes a commission to review existing Federal regulations and report to Congress those that should be repealed to reduce unnecessary costs to the economy--kind of like a regulation report card.  Federal rules and regulations have sucked the life out of our small businesses for the last 8 years. Unlike some lawmakers, I have the unique experience of having operated a business under Obama-era rules and regulations. Let me tell you that it was very difficult. Our struggles were not an isolated event. Georgians and Americans across the country bore those same burdens.  We are ready for growth and innovation and an environment that encourages an economy like we have never seen before. The SCRUB Act is a solid step forward in restoring life to the American small-business community.

2646,topic-id,500,"Mr.Speaker, section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission--an agency not charged with the responsibility of carrying out American foreign policy--to promulgate a resource extraction issuer disclosure rule. That regulation, which is the subject of today's resolution, requires publicly traded U.firms to disclose payments that they make to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or mineral resources.  The intent of the rule, as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle point out, is to allow local populations to see how much revenue is generated by their natural resources; but, in practice, if fully implemented, this rule will have a very negative impact on Americans and on the people it is purported to help.  First, the rule puts American firms at a severe competitive disadvantage, and we have talked about this before. Because section 1504 applies only to companies that are listed on U.exchanges, it forces them to disclose payments in detail in a way that would put them at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.companies, like those located in The SEC estimates that the initial cost of compliance for U.firms could be as high as $700 million and that the ongoing costs could be as large as $591 million annually. That is $591 million that American businesses could be putting to better and more productive use, like in creating jobs and investing in their workers. The SEC, itself, admitted that compliance costs would result in diverting capital away from other productive opportunities.  In addition, these disclosures will include sensitive commercial proprietary information and trade secrets that foreign state-owned competitors can use against American firms, and 50 percent of the firms that are likely to be obligated to comply with this rule are smaller reporting companies. While larger firms can more easily adjust their financial reporting systems in order to collect the required data or can even alter their business models to make the rule less burdensome, the smaller firms that will be forced to comply with this rule will have a very difficult time. This will lead to a consolidation in the industry, to a reduction in competition, and to higher prices for American consumers.  These projects are often carried out in countries with underdeveloped economies. As a result, they provide much-desired work for local populations, and they help improve the standard of living in the area, lifting many people out of poverty. This rule will stifle economic development in areas that need it most, potentially limiting the ability of these regions to thrive.  In conclusion, Mr.Speaker, this is not about investor protection. Instead, it is going to undermine capital formation, and it is going to hurt smaller firms, and it is going to hurt jobs in this country. The Securities and Exchange Commission, as it admits itself, is not in a position to conduct American foreign policy. Let's leave this to the State Department, and let's focus on SEC rules that are core to its mission: investor protection and capital formation.

I rise today in strong support of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Smith) for his unflinching leadership on this issue.  It was just a week ago that groups of women marched in the streets of D.and other cities across the country apparently ready to write off this Presidency as it just began.  There were millions of pro-life women who were explicitly told that they were unwelcome at this event. So today, the people's House is giving them and the more than 60 percent of Americans from all political persuasions who oppose taxpayer funding of abortions a voice.  The legislation before us will protect Americans' conscience rights by ensuring that their hard-earned tax dollars are not used to fund the destruction of innocent life. That is a principle that Members of both parties have supported in this Chamber before.  Every year, Democrats and Republicans alike have come together to support funding bills that maintain the law called the Hyde amendment, which prohibits the direct Federal funding of abortion, with limited exceptions. This 40-year-old law has saved an estimated 2 million lives, but it is not permanent, meaning that this time-honored protection could be taken away on a whim. What is more, the law, in its current form, has clear loopholes.  A 2014 GAO study found that taxpayer-funded insurance subsidies could be used to pay for abortions on over 1,000 ObamaCare plans nationwide. That is why today we have the opportunity to make this life-affirming law permanent and governmentwide.  As a mother, a grandmother, and a nurse for more than 40 years, this measure is especially meaningful to me. During my years in the healthcare industry, I saw the joy in young parents' eyes when they met their newborn for the very first time. I held the hands of grieving spouses and children as they said good-bye to their loved ones. And, sadly, I witnessed a young woman lose her life due to the effects of a botched abortion.  These experiences informed my view that all life is a precious gift from I pray that in time this truth will be reflected in our Nation's laws. Until then, can't we at least do this much.

The Federal Communications Commission issued its Open Internet Order, reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers, which brought them under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications The Federal Trade Commission is the primary regulator of companies' privacy and data security practices; however, the Federal Trade Commission's regulatory authority under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act does not extend to common carriers. Therefore, the reclassification of broadband internet service providers as common carriers created a legal enforcement gap.  The Federal Communications Commission determined that the privacy provisions of the Communications Act would now apply to broadband internet service providers and that new and expanded privacy rules were necessary. Therefore, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated new privacy rules for common carriers on October 27, 2016. These rules were adopted a mere 10 days before the 2016 Presidential election. They were adopted on a party-line vote and over serious objections by the minority Commission members and the internet service providers. The Federal Communications Commission's rules are a departure from the privacy protections that have been applied by the Federal Trade Commission for years.  The Federal Trade Commission employs an opt-out model that requires companies to provide consumers notice of the data that is collected and how it will be used. Consumers are then given the option to opt out of this data collection if they so choose. Instead of implementing well-established collection practices that are accepted industrywide, the Federal Communications Commission chose to promulgate an opt-in model for its new internet service providers. This model prohibits broadband internet service providers from using, disclosing, or providing access to customer proprietary information without the customer's affirmative opt-in consent. Such data includes browsing history, application usage, and location data, among other types of information.  While this may sound like a good thing to opt in to, in reality, it unfairly skews the market in favor of providers that already have access to consumer information. For example, search engines, social media sites, and internet content providers like Netflix, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, these providers, known as edge providers, are free to collect consumer data that broadband internet service providers, under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, are not. The ability to provide consumer data drives the digital advertising market.  The Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules arbitrarily treat internet service providers differently from the rest of the internet, amounting to government intervention in the free market. The Federal Communications Commission stated that the rules would provide more transparency, the rules would provide more choice, the rules would provide more protection; however, these expanded provisions may also result in more frequent breach notifications, leading to a weaker focus on security by consumers who do suffer from notification fatigue.  While the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules were meant to protect consumers, they actually can inhibit security and market competition while creating confusion by subjecting parts of the internet ecosystem to different rules and different jurisdictions. To correct this policy, on March 23, 2017, the Senate passed S.34, a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to nullify the privacy rulemaking promulgated by the Federal Communications  Prior to the reclassification of broadband internet service providers as common carriers under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission regulated companies' privacy practices while preserving the Federal Communications Commission's authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers on a case-by-case basis.  This Congressional Review Act will restore the status quo that existed prior to the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet Order and bring the privacy practices of all parts of the internet back into balance. Not only will this level the playing field for an increasingly anticompetitive market, but it will ensure parity in the protection of consumer data.  The new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai, has called to halt the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules. He stated: ``All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules. . . . The Federal Government shouldn't favor one set of companies over another.'' This is precisely the type of limited government that we should be striving for after years of overreaching by the previous administration and its regulations. The Congressional Review Act protects consumers, and it restores the free market competitiveness that actually allows our economy to thrive.  The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more apparent than over the past 2 months, where this Congress has needed to step in and remove burdensome, unbalanced regulations put in place by the prior administration and their team just as they were walking out the door.  House Republicans today will stand up for the rights of our constituents against the out-of-control Federal bureaucracy.

Technology companies invest billions of dollars      on data security to protect consumer privacy.       Privacy is also a cornerstone of consumer protection, with      federal enforcement agencies striking an appropriate balance      between innovation and security in their regulations. But      just as a flawed line of code can render a new firewall      program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed      through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk      crashing our longstanding privacy-protection regime.       For two decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been      America's sole online privacy regulator. Under the FTC's      watch, our internet and data economy has been the envy of the      world. The agency's evidence-based approach calibrates      privacy and data-security requirements to the sensitivity of      information collected, used or shared online, and applies      protections in a consistent and evenhanded way across      business sectors. Consumer behavior demonstrates the success      of the FTC's regulatory approach: Each day people spend more      time engaging in online activities.       But in 2015, in a bid to expand its own power, the Federal      Communications Commission short-circuited the effectiveness      of the FTC's approach by reclassifying internet service      providers as common carriers, subject to Title II of the      Communications       In taking that unprecedented action, the FCC unilaterally      stripped the FTC of its traditional jurisdiction over      The FTC can no longer police the privacy practices of      providers, leaving us with a two-track system under which the      FCC applies its own set of rules for ISPs while the FTC      monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem.       Even after the 2015 power grab, the FCC could have simply      adopted as its own the FTC's successful sensitivity-based      model of privacy regulation. Instead--after last year's      election--the FCC finalized privacy regulations that deviate      extensively from the FTC framework in several key respects.       The FCC rules subject all web browsing and app usage data      to the same restrictive requirements as sensitive personal      information. That means that information generated from      looking up the latest Cardinals score or checking the weather      in Scottsdale is treated the same as personal health and      financial data.       The new rules also restrict an ISP's ability to inform      customers about innovative and cost-saving product offerings.      So much for consumer choice.       The FCC's overreach is a dangerous deviation from      successful regulation and common-sense industry practices.      But don't just take my word for it. The FTC concluded that      the FCC's decision to treat ISPs differently from the rest of      the internet ecosystem was ``not optimal--agency-speak for      ``a really bad idea.''       Outside of the FTC's well-founded concerns, the new rules      are also a departure from bipartisan agreement on the need      for consistent online privacy rules. President Obama noted in      2012 that ``companies should present choices about data      sharing, collection, use, and disclosure that are appropriate      for the scale, scope, and sensitivity of personal data in      question at the time of collection.'' In other words, privacy      rules should be based on the data itself.       But that's not how the FCC sees it. The commission's rules      suffocate industry and harm consumers by creating two      completely different sets of requirements for different parts      of the internet.       To protect consumers from these harmful new regulations, I      will soon introduce a resolution under the Congressional      Review Act to repeal the FCC's flawed privacy rules. While      the resolution would eliminate those rules, it would not      change the current statutory classification of broadband      service or bring ISPs back under FTC jurisdiction. Instead,      the resolution would scrap the FCC's newly imposed privacy      rules in the hope that it would follow the FTC's successful      sensitivity-based framework.       This CRA resolution does nothing to change the privacy      protections consumers currently enjoy. I hope Congress and      the FCC will continue working together to address issues of      concern down the road. However, it is imperative for rule-     making entities to stay in their jurisdictional lanes. We      need to reject these harmful midnight privacy regulations      that serve only to empower bureaucrats and hurt consumers.

The Senator states here: ``Privacy is also a cornerstone of consumer protection, with Federal enforcement agencies striking an appropriate balance between innovation and security in their regulations. But just as a flawed line of code can render a new firewall program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk crashing our longstanding privacy-protection regime.''

For decades, the hardworking men and women of Peoria were proud to have Bob Michel fighting for them in the United States House of And even though we were from opposite parties, I learned a lot from Bob Michel, who had been a friend of my family for decades.  Like a lot of men and women from his era, Bob Michel believed in America to his core. He believed in the midwestern values that have made our heartland a great place to live, work, and raise a family. Hard work, service, community, and working together to achieve a common good, these are the values that Bob Michel lived by.  Bob Michel could have gone into business and become a wealthy man. He could have left Peoria for a big city. He could have done anything he set his sights on. But what Bob Michel did was he decided to give back to the community that had given him so much, and he gave a life of service.  It was in 1956 that Bob Michel ran and won his seat representing Peoria and several communities across central Even though he went to Washington, Bob Michel's heart was always in He never lost sight of his profound responsibility to the people that he served. For nearly 40 years, he rose through the ranks of Republican leadership to become the longest serving minority leader in our Nation's history.  Even though I might not have agreed with him on every single vote that he cast, Bob Michel proved that you can disagree without being disagreeable. Over the last several days, I have heard from Members from both sides of the aisle about their memories of Leader Michel, and there are several things that we can all agree on.  First, if Bob Michel gave you his word, you could always count on it.  Second, if you had a good idea, whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, if it helped the families that he represented, you could count on his support.  And finally, if he didn't agree with you on something, well, you could probably count on a fight, but not a fight like we think of it today, certainly not the kind of divisive, personal, and negative partisan battles that have become far too common in  Bob Michel didn't believe in something like that. He believed in healthy debate, grounded in mutual respect for both sides of the aisle; because, when it gets down to it, all of us are here with the intent of bettering the families that we serve, bettering the communities that we represent, and, of course, bettering our That is what Bob Michel stood for, and it is why we as a nation come together tonight to mourn his loss.

2332,topic-id,2406,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 116 provides for consideration of two joint resolutions designed to protect working families by blocking harmful regulations through the Congressional Review Act process.  In 1974, Congress passed and President Gerald Ford signed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or This legislation, which has broad and bipartisan support, sets standards for employer-provided retirement plans to protect the workers of the United States of This regulatory framework for employer-provided retirement plans has been largely successful at helping working families save for retirement over the last 40 years.  Unfortunately, in the waning days of his administration, President Obama put forward regulations to uproot this system that has worked for decades. The Obama administration's rules would pave the way for government-run IRAs--for bureaucrat-run IRAs--managed by States and certain municipalities. Employees in several States would be forced to automatically enroll in these government- and bureaucrat-run IRAs that are not subject to the important protections established by  In other words, in the waning days of the Obama administration, they sought to take back from workers the protections that were given to them when ERISA was passed 40 years ago. Let me say that again. Workers' ERISA protections will be out the window for those people in these government- and bureaucrat-run plans.  These regulations remove important protections for American workers as they relate to their retirement plans. American consumers would be directly hurt by this regulation were it to go forward.  Just as bad, workers would have less control over their retirement savings. Withdrawals or roll-over investments to a private-sector account could be restricted and even penalized.  These regulations would create disincentives for small businesses to offer their retirement plans and invest in their employees' retirement, resulting in fewer options for workers. Instead, smaller employers will likely simply shift their employees on to these government- and bureaucrat-run plans.  These regulations could also create a confusing patchwork of rules that vary State to State or, even worse, city to city. This confusion would directly hurt the consumer.  Another concern with pushing people on to government- and bureaucrat-run retirement plans is that taxpayers would end up footing the bill. We have seen how poorly managed many State and city pension plans have been all over this country. If these government-run IRAs are also mismanaged, taxpayers may be asked to pay and to honor the government's promises.  Ultimately, these regulations are simply another attempt to exert control over the American people with a ``government knows best'' policy.  Mr.Speaker, the American people are not children that need direction from their parents. They should not be forced by the heavy hand of the government and faceless bureaucrats to obtain certain plans the government[[Page H1140]]likes that they may not need or want. People are free today to decide whether they want their IRAs or not. This will put them in a position where they can be forced to have them whether they want them or not.  We have seen the problems caused when the government tries to tell the American people what to do or what the government thinks is best for them. These types of heavy-handed policies simply do not work and they are counter to the principles our country was founded on.  So these two bills would use the Congressional Review Act process to block these anti-consumer regulations from taking effect. By passing these two bills, we will protect working families, we will support our Nation's small businesses, and we will be shielding the taxpayers from potential liabilities.  As I pointed out last week on this floor, just because we pass these bills using the CRA does not mean we cannot continue working toward solutions that improve our Nation's retirement programs. Just as the CRA gives Congress power to block regulations, the legislative branch can also give agencies further instructions and directions if a regulation is needed at some point in the future.  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find solutions to help Americans save for their retirement. Attempting to use the regulatory pen to skate around ERISA and its important protections is just not the right answer.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this rule and these pro-consumer bills and protect American families, workers, and their retirement plans.  I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1230  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, we are less than 2 months into 2017, and today we have another closed rule, or as I call them, ``Putin rules.'' This is how they operate in Russia--no deliberation. It is simply astonishing that here in the people's House we continue to have this closed process: no amendments, no debate, no nothing, completely shut down.  I have very serious concerns about the road we are traveling down. The 115th Congress is only 6 weeks old, and we have already ushered in a process that is alarmingly restrictive. It should distress not just Democrats, but Republicans as well. This is now the norm and is very, very sad.  Mr.Speaker, today's rule would pave the way for the House to repeal two important consumer protections that help working families save for retirement. These protections went through a very lengthy process of review. We are repealing these protections without the committees of jurisdiction having any chance to weigh in and in a rushed process that is completely closed.  These protections, as I said, were reviewed by the relevant agencies; they were subjected to public commentary; and we are bringing them to the floor to repeal them without even giving the committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to actually discuss these bills, to discuss whether this makes sense.  Mr.Speaker, America is facing a retirement savings crisis, and rules like this--I should say, protections like this--are essential to helping workers plan for the future. As of today, 55 million Americans lack access to a way to save for retirement out of their regular paycheck. As a result, nearly half of all workers have no retirement assets. Yet we know that employees are 15 times more likely to save just by having access to a workplace retirement plan. These programs are a commonsense solution for working families and small businesses.  Republicans should be working to strengthen programs like these, not rip them apart. If you have a problem and you want to make a tweak, maybe you ought to work with the agency to make that tweak, but not an outright repeal.  Quite frankly, Mr.Speaker, pushing dangerous bills like this in a closed process with no debate is a lousy way to conduct the people's business. But with the avalanche of alternative facts coming out of the Trump White House every day, it should be no surprise that the House Republican majority on Capitol Hill is carrying on in such a heavy-handed way. God forbid, in the people's House, we should actually deliberate and have debate and have the kind of give-and-take that the American people expect.  Mr.Speaker, as bad as this process is, as bad as dismantling the rules and regulations put in place to protect the savings of working families is, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about something that is very serious and troubling to the American people.  Mr.Speaker, this administration regularly goes on TV and appears before the press--and let me say this as plainly as I can--and consistently spouts falsehoods. Now, I am told, Mr.Speaker, that under the rules and precedents of the House that there are certain things that cannot be said. Mr.Speaker, as a member of the Rules Committee and as somebody who respects the precedents of the House, I am going to be very polite in how I respond here today. I will speak plainly, but politely. I want people to understand that I would like to say things much stronger based on what is happening in this country and based on what is happening in this administration.  Mr.Speaker, I certainly wouldn't want to do anything to hurt anybody's feelings, but it is troubling what is happening, the falsehoods and fabrications that we hear each and every day. Some of it is trivial and some of it is silly, like saying that his inaugural crowd size was bigger than President Obama's. Who cares?  But some are more sinister and more dangerous, like the claim that 3 million to 5 million ``illegal aliens'' voted for his opponent in the 2016 Presidential election. Every fact checker, every Secretary of State, both Republicans and Democrats, say this is absolutely false. There is no basis for this falsehood. It undermines confidence in our political system. My fear is that the real purpose of this claim is to put in place policies to restrict voter rights in order to make it more difficult for people to vote in this country.  Mr.Speaker, every day it feels like President Trump and his White House are trying to set a new record in terms of misinformation. There are so many falsehoods coming out of this White House, it makes me nostalgic for  President Trump, in a meeting with U.Senators last week, repeated another falsehood, that he only lost New Hampshire because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bussed to the State to vote illegally. This is simply not true. There is no basis for this statement. This is similar to the President's fabrication that 3 million to 5 million votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election. Plain and simple, President Trump and his White House staff continue to provide zero evidence to back up their claims of voter fraud.  On Sunday, when top White House aide Stephen Miller was asked about the judiciary challenging President Trump's unconstitutional Muslim ban, he aggressively attacked critics and said that ``the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.'' The powers of the President will not be questioned. I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that.  President Trump might talk a lot about his love for Vladimir Putin, but this is not This is the United States of We have checks and balances to stop authoritarianism. Kellyanne Conway, when she is not giving free commercials for the Trump family business on the taxpayers's dime, is making up stories about the Bowling Green massacre, a terrorist attack which never happened, and spouting alternative facts on a daily basis. The latest falsehood from the Trump White House is one of the most serious yet.  In repeated interviews, both Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn--I should be saying now, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn--said that Flynn did not speak with Russian officials about U.sanctions before President Trump took office. A new report shows that that is blatantly false.[[Page H1141]]  After the U.intelligence community overwhelmingly agreed that Russia had actively meddled in our 2016 Presidential election to tip the result in favor of Donald Trump, President Obama announced strong sanctions against Russia, including expelling 35 Russian diplomats or agents from U.soil. When Vladimir Putin responded by saying that they would not expel any U.officials in Russia--what many expected he would not do--a lot of red flags were raised. A new report now shows that, in the 24 hours that followed, Michael Flynn communicated with Russian Government officials about the sanctions and may have actively undermined U.foreign policy weeks before Donald Trump even took the oath of office. And now we know that last month the Justice Department informed the White House of Flynn's deception of the Vice President and of the American people in the days immediately following the inauguration.  Mr.Speaker, this is outrageous, and the fact that President Trump did not immediately fire Michael Flynn as soon as this came to light is stunning. I guess he was too concerned about crowd size rather than a deeply compromised national security adviser.  Mr.Speaker, getting rid of Flynn is not enough. President Trump must stop the blatant and dangerous falsehoods coming from his White We need a full and independent and bipartisan investigation not only under the purview of the intelligence committees; we need to have a full investigation out in the open so the American people actually know what happened and know how many others were involved in Flynn's undermining of our national security.  Who knew what when?  Was Donald Trump aware of these unauthorized talks with Russia while President Obama was enforcing sanctions?  The American people deserve the truth. They deserve transparency. They deserve this Congress to actually do proper oversight.  One of the most troubling parts of all this is that the American people would have been completely in the dark if it were not for the hardworking journalists and patriotic U.officials who helped bring this outrageous scandal to light. Now, more than ever, we need to support freedom of the press, to hold President Trump and his White House accountable.  The Republicans in Congress need to start doing their job by exercising the strong oversight needed. President Trump needs to know that he answers to the American people and he and no President is above the law.  Mr.Speaker, America's hardworking families deserve a Congress that puts them first and a President and a White House that tells the truth instead of spreading falsehoods to stir up fear and advance a dangerous and extreme agenda. We can have policy disagreements, but you have to tell the truth. You can't just make stuff up.  As we are seeing with this administration, alternative facts are contagious. The White House is rapidly losing the public's trust, and every day that Congress fails to hold the Trump White House accountable, we are losing the public's trust as well.  Members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have a responsibility to stand up for the truth and hold the President and his White House accountable. We are here to serve the American people, and they need to know that we are fighting for them, not serving as a rubber stamp for this administration.

2333,topic-id,1837,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman from Massachusetts' remarks. We are not here today to talk about Russia, but I do remember about a month ago when we were on this floor counting electoral college votes, my colleague from Massachusetts objected to the Electoral College votes from my home State of Alabama because of Russian interference.  I want to put his mind at rest. As a Representative of Alabama, I think I can say with complete confidence that the Russians had no influence over the Presidential vote in the State of Alabama last We get our electoral information like most people in America do: from watching FOX News or something like that.  But in the fall, in Alabama, we are also paying real close attention to college football. So far from letting Russian influence have anything to do with our vote in Alabama, we were doing what most people in America were doing and paying close attention to college football. We gave no more credence to what the Russians think about our political votes in Alabama than we do to what they think about our college football teams.  But let's get back to the substance of his remarks. He says that there is no debate. This rule provides for at least 2 hours of debate, perhaps more if we get into motions to recommit. And the truth of the matter is, under the Congressional Review Act, the actual form of these laws are prescribed by statute. We have no control over what can be in them. We can either vote for them or against them. And we are going to have clear debate--over 2 hours, maybe more--whether we are going to vote for or against it.  There are people who are going to vote for them, and there are people who are going to vote against them, and people are going to have reasons for doing each. That is standard order here in the I think the American people would agree, on these sorts of fundamental things when you know what is simply in them, that is plenty of debate.  He calls these regulations that we seek to overturn ``consumer protections.'' But remember what I said earlier: They take these employer plans, these IRA plans that are forced by the government, they take them out from the protections of They take consumer protection away from the people that have these plans. So far from being consumer protection regulations, they are anticonsumer protection regulations. They are antiworker.  So what is really going on here is this is not some effort--or was some effort by the Obama administration--to protect workers. It is an effort to try to get government more involved in people's lives, and the people of America don't want the government more involved in their lives.  The gentleman mentioned that there are 55 million people in America today who don't have a retirement plan. Every one of those 55 million people have access, if they choose to get it, to an Anybody can set up an You don't need your employer to set it up for you. You sure don't need the government to set it up for you. There are plenty of people around the country that will help you set it up, and it is pretty easy, pretty simple.  Maybe some of these people, or a lot of these people that don't have them, don't want them. So why would the government come in and tell them you have got to have them unless your real interest here is in empowering government and not protecting consumers? I will leave it to you to make the decision what the real motive was here.                              {time}  1245  Now, the gentleman talked about the fact that these come to us without going through the committees of jurisdiction; but, as I said earlier, because the form of these bills are prescribed by statute, there is really nothing for the committees of jurisdiction to do. But he will be glad to know that I am informed that, after we come back from the Presidents Day week break, there will be a number of bills coming to the floor that will have, in fact, gone through the committees of jurisdiction, including bills, I predict, that will both repeal and replace the Affordable Care So there is going to be plenty of things coming through regular order to this floor.  But as we go through the Congressional Review Act process, we are pretty constrained in what we can say and not say in these bills, and we are simply following that which is prescribed by statute. As I said earlier, we can all decide, based upon that statutorily prescribed form for what we do, whether we are for it or we are against it, whether we want to force workers in America to get some government-forced type IRA and take them out from the protections of ERISA, or[[Page H1142]]whether we want to let them have their freedom and keep the protections of  We want to keep freedom for the American people. We want to keep freedom for the American workers, and we sure want them to keep the protections they have had for over 40 years under ERISA and not take those protections away from them so that we can force something down their throat from some government-bureaucrat-run plan.  Getting back to what we are here to talk about today, we are here to reverse ill-considered regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration that hurt the American workers. By adopting this rule and by adopting these two pieces of legislation, we protect the American workers. I hope all of us are here to do exactly that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The gentleman is correct, I did rise to object to certifying the electoral college vote. Part of it was because I was appalled by the unprecedented Russian interference in our election system. I would urge the gentleman to read--maybe he doesn't want to read the classified version of the report--the unclassified version of the report. It is pretty outrageous. That is why so many of us have been calling for an independent bipartisan commission to investigate this.  But the other reason why I objected was because of voter suppression. I would say to the gentleman that that is an equally serious issue, that there is still voter suppression in the United States of America, and it is something that we need to deal with. I worry very much under the Republican majority and under this White House that we are going to see more of an effort to restrict people's right to vote.  Now, the gentleman is trying to paint a rosy picture about what we are doing here. I mean, we have had 13 closed rules, 6 structured rules, zero modified open rules, zero open rules. By the end of this week, we will be a third of the way to breaking the record for the Republicans' most closed Congress in the history of the United States, and we are still in My friends have outdone themselves in terms of closing up this process, of shutting people out from participation.  The fact of the matter is, as I mentioned, these protections that the Republicans want to repeal went through a long process, lots of review within the agencies, lots of public commentary, a long time to develop these protections. Now, if the Republicans aren't happy with it, one of the things they might do is they could bring up these rules in the form of legislation where we could have an open process, and people can amend and add and change and do whatever they want to do to make it better, if that is what they want to do.  But that is not what they are interested in. It is all about a press release. This is mindless legislating. When committees of jurisdiction do not do their job, do not hold hearings, do not do markups, and all of a sudden the Rules Committee just reports something out and sends it to the floor under a closed rule, that is mindless legislating. By the way, I am on the Rules I don't think that we have yet had a single bill come before the Rules Committee that went through committee. I am happy I am on the Rules At least you see a little action going on, but I feel bad if you are on any of these other committees.  This is a lousy way to do business, and I am shocked that my Republican friends come to the floor and defend the indefensible. This is not the way this House should be run. This is the kind of process, as I said at the opening, you would expect to see in Russia, not here in the United States Different ideas should be debated. People ought to have an opportunity to have their voices be heard. But yet here, in this House of Representatives--which will break records in terms of being the most restrictive Congress, I think, in history--the name of the game is to try to shut people out. I think that is wrong. I think my Republican friends should be ashamed of the way they are conducting themselves in this This is not right.  I just point that out because I think it is important for people to note that, by the end of this week, my Republican friends will be a third of the way to breaking their own record for the most restrictive Congress in history, with the most closed rules. That is something that I don't think anyone should be proud of. But it is the new norm here: shut everything down, shut everybody out. I think that results in bad legislation and, again, mindless legislating like we are doing here today.  Mr.Speaker, we are all deeply concerned, as I mentioned in my opening statement, with the reports from our intelligence community regarding potential foreign interference in our most recent election. Everybody should be. Mr.Speaker, I am going to ask people to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Swalwell's and Representative Cummings' bill which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate foreign interference in our 2016 election. With the revelations about General Flynn coming to light, and all that we know about his dealings with the Russians, this is extremely timely.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, to discuss our proposal, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr.Swalwell).  ",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1139-2.txt,2197,1415,2017.0,14.0,February
2334,topic-id,1391,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, when I was a young lawyer, an old lawyer one time gave me a piece of advice that I was fortunate to never have to follow. He said: Son, when you are strong on the facts, pound on the facts. When you are strong on the law, pound on the law. If you are weak on the facts and the law, pound on the table.  What we just heard is pounding on the table about Russia, and that has nothing to do with the two bills that are covered by this rule. Nothing in the bills that underlie this rule has anything to do with But because there is not a good argument against the rule, there is not a good argument against these bills, we are pulling up something else and pounding on the table. Let's get back to the rule and the underlying legislation.  This legislation will reverse two regulations that hurt working people in America, period, end of sentence. Far from being a press release, as my colleague from Massachusetts talked about, this bill is going to pass not only this House, it is going to pass the Senate, and, yes, it is going to be signed by the President of the United Two of the Congressional Review Act bills that have already come through this House have passed the Senate and, I am told, are going to be signed by the President this week. These aren't press releases. These aren't messaging bills. These are pieces of legislation that are going to become law and protect American workers after an attempt by the Obama administration, as it is going out the door, an attempt by them to take ERISA rights away from American workers through a regulation. I would think everybody in this body would be outraged, after 40 years of bipartisan support for ERISA, that we would think it is okay for anybody to take away workers' ERISA rights. It is not.  What we are doing today is the right thing to do, not if you are for Big But if you are for the American worker, this is the right thing to do. Rather than pound on the table, let's work together, pass this rule, pass this underlying legislation, and do the right thing for the American worker.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1300  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, there is one similarity with Russia and what we are doing here today, and that is the process. This is completely closed. This is totally undemocratic. There is no opportunity for amendment. There is no opportunity for different opinions to be presented here. So, again, this process is deeply flawed.  Again, my friends on the other side of the aisle may want to defend it, but I will tell you this is unprecedented. With the number of closed rules that we have seen, you are going to break all records.  My Republican friends also have the distinction of presiding over the most closed Congress in history. This will outdo that because they are moving in such a restrictive and closed way. This is not right.  The idea that we are going to repeal protections with an up-or-down vote without having the committees of jurisdiction even do a hearing, even to weigh the very points of view on this, to bring these bills to the floor like this in a way that would not allow people to improve these protections is outrageous. But this is the new norm here. Everything is shut down.  And the gentleman is right that the previous question maybe is a little bit off subject from the two underlying bills here, but as the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a tool used to set the House's agenda and to prioritize consideration of legislation.  For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this Because the fact of the matter is, if we offer amendments to the Rules Committee by a 9-4 vote, we are turned down. We are shut out all the time.  So this is our only opportunity to be able to bring some of our priorities before our fellow Members in the House and to be able to let the American people know that some of us in this House are horrified by Russian interference in our election. It is unprecedented what they did. Anybody who sat through any of the briefings or even read the unclassified report, I don't know how you could not be horrified by the deliberate attempt to impact our elections.  And yet, we can't even get oversight in this The wagons have all circled around the You can't do anything that will make him uncomfortable. Well, the fact of the matter is this is about more than making a President of the United States uncomfortable. This is about defending our electoral system, defending our democracy.  And the gentleman from California, in arguing in favor of voting ``no'' on the previous question so we can bring up a bill that would allow there to be an independent bipartisan investigation of Russian interference on our election I think is even more important, given what we know about what happened with General Many of us said, when he was being considered for the top national security spot in the White House, that this was a bad choice. Why? Well, because this is a guy who regularly peddled in conspiracy theories, whacky conspiracy theories.  Members of the intelligence community, members of our Defense Department regularly said, when he was being considered, that this was a bad choice. My Republican friends said nothing. Now we realize just how bad a choice this was and how bad the President's judgment was in allowing a man like this to be elevated to such a high position in the White  There are serious questions that need to be answered here. I would say to my colleagues, rather than trying to dodge and rather than trying to hide and rather than trying to frustrate attempts to get to the truth, there ought to be a bipartisan effort, similar to the 9/11 Commission, where people come together and, in an open, transparent way so the American people know what is going on, are able to get to the truth. That is what we are trying to do here. We have no other means to be able to get our views heard--certainly not in the Rules Every amendment we offer is turned down.  So I would say to my colleagues, vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let us be able to bring up the Swalwell-Cummings bill and have a vote on it. If you don't want to do an investigation, then vote ``no.'' But this is important and, I would argue, more important than the underlying bills, given what we are faced with. This is serious business, and it is about time my friends on the other side of the aisle treated it as serious business.  I will just close, Mr.Speaker, by saying that I have served here now for 20 years, and I have gotten to know some of the finest people in this Chamber, both Democrats and I know there are a lot of Republicans who believe, as we do on the Democratic side, that we need to find out[[Page H1144]]what happened and we need to get to the truth. We don't want to see more attempts to block investigations.  I hope that those Republicans would join with us and vote ``no'' on the previous question because, if you vote ``no,'' we get to bring this up, we get to vote on it, and we still get to vote on the underlying legislation. This doesn't slow anything down; this doesn't stop anything; but it allows us, at this very important moment, to be able to debate something that I know a lot of people in this country are very concerned about.  Mr.Speaker, again, vote `no' on the previous question, and vote ``no'' on this closed, restrictive Putin rule.  I yield back the balance of my time.

2335,topic-id,1260,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr.McGovern) that this is, indeed, serious business. Looking out for the workers of America is perhaps the most serious business that we do.  We have heard a lot of speechifying about trying to do the right thing for the average person in On the way out the door, the Obama administration promulgated two regulations that attempt to force government-tight retirement on people when they don't want it and take away their consumer protection rights under That is very serious business.  But instead of having a debate about that, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to switch the subject to something else because they don't want to have to defend the indefensible. These two regulations that these two CRA bills would reverse would take away protections for American workers.  This debate is not closed. I completely disagree with that assertion. We had a full debate on this yesterday afternoon in the Rules We devoted an hour of debate to it right now. Of course, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to chew up most of their time, instead of talking about this rule and the underlying legislation, talking about something else; but that is their right if that is what they want to do.  If they had some serious debate that they wanted to have on this rule and the underlying legislation, we wouldn't be talking about We would be talking about these bills. We would be talking about these regulations.  If this rule is adopted, we will have at least 2 hours of debate here on the floor on the bills themselves, and perhaps more if there is a motion to recommit. There is plenty of debate here. There is plenty of time to decide that you are for the American workers and protecting their consumer protection rights under ERISA or you are against American workers--either/or. It doesn't have anything to do with It has nothing to do with the Presidential election. It has everything to do with whether you stand with the workers of America or not.  I stand with the workers of I think the vast majority of the people in this body want to stand with the workers of If they do, I hope that they will vote for this rule and vote for the underlying legislation so that we can reverse these two regulations.  Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support H.116 and the underlying joint resolutions.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 116 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 All points of order      against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour      equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on Foreign After      general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment      under the five-minute rule. All points of order against      provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall      rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as      may have been adopted. The previous question shall be      considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to      final passage without intervening motion except one motion to      recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of      the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution      on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House      shall, immediately after the third daily order of business      under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the      Whole for further consideration of the bill.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

I am referring, of course,to the Constitution, the instrument that, in but a short time, President-elect Donald Trump will take an oath to preserve,protect, and defend.  Our Founding Fathers could not have been clearer that any Federal office holder of the United States must never be put in aposition where he or she could be influenced by a foreign governmental actor. It was a concern made explicit by AlexanderHamilton's writings in Federalist 22, in which he noted examples of republics that had been ruthlessly dismembered by theirhostile neighbors who had paralyzed the victim republic by bribing its officers and officials.  The Founding Fathers addressed this grave concern by placing the Emoluments Clause within the Constitution as an explicitbar on foreign corruption and interference. Article I, section 9, clause 8 of the United States Constitution declaresthat:       No title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States:      And no Person holding any Officeof Profit or Trust under      them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of      any present, Emolument, Office, or Title,of any kind      whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign  Longstanding precedent has made it plain that the President of the United States, as the head of the executive branch of thegovernment, clearly occupies an ``office of profit or trust''. As such, the Emoluments Clause clearly applies to and constrainswhomever holds the office of the  Past American presidents have recognized the danger of foreign corruption and interference, or merely the perception ofcorruption and interference, and have accordingly taken great pains to avoid even the appearance of impropriety with regard totheir personal wealth and investments, ensuring that such investments never interfere with performing their duties as Presidentof the United Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and George Bush allhad their assets placed into blind trust while they were To fulfill his promises of greater government transparency,President Obama went even further and invested the vast majority of his funds in U.Treasury bonds.  The President-elect has claimed he will ``absolutely sever'' his ties to the Trump Organization, which has financialinterests around the world and negotiates and concludes transactions with foreign states, as well as entities that areextensions of foreign states. We have a constitutional duty to ensure that he does. It is easy to imagine circumstances in whicha foreign government will want to give President Trump a personal gift through his businesses with the intent to curry favorwith him and seek to influence his decisions in ways that benefit them, instead of the American people--precisely the danger ourFounding Fathers sought to protect against with the Emoluments  This is not an esoteric argument about rules that do not affect real people. Put simply, the American public has a right toknow that the President of the United States is always acting in their best interest, and not take the risk that his actions areinfluenced by some benefit or gift from a foreign government like Russia or The citizens of this country need to knowthat when the President of the United States is making decisions about potential trade agreements, sending troops into war, orspending America's great resources, those actions are motivated by the public interest, and not because they might advance orharm[[Page S64]]the President's private pecuniary interests.  We should be concerned when the President-elect is connected to an organization that has dealings with countries andentities that are not interested in distinguishing between doing business with President Trump and the profit-makingorganization that bears his name. The President-elect's failure thus far to dispose of his business interests in a comprehensivefashion has left this door wide open, and we are already seeing indications that foreign companies and businesses are beginningto take advantage. Kuwait's National Day event, which has traditionally been held at the Four Seasons in Washington, D.C., wasmoved to the Trump International Hotel, allegedly because of pressure--or perhaps merely a suggestion--from the President-elect'sassociates. Similarly, Bahrain has chosen to schedule an event to take place at the Trump International  News reports suggest that one day after a phone call between President-elect Trump and the President of Argentina, permitsunder review for the Trump building in Buenos Aires were suddenly approved. In China, just days after the presidential election,Donald Trump scored a legal victory in a decade-long trademark dispute over the right to use the Trump name for real estateagent services in commercial and residential properties in The timing of these actions is interesting, to put it mildly.  I sincerely regret the necessity of reintroducing this resolution. Just after Thanksgiving, when President-elect Trump helda press conference to state that on December 15, 2016, he would make an announcement about his future with the TrumpOrganization, I publicly said how encouraged I was to see the President-elect's positive response. When I first introduced thisresolution, my intent was to create an opportunity for the President-elect to act and remove this as an issue, so that he couldput aside any appearance of impropriety and devote himself to good work on behalf of the American people. That is why I wasdisappointed when Mr.Trump abruptly canceled his December 15 announcement--and, as of today, he has not yet rescheduled it. Thisissue is far too critical to kick the can down the road, or to ignore, before an incipient violation of the Constitution becomesan actual violation.  Even before Mr.Trump's cancellation of his December 15 announcement, I was deeply concerned by statements he and hislawyers made with regard to the disposition of his numerous business interests. Mr.Trump's lawyers had initially announced thatthe Trump Organization would be placed into a ``blind trust'' managed by Donald Trump's older children. That arrangement is,unfortunately, by its terms the complete opposite of an actual blind trust. An actual blind trust is an arrangement which theofficial has no control over, will receive no communications about, and will have no knowledge of the identity of the specificassets being held, and in which the trust's manager operates independently of the owner.  Around the same time President-elect Trump cancelled his December 15th announcement, he tweeted another idea for dispositionof his businesses, stating that ``[t]wo of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will bedone during my term(s) in office''. Let me be absolutely clear: the arrangement tweeted by Mr.Trump is not sufficient and ishardly independent. Mr.Trump would be well-aware of the specific assets held, and he could receive communications about andtake actions to affect the value of those assets. The idea that President-elect Trump's children, who are listed as members ofhis transition team and have already been present at meetings or phone calls with foreign leaders, can ever be truly``independent managers'' is simply not a credible resolution of this concern.  This inadequate suggested arrangement is not a blind trust and will not ensure compliance with the Emoluments Clause of theUnited States Indeed, numerous legal and constitutional experts, including Richard Painter, a former adviser toGeorge Bush, have made clear that such an arrangement will leave the President-elect with a personal financial interest inbusinesses that collect foreign government payments and benefits. The notion that the American people should be satisfied by anunbinding promise that no new deals will be pursued--a promise that does notdefine what constitutes a ``deal'' and which can be reneged on at any time--does not pass the laugh test.  I must admit, I have also been quite disturbed and disappointed by the recent excuses and suggestions by surrogate speakersand supporters of the President-elect as to why no action need be taken and, indeed, by statements the President-elect has madehimself. President-elect Trump has tweeted, [p]rior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties allover the world.'' This is undoubtedly true. But the American people, in voting for a candidate, cannot--and, in fact, wouldnot--want to excuse a potential future violation of the Constitution by that candidate. Indeed, I would say that President-electTrump has this idea backwards. Prior to the election, he was well aware of the fact that he had interests in unique propertiesall over the world. Since the President-elect has referred to himself as ``a constitutionalist,'' he must have known of theimportance of complying with the Constitution by severing his foreign business connections in advance of his inauguration, whichmakes his continued failure and delay on this front all the more inexplicable.  On November 22nd, President-elect Trump stated, ``The law's totally on my side, meaning, the president can't have a conflictof interest.'' This regrettable statement selectively picks facts and shows a troubling disregard for the Constitution and forthe duties owed to the American people. While the President, Vice President, Members of Congress, and Federal judges may begranted specific, limited exemptions from conflicts of interest so that they may act and carry out their duties, that law doesnot supersede the Constitution nor, frankly, have anything to do with the very specific provisions of the Emoluments Clause,which are intended to prevent foreign governmental financial influence over the  Even as some of the President-elect's most trusted surrogates have acknowledged that the potential ethics challenges facingPresident-elect Trump are ``a very real problem,'' they have persisted in arguing that Mr.Trump is somehow exempt fromconstitutional strictures, and even from the temptation of corruption itself, by virtue of his great wealth. For example, formerSpeaker Gingrich has claimed ``that this is a new situation we've never seen before, and the rules [that] were written forpeople who were dramatically less successful literally do not work,'' while Mr.Trump's leading candidate to head theadministration's Council of Economic Advisors has claimed that ``[w]ealthy folks have no need to steal or engage incorruption.'' Really? That is a transparently false idea that one does not have to look very far to disprove. We need onlyglance at the countries where the Trump Organization has done business--places like Russia, Azerbaijan, Argentina, and Nigeria--tofind numerous examples of already-wealthy government officials who have used their positions to lie, cheat, extort, and furtherenrich themselves and their families at the expense of the people they are supposed to be serving.  It was the enduring wisdom of our Founders to recognize that America is not magically immune from the corruption problems inother countries, and that not all men are angels. This is why we place our trust in the Constitution, not in individuals. A manwith more wealth and extensive foreign holdings than prior presidents is, by an order of magnitude, more vulnerable to foreigncorruption and interference than any president before him. The Emoluments Clause has greater bearing on Mr.Trump's presidencythan his predecessors, not less.  No man can gain such wealth and power that he outgrows the limits of our John Adams said it best: ``We are agovernment of laws, and not of men.'' No matter our political or partisan sympathies, we all recognize that the Constitution isthe law of the land, and that when the needs and ambitions of any man conflicts with the Constitution, the Constitution must winout.  It has also been suggested by some of Donald Trump's supporters that the[[Page S65]]Emoluments Clause does not actually apply tothe office of the Not only does this conflict with longstanding understanding of the Emoluments Clause in theExecutive Branch, it contravenes both the strict interpretation of the plain words of the Constitution, as well as thetraditional values and practices adopted by previous presidents.  To get around the ethics challenges facing Mr.Trump, it has been suggested by the President-elect's supporters that a panelof five ``experts'' regularly monitor the Trump Organization businesses and tell the President ``don't go over these bounds''.It has even been suggested that the President-elect can simply sidestep ethics issues that clearly violate the law by pardoningadvisors ``if anyone finds them to have behaved against the rules''. These 'ideas' are non-starters that cut dangerously againstthe plain intent of the Emoluments I am afraid they show a disregard for the values of our  The solution to this problem is simple, not complex, and is set forth by my resolution: President-elect Trump has only tofollow the precedents established by prior presidents and convert his assets to simple, conflict-free holdings; adopt blindtrusts managed by truly independent trustees with no relationship to Mr.Trump or his businesses; or to take other, equivalentmeasures. This solution also has the benefit of having been successfully implemented by every modem president before Mr. This resolution and its aims should not be viewed through the distorting prism of politics. I want the Trump administrationto have the support from Congress to succeed on behalf of the American people. Nevertheless, I believe that Congress has aninstitutional, constitutional obligation to ensure that the President of the United States, whoever that person may be, does notviolate our Constitution, acts lawfully, and is discharging the obligations of the office based on the broad interests of theAmerican people and not his or her own narrow, personal interests.  Despite the late hour--just days before the inauguration--it is still possible for President-elect Trump to live up to thevalues of the Constitution, give the American people the transparency they deserve, and completely sever his relationship withthe Trump Organization before he takes the oath of office on January 20, 2017. To do so would avoid a constitutional crisis thatwould not serve the best interests of the President, Congress, or the American people.

2160,topic-id,483,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.  Mr.Chairman, there can be no doubt that this legislation is an assault on the civil justice system. By effectively banning class actions, H.985 would give wrongdoers a permission slip to avoid public scrutiny or liability for their unlawful conduct. Worse still, this legislation also contains the text of the so-called FACT Act, which is designed to delay justice for asbestos victims and deny accountability for corporate defendants.  As the ranking member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee that exercises jurisdiction over this bill, I am strongly opposed to this dangerous and offensive measure.  For decades, medical experts have closely linked asbestos exposure with mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer, and other forms of lung disease. Asbestos manufacturers have also known about the deadly effects of asbestos exposure; but, as a Federal judge noted in 1991, there is compelling evidence that these companies sought to conceal this information from workers and the general public. Instead of sharing this critical information, which could have saved countless lives through exposure prevention, asbestos companies ``continued to manufacture one of the most widely used asbestos products without informing workers or the public,'' as the nonprofit Environmental Working Group has reported.  Real examples of this widespread corporate deception are legion, but one in particular stands out. In 1966, the senior executive of a corporation that currently operates as a subsidiary of Honeywell wrote that, if asbestos victims ``enjoyed a good life while working with asbestos products, why not die from it.''  In the wake of numerous lawsuits related to asbestos-related deaths, Congress amended the bankruptcy code in 1994 to authorize the use of trusts for the settlement of asbestos liability.  In 2001, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office conducted an exhaustive study of these trusts but did not find a single example of fraudulent conduct. Despite this finding, proponents of H.985 now make the outrageous and totally unsupported claim that victims of asbestos exposure have committed fraud--more alternative facts.  In the name of what they describe as transparency, the bill would force trusts to publicly disclose asbestos victims' sensitive personal information, including their names, partial Social Security numbers, and the like. Beyond the obvious consequences these requirements would have in the form of hacking and identity theft, this information is already available to relevant parties on a confidential basis through the discovery process, as both the GAO and the RAND Corporation have reported.  I agree with the majority that asbestos trusts must be accountable and transparent to both present and future claimants, but there is no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing or any fraud. This legislation would only make it easier for wrongdoers to get away with harming others and to make it harder for Americans to be compensated for these injuries.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.985.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,2055,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,9.0,March

During his more than 7 years of service, Secretary Mabus has also demonstrated an unwavering commitment to building our naval fleet and supporting America's shipbuilding industrial base. He has put 84 ships under contract across the country, more than the last three Navy secretaries combined, and invested significantly in our aging shipbuilding infrastructure.  Secretary Mabus's focus on increasing shipbuilding has allowed the men and women at Bath Iron Works, BIW, to continue building high-quality destroyers, which are the workhorses of our To allow the Navy to operate these ships to their fullest potential while remaining mindful of the budget constraints faced by our military, Secretary Mabus supported energy initiatives to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. His focus on power-saving technologies, like diesel-electric plants in new ships, has reduced the Navy and Marine Corps' fuel expenses by 30 percent.  In Maine, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, PNSY, has received approximately $100 million in modernization funds since 2009, enabling it to maintain its status as the gold standard for public naval shipyards and further[[Page S110]]hone its efficiency and effectiveness in submarine repair.  While advancing these reforms, Secretary Mabus visited Navy and Marine Corps installations across the globe, traveling over 1.3 million miles to over 150 countries and territories and all 50 When measured in distance, Secretary Mabus has travelled to the moon and back almost three times. In 2009, he and I visited the hard-working men and women at BIW and PNSY together.

In addition, Secretary Mabus's leadership in 2010 on the Gulf Coast's long-term recovery plan following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was exemplary. His work securing the future of the Gulf Coast made Americans and certainly his home State of Mississippi proud.

Secretary Mabus has also taken steps to support career flexibility, continuing education, and family well-being for all members of the Navy and Marine He worked to ensure that all those who serve in uniform are provided the mental health care they need and deserve.

2197,topic-id,2494,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which would exempt H.985's unnecessary and burdensome class action provisions all class actions asserting civil rights claims.  Class actions are an important litigation tool that consumers, workers, and anyone else who has suffered injury can use to vindicate their rights. They are also a critical mechanism for enforcing public policy and are especially key in the enforcement of Federal civil rights laws.  For instance, plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases who seek backpay because of an adverse employment decision often pursue class actions because such cases tend to be the kind that are well-suited for class treatment. These cases typically concern multiple victims who were subjected to the same discriminatory employment practice or policy.  While damages awarded pursuant to a single plaintiff may not be large enough to deter the employer's alleged wrongdoing, aggregate damages awarded to plaintiffs as a result of class action would have a deterrent effect.  Unfortunately, this bill, H.985, requires class action plaintiffs to prove at the certification stage that every potential class member suffered the same type and same scope of injury, a requirement that is obviously virtually impossible and cost prohibitive to meet.  This onerous requirement would effectively deter employment discrimination and other civil rights plaintiffs from proceeding with any class action.  As if this provision were not onerous enough, H.985 would also harm civil rights plaintiffs by making it virtually impossible to pursue class actions pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil  All Federal appeals courts interpret that provision as allowing courts to certify a class limited to one issue in a case, such as liability, without having to certify a putative class for the entire cause of action.  Allowing courts to decide common questions within a case, while permitting other issues to be determined on an individual basis, would promote judicial efficiency, which is also one of the principal benefits of class actions.  H.985, however, would prohibit certification of such ``issue'' class actions unless the putative class for the entire cause of action is certified, which would only further delay and possibly deny justice for plaintiffs.  This provision would have a particularly devastating impact on civil rights class actions that often can only be maintained as to particular issues, such as liability.  Indeed, for these, and many other reasons, including the bill's mandatory appeals provision, its automatic stay of discovery, and its draconian and unworkable standards for setting attorneys' fees, 123 civil rights groups and organizations have written a letter to the Judiciary Committee in strong opposition to H.985, which I include in the Record.[[Page H1989]]                                                    March 7, 2017.     Re Strong Opposition to H.985--Section 2.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We understand that the      House will soon consider H.985, the ``Fairness in Class      Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency      Act of 2015.'' The 123 signatory civil rights organizations      and advocates write to strongly oppose Section 2 of H.985.      The bill will undermine the enforcement of this nation's      civil rights laws and upend decades of settled class action      law. This sweeping and poorly drafted legislation will create      needless chaos in the courts without actually solving any      demonstrated problem. In this letter, we highlight the most      egregious of its many harms.       As advocates for the marginalized and often invisible      members of our society, we write to remind House members that      class actions are critical for the enforcement of laws      prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education,      and access to public areas and services. As the Supreme Court      has recognized, class actions provide ``vindication of the      rights of groups of people who individually would be without      effective strength to bring their opponents into court at      all.'' Amchem Products, v. Windsor, 521 U.591, 617      (1997). Courts have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure, the federal class action rule, over      decades and the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules has,      through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended the      rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation. No further      revisions are needed at this time.    H.985 Adds Years of Additional Delay, Expense, and Disruption       One of the stated purposes of the bill is to ``assure . . .      prompt recoveries,'' yet it includes provisions that will      extend the duration of cases by years and add exponentially      to the expense on both sides.       The bill allows for an automatic appeal--in the middle of      every case--of the class certification order. Such appeals      are extraordinarily disruptive and typically add one to three      years to the life of the case. While the case sits in an      appellate court, expenses and fees rise, memories fade, and      injured victims remain without justice. Automatic appeals of      all class certification orders will clog our already-taxed      Courts of Appeals of class certification rulings are      already permitted at the discretion of the Courts of      An appeal of every class certification ruling is unnecessary.       The bill similarly builds in an automatic stay of discovery      in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any      one of a list of motions. This is an invitation for      gamesmanship and delay, and will deprive judges of the      ability to properly manage their cases.       The bill, by its terms, applies to all cases pending upon      the date of enactment. This means that hundreds of cases that      have been litigated and certified under existing law would      start from scratch with new standards, new class      certification motions, and new automatic interlocutory      appeals. The resulting waste of judicial resources would be      enormous. Civil Rights Injuries Are Never Identical and Are Already Subject to                         Rigorous Judicial Review       H.985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class      certification. It requires that the proponents of the class      demonstrate that ``each class member has suffered the same      type and scope of injury.'' At this early stage of a civil      rights class action, it is frequently impossible to identify      all of the victims or the precise nature of each of their      injuries.       But even if this information were knowable, class members'      injuries would not be ``the same.'' As a simple example,      those overcharged for rent will have different injuries. In      an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a      class member's injuries will depend on a range of factors,      including their job position, tenure, employment status,      salary, and length of exposure to the discriminatory      conditions. For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the      Supreme Court developed a two-stage process for such cases in      International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.324,      371-72 (1977). In the first stage, the court determines      whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of      discrimination. If the employer is found liable, the court      holds individual hearings to determine the relief (if any)      for each victim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the      use of the Teamsters model for discrimination class actions      in part because of the individualized nature of injuries.      Wal-Mart Stores, v. Dukes, 564 U.338, 366 (2011).      Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four      decades ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to      seek effective relief.       For the same reason, the bill's limitation on ``issue      classes'' will impede the enforcement of civil rights laws.      Under current practice, the district court will decide in      some cases that the best approach is to resolve the      illegality of a discriminatory practice in an initial      proceeding, and then allow class members to pursue individual      remedies on their own. In such cases, class certification for      the core question of liability (often a complex proceeding)      will be tried and resolved just once for the benefit of the      many affected individuals. These issue classes can promote      both efficiency and fairness. Section 1720, however, would      deprive courts of this ability that they currently have to      manage class actions to ensure justice.   Requiring the Early Identification of Class Members Is Unnecessary       Section 1718 seeks to impose a heightened standard for      identifying class members, an approach that has been rejected      by the majority of circuits to have considered the question.      This stringent standard would not further any interest that      is not already adequately protected by Rule 23, which      requires that the court consider whether the case is      manageable and the class action device is the ``superior''      method for fairly and efficiently resolving the case.       Moreover, 1718 would impose a nearly insurmountable      hurdle in situations where a class action is the only viable      way to pursue valid but low-value claims. In such cases,      records of who has been affected may have been destroyed by      the wrongdoer, may be incomplete, or may have never existed      at all. In those cases, individual notice to all class      members may be impossible. But, without class certification      in these situations, class members who have valid claims and      who can be identified would not be allowed to recover. The      bill also ignores the important objective of deterring and      punishing wrongdoing, and encourages defendants not to      maintain relevant records.Arbitrary and Unworkable Standards for Attorneys' Fees Undermine Civil                            Rights Enforcement       Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms      that benefit the most vulnerable. In many cases, the sole      remedy is an injunction to change illegal laws or practices.      To ensure that non-profit legal organizations and other      advocates are able to undertake these important, complex, and      often risky cases, dozens of our civil rights laws      incorporate fee-shifting provisions. If a case is successful,      the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon the time that      the advocates have spent working on the case. This method of      determining attorneys' fees provides for consistent and      predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a      lawsuit.       H.985 would entirely displace this well-settled law with      a standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable.      Under the bill, attorneys' fees would be calculated as a      ``percentage of the value of the equitable relief.''      1718(b)(3). But how is a judge to determine the cash      value of an integrated school, a well-operating foster care      system, the deinstitutionalization of individuals with      disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable relief      secured by civil rights class actions? Asking judges to      assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible task and      would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.       Non-profit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long      and expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated      under this incoherent and capricious standard. Indeed, the      bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the      litigation so as to make it economically impossible for      plaintiffs' attorneys to continue to prosecute the      litigation.       These serious issues warrant, at a minimum, careful      consideration and public hearings. A rush to pass such far-     reaching and flawed legislation will deny access to justice      for many and undermine the rule of law.

2618,topic-id,475,"Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.7, the so-called ``No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017.''  The Majority marks the 44th anniversary of Roe v. Wade this week with its latest attempt to undo that decision's unequivocal recognition of a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose to terminate a pregnancy.  We must recognize this bill for what it really is. H.7 is yet another attack by the Majority on women's health, a goal it accomplishes in several respects.  To begin with, H.7 would make it virtually impossible for a woman to obtain abortion services even when paid for with purely private, non-Federal funds.  It achieves this end by denying Affordable Care Act tax credits to income-eligible women and small business employers who choose insurance coverage that includes abortion.  Through its novel tax penalty provisions, H.7 departs radically from existing law, taking away women's existing health care and placing their health and lives at risk.  Despite the claims of its sponsors, H.7 does not merely codify current law, but, rather, goes well beyond it to deny women basic health care services.  Moreover, to the extent it bans federal funding of abortion services, H.7 is unnecessary, because such funding is already banned by the Hyde Amendment, and the Affordable Care Act maintains that ban.  For more than 30 years, Congress has prohibited federal funding of abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, through the Hyde Amendment and similar measures in annual appropriations bills.  Nothing in the Affordable Care Act changes this. That Act does not permit federal funding of abortion, and ensures that only private funds can be used to purchase abortion insurance coverage.  There is absolutely no risk that public money will be used to pay for abortion services.  So what is H.7 really about? Plain and simple, it is part of the Majority's relentless war against women's health and constitutional freedoms.  Members should understand that a vote for H.7 is not a vote to codify existing law. It is, instead, a vote to attack women's health and equality.  Finally, we should reject H.7's permanent restriction on the District of Columbia's use of local funds that Congress has approved.  H.7 not only infringes women's constitutional rights, but also intrudes deeply into local government decision-making by the  Women and families who live in the District should not be singled out for additional harm simply because of where they live.  Last Congress, the Obama Administration ``strongly oppose[d]'' a substantially similar bill, saying the legislation ``would intrude on women's reproductive freedom and access to health care; increase the financial burden on many Americans; [and] unnecessarily restrict the private insurance choices that consumers have today.''  I agree wholeheartedly with that analysis and, accordingly, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous bill.

Kuwait requires continued support for equipment already      procured to ensure national security interests and objectives      are met. The defense articles maintained are used solely by      the Ministry of Defense to protect the sovereign border and      to conduct operations and training to include joint exercises      with the U.military. Kuwait will be able to absorb this      additional equipment and support into its armed forces.       The proposed sale of equipment and support will not alter      the basic military balance in the region.       The U.companies potentially involved in the sale are      Boeing, Mesa, AZ; Longbow Limited, Orlando, FL/Owego, NY      (Joint Venture between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman);      Lockheed Martin, Orlando, FL; and DynCorp International, Fort      Worth, There are no known offset agreements for the sale.       Implementation of this proposed sale will require the      assignment of four (4) U.Government representatives and      sixty-five (65) contractor representatives in country for up      to five year.

Protecting this industry, which contributes $985 billion to our economy, from international and naturally occurring biological events is critical not only to the stability of our national economy, but also to the security of our national food supply and our human health.  This bill would clarify the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs as they relate to the DHS' responsibilities under the Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9, entitled: ``The Defense of U.Agriculture and Food.''

He was a loving husband, father, and grandfather. He dedicated much of his life to public service.  No matter whether you were a good friend or you hardly knew Joe, he had a way of making everyone feel important and special.  In 1968, he started a 26-year career at the Fresno Economic Opportunities After 2 years of serving as the director of the Fresno County Head Start, Joe was promoted to serve as the executive director for Fresno During his tenure at the Fresno EOC, he established 35 new programs, with a budget starting at $1.8 million, growing it to $37 million.  With the help of over 670 employees in the Fresno EOC, he was able to implement so many important programs, such as the Women, Infants, and Children program, otherwise known as WIC; opened the first rural health clinic in Fresno County; and started Meals on Wheels programs for seniors.  But he didn't stop there. Joe was a doer. He created a sanctuary program for homeless youth, which was established and later named in his honor upon Joe's retirement. Under his leadership, the Fresno EOC became a model for similar programs around the Nation, one of the truly outstanding leaders in terms of community action agencies in the country. Joe made that happen.  In 1977, he became the first African American elected to the Fresno City He served two terms and was always an advocate for what was best for the entire city. He said: You know, you've got to feel it in your gut; and if it's there, you do it.  He was a civil rights leader in our San Joaquin Valley and throughout the State and the Nation, encouraging others to do the right thing.  My thoughts and prayers are with Joe's wife, Laura; their children, Michael and his wife, Sonya, Winston, and Terri; his brother, George; his grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews.  My colleagues, I ask you to join me in paying tribute to the life and times of Joe He will be remembered in a selfless way in which he lived his life, always looking to help those in the community who needed help.  As Emerson once said: ``To have a friend is first to be a friend.''  Thank you, Joe, for being my friend and being the friend of our community. I join his family in honoring his life and love and service to our country, and he will be greatly missed.

We either had the last 6 years of some of the driest conditions we have experienced in over 1,000 or, in the last 2 months, record rain and snow in the mountains and, thus, floods that we are experiencing.  This last weekend I joined on an official tour of Merced County with Sheriff In Le Grand, this weekend we had 25 homes in my district that were evacuated.  I commend the collaboration between the Merced County officials, the California Office of Emergency Services, and FEMA for rightly declaring a state of emergency for the flooding that is happening and may continue with new storms coming.  My thoughts are with the people in Butte, and Sutter and Yuba The emergency spillway that could be compromised at Oroville Dam is something that we are all concerned about; 200,000 people, as we know, have been evacuated from their homes.

Additionally, we must invest in California's infrastructure needs. Its water infrastructure needs to fix a broken water system. The President has proposed a significant massive infrastructure program, $1 trillion. That could be used not only in California, but throughout the entire country.  We need additional water storage in order to prevent devastating flood conditions as we are having now, and also to store that water so we can have it during the dry conditions. So two things go hand in hand.  There are another series of storms expected later this week, and we still have about 2 months left of our winter season. Therefore, we need all hands on deck. We are using every tool available to reduce the potential flood and damage and accidents that are there, but we must invest to fix this broken water system.  The President's proposal will allow us to provide additional surface storage supply to not only protect against flooding, but also to store that water so that when we have the dry periods in California, we can use that water for our crops and for the people who need it the most.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1132.txt,1774,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,14.0,January

It is important because we are seeing a rise, quite frankly, of anti-Semitism not only around the world, but right here in the United It takes different forms in different places, but, in[[Page H1237]]the end, has the same result of targeting and hurting one of the historically most vulnerable groups in our world: the Jewish people.  One of the things that has been the most concerning to me is the minimizing of the suffering of the Jewish people during the Frankly, it is really outright disturbing--I don't know if that does it justice--that the White House of the United States of America, the home of our President, our present administration, representing the same country that defeated Nazi Germany, the same country that bore the Greatest Generation, the same country that led the fight against anti-Semitism worldwide, while recognizing from time to time it had to douse it here in the United States, our country, this same White House that I referred to deliberately refused to mention that the Holocaust was designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Not a single mention of the Final The Final Solution was to obliterate, eliminate the Jewish people off the face of the  Yes, many people died in the Holocaust, as the gentlewoman made reference to so eloquently--disturbingly, but eloquently. Of the tens of millions of people who died, we know of them historically, but no race or religion was designated for elimination like the Jewish people were. The Final Solution was about ridding the Jewish people from the face of the It is that simple. It is imperative that this moment does not pass without some clarity.  What is clear is that the White House purposely removed the reference. They are proud of it. They doubled down. They tripled down. They removed the reference to the Jewish people in its statement on International Holocaust Remembrance  Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it feeds the extremists. We know they exist. Let's face it, extremists have welcomed this White House statement. They love it, they glorify it, not just theoretically, but literally. Literally, White supremacists have welcomed the White House decision to leave any mention of the Jewish people out of the Holocaust remembrance.  Secondly, it matters because a lot of people in the world today either don't know that the Holocaust happened or don't believe that the Holocaust happened--not just theoretically, but literally don't believe that the Holocaust took place.  Literally, a 2014 global survey of anti-Semitic attitudes found that 35 percent of people around the world have never heard about the Maybe you can understand that. But an additional 32 percent, more importantly, believe it is a myth or greatly exaggerated.  Thirdly, it matters because there are many Holocaust survivors--I know them and their descendents--in the United States and throughout the world.  The actions behind the statement were just downright cruel and inhumane to them, not just theoretically, but literally cruel and inhumane.  Literally, groups that are dedicated to this issue are deeply, deeply disturbed. The Anne Frank Center and others have raised their voices.  This is not just coming from I don't want to mislead here at all. There are a range of Republican leaders--and there are four of them--and Republican groups that have expressed their anger at the White House position on the Holocaust, but one entity. We will come back to this House in a moment.  The White House hasn't seemed to have heard their outcry, but the gentlewoman from Ohio and I, the Democratic Caucus, we have heard.  What has taken place is wrong; simply wrong. You would think that the President would correct the situation. In fact, today, he had the opportunity to condemn anti-Semitism at his press conference with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and he didn't do it. In fact, when he was asked on this very subject of the failure to mention the Jewish people of the Holocaust, he used the opportunity not to clarify his position, but to make reference to how great his election victory was.  In watching that press conference, as disturbed as I was about the answer from our President, I was more than a bit disappointed, quite frankly, by Prime Minister Netanyahu's failure to challenge the President on that. I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu would have asked President Trump to change his statement; not to whitewash what was done, but to change his statement on the I still hope that the Prime Minister does that in the time that he is here.  So this Special Order tonight will help us set the record straight, not just on behalf of the millions of Jewish Americans across this country, but to send a clear message to all those who engage in this type of behavior.  I ask this question: Where are our Republican colleagues on this issue?  Do you hear that?  We have given them opportunity after opportunity to speak out against what the White House has done, but our Republican colleagues refuse to criticize the White House for the omission of the Jewish people in the Holocaust resolution.  Could you imagine for a moment what the outcry would have been had President Obama accidentally omitted this, putting aside purposely omitting it, but the outcry if he had accidentally omitted the mentioning of the Jewish people in his annual statement?

2174,topic-id,371,"Mr.Chairman, the right to choose one's own counsel is a basic right in our democracy. This is a right that is a foundation of a fair and impartial judicial system.  Having the right to choose one's own attorney ensures that a person can hire an attorney who will best represent their interests and protect their rights in the judicial process.  H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, undermines this basic right by requiring a court to deny any class action certification based solely on a proposed class representative or named plaintiff being represented by a family member. The bill provides no discretion to the court and no exceptions.  The bill uses an expansive definition that includes not only immediate family members, but extended parts of a family tree by blood and marriage. Such a broad definition is an unfair restriction on the right to an attorney of one's own choosing.  Previously, the manager's amendment modified this provision but did not relieve these concerns. Such broad, blanket assumptions about family relationships fail to recognize the importance of trust and expertise into the attorney-client relationship.  In many instances, a family member will best represent their interests in court or could have specialized training and experience relevant to the case, yet the language in this bill does not provide for any discretion or any exceptions.  The fact that a lawyer representing a potential class is a family member of a named class member does not, in itself, create a conflict of interest; and under current law, there is a process for courts to address real conflicts of interest when they arise.  Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 23(g), courts have an extensive list that must be satisfied when appointing counsel to represent a class. There also already is a strong disincentive against conflicts through fairness hearings after settlement is reached. Any potential conflict of interest risks spoiling the agreement and wasting the efforts of counsel and the class.  Removing the discretion of the courts is overly broad and will remove access to appropriate counsel where no conflict exists. I urge strong support for my amendment and the removal of this provision from this bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.

2180,topic-id,599,"Mr.Chairman, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and other rights enumerated in the Constitution have an intrinsic value that cannot be adequately expressed in dollars and cents. When a person's constitutional rights are violated, they cannot be made whole entirely with money, and yet the bill that we have before us today would require our judicial system to hang a price tag on our most cherished constitutional rights.  Under H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act, if a ``judgment or proposed settlement in a class action provides for equitable relief, the portion of any attorney's fee award to class counsel that is attributed to the equitable relief shall be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of the equitable relief, including any injunctive relief.''  Mr.Chairman, when a court grants such relief, it is not awarding money to a plaintiff. In these cases, the courts are stepping in to say this is a violation of constitutional rights and it must stop.  My amendment would strike the provision in this bill that would devalue our fundamental rights by requiring a highly subjective and wasteful, costly, and demeaning process of putting a price tag on these rights. Worse, it would deter attorneys from bringing critical civil lawsuits that reform systemic and widespread violations of individual rights.  When we think of class actions, we usually imagine a group of people seeking money to compensate them for an injury or a harm--a toxic spill, a horrific accident, an Erin Brockovich-type story. But the reality is that there are many class actions that do not seek monetary damages but are fighting to right a systemic wrong in our society.  These class actions have made lasting changes to our legal system and society that have moved our country closer to equality and justice, landmark class actions such as: Brown v. Board of Education, ending separate but equal as a basis for racial segregation in our schools; Allen v. State Board of Elections, finding that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires preclearance of any changes in voting practices; and Alexander v. Holmes County School District, requiring immediate integration of the schools. In these cases, plaintiffs asked the courts to protect and preserve their constitutional rights for themselves and others in similar situations in the future.  Under the system set forward by H.985, a court would have to also set a dollar value to the judgment. How do you place a price tag on desegregating our Nation's public schools? How do you place a price tag on protecting the right to vote? How do you put a price tag on preserving the Constitution's Sixth Amendment right to counsel? How do you put a price tag on the fundamental right of marriage? It is not possible. These are fundamental, constitutional rights, and these rights are priceless.  If this bill were to become law, courts and civil cases would become bogged down in ancillary litigation aimed at establishing the value of rights, rights that are protected through equitable and injunctive relief. It would be a mess, and we don't have to make this unforced error.  I oppose the underlying bill, but it is my sincere hope that, if the House is going to pass it, the least that we can do is remove this provision from the bill and end this insulting pretense that the courts or anyone else can put a dollar value on our constitutional freedoms.  I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,1976,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,9.0,March

I rise today in support of H.1238, the Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, introduced by Congressman David Young of This bill seeks to authorize the Department of Homeland Security's food, agriculture, and veterinary defense program within the Office of Health  Last year, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications held a hearing to examine the potential devastating impacts of an intentional attack on, or a natural disruption of, U.agricultural or food production systems.  The food and agriculture sector is critically important to our Nation's economy. U.food and agriculture accounts for roughly one-fifth of the Nation's economic activity, and contributed $835 billion to the U.gross domestic product in 2014, and is responsible for 1 out of every 12 U.jobs.  Coming from Iowa and as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Congressman Young of Iowa knows all too well the importance of protecting this sector, which is vital to the economy and our way of life. I appreciate him introducing this bill of which I am pleased to be an original cosponsor.

2311,topic-id,389,"Mr.Speaker, I do quite agree with what Mr.Capuano just shared, but I will say this: for anybody listening to this broadcast today, this is a classic fight of the big money against the many. The big money, they say that they want even more money, so they want to be able to dig into your private information so that they can figure out when you get up, when you go to bed, what you looked up, and then write ads just so they could try to sell you more stuff.  And as disgusting as that is, you can see easily how that is not the end of it. What if you have somebody who has something really sensitive that they just want a little bit more information about, that is not of a nature where it is saleable, but it is just their business? Well, somebody else is going to know now. And they may well be able to monetize it, gather it, and distribute it.  It is outrageous what the majority is doing today, and I can't possibly believe that it is conservative, that it is small government. I can't believe that they believe that this is what a government in restraint should do. The government should be protecting our rights, protecting our privacy. Small government means that the individual ought to be protected from the big powers out there, like the corporate interests, yet the majority is handing us over to them at this very hour.  Mr.Speaker, I urge Members of the majority to vote against this. I can't believe that a person who is a constitutional conservative would ever vote for a monstrosity like this. It is beyond my comprehension that a conservative libertarian would say: oh, yeah, give the individuals' information over to the big commercial interests. This is one of those moments.

2759,topic-id,1053,"Mr.President, the repeal resolution we have been debating in the Senate this week will complete the firststep toward reducing the Federal Government's role that has prevented Americans from pursuing affordable and accessible healthcare that meets their needs without emptying their wallets. After we complete our repeal work, the Senate can then vigorouslypursue putting the Nation on a more responsible and sustainable fiscal path and address government's out-of-control spending anda mammoth national debt when we begin our work on the fiscal year 2018 budget.  I thank my colleagues for their considerationand cooperation for bringing us to this point, and I thank Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his leadership in pushingthe Senate to take the first steps to repair the Nation's broken health care system and to remove Washington from the equationin order to put control of health care back where it belongs: with the patients and their families and their doctors.  Thiscommitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative process is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of theAmerican people.  Thanks, as well, are due to many Members on this side who came and spoke on the resolution's behalf, whoworked with us and each other to move through the resolution, the debate, the amendments, the votes, the whole process.  Ihave enjoyed my partnership with Senator Sanders as we took on new roles as the top Republican and Democrat on the SenateBudget Committee last We have known each other a long time, and we have served on some of the same Senate committees.I believe he and my colleagues across the aisle share the same goal of establishing a robust and affordable health care systemfor hard-working families. I truly hope that they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more choices and lowercosts in the weeks and months ahead.  Also, I would like to focus for a moment on some of the staff who helped lead us here.  I thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee, including my acting staff director, DanKowalski; the director of the budget review and acting deputy staff director, Matt Giroux; the chief counsel, George Everly;senior budget analysts Peter Warren and Steve Robinson; budget analysts Greg D'Angelo, Tom Bork, Becky Cole, David Ditch andSusan Eckerly; and assistant counsels Clint Brown and Thomas Fuller; outreach director Jim Neill; editor Elizabeth Keys; policyassistant Kelsie Wendelberger; and communications director Joe  As well, thanks are due to my personal officestaff, especially my chief of staff, Tara Shaw; my legislative director, Landon Stropko; my health care policy staff, ElizabethSchwartz, Alec Hinojosa, and Chris Lydon; as well as the entire Wyoming team.  I want to pay specific attention to thankingTara Shaw, who is my chief[[Page S273]]of staff. She has been filling a dual role for some time. She was my legislative director. Wehave filled that position now. But she has been acting as the assistant here on the floor as well and done a tremendous job ofmanipulating and coordinating both centers of action.  Now, we have also been supported by the great work of our leadership,floor, and cloakroom staff. I thank them for their continued good work and dedication to this institution and the country as awhole. In particular, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Jane Lee, and Scott Raab in the leader's office, andMonica Popp, John Caphuis, and Emily Kirlin in the whip's office, and very especially Laura Dove and Robert Duncan in thecloakroom.  These folks, as well as my budget team, worked hours over the holiday break to ensure our success. Without alltheir work, we would not be here this evening standing on the verge of passing the Senate's repeal resolution that will set thestage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in whichthose with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage.  This will allow us to move step by step on a new set ofreforms, listening carefully to the advice of the millions of Americans who are affected, a step we left out when we did itpreviously. Or, as Senator Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and PensionsCommittee put it, the ObamaCare bridge is collapsing, and we are sending in a rescue team. Then we will build several newbridges to get better health care. Finally, when those bridges are finished, we will close the old bridge.  After 5 days ofconsideration, many hours of debate, and numerous amendments reviewed and voted on, this part of the process can now beconcluded. With that, I ask for the continued support and discussion on this valuable issue. If people have ideas for what oughtto be included, I hope they will talk to us about them. I hope the American people will talk to us about the ideas they thinkneed to be included.  There has been a lot of fearmongering, a lot of supposition about what will happen at the next stage.There were amendments that were put in about the next stage. Those, of course, wound up being nongermane. But we have our workcut out for us. We do have to come through now with a system that will solve the problems for the American people.  Imentioned before that when we started the whole debate on ObamaCare, there were 30 million people uninsured. Today, there are 28million people uninsured. I think that the 30 million people was probably closer to 28 million at that time. One of thedifferences is some people who could not get insurance have insurance, and a bunch of people who had insurance can't affordtheir insurance, and a bunch of people who have insurance can't afford their insurance, as you heard through the debate.  Wewant all the people who want insurance to be covered, and to be covered in such a way that they can actually get the treatment.If you have a $12,000 or $10,000 or $6,000 deductible, that may not happen.  But I thank all of the people who have worked toget us to this point. Our work is now cut out for us even more so.  I know that we can have a spirit of cooperation and workthrough this, or we can use the reconciliation process and do it with 51 votes. But it is far better if we can find commonground and common solutions and get the work done.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-11-pt1-PgS272-2.txt,1542,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,11.0,January
2299,topic-id,507,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Colorado for his leadership and for yielding time to me.  First of all, I would like to respond to the gentleman's presentation about the underlying bill.  Make no mistake about it, what the underlying bill does today is it wipes out--it totally wipes out--privacy protections for consumers on the internet. That is what it does. There are not duplicative regulations. I know that it was stated on the floor that there are duplicative regulations.  There are two agencies--the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission--however, it is only the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, that can actually protect consumers by enforcing the protections. The FTC does not have that authority.  What happens today if these privacy protections are ripped away from the American people? Well, all the information that you give to your internet service provider, whether it is Comcast, whether it is cable providers, Charter, AT&T, the one that you pay a pretty big bill to, they can take all of the information that they have--my account, your account, your account, your account--and use that information to sell it to the highest bidder to make money off of it.  Now, there is an additional charge in this thing, alleged charge, and that is,[[Page H2480]]well, what about Google and Netflix and Facebook? What about them? Why aren't they subject to what the FCC did? Well, they are edge providers. They are edge providers.  You don't have to go to You don't have to go to You don't have to go to Netflix in order to get your internet service. That is why the FCC did not apply these rules to them. Maybe there should be a debate about them. But to equalize and say that Google and Facebook are equal to your internet service provider suggests to me that some people just don't know what they are talking about.  This is a subject that the American people feel very, very deeply about. In fact, I think it is in the DNA of every American: ``I want my privacy, and it should be protected.'' We all feel that way.  What is being done today is a ripping away. It is like taking a bandage, just stripping it away. Who do you go to? Who do you go to complain to? No one. No one. Because there isn't anything left to enforce.  I think it is a sad day if the underlying bill passes. I think it is shocking that my Republican colleagues, either out of a lack of understanding of how the internet works, how their constituents--all of our constituents benefit from these protections of our privacy, and our information is private. I don't want anyone to take my information and sell it to someone and make a ton of money off of it just because they can get their mitts on it. That is why the privacy protections were adopted.

2205,topic-id,599,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017.  My amendment would exempt a claimant who is or has been living in public housing or any dwelling unit for which rental assistance was provided under the Section 8 housing program. While I firmly believe that every individual should be exempt from this outrageous provision, my amendment recognizes that we, the Federal Government, are the landlords, the owners, if you may, of public housing.  Speaker Ryan is a landlord of public housing. Our leader, the gentlewoman from California, is a landlord of public housing. The President is a tenant of public housing. The White House is public housing. While the White House has hot water, a nice roof, and likely no asbestos, it is still public housing. We, the taxpayers, pay the rent. We, as the Federal Government on both sides of the aisle, are the owners and the landlords of public housing.  As the owners of public housing, we have a unique obligation to the people living in these units. We are responsible for the dilapidated conditions of[[Page H1993]]our public housing units, and we are responsible for the health and well-being of low-income tenants living in them.  Much of our public housing was built in the 1950s and 1960s, coinciding with what was perhaps the peak time for the use of asbestos-containing products in building and construction materials. This has left thousands of our most vulnerable citizens at risk of exposure to asbestos, which has killed as many as 15,000 Americans each year.  People who have a legitimate claim and have been exposed to asbestos while living in either public housing or Section 8 housing should be afforded the due process they deserve and given the opportunity to bring their claims in a timely manner. I think this entire bill is a misnomer and should be renamed the unfairness in class action litigation act.  No one--no one--should have their due process rights delayed or denied. There is no doubt that the consequences of this legislation will be especially and uniquely detrimental to low-income individuals. This legislation will completely upend privacy and bankruptcy laws.  As it stands today, our laws guarantee that a claimant's information is protected. This bill, however, will require that an individual claimant's personal information and the amount they have received from the trust be made available on a public website. Not only is this a complete and total disregard for the individual's privacy, but it makes the most vulnerable in our society prey for financial predators.  My amendment will guarantee that tenants living in public housing and Section 8 housing are not subjected to such an outrageous shift in privacy rights. The bill sends trusts on a wild goose chase for information that may not even be there, while they should be spending their time working through the pending claims.  These companies hid the dangers of asbestos for decades, for far too long, and there is absolutely no reason why we should be helping them now. Rather than wasting time and taxpayer dollars obstructing the judicial system, we should be focusing on initiatives that will update our crumbling infrastructure. And, yes, public housing is undoubtedly infrastructure.  Finally, the CBO has indicated that, financially, this amendment will cost nothing. This amendment will cost absolutely nothing. But I can promise you that not adopting it will come at a great cost to our system of justice. I ask my colleagues to adopt this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

2150,topic-id,1049,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, recently an independent research firm surveyed companies in 26 countries and found that 80 percent of those companies that were subject to class action lawsuits were U.companies, putting those U.companies at a distinct economic disadvantage when competing with companies worldwide.  But the problem of overbroad class action doesn't just affect U.companies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced into lawsuits they don't want to be in. How do we know that? We know that because the median rate at which consumer class action members take the compensation offered in a settlement is incredibly low. That would be 0.023 percent. That is two-hundredths of a percent. That is right, only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is clear proof that vastly large numbers of class members are satisfied with the products they purchase, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a ginormous class action lawsuit.  Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action lawsuit system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those artificially inflated claims to force defendants to settle the case. Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that ``A court's decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to settle even unmeritorious claims.''  Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed by President Clinton, has explained that class certification ``is, in effect, the whole case.'' And as one appeals court judge, nominated by President Obama, wrote in his dissent in a recent class action case, ``The chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact that some of the members of the class have not suffered the . . . injury upon which this entire case is predicated and that could constitute as many as 24,000 consumers who would have no valid claim against the defendants under the state laws even if the named plaintiffs win on the merits.''  He went on to chastise the other judges who allowed the class action to proceed, writing ``if the district court does not identify a culling method to ensure that the class, by judgment, includes only members who were actually injured, this court has no business simply hoping that one will work.''  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating similar, meritorious claims, not to provide a way for lawyers to artificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger settlement fee for themselves, siphoning money away from those actually injured, and increasing prices for everyone.  Just look at an accounting of recent class action settlements. The SUBWAY food chain was sued in a class action because trial lawyers complained their foot-long subs weren't a full foot long. As part of the settlement, small amounts were paid to the 10 class representatives, but the millions of other class members received nothing; not a dime, not a sandwich. Meanwhile, the lawyers were awarded $520,000 in fees. The settlement was appealed, and during oral arguments Judge Diane Sykes remarked that ``A class action that seeks only worthless benefits for the class should be dismissed out of hand. That's what should have happened here. . . . This is a racket.''  The Coca-Cola Company was sued in a class action lawsuit involving Class members received zero dollars in the settlement. The lawyers were awarded $1.2 million in fees.  In a case involving Facebook, the company agreed to settle the case by paying class counsel $3 million. Zero dollars were paid to class members. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the deal, but in a withering dissent, Judge Kleinfeld observed that ``Facebook users who had suffered damages . . . got no money, not a nickel, from the defendants. Class counsel, on the other hand, got millions.''  This bill includes several reforms. It prevents people from being forced into a class with other uninjured or minimally injured class members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It prevents trial lawyers from using incestuous, litigation-factory arrangements to gin up lawsuits. It requires courts to use objective criteria in determining who is injured in a class action and how compensation will actually reach the victims. It requires that injured victims get paid first, before the lawyers, and that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money received by victims.  It requires judges to itemize exactly who gets what in a class action settlement and who is paying and controlling the lawyers. It requires all the rules governing class action be followed, that expensive pretrial proceedings be put on hold while the court determines if the case can't meet class certification requirements, and allows appeals of those class certification orders so justice can be done faster.  It ensures lawyers don't add plaintiffs just for forum shopping purposes, and it requires the verification of allegations in multidistrict pretrial proceedings, ensuring defendants receive due process while plaintiffs, not lawyers, get the benefits of any cost savings achieved by the multidistrict pretrial process.  H.985 also contains provisions to include much-needed transparency into the asbestos bankruptcy trust system. On too frequent an occasion, by the time asbestos victims assert their claims for compensation, the bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been diluted by fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their entitled recovery.  The reason that fraud is allowed to exist within the asbestos trust system is the excessive lack of transparency created by plaintiffs' firms. The predictable result of this reduced transparency has been a growing wave of claims and reports of fraud.  This bill strikes the proper balance of transparency and preserving the dignity and medical privacy of asbestos victims while also minimizing the administrative impact on the asbestos trusts. This bill saves the money in these trusts, which is a limited amount of money, to make sure future claimants, many of whom are veterans, have the opportunity to seek and receive compensation for their injuries and prevent double-dipping and fraud.  Please join me in supporting this bill on behalf of consumers and injured parties everywhere.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleague across the aisle that over the past several Congresses, we have had multiple hearings on class action reform and asbestos trust litigation, all of which are easily and publicly available.  I further would like to go on to say this bill doesn't prevent any claim from being brought as a class action--zero, zip, none. All it does is maximize the recovery of the victims.  Under this bill, a class action lawyer's fees are pegged to a reasonable percentage of the money actually received by the client under the settlement. What that will do is incentivize lawyers to make the maximum amount available to their clients, to seek the maximum recovery for their client.  Under this bill, class action lawyers will no longer be able to agree to settlements that give them millions of dollars and get their clients absolutely nothing, or maybe a coupon, if they are lucky.  Under this bill, a class action lawyer will get more in fees as long as they agree to a settlement that actually means that their clients, the actual plaintiffs, are getting a reasonable amount of money. Imagine that: incentivizing lawyers to do the best work for their clients. That is what this bill does.  I would also like to talk for a second about the asbestos portion of this. I have to say that this is a little troubling for me. The disclosure requirements in the FACT Act portion of this bill requires less than would be required in a State court pleading for damages. It is the minimum amount of information necessary to make sure somebody isn't double-dipping. It specifically protects medical records and social security numbers. It is designed as a fraud prevention tool.  The argument that this is designed to protect companies that manufactured asbestos is flawed. This is designed for the asbestos trust--companies that have gone bankrupt and set aside large amounts of money to be paid to the victims of asbestos. This protects the assets in those trusts, not the tortfeasor companies. We are making sure there is enough money in these trusts to pay future victims by stopping fraudulent claims today.  Mr.Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-09-pt1-PgH1974.txt,2067,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,9.0,March

This FACT Act provision is designed to protect veterans from fraud and make sure our future veterans who are exposed and other people who are exposed in their jobs to asbestos have the resources available because the company that actually made the asbestos is most likely bankrupt and out of business now.  There are finite resources in these trusts, and we owe it to our servicemembers and to future victims of asbestosis or mesothelioma to make sure there is money there to take care of their medical bills and compensate them for the injuries.

2161,topic-id,205,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am going to have to beg to differ with my colleague from across the aisle.  Fraud has been documented in news reports, State court cases, and in testimony before the Judiciary Committee.[[Page H1979]]  The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation that found thousands of dispiritedly filed claims. Court documents in many States, including Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia, attest to widespread fraud. Most recently, a bankruptcy case in North Carolina uncovered a startling number of dispiritedly filed claims.  Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony over the course of four hearings about the FACT Act, during which witnesses repeatedly testified that fraud existed within the asbestos trust bankruptcy situation. Keep in mind that the fraud reported today has been in spite of the lack of disclosure that exists.  Consistent with other multimillion-dollar compensation programs, there is fraud occurring in the asbestos trust system, and the FACT Act will go a long way to uncovering that fraud. The FACT Act is designed to provide the minimum amount of transparency necessary to prevent this fraud while protecting the personal information of those victims of asbestos.

2167,topic-id,579,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to address the fact that there have been numerous hearings on the FACT Act and the problems associated with it. There was one hearing before the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on September 9, 2011. There were three legislative hearings before the Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, one during the 112th Congress, one during the 113th Congress, and one during the 114th I am sure the gentleman's staff could have gotten him copies of those.  I also point out that the minority used these opportunities to call witnesses that were representatives of the plaintiffs' asbestos trial bar. They called the attorneys to voice their concern about the bill, not the victims. In fact, the minority called the same witness for three out of the four hearings. Now they claim that asbestos victims were never provided an opportunity to testify.  The Judiciary Committee has provided ample opportunity to include asbestos victims' views on the legislation in the record, and there are many letters and statements from victims in the record.  In closing, I do want to say--going back to the class action part of this bill for a second only--that only the tiniest fraction of consumers in class actions bother to claim the compensation awarded them in the settlement. That is clear proof that the vastly large number of class members are satisfied with the products they have purchased, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a gigantic class action lawsuit.  Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with hundreds and thousands of meritorious claims and use those artificially inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.  As I recounted, class action settlements have left lawyers with millions of dollars while victims receive absolutely nothing or a coupon, at best. The bill prevents people from being forced into class actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims actually receive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  I also want to talk a second about the FACT We hear these stories about these corporations that did all of this wrong. Many of them are bankrupt, and the only money available to the victims are the money that has been set aside in these asbestos trust funds. When an unscrupulous attorney makes a claim against multiple trusts or files claims in Federal court and State court, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find out if that claim has already been made. The FACT Act makes that easily available while providing privacy necessary to protect the victims.  The FACT Act is designed to protect the future victims and make sure there is money there for the children, for the veterans, for the hardworking Americans who are injured by asbestos but whose symptoms have not yet manifested. Sometimes these asbestos-related diseases take decades to show up, and there needs to be money there to take care of those folks. That is what this legislation is intending to do, not to protect corporations.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill that provides much-needed reform to the class action system and to the asbestos trust system.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

In fact, a judge with 29 years of bench experience testified before the Committee on the Judiciary that the FACT Act provides more protection in terms of confidentiality of records than the legal system is able to do.

2644,topic-id,535,"I thank Ranking Member Waters for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.41 and in support of the SEC rule requiring resource extraction companies to disclose payments to governments.  Historically, payment for resources is a huge source of corruption in developing countries, which, for most of us, is morally abhorrent; but what I want to talk about is the competitive advantage that we gain when we embrace the principles of the democratic rule of law, transparency, and morality that our financial system depends upon. We passed Dodd-Frank to strengthen our financial system in a time of crisis but also to make it more transparent and effective for American consumers and investors.  Section 1504 of Dodd-Frank directed the SEC to publish a rule requiring issuers to disclose the types and amounts of payments for each project and to each government annually. The provision improved disclosures made to financial regulators and to investors.[[Page H852]]  Private and public institutional investors--representing trillions of dollars invested on behalf of American families--voiced support to the SEC in favor of the rule. There are two main reasons for this support from institutional investors:  First, all investors want to be able to review payments to all governments, to assess the exposure the issuer may have to corruption risk. The SEC has jurisdiction over compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and investors need to know whether fines for potentially corrupt payments could be levied against firms in which they are considering investing.  Investors should always have the right to know material information about the firms, and systemic noncompliance with the law is always material. It should not take an event of noncompliance that has been uncovered by the regulators to inform investors when simple transparency requirements, like the annual reporting of payments, can alert them to the risk.  Secondly, some investors may simply want to stay away from investments in firms that make payments to certain governments. Many resource-rich nations in the developing world lack a democratic rule of law and are often governed by oppressive regimes that exploit their land and environment, extracting resources for their rulers' financial gain at the expense of their citizens. Investors have the right to know this information because they own the company and may feel a moral responsibility for its action.  For these two reasons, extractive payments are information crucial to an investor's analysis of an issuer's securities.  The United States equity markets are the most efficient in the world because we have strong disclosure laws and strong enforcement at the The disclosure of payments made to foreign governments is a relevant factor in valuing securities and is crucial to avoiding asymmetries in information, which can and will be exploited. These disclosures actually enable the market to police an issuer by punishing excessive payments to questionable governments with a devaluation of its equities.  In short, there are three market-based reasons to disclose payments to foreign governments:  First, these disclosures promote market integrity; second, they provide investors with crucial information for valuing securities; third, they enable investors to make ethical values-based decisions on where they allocate their resources--a right that we should be enhancing rather than eroding.

2169,topic-id,487,"Mr.Chairman, the manager's amendment makes several technical changes to the bill, none of which alter its basic policy, but all of which add clarity to the bill where necessary.  First, in the section of the bill governing conflicts of interest, this amendment strikes the prohibition on the use of the same class counsel if the named plaintiff is a present or former client or has a contractual relationship with the class counsel. In some instances, those restrictions may unduly limit the availability of class counsel or class representatives, so this amendment would remove them. It also clarifies that nothing in the conflicts of interest section of the bill applies to securities class actions, which have their own provisions for selection of class representatives and counsel elsewhere in the U.The same exemption for securities class actions is made to the stay of discovery section of the bill because, again, securities class actions have their own discovery stay provisions elsewhere in the U. Second, the amendment makes technical changes to the misjoinder section of the bill, making clear it applies only to civil actions commenced in State court and subsequently removed to Federal court, and that a Federal court can retain jurisdiction over claims that are so related to each other that they form part of the same case and controversy under Article III of the Constitution, and the plaintiff consents to the removal of the claim.  Third, the amendment extends from 30 days to 90 days the amount of time for Federal courts to review the sufficiency of the allegations verification submissions made in the section on multidistrict litigation. The amendment also makes clear that a particular case may not be tried in a multidistrict proceeding unless all parties in that particular case consent--not all parties in the entire multidistrict proceeding. And it also makes clear in the section providing that the claimant shall not receive less than 80 percent of any monetary recovery, that such section does not alter the claimant's obligations to satisfy liens on the recovery--that is, debts owed to the Federal Government or to private insurers--for medical services received by the claimant for the treatment of the injuries alleged in the litigation. So, for example, if a person took a medicine and alleges he suffered injury as a result, a Federal program may[[Page H1984]]have paid for the treatment of the injury. If the person gets a settlement of his claim, it would include money for those medical services that should be paid back to the Federal The revision makes clear that the satisfaction of such liens should come out of the 80 percent received by the claimant. The amendment also makes clear that the authorization for appeals from orders in MDL proceedings is limited to cases seeking redress for personal injury.

2176,topic-id,605,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be defeated. Abraham Lincoln left behind pages of notes on a lecture he was to give to lawyers. They say: ``Never stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually overhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon to stir up strife and put money in his pocket?''  That was Lincoln in the 1850s. Here is Forbes Magazine just a couple of years ago:       The lead plaintiff in the 5-Hour case . . . worked in      marketing for a cosmetic surgery center in But in      a grueling 5-hour deposition, she admitted she had been      recruited to serve as a plaintiff by her cousin, who worked      for a Texas lawyer; had purchased two bottles of 5-Hour      ENERGY specifically to sue the manufacturer; had never      complained to the company or sought a refund; and had signed      a backdated retainer agreement with the trial lawyer,      Rubinstein, the fellow seen here at his own deposition. . . .      Another one of Rubinstein's clients . . . admitted she had      served as a plaintiff for Rubinstein in at least four class      actions over products like Swanson pot pies and lipstick. . .      . Emails and other communications 5-Hour's lawyers uncovered      in their suit showed that Rubinstein belonged to a loose      affiliation of lawyers who ran an assembly-line process of      identifying companies to sue and then helping each other find      plaintiffs.[[Page H1985]]  Lawsuits are supposed to be initiated by truly injured plaintiffs seeking redress, not invented by lawyers who hunt for a plaintiff to assert a supposed injury made up by the lawyer.  Few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements, in large part because they don't feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place.  In too many cases, trial lawyers come up with an idea for a lawsuit and then search for a person who has bought the product, or they send a relative or employee to buy the product so they will have someone who can sue on behalf of a proposed class of all other buyers. No product purchaser has actually complained or feels cheated; it is just lawyers in pursuit of money. That is a major reason why so few class members bother to collect the payments available in class action settlements. They don't feel injured by the supposedly wrongful conduct in the first place.  This abuse of the class action lawyer-driven lawsuits must end. The base bill, therefore, requires lawyers to disclose how proposed class representatives became involved in the class action. Further, it prohibits class actions in which any proposed class representative, that is, a named plaintiff that will be representing everyone else in the class action, is a relative of or an employee of the class action lawyer.  Further clarifications making clear that this provision will not apply to present or former clients of, or those who have had any contractual relationship with, class counsel have already been made to the bill in the manager's amendment. The only prohibition that remains in the bill is the bar on class counsel using a relative or employee as a class representative. Clearly, that shouldn't be permitted.  The class representative is supposed to be representing the class interests, to independently ``be the client'' for the class, and tell counsel what to do. That independence will be gone if the class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel. This amendment should be defeated.  Mr.Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

2182,topic-id,406,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be defeated.  Insofar as a class action seeks equitable relief, that is, the nonmonetary relief, including any injunctive relief that seeks to stop the defendant from doing something wrong, the portion of any class action lawyer's fee should be limited to a reasonable percentage of the value of that relief as determined by the court.  This provision won't affect fee awards in civil rights cases because both the monetary and equitable relief attorney's fees provision in this bill are qualified with the initial phrase, ``unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.''  The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims. Consequently, this bill won't affect attorney's fees in civil rights class actions at all.  Regarding other equitable relief cases that don't involve civil rights claims, Federal courts routinely determine the value of intangible relief such[[Page H1986]]as equitable or injunctive relief for purposes of determining whether the amount in controversy requirement--currently, $75,000 to get into court--is met.  A majority of courts consider only the value of the injunctive relief from the plaintiff's perspective or viewpoint. Some courts determine the jurisdictional amount by evaluating the claim from the perspective of the party seeking Federal court jurisdiction. Others have adopted the ``either viewpoint'' rule, which allows the court to look to either the plaintiff's or the defendant's viewpoint in establishing the amount in controversy in cases seeking some form of injunctive relief.  The bottom line is that, under this bill, Federal courts will be able to use either approach in deciding the value of the injunctive relief provided to class members; and generally speaking, counsel should be paid on the basis of what lawyers actually deliver to their clients.  This base bill, of course, does not alter in any way the relief that would be granted to equitable relief class action members. It only limits the fees attorneys would receive to a reasonable percentage of the value of what the class members actually received. So all this amendment would do would be to put more money in the hands of lawyers and less in the hands of victims.

2189,topic-id,575,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, this amendment should be rejected. The discovery process--the pretrial process in a lawsuit in which trial lawyers demand documents and other things from the people they are suing--imposes huge costs on defendants, particularly because of the astronomical costs associated with the discovery of electronic information, such as emails.  Law Technology News has reported that the total cost of electronic discovery rose from $2 billion in 2006 to $2.8 billion in 2009 and estimated that the total cost would rise 10 to 15 percent annually over the next few years. In a more recent case study of Fortune 500 companies, the RAND Institute found that the median total cost for electronic discovery among participants totaled $1.8 million per case.  These costs are asymmetric. While defendants typically are subject to gigantic discovery costs, because they are large organizations possessing large amounts of data, plaintiffs have little information in their possession, and, therefore, are subject to a very small financial burden during the discovery process.  Moreover, discovery conducted before a motion to dismiss is decided is unfair. Why should defendants bear the burden of paying for discovery before a complaint is held legally sufficient, especially when the threat of huge costs may coerce an unjustified settlement?  The reality for most civil litigation is that the defendants' obligation to bear these exorbitant discovery costs incentivizes plaintiffs to serve burdensome discovery requests on defendants with zero downside risk to themselves. As professor Martin Redish has explained: ``The fact that a party's opponents will have to bear the financial burden of preparing the discovery response actually gives litigants an incentive to make discovery requests, and the bigger expense to be borne by the opponent, the bigger incentive to make the request.''  Because defendants seek to avoid these exorbitant costs, discovery is all too often used as a weapon to coerce settlement of claims regardless of their[[Page H1987]]merit. Even the Supreme Court has recognized this problem, lamenting that the threat of discovery expense will push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases before reaching trial.  For example, assume that a defendant moves to dismiss a class action because it doesn't assert any valid claims. Under current law, the named plaintiff can serve massive discovery requests that force defendants to spend $10 million to collect the requested documents. A rational decision for that defendant is to settle the case for millions, even if 4 months later the court grants the motion to dismiss, finding the class claims to be totally without merit. That is because, without a stay in discovery, the defendants will, in the meantime, have been required to spend all or part of the $10 million costs complying with the discovery requests for, it turns out, no legitimate reason. Trial lawyers pursue discovery in this circumstance primarily in an effort to pressure the defendant to settle invalid claims.  The subsection of the bill entitled ``Stay of discovery'' would stop the use of discovery to coerce unjustified settlements by requiring Federal courts to stay discovery pending resolution of rule 12 motions--that is, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim--motions to strike class allegations, motions to transfer, and other motions that would dispose of class allegations unless the court finds that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to a party.

2194,topic-id,518,"Mr.Chairman, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and should be rejected.  The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like[[Page H1988]]claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value. Exempting a subset of cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties.  Why should only the claimants covered by the amendment be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? This does a disservice to those claimants. Yet, that is exactly what this amendment would do.  Regardless of the subject matter, class action plaintiffs are increasingly inclined to include fraud claims in their complaints. If they are suing about an allegedly defective product, they will add fraud claims, alleging that the manufacturer committed fraud by not disclosing the defect. If they are suing for a breach of contract, they will add fraud allegations, saying that the defendant didn't disclose the alleged breach, and so on and so forth.  Thus, this amendment would effectively gut the entire bill, since, to avoid its important reforms, class action lawyers would simply add fraud claims to their complaints, as they are increasingly prone to do in any event.  Regarding the Volkswagen case, some opponents have urged that, if enacted, the base bill would have prevented the filing of the class actions related to the Volkswagen diesel emission controversy. Those assertions are false.  This bill's injury provision would be readily satisfied in the VW cases, as class members presumably would argue that they have been injured by their purchase of vehicles with noncompliant emission systems.  Further, if the scope or type of injury differed among class members, separate class actions could be filed for each group, as actually occurred with respect to differing models in the Volkswagen MDL proceeding.  The bill's requirement about class representative disclosures would be easily satisfied. Many class members are interested in the litigation and presumably ready to serve as conflict-free class representatives who would not run afoul of these provisions.  The bill's ascertainability provisions would pose no obstacles because vehicle registration records would provide reliable class member lists and counsel could easily demonstrate a method to get any relief to class members.  Requiring that payment of counsel fees await distribution of class benefits and that fees reflect a reasonable percentage of benefits actually received by class members would not impede bringing such cases.  The cases would be litigated without resort to issues classes. Disclosure of any third-party litigation funding of the class actions wouldn't preclude such cases. The provision doesn't prohibit such funding. Only disclosure is required. Staying discovery while motions to dismiss are pending also poses no roadblock.

2199,topic-id,586,"Mr.Chairman, with great deference and respect to my friend and colleague, the ranking member, this amendment would subject certain class members to unfair treatment and, thus, should be rejected.  First, the bill's provisions on type and scope of injury only apply to proposed classes ``seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss.'' Insofar as civil rights cases do not seek money damages, they are completely unaffected by the bill and would proceed just as they do today.  However, if money damages are sought by a proposed class, then, of course, they should be subject to the procedures in the bill. The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of evaluating like claims, not to provide a means of artificially inflating the size of a class to extort a larger settlement value.  Exempting a subset of money damage cases from the bill, as this amendment would do, would serve only to incentivize the creation of artificially large classes to extort larger and unfair settlements from innocent parties for the purpose of disproportionately awarding uninjured parties.  Any claims seeking monetary relief for personal injury or economic loss should be grouped in classes in which those who are the most injured receive the most compensation. Why should civil rights claimants seeking money damages be subject to particularly unfair treatment by being allowed to be forced into a class action with other uninjured or minimally injured members, only to see their own compensation reduced? That does a disservice to those claimants. Yes, that is exactly what this amendment would do.  Further, the bill's provision on attorneys' fees won't affect fee awards in civil rights cases at all because both the monetary and equitable relief attorneys' fees provision in the bill are qualified with the initial phrase ``unless otherwise specified by Federal statute.''  The Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act of 1976 allows a court, in its discretion, to award reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs to a prevailing party in Federal civil rights lawsuits, including cases brought under 28 U.S.section 1983, the statute most commonly used to assert civil rights claims.  Consequently, this bill will not affect attorneys' fees in civil rights class actions at all, including, of course, cases brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has its own attorneys' fees provision.  The conflicts of interest provision reflects a valid concern in all class actions. The courts need to know how the named plaintiffs came to be involved in class actions in all types of cases to ensure there aren't conflicts and that the due process rights of all class members are protected.  The issues class provision won't disrupt the manner in which civil rights cases are normally litigated. Discovery stays while dispositive motions are pending won't disrupt civil rights cases. Like any other case, the plaintiffs need to show they have a facially valid complaint before discovery should commence.  Disclosure of third-party funding is no less important in civil rights cases than in other class actions. The appeals provision benefits both plaintiffs and defendants, giving either side the right to appeal if class certification is granted or denied.  I urge all my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which would set back the just causes of civil rights claimants.

2574,topic-id,429,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her ardent work on this important cause.  However stark Americans' differences of opinion can be on the matter of abortion generally, there has been long, bipartisan agreement that Federal taxpayer funds should not be used to destroy innocent life.  The Hyde amendment, named for its chief sponsor, former House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, has prohibited the Federal funding of abortions since 1976 when it passed the House and Senate that was composed overwhelmingly of Democratic members. It has been renewed each appropriations cycle with few changes for[[Page H636]]over 40 years, supported by Congresses controlled by both parties and Presidents from both parties. It is probably the most bipartisan, pro-life proposal sustained over a longer period of time than any other. It is time the Hyde amendment was codified in the U. H.7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, sponsored by Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey, would do just that. It would codify the two core principles of the Hyde amendment throughout the operations of the Federal Government; namely, a ban on Federal funding for abortions and a ban on the use of Federal funds for health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion.  As hundreds of thousands of people from across the country come to Washington to express their love of unborn children at the annual March for Life and as we now have a President who supports this legislation, let's reflect on what could be accomplished if the bill we consider today were signed into law.  During the time the Hyde amendment has been in place, the most reliable estimates--and those of the Congressional Budget Office--are that millions of innocent children and their mothers have been spared the horrors of abortion. Millions of lives have been saved. And of those millions of lives saved, many more have grown up to bear their own children and to raise them in happy, loving families.  This bill is more than a proposed law. It is a celebration of the lives of those millions of Americans--boys and girls, men and women of all races--who give joy and feel love and create and contribute all because of the policies this bill contains. And even more than that, this bill is a welcome sign for millions and millions more Americans to come.  I congratulate the President for already reinstating the Mexico City policy, which prohibits the Federal funding of abortions overseas. And I look forward to his signing this bill into law to codify the same policy here in  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH633-3.txt,446,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,24.0,January
2694,topic-id,889,"Mr.President, this week is Sunshine Week, an annual nationwide celebration of the good that comes from peeling back the curtains on government. Sunshine Week coincides with the National Freedom of Information Day and President James Madison's birthday, both of which occur on March 16.  James Madison understood the value of an informed citizenry as a necessary check against those in power. We shouldn't forget his call for the people to ``arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''  More recently in our Nation's history, Justice Brandeis declared, ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.''  These sentiments hold true to this day. A government that operates in darkness--and a public that's kept in the dark--sows the seeds of waste, fraud, and abuse.  In the face of secrecy and obstruction, the public has a vital weapon: the Freedom of Information Act,  Over 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA into law, establishing the public's judicially enforceable right to government information.  Before FOIA, the people had to justify their need for information to the government, but after FOIA, the government has to justify its refusal to release information to the public. FOIA's enactment marked a crucial step toward a government more accountable to the people.  No doubt, FOIA manifests Congress's recognition of the need to carefully balance the public's right to know and the government's interest in protecting certain information from disclosure, but practice and history demonstrates this balance has all too often been tilted away from transparency.  Many in government have continued to find ways to undermine citizens' right to know under Transparency should be the norm, not the exception; yet, when it comes to FOIA requests, we have continued to see a government culture of delay, deny, and defend. When this happens, FOIA's effectiveness is undermined and the public becomes even more skeptical of its government.  We have seen this in one way or another under every administration, both Republican and Democratic, since FOIA's enactment, but the trend toward secrecy and obstruction in recent years should alarm all of us.  According to a March 14 Associated Press report, ``The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under [FOIA.]''[[Page S1837]]  In 2016, the Obama administration set records for ``outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees.''  To top it off, ``The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years.''  We simply cannot continue down this path.  Fortunately, a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort last year resulted in the enactment of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. I was proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation and to have worked closely with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, as well as the open government community, in ensuring its passage. It achieves some of the most meaningful and necessary reforms to FOIA in history.  We are already witnessing some of the positive impacts of these reforms.  For example, the National Security Archive, a nonprofit open government advocate, fought for years to achieve the public release of certain historical documents about the Bay of Pigs invasion. But time and again, they were met with legal hurdles put up by the Central Intelligence Agency,  This past October, however, the CIA released these historically significant documents. In doing so, the CIA's Chief Historian stated that the Agency is ``releasing this draft volume today because recent 2016 changes in the [FOIA] requires us to release some drafts that are responsive to FOIA requests if they are more than 25 years old.''  This is excellent news. It is just one example of the good that can result from bipartisan work toward a common goal for the American people. I look forward to hearing many other such stories of important information finally being made publicly available under FOIA, thanks to these recent reforms.  But we can't just rest on our laurels. No matter which party is in control of Congress or the White House, continuing oversight of FOIA--and the faithful implementation of its amendments--is essential to ensure the law's effectiveness as a tool for the public good.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am proud during this Sunshine Week to join Senators Feinstein, Cornyn, and Leahy in sending letters to the Trump administration to learn more about specific steps taken to carry out the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and efforts underway to improve the proactive disclosure of information.  Compliance with both the letter and spirit of FOIA should always be a top priority of any administration, so I look forward to hearing back about progress made.  Before President Trump took office, I stood on this floor and urged him to reverse the secrecy and obstruction that defined the Obama administration's FOIA track record. Today I reiterate that call.  A new administration provides a new opportunity to get it right.  This Sunshine Week, let's recommit to working together toward improving open government, fulfilling FOIA's promise, and ensuring a more informed citizenry.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgS1836-2.txt,457,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,15.0,January

2637,topic-id,827,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.41, introduced by the gentleman from Michigan, (Mr.Huizenga), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises of the Committee on Financial  This resolution disapproves a burdensome and controversial Securities and Exchange Commission rule that places an unfair burden on American public companies that is not applied to many of their foreign competitors.  Virtually every day we hear from many Americans about how this economy is just not working for them. It is just not working for working Americans like Keith from Dallas in my district who wrote me: ``I am 53. I have a grown son who lives with me. It seems like the cost of everything keeps going up, yet wages do not keep pace.''  The economic opportunities of Keith and millions of Americans like him are not helped by top-down, politically driven regulations that give many foreign companies an advantage over American public companies.  That is exactly what this Securities and Exchange Commission regulation that we are talking about today does. It forces American public companies to disclose inexpensive proprietary information that can actually be obtained by their foreign competitors, including state-owned companies in China and This is just one regulation out of thousands and thousands that are burdening our companies, our job creators, and are costing our households, by one estimate, over $14,000 a year, Mr. Even though this is a Securities and Exchange rule, section 1504 of Dodd-Frank has nothing to do with investor protection nor anything else we were told the Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to do. As the acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission has said, this rule ``neither reforms Wall Street nor provides consumer protection and it is wholly unrelated, and largely contrary, to the Commission's core mission.''  In addition, Mr.Speaker, the SEC estimates that ongoing compliance costs for this rule could reach as high as $591 million per year. It is just an outrage, Mr.That is $591 million every year that could better be used to hire thousands more Americans in an industry where the average pay is 50 percent higher than the U.average. Literally we could be talking about 10,000 jobs on the line for this ill-advised rule. This is significant, given that millions of Americans, like Keith from my district, have not seen their wages increase while our economy has been stymied under the Obama administration.  Now, for those who claim that somehow by rolling back this rule, that this undermines anticorruption efforts, let me remind everyone that Mr.Huizenga's resolution, that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which the SEC and the Department of Justice administer, already makes it illegal to pay former government officials when it comes to winning or maintaining business opportunities.[[Page H849]]  To further prove the point, Mr.Speaker, just this year the SEC has brought enforcement actions or settled four separate cases for violations of this anticorruption law. So even without this SEC rule, fraud will still be fraud, corruption will still be corruption, and both will still be illegal. The SEC and the Department of Justice will still have the authority to vigorously pursue those who break the law and hold them accountable, as they well should. So no one, Mr.Speaker, should fall for this false argument of our opponents.  Let's also remember that this joint resolution does not repeal section 1504 of Dodd-I wish it did, but it doesn't. Rather, it vacates a flawed SEC rule that mimics a previous rule that was already struck down by a U.District It is a rule that by the SEC's own estimates has taken 51 employees over 20,000 hours to promulgate, defend, and repromulgate. Fifty-one employees, 20,000 hours that could have been directed at rooting out Ponzi schemes, that could have been used to promote capital formation or make our capital markets more efficient.                              {time}  1515  Furthermore, this rule still goes far beyond the statute passed by Congress and mandates public specialized disclosures that cost more and more, and is more burdensome than the law requires.  So, Mr.Speaker, for those who religiously defend the Dodd-Frank law, they should be in vigorous support of what Mr.Huizenga brings to the floor today because the rule flies in the face of the Dodd-Frank So when an agency exceeds its statutory authority, it is no longer regulating, Mr.Speaker, it is legislating. And all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, should be able to agree that when the executive branch acts in such a manner, Congress has a duty, a duty under article I of the Constitution, to check this executive overreach.  As such, this House should wholeheartedly support Mr.Huizenga's resolution. It simply tells the SEC to go back to the drawing board, comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, and come up with a better role that will not put American public companies at an unfair disadvantage and cost us jobs.

And if we put a 10 multiplier on it, that is $50 billion of investable capital that could be put out for productive use helping the world have more mineral resources. Instead, it goes to this ill-advised rule.                              {time}  1600  In the past two decades, the United States has lost more than 50 percent, Mr.Speaker, of its public companies, in large part due to the costs and regulatory burdens of being associated with being a public company. Dodd-Frank's resource extraction rule piles on even more harmful red tape for those publicly traded companies in the United States that are global energy providers.  As this rule only applies to publicly traded companies, this increased burden puts U.companies at a disadvantage. Over 75 percent of the extracted minerals are owned by state-owned enterprises, Mr.Speaker, that are not covered by this rule. That puts our companies at a competitive disadvantage. It requires our companies to reveal confidential information, putting our companies at a competitive disadvantage.  And if, Mr.Speaker, the people want transparency, the best way to handle that is through self-disclosure through global transparency and accountability. There are important public policy goals, and 51 countries have entered into the Extractive Industry Transparency Institute, which is self-reporting and publishing, by country, by company, both public and private, these important issues about mineral extraction.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, if it is about corruption, our friend, Senator Proxmire from Wisconsin, long ago, in the 1970s, passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices There is no more act feared by global corporate America than complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and ensuring that our companies, our shareholders are not prone or party to bribery.

2236,topic-id,1135,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Well, maybe not exactly Peoria, but Bradley  Mr.Speaker, I rise to honor one of the most decent, patriotic Americans with whom I have ever served in any legislative body. I had the great honor of being Bob Michel's friend, the great honor of being his colleague, and the great honor of believing that what Bob Michel represented in this Congress was the best of us, the most decent of us, the most considerate of us, and deeply committed to his country and[[Page H1344]]respectful of those with whom he served, perhaps differing with them, but, nevertheless, deeply respectful of his colleagues. He and Tip O'Neill were good friends. They could argue their side and their policies vigorously but be the best of friends after we adjourned that day.  I thank my colleague from Illinois for leading this tribute, and I rise to join in remembering this great man, a great American leader, Bob  Mr.Speaker, Bob's entire life was given to service to his country. From his time in the Army as an infantryman on the front lines of the fight for democracy in the Second World War to his long career in government, Leader Michel sought to make America and the world safer and to protect the American Dream for all of our people.  Mr.Speaker, I did not want to lose the majority in 1994, but when we lost, I lamented the fact that Bob Michel did not become the Speaker of the House of In my opinion, if he had, America would be a more civil place today and this body would be a more collegial body than it is.  I want to congratulate the gentleman who represents Bob Michel's district now, succeeding in that office, his father, who is a very dear and close friend of mine. All three of them represented the best of that which America hopes would serve it well.  Bob Michel and I didn't always agree on policy, Mr.Speaker, but as colleagues, we worked together to reach consensus and achieve results. I remember in 1989 when Tony Coelho and I were working to pass the House's version of what would become the landmark Americans with Disabilities It was Bob Michel who saw how important this legislation would be and asked my friend, Steve Bartlett from Texas to work with me, from the Republican side of the aisle, to achieve a bipartisan version that could become law. That is how Bob Michel operated.  This House would be a better House if we followed the example of Bob He saw a problem and looked for a way we could come together around a compromised solution, not focused first on confrontation. His decency and friendliness were as evident as his seriousness as a legislator.  As Republican whip and leader, he set an example of how to lead an effective opposition based not on obstruction, but on identifying ways to work together to achieve common goals. To that extent, and in so many other ways, as I have said, Bob Michel represented the best of us.  Now, Bob, Mr.Speaker, could be tough. He could be really tough. He knew how to defend his party's interests and advance its goals in the minority. But Bob believed strongly that we who are sent here by our constituents have, first and foremost, a responsibility to make policy, not to play politics. And that is how Bob Michel served--by always, always, always putting country first. Mr.Speaker, I hope his example will be an inspiration to all who serve today.  I join in extending my condolences to Bob's children--Scott, Bruce, Robin, and Laurie--and the entire Michel family. I join the people of Illinois' 18th District in mourning the man who was their champion for so many years. Illinois, this House, and our country lost a great light, but one, I hope, that will continue to shine through its reflection in those whom Bob Michel inspired. I was one of those. We will miss him. There aren't enough Bob  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Leader Hoyer for those warm words and inspiring words and heartfelt words for Leader It means so much for his family, for all of us in Peoria, and for all of his colleagues.  I want to thank everybody here tonight from the Illinois delegation that spoke so fondly about Mr.When we think about the traits that he exemplified--integrity, sincerity, humility, genuineness, and civility--that everybody talked about here tonight, I think it is also important to remember where he came from in  The congressional district that he represented, the 18th Congressional District, was the same district that Congressman Abraham Lincoln represented from 1847 to 1849. It is also the same congressional district that Everett Dirksen represented and that Bob Michel represented for 38 years, and you think about the values that they all exemplified, those strong midwestern values they never forgot.  The other thing that is unique about all three is they were all buried within 1 hour of each other. Oak Ridge Cemetery, President Lincoln; Pekin Cemetery, Everett Dirksen; and this last weekend, Leader Michel in Peoria, Bob Michel could have been buried in Arlington Cemetery in a beautiful grave, but he chose to be buried next to the love of his life in Peoria, That says a lot about the person that he was. I think it is unique that, within an hour's drive, you can go see all three of their graves, but I think it reflects the midwestern values that he had and those traits.                              {time}  2015  The other thing that I just want to mention here in closing is that he served his 14 years as the Republican leader, the longest of anyone in this institution as a leader of the minority party. But he also had a number of people that he mentored and tutored: from Jack Kemp, to Trent Lott, to Dick Cheney, to Newt Gingrich; people that served under him, and he mentored in their positions, and that should not be lost.  Bob Michel was a conservative Republican, but the way that he went about the work that he did, his style of civility and treating friend and foe alike, and being able to work across party lines when he needed to made this institution a better place. We need more people like Bob Michel in public service. He is a shining example of what public service should be. I couldn't be prouder to serve in the same congressional district that he represented for 38 years.  Lastly, Mr.Speaker, he made us proud to be from Peoria, He made this institution a better place. He made this country a better place by his service of over 50 years.  Tonight we say: Mr.Leader, rest in peace.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

2639,topic-id,512,"Mr.Speaker, section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act was like[[Page H850]]many other provisions that were ultimately included in the sprawling law. They had absolutely no relationship to the underlying cause of the financial and housing crisis.  However, some have used the financial crisis to hijack Federal securities law in order to push a socially motivated agenda. Specifically, section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to annually report payments such as taxes, royalties, fees, production entitlements, and those types of things made to a foreign or the U.Federal government relating to the commercial development of minerals, oils, and natural gas.  Companies subject to section 1504 must report the type and total amounts of these payments made for each project, as well as the type and total amounts of payments made to each government. These payments cover, as I said, taxes and other things that are really business expenses.  While this may be a laudable goal, using Federal securities law and the SEC to enforce social issues is inconsistent with the SEC's core mission and completely inappropriate. Just to remind everyone, the SEC's mission by law is to: One, protect investors; two, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and three, facilitate capital formation. I would liken what they are doing by having the SEC put this rule in place sort of like requiring your police department to be in charge of road repair, too. It is just not their expertise.  The SEC recognized this fact and stated that section 1504 ``appears designed primarily to advance U.foreign policy objectives,'' not investor protection or capital formation. Notwithstanding the merits of the underlying policy goals, conducting American foreign policy is not what Congress created the SEC to do. In fact, just moments ago, the U.Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State, and I would suggest that we let him direct our foreign policy. With all due respect to the commissioners and the SEC staff, none of them are really foreign policy experts.  As we debate this resolution, let's be clear on what this isn't about. Some have tried to argue that a vote to vacate this provision is a vote for corruption somehow. This couldn't be further from the truth. Now, I understand and sympathize with the sense and the feeling of this that this rule makes supporters feel better about themselves, but it does not solve the real world issues. This foreign rule that has been brought up is really like comparing apples and oranges with the foreign rules versus this particular rule. And if we allow them to rewrite this particular rule, we might actually mirror what the EU and what other foreign governments are doing.  Despite the claims to the contrary, H.41 does nothing to undermine the ability of the SEC and the Justice Department to police against foreign corruption. In fact, both of these agencies still have, at their disposal, Federal laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribing foreign officials.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Hasn't the American taxpayer paid enough for goats and paying ghost soldiers? 200,000 Afghans who don't even exist are getting paid, so that means that the money ends up in the hands of the Taliban or the village leaders.  You know, if the Chinese want to spend 16 years in Afghanistan, so be it. Let them have it.  Think about the history of Afghanistan, Madam Alexander the Great was the first, and then we had the Brits that went in. In fact, Winston Churchill was a young reporter when they were in Afghanistan and he was very disillusioned with that world. Then the Russians went in for 10 years and then they left, and now we have been there 16 years. Afghanistan is a graveyard of empires.  It is time for us to start looking at the sensibility of what we are doing there and does it make any sense, which is a better way of saying it.  I think that at some time, Afghanistan being the graveyard of empires, there is probably a headstone that says ``Russia.'' After 16 years, maybe there will be a headstone that says ``USA.'' And who knows? If the Chinese go and stay 16 years, there might be another headstone that says ``China.'' At that time, maybe the ghost soldiers can take the $6 million goats out to the graveyard and let them eat the grass or something.  I don't know, Madam It gets a little bit crazy. It really does.

Of the 14 million human beings who were killed, at least 6 million were Jewish souls. Their carnage was the largest in human history.  Thus, the brevity of the Trump administration's statement was surprisingly and unusually short and general--only about 100 words. When the White House was asked about these glaring omissions, multiple officials in the new administration at the White House merely confirmed ``the statement was no mistake.''  The Trump White House statement chose not to explicitly acknowledge the deaths of 6 million Jews during the This is atypical of any former President of our country. Moreover, the Trump statement implies that the recognition of the death of Jews during the Holocaust would come at the exclusion of other groups. The tone of those remarks takes the reader in the direction of denying the suffering of the Jewish people.  For the President not to mention Jews is a terrible omen.  So let us go through some history. The term ``holocaust,'' arising from World War II, has come to mean annihilation of Jewish persons. From 1933 to 1945, those Jewish souls who perished in Europe totaled at least 6 million human beings. Between 2.7 million and 3 million Jews were murdered in Nazi-run death camps. In the USSR, 1,340,000 Jewish deaths were ordered by Joseph At least 1.5 million of the victims forcibly killed by Hitler and Stalin were children.  Cumulatively, this carnage represented about two-thirds of the 9 million Jews who had resided in Central By way of explanation, for the 8 million Christians and others who were also murdered, the term generally used to describe their carnage is martyrdom. As an example, in Poland, 3 million Catholic Christian Poles were martyred by Nazi and Soviet killing machines.  The Holocaust also included Stalin's mass executions and forced starvation[[Page H1236]]and relocation of Soviet prisoners of war to fight in horrendous places like the Battle of Monte Cassino after being marched through the Middle Many of them were buried in  Stalin also perpetrated a massive post-war ethnic and religious cleansing of Jews and non-As Hitler and Stalin fought for control of the European continent, over 14 million innocent people--these aren't soldiers I am talking about. This was in addition to the 14 million--women, children, and men who were civilians died in their vastly evil plunder. Millions of Eastern Europeans were trapped between the two most murderous regimes in not only European history, but human history: Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet  As an aside, I found it chilling that President Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, in an address to the Vatican in 2014, referenced in a most troubling line of thought the name of Julius Evola and his murderous movement.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts of an article entitled ``This is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World,'' which is also available at www.buzzfeed.com.                     [From BuzzFeed News Reporter]             This Is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World                          (By Lester Feder)       Donald Trump's newly named chief strategist and senior      counselor Steve Bannon laid out his globalist nationalist      vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a      conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014.       Bannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When      Vladimir Putin, when you really look at some of the      underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those      come from what I call Eurasianism; he's got an advisor who      harkens back to Julius Evola and different writers of the      early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's      called the traditionalist movement, which really eventually      metastazied into Italian fascism. A lot of people that are      traditionalists are attracted to that.       One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin      is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying      to do it in a form of nationalism--and I think that people,      particularly in certain countries, want to see the      sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism      for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-     European Union or they don't believe in the centralized      government in the United They'd rather see more of a      states-based entity that the founders originally set up where      freedoms were controlled at the local level.       I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that      he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist      of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West really      have to look at what he's talking about as far as      traditionalism goes--particularly the sense of where it      supports the underpinnings of nationalism--and I happen to      think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good      thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong      nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and      that is really the building block that built Western Europe      and the United States, and I think it's what can see us      forward.

2736,topic-id,761,"Mr.Speaker, Julius Evola has been described as one of the most influential Fascist racists in Italian history, admired by the Nazi SS, its commander, Heinrich Himmler, and Benito Nazi SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler was most certainly responsible for the  Hitler's madness obsessed over creating an Aryan nation. Joseph Stalin's depraved dream of conquest knew no bounds. Stalin even conscripted Jews to lead hunts to exterminate other ethnic groups, and then killed the Jews when the mission was completed. The level of Stalin's depravity is difficult for sane people to understand.  Violent anti-Semitism and hatred did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the ultimate collapse of the Communist Soviet We can observe a resurgence in certain places in Europe and, sadly, even in isolated incidents here in the United                              {time}  1930  History tells us that the rising anti-Semitic violence is not just a threat to civil society today, but the future of free people everywhere. The recent anti-Semitic terrorist incidents in Paris at the Bataclan, Jewish-owned enterprises, or Nazi symbols appearing in hateful situations here in our own beloved country demand that decent people find peaceful means to stare down hate.  Timothy Snyder's masterful book ``Bloodlands'' documents the 6 million souls of the Holocaust and 8 million souls of martyrdom and murder. The Nazis established killing centers for efficient mass execution. These killing centers, also referred to as ``extermination camps'' or ``death camps,'' were almost exclusively ``death factories.'' German Schutzstaffel and police murdered nearly 2.7 million Jews in these killing centers either by asphyxiation with poison gas or by shooting.  For the non-Jewish populations of Europe, the 8 million non-Jewish victims of Nazi and communist campaigns of mass murder include Romas, Soviet prisoners of war, Aktion T4 patients, Ukrainian Holodomor famine victims, Serbs, the disabled, the LGBTQ communities, and others known only to  There were also unfathomable crimes against entire nations, as Poland and Belarus were both slated for complete extinction. Poland lost an astounding 20 percent of its entire population, with 6 million killed in the war, and Belarus, though smaller in population, lost 25 percent of its population.  In Poland, leaders were annihilated. Many members of the Catholic clergy were either threatened with deportation, kept in custody, or sent to camps. The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed, for nearly a fifth of all priests--over 3,000--were killed between 1939 and 1945, most in concentration camps.  From 1932 to 1933, Joseph Stalin's forced famine engulfed much of present-day Ukraine and its eastern flank. The heaviest losses were in Ukraine--which is struggling for its freedom today--which had been the most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Stalin was determined to crush all evidence of Ukrainian pride. As with Poland's leadership, the famine was accompanied by a devastating purge of all of Ukraine's intelligentsia.  Millions of peasants were condemned to death by starvation. Troops and secret police units waged a merciless war against peasants who refused to give up their grain. Any man, woman, or child caught taking even a handful of grain from a collective farm could be, and often were, executed or deported to work camps. Stalin's system of internal passports and brutal secret police forced collectivization of the land to Communist-run production.  After a long search through history and recordkeeping, I can personally give testimony and even learned that the Catholic Church located in today's Ukraine, in which our maternal grandparents were married, held a dark secret. Joseph Stalin's secret police, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the NKVD, killed 168 people in its basement as Stalin's Black Raven trucks drove the innocents to their death.  Historians continue to seek truth even until today about what happened. Their painstaking research includes information from the Soviet archives. Though some people try to erase history or ignore it, others work diligently to record it and learn from it.  I recall how fondly our grandmother spoke of Jewish storekeepers in the region from which she emigrated, welcoming her before and after church on Sunday and telling her to change into her church shoes there before attending mass and after her 5-mile hike from her village and the 5-mile hike back. The Jewish storekeeper would always give her a piece of candy.  There are other Members here tonight that wish to speak. I am so grateful for their presence here tonight because we are the bearers of liberty's torch.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, (Mr.Crowley), the great leader of the Democratic Caucus, and I thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to be here with us.

I hope every one of our colleagues, all 435, sign on to his resolution. It is most worthy. I thank him so very, very much for joining us this evening.  I want to tell a story in the region that I represent, though this particular neighborhood was cut out of my district. A Nazi swastika was painted on a garage door recently of the home of a Muslim family. It was really repugnant and very cruel, but what happened in our community? What did the American people do? One neighbor came over with a bottle of red paint and she made a big heart over the swastika. Then the conductor of the symphony came and musicians came, and they played ``Ode to Joy'' to the family, and other friends came and the American people.  I love the American people because deep in their hearts they live the values of liberty and justice for all. The garage door itself was replaced by the Toledo Overhead Door They gave the family a new door for free. I am just so proud of them. I am just so proud of them.  Our communities don't have to bear this sadness of anti-Semitism and of degradation by those who really don't[[Page H1238]]get what this country is made of. I know the Trump White House statement on the Holocaust falls far short of the administration's ability to properly recognize and record history accurately.  The Trump White House has the means to hire appropriate staff to prepare thoughtful, carefully researched statements, and their 2017 statement is out of touch with history. History teaches us that wherever anti-Semitism has gone unchecked, the persecution of others has been present or not far behind. Presenting historical truth and defeating anti-Semitism must be a cause of great importance not only for Jews but also for us, for people who value liberty, truth, free expression of religion, justice for all. I know that is the vast majority of the American people.                             General Leave  ",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1235.txt,616,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,15.0,March

2740,topic-id,303,"I want to thank Mr.Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania also for coming to the floor this evening. If there is any remaining time, I would just like to read a couple of the sentences of Congressman Boyle's remarks because they are so incredible.  He talks about Deborah Lipstadt, an American historian and author of influential books such as ``Denying the Holocaust,'' who wrote an important article in The Atlantic, entitled, ``The Trump Administration's Flirtation With Holocaust Denial.''  He talks about ``'hardcore Holocaust denial.' In this type of rhetoric, anti-Semites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur; that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based solely on their religion.  ``This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the Holocaust began.''  But he talks about a more insidious form of denial in rhetoric that has begun to creep into our national discussion. Lipstadt terms this ``'softcore Holocaust denial.' This form of denial, argues Lipstadt, uses different tactics but has the same end-goal. . . . It does not deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of . . .  ``Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when someone suggests it was not so bad. Softcore denial, then, is potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not just about the Jews per se.''

2314,topic-id,234,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Polis for yielding and for your leadership on this issue.  This resolution would overturn rules that protect a consumer's privacy, and they would be a handout to internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon, AT&Now, as it is, the average American, 80 percent of Americans, don't have a choice about which internet service provider they can use, and they pay six to seven times more than people pay in France, than people pay in And people wonder: Why is this?  Obviously, the United States did all of the research that invented the internet. Why are Americans paying more? It is because they have monopolistic, anticompetitive practices. So what is the solution? Instead of making the industry more competitive so Americans have more choice and don't have to pay as much, what this bill wants to do is give these four or five internet service providers even more power, allowing them to take an individual's data and sell it to whoever they want.  The fear of Big Brother is so real out there, as it is, people fear that the bureaucracy and big companies are controlling their lives. This bill would allow that to continue and get worse.[[Page H2483]]  What we need is more anticompetitive legislation.

2213,topic-id,634,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  My motion to recommit is quite simple. It exempts class action lawsuits that are brought to protect public water supplies.  I know some of you have heard me speak of this. I am from Flint, Michigan, and we know, in my community, what happens when we fail to protect drinking water.  In the course of the day, most Americans take for granted that water that comes from the tap is safe. But for my community of 100,000 people, that is not true. It hasn't been true for years. Since the State government switched to a corrosive water source, the Flint River, they have not been able to drink water out of the tap.  This terrible decision poisoned the city's water supply with corrosive water, resulting in high levels of lead leaching into their water system, going into their pipes, into their homes, into their bodies, 100,000 people, 7,000 children under the age of 6. Nearly 3 years later, those same families are still reeling from this crisis. It is unacceptable. It is an injustice.  Lead is a potent neurotoxin. There is no safe level of lead. Lead exposure can lead to serious health effects felt for years.  But the impacts are not limited just to health. Those high levels of lead also damaged Flint's infrastructure, and we now have to remove thousands of pipes in order to provide safe water.  Thankfully, this Congress, Democrats and Republicans, came together to provide necessary help for my hometown to fix those pipes. But Flint residents will continue to suffer. That was important, but not enough. There are lots of health effects.  Just recently we learned that many cases, in fact, many deaths that we thought were attributable to pneumonia, were, in fact, Legionnaires' disease, traceable to the bacteria caused by this terrible crisis. A dozen people have already died as a result of Legionnaires' disease, and others, whose deaths may be reclassified, could bring that number much higher.  The corrosiveness of that water not only had health impacts, but it literally destroyed people's homes from the inside out. So, in addition to those service lines, people's plumbing in their homes, their water heaters, their washing machines destroyed, ruined, and their lives potentially ruined as well.  So where does the support, where does the funding come for those losses experienced by residents of my hometown?  It comes from the justice system. This bill would create more barriers for people in my hometown to access that justice system, to seek justice for what happened to them. They have suffered a terrible crisis, and they should be able to seek justice and restitution.  Unfortunately, this bill could prevent people from Flint, and other Americans, from seeking justice, and that is what my motion intends to correct.  In order to receive justice from the harm that they have experienced from this public water source, residents have filed class action suits. This bill severely curtails their access to the courts to seek redress, to seek that restitution. This bill would weaken their access to justice.  My motion is simple. It would allow lawsuits that are brought to protect our precious public water supplies to be exempt from the additional hurdles, from the additional barriers that this underlying bill sets out.  Having safe drinking water is a human right, and the access to that and the access to justice related to that basic human right ought to be completely unfettered. My motion to recommit would assure that, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this motion.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Section 1504 requires that gas and oil companies that are listed on U.exchanges to disclose payments made to foreign governments.

2154,topic-id,549,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.985, the so-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency  This outrageous legislation would severely limit the ability of injured consumers and workers to obtain relief through class action lawsuits. If that were not bad enough, the bill also contains a totally unrelated measure to violate the privacy of asbestos victims, and subject them to potential discrimination. Together, this legislation is just one more measure in the Republican parade of bills this week to further tilt the playing field in favor of wealthy corporations over ordinary people.  Class action suits are an essential tool to enable victims of corporate wrongdoing to be compensated for their injuries and to deter future misconduct. Plaintiffs often seek to band together as a class when the potential damages they could receive individually are too low to make it practical to hire a lawyer and bring a lawsuit alone. But, as members of a class, they have the power to secure relief from a multimillion-dollar company and put an end to its illegal practices.  That is exactly why the big corporations oppose them. It makes it harder for those companies to operate with impunity from the law, with little regard for the injuries they may cause.  It was class action lawsuits that helped uncover years of corrupt practices in the tobacco industry and began to turn around a public health disaster, not to mention recover billions of dollars. It was class action lawsuits that revealed contamination of groundwater that cause certain forms of cancer. It was class action lawsuits that revealed fraudulent pricing practices and misleading advertising by drug companies, widespread employment discrimination, and predatory payday lending practices. Class action lawsuits also helped expose and bring down the sham university peddled on winning victims by the current occupant of the White  But this bill includes a range of provisions that would make such class action suits practically impossible. For example, it would require each member of a class to suffer ``the same type and scope of injury'' as the named class representative. What this means is that if two people use a defective product, but one suffers first-degree burns while the other person suffers third-degree burns, they cannot join together in a class because their injuries are of a different scope. Or take a company with a pattern of racial discrimination. If some workers are being paid less than others for doing the same job while other workers find themselves repeatedly passed over for deserved promotions, they cannot join in the same class action because they would not be deemed to have suffered the same type of injury--one having been paid less, the other having been passed over for promotions--despite being victims of the same discriminatory policies.  This is just one of a host of unnecessary and onerous requirements placed on victims by this bill that makes it virtually impossible to form a class. When added together, it amounts to a giant bailout for wealthy corporations at the expense of injured consumers and workers.  Mr.Chairman, we do not want the Federal courts to be simply collection agencies to large corporations. We need justice for the small, ordinary person.

Today, Republicans are bringing up a bill that will deny women the right to access comprehensive reproductive health care, a right protected by the  The right of a woman to decide whether to become pregnant, to decide to continue her pregnancy, or to make the decision to terminate her pregnancy is protected by the The Supreme Court has determined that neither Congress nor a state may place an ``undue burden'' on that right. Denial of Medicaid or other government funding that would be available for other medical procedures should be considered an ``undue burden.'' For decades, Congress has imposed the Hyde Amendment on every appropriations bill. This language disproportionately impacts poor women and women of color, effectively denying them their constitutional right to access abortion. Yet today, Republicans want to make that language permanent.  As unjust and despicable as the Hyde Amendment is, this bill goes beyond it. For the first time, Republicans are restricting the right of women to use their own money to pay for abortions. This bill will deny normal tax deductions for medical expenses if those expenses include abortion, normal tax credits for health insurance if that insurance includes abortion, and denying the ability to use tax-free money from an FSA or HSA for an abortion.  The bill does include an exception in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother. You may ask, how the IRS will know a woman's reason for getting an abortion. Well, under this bill, women will have to prove they are a victim of rape or incest or will have to provide detailed medical records to determine just how at risk their life was. Women will not only have to suffer the trauma of a sexual assault or the loss of a pregnancy because of life-threatening complications, they will now also have to face an IRS inquisition to get their own money back. So much for Republicans' pledge to get ``big government'' out of people's lives.

That is the belief that I have, and my hope and my dream for everyone here in America is that we would recognize that those children are a gift from God to us to protect, to keep, and to make sure that they are brought into this world safely and helped from thereon. My perspective and my profound commitment to protecting unborn children is why I am standing here today.  Time and again, Congress has risen with bipartisan support to oppose taxpayer-funded abortions. Annual provisions, including the Hyde amendment, have been passed repeatedly; and they have been estimated to save over 2 million innocent lives. Our goal here is to save even more. We need to make these provisions permanent.  ObamaCare has allowed the tax dollars of hardworking Americans to flow to over 1,000 abortion-covering health plans. This has made today's bipartisan legislation more important than ever.  H.7 would create a permanent governmentwide prohibition against Federal dollars to fund abortive procedures. It would also ensure the Affordable Care Act complies with the Hyde amendment until it is repealed and replaced. That is the right thing to do.                              {time}  1430  Today we stand to make sure that every single life is valued, not just the ones that we pick and choose for political reasons; that every single one that God has created has an opportunity to live out their dreams here in the United States of  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH633-3.txt,2060,READING OF THE CONSTITUTION,2017.0,24.0,March

2619,topic-id,383,"Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.7--another radical attempt by House Republicans to attack women's health and limit women's access to comprehensive care.  The real purpose of this bill is to effectively eliminate insurance coverage for abortion services, not only for federally funded coverage, but also for private health insurance by raising taxes on women, their families, and small businesses.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that this bill just codifies the Hyde Amendment, which already prohibits federal funding for abortion except in limited cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother, and it is already enacted each year in appropriations.  But in reality, this bill goes much further than that. Instead of just limiting the Hyde Amendment's reach to federal funds, this bill would place sweeping restrictions on how women with private insurance can spend their own private dollars when obtaining insurance coverage.  Women and their families who have insurance through the health insurance marketplaces would no longer be entitled to premium tax credits if the plan in which they are enrolled includes abortion coverage. Small business employers would be prohibited from receiving small business tax credits if the insurance provided to employees includes abortion services.  This would mean that women would likely forgo comprehensive coverage in order to retain the premium tax credits they need, and small businesses may limit coverage to ensure they receive small business tax credits. But this is the true goal for proponents of this bill: to effectively eliminate insurance coverage for abortion.  As we speak, Republicans are actively working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, to restrict access to contraception, and to defund the life-saving health care services provided by Planned It seems that this bill is another page in their playbook to attack women's health. Let me be clear: this bill isn't about ensuring federal finds are not used for abortion--this bill is about denying women access to coverage Republicans disagree with.  Bringing this bill to the floor only days after millions of women throughout the country marched on behalf of issues like reproductive rights just shows how tone-deaf House Republicans continue to be.  We should be working to protect and expand women's access to comprehensive health care, not considering ways to deny it.

2684,topic-id,380,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.1029, the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017.  Once again, Madam Speaker, I stand before you to urge the passage of H.1029. As we know, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of pesticides. To facilitate and expedite that pesticide approval process, pesticide manufacturers have long supplemented the EPA's annual budget. This system allows the products to be reviewed in a timely manner, without sacrificing environmental and safety protections. It is truly a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers, and, as you heard Mr.Davis speak about, it is a clear example of government at its best. It is exactly why I enjoy working on the Committee on It is exactly why I enjoy working with people such as Rodney We have a bipartisan, effective, public-private legislative solution for a more predictable pesticide evaluation process that literally helps everybody.  The Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, H.1029, is an exceptional piece of legislation not only because it is supported by a unique coalition of pesticide registrants, environmental groups, and agricultural labor representatives, but H.1029 provides a more effective, predictable, and transparent pesticide evaluation process. It promotes shorter review periods for reduced-risk pesticides and enhances scientific and regulatory activities related to farmworker protection.  My district on the central coast of California is not only bountiful in its agriculture, it is absolutely beautiful with its environment. Therefore, we on the central coast work hard to find that balance of being known as the salad bowl of the world and one of the most scenic places in the world. That is why our agriculture producers are the most thoughtful stewards of the land and recognize the need to protect the environment and the natural resources.  This legislation facilitates that balance. This legislation provides a unique coalition building and encourages the agriculture industry to work with environmentalists. Thus, H.1029 helps all of us who live and work in our community and, ultimately, our country. That is why I am absolutely honored to speak in this debate, humbled to share the floor with Representative Davis, and why I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

Our first responsibility is to secure the Nation, embodied in the oath we take to support and defend. We must be strong and smart in defending our land, defeating terrorists, and advancing our vital interests in a world of promise and peril. America's actions must always be equal to America's values, honoring our Constitution and respecting our men and women in uniform.  Another responsibility is to further secure our economy and truly secure opportunity for hardworking families. We in this Congress must focus on job creation and growing paychecks every day for everyone and everywhere in our country. From the rural heartlands, the cities, and the suburbs, we must ensure that those who do their part have the opportunity to buy a home, address the aspirations of their children, and retire with dignity.  Our responsibility is also to secure our democracy. Our Founders pledged their sacred honor to create a democracy; a government of the many, not a government of the money. Now our sacred trust is to keep that covenant. We cannot permit our democracy to be suborned by the checkbooks of the powerful or to be subverted by the dark operations of a foreign regime.

All of these provisions President-elect Trump has pledged, and we will seek common ground, but we will stand our ground wherever in good conscience we must. If there is an attempt to destroy the guarantee of Medicare, harm Medicaid, Social Security, or the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will stand our ground.

2304,topic-id,1635,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the resolution.  This resolution undermines fundamental privacy for every internet user. You hear my colleague on the other side trying to conflate different things. When your broadband provider can sell your information, and there is no rule prohibiting them from doing so--effectively that includes all of your browsing history, data entered in forms, everything that you have done on the internet that has absolutely nothing to do with a relationship with a particular content provider or e-commerce company; you can enter information, obviously, for the express purpose of them optimizing your experience or selling you a product--they are then the owners of that information, and you have choice in the marketplace. Whereas, with our broadband providers, most of us don't have a choice. You either sign up for the local cable company or you don't.  Before I discuss the many disastrous facets of this resolution, I also want to point out that this is yet another closed rule. There have been absolutely no open rules that allow Democrats and Republicans to bring forward amendments. No amendments are allowed under this rule here on the floor of the House of Sadly, that has become the norm.  The FCC recently took steps to reevaluate their rule. Commissioner Pai even paused their implementation to examine the FCC doing their job.[[Page H2481]]  Now, why would Congress step in and use the CRA authority, a very cumbersome authority, that also prohibits future implementation of similar rules?  In many ways, it hamstrings the agency.  What we are worried about is that, if this bill were to become law, it would essentially be impossible for the FCC to act to protect the privacy of Americans who use broadband ever again. So it is not a matter of a nuance under this rule. If we go through the process of passing a CRA, the FCC wouldn't be able to pass any rule--or if they did, it would be under a legal cloud--to protect the privacy of the American people. That is the danger: that CRAs are effectively permanent.  The second aspect is that the FCC has already established a notice and comment period that allows for comment on the new rules. By going around that, we would avoid government transparency.  So here is what is at stake. On October 27, 2016, after a 6-month rulemaking process that was open to public comment and received comments, the FCC developed a commonsense rule to protect our privacy. The rule that we are talking about undoing basically does three things, which are great.  It requires broadband internet access service providers to obtain opt-in consent before using or sharing sensitive information. Sounds obvious that we would want that. We wouldn't want information that doesn't have an opt-in consent to be sold or used. That includes things like web browsing history or data that is entered on forms.  It would also require broadband providers to use reasonable measures to protect the cybersecurity of our data. Again, of course.  Third, it requires that broadband providers notify consumers in the event of a breach of information. Again, just like we have with credit card companies, we want some kind of affirmative information that is given to consumers that your information may be breached if there is a cybersecurity threat that might do that.  This bill undoes all those things. It says that you don't have to notify people if there is a breach, you don't need to have reasonable measures to protect cybersecurity, and, most importantly, with regard to privacy, it will no longer require opt-in consent before using, sharing, or selling your most intimate personal data that you use on the internet.  Now, look at the implications of this rollback. It is not just a collection of internet data usage, but bulk collection of all of your network traffic. A broadband provider could collect every search, every website visited, every email written and received, every piece of data entered, every article read, see how often you log in and how you use various accounts for all members of your family, including minors, and even your location, sell that information, and use that information without restriction and without opt-in.  Think about what someone can conclude about this information--your political affiliation, preferences, your health.  What could they do with it?  They could charge pricing of goods and services discriminating against you based on your income or your past purchasing behavior. Your sensitive financial information could be used to steer you to higher costs and worse financial products. This rule would literally change how broadband providers have access to your entire personal life. It would make the broadband providers the most valuable part of the internet value chain.  Now, we all want broadband providers to have compensation for the infrastructure costs and a reasonable profit. There is no doubt about that. Those of us who advocate for net neutrality, as I do, or those who advocate for privacy, we want them to have a reasonable return on investment so that we can all have access to broadband. And we have that largely through user fees and subscription fees.  Have you seen your cable bill, Mr.Speaker?  I have seen my cable bill. It ain't cheap anymore. But many families pay for it because it is the best way to have fast access to the internet.  And guess what?  The cable companies are able to justify broadband in many areas.  Again, maybe there are some tweaks, and it would be great if there is a way we could have greater value for rural broadband and have them have an We would love that. But the answer is not to turn over the keys to the internet and all your personal data to cable companies and say: You own it all. You are more powerful than Amazon, more powerful than Google, more powerful than every consumer site because you own everything that is entered into every one of those and more, and you can sell it and use it as you see fit without restriction, without even requiring that users opt in.  The value conveyance from the content side to the infrastructure side of this bill would be game-changing and game-destroying for the free and open internet. It simply makes no sense.  Look, consumers should have the right to choose with who and how they share their personal information. When it comes to a broadband provider, we simply don't have that choice that you do with consumer websites like Facebook or Google, which are governed under a separate set of laws.  Proponents of this bill are arguing that, because there is not adequate protection somehow in social media and the edge providers here, somehow the standard should be lower for broadband internet services. It makes no sense. In today's day and age, not having internet access is simply not an option for many To say you can choose not to have broadband, maybe in some places you can pay more for satellite and you might have some reasonably fast download but not upload that may be spotty, maybe you want to use dial-in over your phone. But for most of us--I use broadband. Most of us use broadband through our cable because it is the most cost-effective way to have high-speed internet access, and that is the case for most American families.  So this is not the time to get rid of privacy rules and convey the vast ecosystem that is the internet away from the content and dynamism that exists there to the broadband side. That is absurd.  People can choose not to use social media accounts, can choose what they share, and can choose who to enter contracts with with regard to searches or purchases. Social media is an optional platform that you can choose between many providers, but the broadband access side frequently looks and acts more like a monopoly.  Supporters of this bill also mention how this somehow levels the playing field for broadband providers. What it does is it tilts the playing field entirely in their favor. Internet service providers are a gateway to the internet. They do not own the internet.  The second protection the rule offers is to require reasonable measures be taken to protect the data that they want to collect. Again, we all value cybersecurity and protection of this data. Given the countless incidents of cyber hacking incidents, how can we entertain the idea of rolling back a rule that requires reasonable measures to protect consumer data? What are proponents advocating for? No measures to protect consumer data?  The third important protection under this rule is the consumers whose data has been breached should be notified. Again, that is important. I had my credit card stolen a few years ago and got notified that it was. I used it at another location where it might have been compromised and I received notification. This eliminates that notification from users of broadband. It would do away with that.  I would like to know, as would consumers, if my credit card information was hacked. I want to know if my personal profile or medical records or emails were hacked. If someone is able to attain my children's names, our home address, information about the schools they attend, or the homework they do, I would want to know.  Now, look, this bill moves entirely the wrong direction. It basically seizes the value of the internet from content, from e-commerce, from all of the important dynamism that occurs there and tries to apply that to the broadband side rather than simply find a reasonable way for broadband providers to see a return on investment.

2318,topic-id,2406,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is no surprise that nobody wants to come to the floor and talk in favor of this bill because it is such an awful bill. This bill would allow your broadband provider of internet services to sell all of your personal information.  So, again, the other side is trying to conflate two entirely different things. When you do a transaction within an e-commerce site or search site, you are agreeing to their terms of service, and you are engaging in a discrete transaction, and the information that you enter is subject to their terms of use--completely appropriate. A competitor is only a click away.  Whether there are any monopolistic content providers is a different matter for a different day, and a different Federal agency--the What we are talking about here is the access piece, the broadband access piece. They actually, through the pipes, get to see all of the information that is entered that you see: every email; all of your credit card information; if you use the internet for any personal medical research, all of your personal medical research; your kids' information, everything your kids and minors in the family do. And what this bill says is: you don't have to require people to opt in to have their information used.  Consumers should be in control of their own information. They shouldn't be forced to sell and give that information to who knows who simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.  Again, we all want there to be a reasonable capital return on infrastructure and on broadband. That is something we can agree on. If there is a case to be made that we can do better in providing an economic return to encourage rural broadband, I am for it. I know many of my colleagues on the other side would be for it. Let's do it.  What we don't want to do in that process is turn over the entire value chain of the internet to the infrastructure and provider side, rather than the dynamic innovative content and e-commerce side.  I would like to read an excerpt from two letters from groups who are opposed to this bill. The first is a coalition of 19 media, justice, consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups.  Their concern that: ``Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer information at will. The result could be extensive harm caused by breaches or misuse of data.''  They remind us that: ``The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their personal information and lets them choose the terms on which ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it.''  Consumers should be in control of their own information.  The second letter is from Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer They say, in part, that this bill ``would strip consumers of their privacy rights and . . . leave them with no protections at all.''  I include in the Record those two letters, Mr.                                                January 27, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,              Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell, Representative      Pelosi, and Senator Schumer: The undersigned media justice,      consumer protection, civil liberties, and privacy groups      strongly urge you to oppose the use of the Congressional      Review Act (CRA) to adopt a Resolution of Disapproval      overturning the FCC's broadband privacy order. That order      implements the mandates in Section 222 of the 1996      Telecommunications Act, which an overwhelming, bipartisan      majority of Congress enacted to protect telecommunications      users' privacy. The cable, telecom, wireless, and advertising      lobbies request for CRA intervention is just another industry      attempt to overturn rules that empower users and give them a      say in how their private information may be used.       Not satisfied with trying to appeal the rules of the      agency, industry lobbyists have asked Congress to punish      internet users by way of restraining the FCC, when all the      agency did was implement Congress' own directive in the 1996      This irresponsible, scorched-earth tactic is as harmful      as it is hypocritical. If Congress were to take the industry      up on its request, a Resolution of Disapproval could exempt      internet service providers (ISPs) from any and all privacy      rules at the As you know, a successful CRA on the      privacy rules could preclude the FCC from promulgating any      ``substantially similar'' regulations in the future--in      direct conflict with Congress' clear intention in Section 222      that telecommunications carriers protect their customers'      privacy. It could also preclude the FCC from addressing any      of the other issues in the privacy order like requiring data      breach notification and from revisiting these issues as      technology continues to evolve in the future. The true      consequences of this revoked authority are apparent when      considering the ISPs' other efforts to undermine the rules.      Without these rules, ISPs could use and disclose customer      information at will. The result could be extensive harm      caused by breaches or misuse of data.       Broadband ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers      to everything on the internet, have a largely unencumbered      view into their customers' online communications. That      includes the websites they visit, the videos they watch, and      the messages they send. Even when that traffic is encrypted,      ISPs can gather vast troves of valuable information on their      users' habits; but researchers have shown that much of the      most sensitive information remains unencrypted.       The FCC's order simply restores people's control over their      personal information and lets them choose the terms on which      ISPs can use it, share it, or sell it. Americans are      increasingly concerned about their privacy, and in some cases      have begun to censor their online activity for fear their      personal information may be compromised. Consumers have      repeatedly expressed their desire for more privacy      protections and their belief that the government helps ensure      those protections are met. The FCC's rules give broadband      customers confidence that their privacy and choices will be      honored, but it does not in any way ban ISPs' ability to      market to users who opt-in to receive any such targeted      offers.       The ISPs' overreaction to the FCC's broadband privacy rules      has been remarkable. Their supposed concerns about the rule      are significantly overblown. Some broadband providers and      trade associations inaccurately suggest that this rule is a      full ban on data use and disclosure by ISPs, and from there      complain that it will hamstring ISPs' ability to compete with      other large advertising companies and platforms like Google      and To the contrary, ISPs can and likely will      continue to be able to benefit from use and sharing of their      customers' data, so long as those customers consent to such      uses. The rules merely require the ISPs to obtain that      informed consent.       The ISPs and their trade associations already have several      petitions for reconsideration of the privacy rules before the      Their petitions argue that the FCC should either adopt a      ``Federal Trade Commission style'' approach to broadband      privacy, or that it should retreat from the field and its      statutory duty in favor of the Federal Trade Commission      itself. All of these suggestions are fatally flawed. Not only      is the FCC well positioned to continue in its statutorily      mandated role as the privacy watchdog for broadband telecom      customers, it is the only agency able to do so. As the 9th      Circuit recently decided in a case brought by AT&T, common      carriers are entirely exempt from FTC jurisdiction, meaning      that presently there is no privacy replacement for broadband      customers waiting at the FTC if Congress disapproves the      FCC's rules here.       This lays bare the true intent of these industry groups,      who also went to the FCC asking for fine-tuning and      reconsideration of the rules before they sent their CRA      request. These groups now ask Congress to create a vacuum and      to give ISPs carte blanche, with no privacy rules or      enforcement in place. Without clear rules of the road under      Section 222, broadband users will have no certainty about how      their private information can be used and no protection      against its abuse. ISPs could and would use and disclose      consumer information at will, leading to extensive harm      caused by breaches and by misuse of data properly belonging      to consumers.       Congress told the FCC in 1996 to ensure that      telecommunications carriers protect the information they      collect about their customers. Industry groups now ask      Congress to ignore the mandates in the Communications Act,      enacted with strong bipartisan support, and overturn the      FCC's attempts to implement Congress's word. The CRA is a      blunt instrument and it is inappropriate in this instance,      where rules clearly benefit internet users notwithstanding      ISPs' disagreement with them.[[Page H2484]]       We strongly urge you to oppose any resolution of      disapproval that would overturn the FCC's broadband privacy      rule.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: Consumers Union, the policy and      mobilization arm of Consumer Reports, writes regarding House      consideration of S.34, approved by a 50-48 party line      vote in the Senate last week.       This resolution, if passed by the House and signed into law      by President, would use the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to      nullify the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) newly-     enacted broadband privacy rules that give consumers better      control over their data. Many Senators cited ``consumer      confusion'' as a reason to do away with the FCC's privacy      rules, but we have seen no evidence proving this assertion      and fail to understand how taking away increased privacy      protections eliminates confusion. Therefore, we strongly      oppose passage of this resolution--it would strip consumers      of their privacy rights and, as we explain below, leave them      with no protections at all. We urge you to vote no on S.     34.       The FCC made history last October when it adopted consumer-     friendly privacy rules that give consumers more control over      how their information is collected by internet service      providers (ISPs). Said another way, these rules permit      consumers to decide when an ISP can collect a treasure trove      of consumer information, whether it is a web browsing history      or the apps a consumer may have on a smartphone. We believe      the rules are simple, reasonable, and straightforward.       ISPs, by virtue of their position as gatekeepers to      everything on the internet, enjoy a unique window into      consumers' online activities. Data including websites      consumers visit, videos viewed, and messages sent is very      valuable. Small wonder, then, that ISPs are working so hard      to have the FCC's new privacy rules thrown out through use of      the Congressional Review But we should make no mistake:      abandoning the FCC's new privacy rules is about what benefits      big cable companies and not about what is best for consumers.       Many argue the FCC should have the same privacy rules as      those of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). FCC Chairman      Ajit Pai went so far as to say ``jurisdiction over broadband      providers' privacy and data security practices should be      returned to the FTC, the nation's expert agency with respect      to these important subjects,'' even though the FTC currently      possesses no jurisdiction over the vast majority of ISPs      thanks to the common carrier exemption--an exemption made      stricter by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in last year's      AT&T Mobility case. We have heard this flawed logic time and      time again as one of the principal arguments for getting rid      of the FCC's strong privacy rules. Unfortunately, this is      such a poor solution that it amounts to no solution at all.       For the FTC to regain jurisdiction over the privacy      practices of ISPs, the FCC would first have to scrap Title II      reclassification--not an easy task which would be both time-     consuming and subject to judicial review, and jeopardize the      legal grounding of the 2015 Open Internet Congress, in      turn, would have to pass legislation to remove the common      carrier exemption, thus granting the FTC jurisdiction over      those ISPs who are common carriers. We are skeptical Congress      would take such an action. Finally, the FTC does not enjoy      the same robust rulemaking authority that the FCC does. As a      result, consumers would have to wait for something bad to      happen before the FTC would step in to remedy a violation of      privacy rights. Any fondness for the FTC's approach to      privacy is merely support for dramatically weaker privacy      protections favored by most corporations.       There is no question that consumers favor the FCC's current      broadband privacy rules. Consumers Union launched an online      petition drive last month in support of the Commission's      strong rules. To date, close to 50,000 consumers have signed      the petition and the number is growing. Last week, more than      24,000 consumers contacted their Senators urging them to      oppose the CRA resolution in the 24 hours leading up to the      vote. Consumers care about privacy and want the strong      privacy protections afforded to the them by the Any      removal or watering down of those rules would represent the      destruction of simple privacy protections for consumers.       Even worse, if this resolution is passed, using the      Congressional Review Act here will prevent the FCC from      adopting privacy rules--even weaker ones--to protect      consumers in the future. Under the CRA, once a rule is      erased, an agency cannot move forward with any      ``substantially similar'' rule unless Congress enacts new      legislation specifically authorizing it. Among other impacts,      this means a bare majority in the Senate can void a rule, but      then restoration of that rule is subject to full legislative      process, including a filibuster. The CRA is a blunt      instrument--and if used in this context, blatantly anti-     consumer.       We are more than willing to work with you and your fellow      Representatives to craft privacy legislation that affords      consumer effective and easy-to-understand protections. The      FCC made a step in that direction when it adopted the      broadband privacy rules last year, and getting rid of them      via the Congressional Review Act is a step back, not forward.      Therefore, we encourage you to vote no on S.34.

2319,topic-id,483,"I also include in the Record an op-ed that I had the opportunity to publish last week on this topic. My piece is entitled ``Why Americans should be worried about their online broadband privacy,'' talking about this very bill that Congress has the tenacity to try to bring to the floor under this rule to force the most personal information pieces of information about every aspect of your internet behavior, and that of your family members, to be given to the broadband provider to do whatever they want with.               [From the Huffington Post, March 22, 2017] Why Americans Should Be Worried About Their Online, Broadband Privacy                            (By Jared Polis)       Over the last couple of months, the dialogue surrounding      government surveillance and consumer privacy has shifted in a      troubling direction. While news outlets are covering      everything from false claims of wiretaps to outlandish claims      of reconnaissance microwaves, Republicans are quietly taking      real and dramatic steps to protect corporate profits at the      cost of your privacy. A few weeks ago, Senator Jeff Flake (R-     Ariz.) and Representative Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) filed      bills in both the House of Representatives and the Senate      that, if passed, will permanently eliminate broadband users'      privacy protections, affecting nearly everyone who uses the            The legislation allows broadband providers to access and      sell consumers' information without their permission. As our      gateway to the Internet, Broadband Internet Service      Providers--commonly referred to as ISPs--have access to a      wealth of personal information, from our physical location to      our shopping habits and the medical issues we research--can      reveal potentially sensitive details about our personal      lives.       Every search, every website visited, every article read      online, see how often you log into and use your various      online accounts and even, in some cases, collect your      location. Think about what someone could conclude from this      information about you--your overall health, risk activity,      political affiliation, preferences. What could they do with      that information? Could they change pricing of goods and      services depending on your income and past purchasing      behaviors? Could you face challenges obtaining insurance due      to perceptions on your health or risk behavior based on your      search activity? This rule change will literally allow      broadband providers to have access to your entire personal      life on a network and sell it.       After years of advocating for further consumer protections,      in October 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)      took a responsible and commonsense step to establish      broadband privacy protections--but only months later      Republicans are trying to roll back the progress made and      repeal the existing rules, fighting alongside corporate      broadband providers.       The legislation is unnecessary, as the FCC has already      taken steps to review the rules, pausing implementation to      conduct a careful examination of the complexities of      implementation. The Republican legislation, would stop this      process, bypass public comment, and eliminate the privacy      protections permanently and irrevocably.       That is why I am drawing attention to this critical issue,      before it's too late.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2478.txt,1910,HONORING THE LIFE OF THE HONORABLE BOB MICHEL,2017.0,28.0,January
2320,topic-id,275,"Like these groups, I also believe that privacy is worth defending. In the wrong hands, information can be damaging and used for the wrong reasons.  Simply put, this bill is about conveying the value of the internet to the infrastructure side rather than the content side. And rather than finding common ground to establish reasonable ROI for broadband and internet investments, this bill would hurt the entire internet ecosystem by breaking down the trust between consumers and service providers.  What they are really trying to do here is shift the reasonable burden for cybersecurity measures from the internet servers onto consumers. At the[[Page H2485]]same time, they want to eliminate the requirements of cybersecurity measures, even notify consumers of violations, and they want to collect more and more consumer data without any protections to do what they want with.  Supporting this bill would make each and every user of the internet vulnerable to violations of our privacy and vulnerable to cybersecurity threats without even receiving notifications of when our own intimate information, like credit card numbers, is compromised.  The FCC took a responsible, deliberate, and commonsense step to establish broadband privacy protections in October 2016. If they need to be tweaked or changed, let's have a process to do that. This bill is not that process. It not only undoes those privacy protections but prevents the FCC from ever issuing a rule that has those privacy protections in it.

2151,topic-id,977,"I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.985, the so-called Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act of 2017.  I want to thank my distinguished colleague from Texas for his presentation and for also making clear that the overriding purpose here is really to give the class action mechanism the guillotine. Now, this doesn't formally abolish the class action mechanism. It is not the guillotine, but it is a straitjacket. Let's be very clear, the whole purpose of this legislation is to make it virtually impossible for class action lawsuits to be brought by groups of citizens who share a common injury from things such as consumer rip-offs, pharmaceutical drug mistakes, faulty product design, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, poisonous breast implants, asbestos poisoning, lead poisoning, and so on--all of the billions of dollars worth of tort actions, nothing fraudulent about them, all of them already determined by courts and by juries to have taken place against our citizens, and they want to make it virtually impossible for people to proceed in court under the class action mechanism.  I began with a very important process observation which I noted before, Mr.There has been no hearing on this legislation. There have been[[Page H1976]]no calls for this legislation from people allegedly suffering the horrors of the reviled class action lawyers. I notice that while my thoughtful colleague from Texas uses much of his time to deplore the work of plaintiffs' lawyers, he says nothing about defendants' lawyers, who have defended guilty parties in all of the cases we have mentioned before--all of the mass toxic torts, all of the drug injury cases, all of the environmental crimes and torts, all the asbestos poisoning and so on--and they have got a right to do that. They are simply doing their job. But the plaintiffs' lawyers have a right to do their job, too. That is how our system works.  I find it fundamentally disturbing that anybody would be out denouncing lawyers for representing people who have been injured in a tort case. But I oppose this misguided legislation because it sends another huge Valentine and wet kiss to large corporate polluters and tortfeasors but gives the finger to millions of American citizens who suffer injuries from these defendants.  This legislation would shield corporate wrongdoers by making it far more difficult for them to get together to obtain justice in a class action lawsuit. So whether it is by making it almost impossible for Americans to pursue their day in court through the class action vehicle or threatening the privacy of asbestos victims, it is clear that H.985 wants to give corporate polluters and tortfeasors the power to play hide-and-go-seek with their victims in Federal court whenever they want to.                              {time}  1600  And it raises the broader question of who rightfully should hold power in a representative democracy like ours. Should it be large, private corporations, who are seeking rightfully their own profits? Or should it be the people, who are supposed to be sovereign?  I say it is the people.  This bill only favors the interests of the already powerful, to the detriment of the vast majority of the American people.  In cases seeking monetary relief, the bill requires a party seeking class certification to show that every potential class member suffered the same type and scope of injury at the certification stage, something that is virtually impossible to do. This requirement alone would sound the death knell for class actions, which are the principal means we have in court for consumers to hold wrongdoers accountable, without having to engage in multiple duplicative actions all over a State or all over the country, piling up the expenses for courts.  Most importantly, class actions make it feasible for those who have smaller but not inconsequential injuries to get justice. These injuries include diverse matters like products liability, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, and so on.  It is already very difficult to pursue class actions. Under current law, the courts strictly limit the grounds by which a large group of plaintiffs may be certified as a class, including the existing requirement that their claims raise common and factual legal questions, and that the class representative's claims must be typical of those of the other class members.  Finally, title II of H.985 gives asbestos defendants--the very entities whose products have injured millions of Americans--new weapons with which to go out and harm their victims. This part of the bill would require a bankruptcy asbestos trust to report on the court's public case docket--which is then made immediately available on the internet--the name and exposure history of each asbestos victim who gets payment from a trust, as well as the basis of any payment made to that victim.  As a result, the confidential personal information of asbestos claimants, including their names and entire exposure histories, would be irretrievably released into the public domain. Imagine what identity thieves, reporters, insurers, potential employers, lenders, and data collectors could do with this sensitive information.  The proper title of this section of H.985 should be the alternative fact act, not the FACT Act, because it penalizes the victims while favoring the perpetrators.  The bill requires the trusts to make intrusive disclosures of victims' personal information, but it makes no comparable demands on asbestos manufacturers, some of which intentionally concealed the life-threatening dangers of their products not just for months or years, but for decades, the result of which millions of unsuspecting workers and consumers were exposed to this toxic substance.  Essentially, this bill re-victimizes asbestos victims by exposing their private information to all of the world--information that has absolutely nothing to do with compensation for asbestos exposure.  Accordingly, I must oppose also this highly flawed provision of the legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Chairman, I am afraid that the eloquence of my opponent might cloud the issue for some of the people in So rather than having us go back and forth disputing the character of the legislation before you, I urge everybody to go to it. But let's go to some of the people who care most about protecting innocent Americans from corporate wrongdoing and injury in the marketplace and in the workplace, and let's see what they have got to say about it.  Mr.Chairman, I have a letter to the House from groups who oppose this legislation as an assault on the rights of consumers and workers, including the Alliance for Justice, the American Association for Justice, Americans for Financial Reform, the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the California Kids IAQ, the Center for Justice and Democracy, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Central Florida Jobs with Justice, Coal River Mountain Watch, the Committee to Support the Antitrust Laws, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Watchdog, Consumers for Auto[[Page H1977]]Reliability and Safety, Consumers  I have just gone through the I am not going to take us all the way through the Zs, Mr.But America's consumer groups are opposed to this legislation, and America's workers' groups are opposed to this legislation. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing, Mr. I have also gotten, specifically on the asbestos point, a letter from groups concerned with occupational health and safety who strongly oppose the Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act, saying that this bill will drain critical resources that have been set aside to secure justice for victims of asbestos diseases, while simultaneously publishing those victims' personal information on the internet. Included in this very long list of opponents are the Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization, the Communications Workers of America, the Maine Labor Group on Health, the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, the New Jersey State Industrial Union Council, and on and on.  So, again, they pushed this legislation through the House of Representatives at the speed of light, but under the cloak of darkness with no hearing at all. And then they come out and say: It is really for you, trust us. We are the Federal We are here to help you. We are going to move all of the cases into Federal Court, and we are going to make it a lot easier to nullify class actions.

2166,topic-id,571,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We obviously have a different vantage point on what is taking place in the civil courtrooms of America today. On our side, we look out over America and in the courts and we see millions of our neighbors, our fellow citizens who are suffering the effects of asbestos poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; lead poisoning, which is real, not imaginary; and manufacturing defects by large automobile manufacturers and others.  They look at it and all they see is fraud, and they want to put the class action mechanism in a straightjacket to make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for people to pursue class actions. They want to put the names of asbestos victims up online for the whole world to see.  Obviously, we have got a division of opinion within the legislative branch. What about the judiciary itself?  Well, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking arm of the Federal judiciary, and the American Bar Association both strongly oppose H.985. The conference report that has been studying class actions for 5 years has considered many of the issues addressed in H.985. It strongly urges Congress not to amend the class action procedures found in rule 23 outside the Rules Enabling Act process.                              {time}  1630  Likewise, the ABA observes the many problems of advancing comprehensive class action reform without a hearing to examine all the complicated issues involved with so many rule changes.  Mr.Chairman, the other side invoked some hearings. I was astonished to hear it because I have been here for several months. I just joined I didn't have any hearings.

It was a completely one-sided, lopsided process, and I will try to get to the bottom of that in order to determine it.  This is what happens when they are moving legislation through this body at lightening speed, but really in the thick of darkness because we don't have any meaningful, transparent communication about what the underlying issues are.  Well, I restate my opposition to this. The class action mechanism has been a central vehicle for justice for Americans for many decades. And now without so much as a hearing, without the mobilization of any proof that this should be done over the objections of the Judicial Conference of the United States, over the objections of the American Bar Association, and over the objections of every consumer group and worker group that has written in that I have seen, they are purporting to be acting in the name of the American people. In fact, what they are doing is they are pulling the rug out from underneath the class action vehicle.  Class actions have been so central to vindicating the rights of people who have been victimized by corporate polluters and toxic contaminators and automobile manufacturers who knowingly put defective instruments into cars, leading to people's deaths and injuries, and they want to make it more difficult for people to pursue justice in the courts.

Although the amendment makes a number of mostly technical amendments to the bill, it still fails to address the numerous fundamental flaws that we have identified in the underlying legislation, which is a dagger pointing at the heart of class action lawsuits in  The major substantive change that I noted under the manager's amendment was that class certification would still be prohibited when a named plaintiff or class representative is a relative or employee of the class counsel, but made some other changes narrowing the scope of the conflict of interest provision slightly. The amendment still fails to address the fundamental problem with that provision, which is that there is no justification for concluding that the specified relationships are, per se, problematic or that class certification should be denied just because such a relationship exists.  The general problem pervading the legislation remains. The first is a procedural problem, which we have identified.  I was delighted that the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Farenthold) responded to our complaint that we had had no hearings on the bill. In response to that, he directed my attention to a hearing that took place in 2011, 6 years ago.

2650,topic-id,366,"Mr.Speaker, we are all painfully aware that Washington's financial control law, Dodd-Frank, is full of provisions that have nothing to do with protecting consumers or preventing another financial crisis.  The SEC rule in question today is no exception. This politically motivated rule, tucked into a provision under the miscellaneous provisions of Dodd-Frank, fails to advance the core mission of the SEC, which is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.  Ensuring that payments by oil, gas, and other mineral companies are transparent and accountable is a worthwhile public policy goal, but it is outside the securities laws' core mission of investor protection.  Not only should this rule and its enforcement fall outside the purview of the SEC, but the rule itself is fundamentally flawed.  Like so many rules and regulations emanating from Dodd-Frank that harm our economy, it is more complex and costly than is required by statute, which calls into question the extent to which it meets the SEC's economic analysis requirement.  The SEC itself estimates the cost for compliance at between $239 million to $700 million initially and from $96 million to $591 million annually after that.  I am also concerned that this rule could force companies to withdraw from certain countries. Among other things, some foreign countries have laws to prohibit the sort of disclosures called for in this rule.  Since the rule provides no exemptions, American firms may be forced to abandon business ventures that provide jobs and opportunities for  I understand that some opponents of our effort have tried to label the SEC's policy as an anticorruption rule.

2623,topic-id,576,"Madam Speaker, I rise to offer the motion to recommit on H.7, the so-called No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  The motion to recommit is very simple. It would amend H.7 to say that nothing in this legislation would allow an insurance company to charge women higher premiums than men just because they are women.  In the first few days of the Trump Presidency, we have seen one action after another to discriminate against women, restrict access to health services, and make their care more expensive. We also know that Republicans are determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would, once again, allow insurance companies to discriminate against women.  Repealing the ACA would be a triple whammy for women. Not only would they have to pay more for their insurance, but their insurance would be less likely to cover the services they need. And these higher costs will take a bigger chunk out of their budget.  Before the ACA, insurers were able to exclude services critical to women's health. And we are not just talking about preexisting conditions, which, by the way, often included having a baby or being the victim of domestic violence.  The benefit package itself left out medical care critical to women. Only 12 percent of plans in the individual market offered maternity coverage. And some insurance plans that offered that coverage imposed waiting periods of a year or charges of up to $10,000 just for maternity care. And even when maternity care was excluded from any insurance plan, insurers still used gender rating to discriminate against women, charging women more just because they were women, regardless of their benefits. Being a woman was a preexisting condition.  Thankfully, the ACA prohibits gender rating. Before the ACA, women were forced to pay between 10 to 57 percent more than men for essentially the same insurance. In my home State of Illinois, women were charged 55 percent more than men for the same coverage. In fact, a 2012 National Women's Law Center study found that 92 percent of best-selling insurance plans were gender rated.  A 25-year-old woman in Arkansas was charged 81 percent more than a man for similar coverage. A 40-year-old woman in South Dakota was charged over $1,200 more a year than a 40-year-old man for the same coverage. In Kentucky, women were charged 57 percent more than men for the same coverage. In Texas, they were charged 56 percent more. In Indiana, they were charged 54 percent more. And the list goes on.  This study even found that over half of all insurance plans charged women who didn't smoke significantly higher premiums than men of the same age who did smoke. Overall, gender rating cost American women about $1 billion a year. It also harmed businesses with predominantly female employees who were routinely charged more for their insurance coverage.  Finally, charging women more for health care is even more devastating when you take into account that women still make only 77 cents to the dollar compared to men. We cannot go back to the days when insurance companies were free to discriminate against women. But that is exactly what Republicans want to do. They want women to pay more for insurance coverage that doesn't include the services they need.  So I am asking my colleagues to support the motion to recommit and protect women from discrimination by insurance companies.  I yield back the balance of my time.

How many more of these dismissals will take place over the next 4 years? How many more firings because the President and his people in the White House do not want to hear a proper legal opinion?  Sally Yates was the Acting Attorney Why wasn't she consulted on the Executive order? Maybe if she had been, they would have learned all of the ways it is legally and constitutionally deficient and the administration would not have issued it.  But here we are, 2 weeks into the new Trump administration. Already we are on the cusp of a constitutional crisis. We are already in a crisis of competence.  A dangerous pattern is beginning to emerge because throughout the past week, incompetence led to chaos at the State Department as well. Before the Secretary of State is confirmed, before any Deputy and Under Secretaries have been named, the President unceremoniously cleared out more than a century of experience among senior officials at the State One of the top officials removed last week was in charge of management issues at the State Department, including security of our embassies and associated personnel overseas. This could potentially put our people overseas at risk and could potentially make it more difficult for our government to conduct the business of our Nation overseas. This makes America weaker, not stronger.  Another official was in charge of ensuring the compliance of nations with whom we have arms control and security treaties. This is an area where my friends from the other side of the aisle--most notably, my friend from Arkansas--demanded robust action under the previous administration, especially with respect to These important issues require continuing senior-level government attention and expertise, not a vacant office.  So, again, incompetence is astounding the American people. It is amazing how poorly done so many things that have come out of the White House in the first 2 weeks have been. It seems the President is treating our Nation's most senior and capable members of his workforce as if this is an episode of ``The Apprentice.''  Unlike on the campaign trail, the President's slapdash decisions, tweets, and the basic incompetence of his administration threatens to spread chaos across the country and across the world, undermining America's global reputation and making Americans less safe--especially the Executive order on immigrants and refugees.  The events of last night make that fact as clear as day. Our country's top lawyers think it is illegal, unconstitutional, and indefensible. An unprecedented number of senior nonpartisan State Department personnel--many of whom served under Republican administrations loyally and ably--signed[[Page S501]]onto a letter of dissent, a memo of dissent, actually, arguing that the Executive order ``will immediately sour relations with much of the Muslim world . . . [and] increase anti-American sentiment'' from seven countries from which not a single refugee has ever committed an act of terrorism in America, not a single one.  Today, even more than yesterday and over the weekend, we have reason to overturn this Executive order. I urge my Republican colleagues to rethink their position, to join us on Senator Feinstein's bill to rescind the order. Then we can actually get to work, actually protecting our country with a smart, thoughtful, and effective policy against terrorism--not with what seems good on a tweet.  I asked a unanimous consent request yesterday because this order is so bad for our safety, for our security, for our troops, for our country, and for the moral leadership that we have always held. There is even a greater need today because we saw what Sally Yates said and the President's actions.  The need to rescind this order is even greater today than it was yesterday, so I am pleading with my colleagues. I know many of you have doubts about this order. You have expressed them. Let's rescind it and really get to work on tightening up our laws and making America safe from terrorists.                   Unanimous Consent Request--240  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Senator Feinstein's bill, 240; that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill; finally, that there be no amendments, motions, or points of order in order to the bill.

Bob Michel was a giant here in Washington, and he left this world in a manner in which he probably would liked to have--without fanfare, without parades, just going home.  As was said, Bob Michel actually served in this House for 38 years. He loved the House of He cherished this Chamber and he cherished this institution. He served as minority leader for 14 years in, as he lovingly called it, the people's House, in this institution he dearly loved.  Few are left in this Chamber who actually served with him. It is my hope that Minority Whip Hoyer gets to the floor, who served with him. I think Steny also tries to represent that era of time when there were people who disagreed without being disagreeable or who could work across the aisle. I look forward to hearing Steny's remarks.  Bob was known for his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone singing voice. I remember once at a Lincoln Day dinner, when he was leaving and I was running, and the people always wanted him to finish the Lincoln Day dinner singing ``God Bless America.'' Always.[[Page H1343]]It was mandatory. But his aw-shucks demeanor and his baritone voice should not distract from his keen legislative ability, where he steered the Reagan Revolution through this Chamber as the minority leader. As those of us who have served post-Bob Michel know, that is a difficult thing to do.  Many times you would see Bob Michel wearing his CIB on his lapel pin. For those of us who served in the military, the CIB is one of the most treasured awards because it means he was an infantryman who served in combat. My colleague, Congressman LaHood, relayed his service from Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge, meritorious service awards, and wounded in combat.

As an avid player myself, we shared fond memories. I pitched, he pitched. I think he won more games than I did. One flaw in Bob Michel's character was being a Cubs fan. As a Cardinals fan, I was able to say that. But when all the ceremonies were going on with the Cubs winning the World Series, I finally found that a reason to be happy about the Cubs' success is that Bob was alive to experience it. In fact, stories over the weekend said he stayed up to see the final play and the final out.

2187,topic-id,324,"Mr.Chairman, my amendment would strike section 1721 of this Fairness in Class Action Litigation Act of 2017. The irony of section 1721 is it unfairly subjects class action plaintiffs to an inevitable deluge of prolonged delay.  A stay of discovery means no depositions. It means injured people will not get essential documents. It means victims will not be entitled to the names of necessary witnesses and more as long as a motion that may dispose of the case is pending. There is nothing to prevent a corporation from filing motion after motion to obstruct a victim's path to justice.  Numerous consumer, civil rights, environmental, labor, and other public interest groups oppose this bill because it builds in an automatic stay of discovery in the district court whenever an alleged wrongdoer files any one of a list of motions, including common motions like a motion to strike, a motion to dismiss, and a motion to dispose of class action allegations. There will be no end to the filing of these motions. This is an invitation for gamesmanship and delay and will deprive judges of the ability to properly manage their cases.  The framers of the bill want you to believe that plaintiffs are greedy, undeserving people who want to hinder small business. This could not be further from the truth. If there are big settlements, it is because the damage to the victims was heinous.  Is there any doubt that huge corporations would file motion after motion to obstruct these victims from getting the facts they need?  Class actions are critical for enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, education, and access to public areas and services.  At the end of the day, if we are trying to reduce litigation, why have this glaring loophole where someone continues to file motions to stop ordinary discovery from going forward?

Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time      limit set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness may      request changes in the transcript to correct errors of      transcription and grammatical errors. The witness may also      bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the      witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about      those facts with a request that it be attached to the      transcript.

2660,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr.Huizenga) for offering the resolution under consideration today.[[Page H854]]  This resolution of disapproval will repeal the SEC's resource extraction rule, which imposes burdensome disclosure requirements on public companies engaged in the commercial development of natural gas, minerals, and oil.  The SEC's mission is to protect investors, maintain efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. Unfortunately, the resource extraction rule is well outside the bounds of these mandates, which acting SEC Chair Michael Piwowar noted in his dissent of the rule saying that it `` . . . neither reforms Wall Street nor provides consumer protection and it is wholly unrelated, and largely contrary, to the Commission's core mission.''  When our businesses are being overwhelmed by compliance obligations, it is crucial that our regulators do everything in their power to ensure regulations do not actively disrupt growth by enforcing nonmaterial, socially motivated disclosures like those included in the resource extraction rule.  The SEC itself has admitted that this rule will be costly. The SEC estimates that the ongoing compliance cost for the resource extraction rule could reach as high as $592 million annually and noted that the disclosure requirements could result in capital being diverted away from productive opportunities. An agency tasked with maintaining efficient markets and facilitating capital formation should not be promulgating unnecessary and burdensome rules like this.  Dodd-Frank is full of examples like the resource extraction rule that require Federal agencies to engage in rulemaking on topics outside of their substantive experience and jurisdiction. In the future, I urge my colleagues to craft legislation in a bipartisan manner that only requires actions consistent with the mission of the applicable agency. Until then, however, it is necessary for Congress to exercise its oversight power to unwind these misguided regulations that have hampered economic growth.  I am happy to lend my support to this resolution and encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.  ",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgH848.txt,1997,1415,2017.0,1.0,January

It repeals an onerous rule that puts American manufacturing and energy companies at a global disadvantage.  Both foreign and American companies sell products and energy in our economy, but only American companies are required to jump through additional hoops, regulations that cost billions of dollars and pass on hundreds of millions of dollars to consumers. Michiganders know all too well what happens when government tips the scale in favor of foreign companies: jobs are lost overseas, and the investment necessary to create jobs is delayed or canceled.  My friends across the aisle have suggested that this resolution is about bribery. It is not. This resolution and, in fact, the election on November 8 is about jobs, the loss of American jobs.  Manufacturers in Michigan don't need special treatment. The unparalleled product of hardworking men and[[Page H855]]women in Michigan speaks for itself.

2558,topic-id,557,"Mr.President, today I wish to continue what has become a tradition. At the beginning of the 112th Congress, Itook to the Senate floor and called for this body to adopt its rules with a simple majority vote and to amend them so theyactually allowed the body to function as our Founders intended.  I did the same at the beginning of the 112th, 113th, and 114th Today, at the start of the 115th Congress, Iagain call for reform. This is something I have done as a member of the majority and the minority. Senator Merkley hasworked closely with me on this issue and spoke briefly yesterday about our efforts.  But we did not start this tradition. It dates back decades. My predecessor, Clinton Anderson, was a leading proponent ofwhat has become known as the ``constitutional option'' in the 1950s and 1960s. Vice President Walter Mondale--then a Senator fromMinnesota--carried on the tradition in the 1970s. When Senator Merkley and I first joined the Senate, Senator Tom Harkinworked closely with us to help us carry on the tradition.  The proposals we have offered to change the rules at the start of a new Congress have never been radical. They were changeswe were willing to live with whether we were in the majority or minority. We have offered the same proposals as Members of themajority and minority. We believe the Senate is broken, and even the minority party should want to fix it.  Congress had made some progress in recent years, but unfortunately, it took unprecedented Republican obstruction to bring itabout. Republicans blocked nominees to all sorts of positions submitted by President Obama, so we took action to change therules to break through the gridlock. It was unfortunate that Republicans precipitated that situation, but the result was for thebest.  New rules allow for a lower cloture threshold for all nominees except those to the Supreme Court now, and the new RepublicanPresident can take advantage of them, just as President Obama was able to do for the final years of his term.  But no one would argue that Congress or the nomination process has been fixed. Further debate and reform is needed on manyaspects of Senate function.  We believe the Senate should openly debate and consider its rules at the start of each Congress, to consider changes thatcan provide commonsense reforms. This ongoing process is the ideal way to restore the best traditions of the Senate and allow itto conduct the business that the American people expect.  We have one goal whether we are in the majority or in the minority: to give the American people the government they expectand deserve--a government that works.  This is not just about rules. It is about the norms and traditions of the  Neither side is 100 percent pure. Both sides have used the rules for obstruction. No doubt they had their reasons.  But I don't think the American people care about that. They don't want a[[Page S47]]history lesson or a lesson in parliamentaryprocedure. They want a government that is fair, that is reasonable, and that works.  I hope that all my colleagues--and especially the new Senators--give serious consideration to reform.  We do not need to win every legislative or nomination vote. But we need to have a real debate and an open process to ensurewe are actually the greatest deliberative body in the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-04-pt1-PgS46-3.txt,1567,BUDGET RIDER,2017.0,4.0,January

Mr.Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the SEC disclosure rule for resource extraction, which is an important tool for Congress to use in disapproving excessive red tape brought by Washington bureaucrats.  The previous administration placed crushing regulatory burdens on the American people. In 2015 alone, Federal regulations cost almost $1.9 trillion--nearly $15,000 per American family. This particular SEC regulation, which was issued by the Obama administration, regarding resource extraction disclosures will make it more expensive for our public companies that are involved with energy production to be competitive overseas with foreign state-owned companies.

The SEC has estimated that ongoing compliance costs for this rule could reach as high as $591 million annually and fully admit that it has the potential to divert capital away from other productive opportunities, like growing a business and creating jobs.  Securities law should not be used to advance foreign policy objectives, particularly when the compliance cost of implementing those objectives is so expensive--with no added benefit of investor protection.  While this rule had already been vacated before the U.District Court of D.in 2013, I am happy that, through this resolution of disapproval, Congress--we the people--can now weigh in as well on this harmful rule.

2715,topic-id,687,"Mr.President, Republicans in Congress have been on the warpath for a long time to repeal the Affordable Care In fact, in this new Congress, their first order of business has been to pave the way for dismantling this law. Despite the fact that 20 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage thanks to this law, despite people no longer being denied coverage for preexisting conditions, despite big savings in health care costs, and despite everyone with insurance being able to access important preventive health services for free, my Republican colleagues have decided to repeal it. And, after 7 years to get ready, they have no replacement, not even a path to a replacement at this point.  Yes, they are set on repealing a law that has provided both health and financial security to millions of Americans, with no replacement in sight, just at this point some empty IOU for some future piece of legislation that may or may not be any good. It is a little like being asked to jump out of an airplane without a parachute and being told: Trust us. We will build the parachute for you before you hit the ground.  We don't know what this nonexistent Republican replacement would look[[Page S422]]like, but we sure do know what a repeal would do; it would gut health insurance premium tax credits that help millions of Americans obtain health insurance they could not otherwise afford. It would unwind an expansion of the Medicaid Program that covers millions more Americans in some 30 States that have chosen to participate, casting tens of millions of Americans--men, women, and children--out of their health insurance.  At the same time, it would deliver an enormous tax boon to millionaires and billionaires, as usual for Republicans, by repealing the revenue we used to pay for This tax boon is a 16-percent reduction in the taxes owed by millionaires and billionaires on their investment income.  Republicans want to take health insurance away from tens of millions of ordinary Americans and simultaneously reward those at the very top of the income pile with a big tax benefit. So much for all the talk we have heard from Republicans about the deficit.  At least in Rhode Island, the Affordable Care Act is working. The law launched accountable care organizations that are improving care while lowering costs. In Rhode Island, Coastal Medical and Integra Community Care Network--two primary care-focused ACOs--are not only driving down per person health expenditures but achieving high marks on quality and on patient experience. In total, Coastal has saved $24 million over 3 years and Integra has saved $4 million in its first year as an  The Affordable Care Act also has protected seniors from the dreaded drug price doughnut hole, and I can tell you I heard a lot about the doughnut hole from seniors in Rhode Island when I was running for the The Affordable Care Act has protected families where someone had a chronic condition and couldn't get insurance, and the Affordable Care Act has prevented insurers from throwing customers off coverage when they get sick.  It is true that some of the health insurance exchanges haven't attracted enough competition. We can fix that. Indeed, to help with that issue, Senators Brown, Franken, and I are today introducing the Consumer Health Options and Insurance Competition Enhancement Act, or the CHOICE Act, to add a public health insurance option to the health insurance exchanges. This public option would guarantee that consumers always have an affordable, high-quality option when shopping for health insurance and a strong health care fallback when markets fail.  ObamaCare may not be perfect, but it has done an awful lot of good. Millions of Americans who lacked insurance now have it, and the rate of uninsured Americans has fallen to 8.6 percent, about half of what it was in 2010. Projected Federal health care costs are down nearly $3 trillion.  Instead of demolishing a system that works well for millions of Americans with no replacement on the horizon, let's use our proposal to make it better. Let's add a public option to our health insurance exchanges.  ",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS421.txt,1823,1700,2017.0,24.0,January

Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires a public company engaged in the commercial development of natural gas, minerals, or oil to report payments made to foreign governments for these natural resources.  At a time when our President and my Republican colleagues are looking to cut regulations on businesses, the SEC estimates that ongoing compliance costs for this rule to be as high as $591 billion. Let me say that again: one agency, one rule, $591 billion.  Let me go back to something many of my colleagues have already mentioned today, the SEC mission. I will quote from their own website. The mission of the SEC is to ``protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.''  If investor protection is truly the mission of the SEC, then why was this provision of the Dodd-Frank listed in the section titled ``miscellaneous provisions''?  Mr.Speaker, American companies should be protected, and no one denies that. But to put them at a competitive disadvantage against their foreign counterparts by implementing this rule is just plain wrong.  Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle will argue that Republicans are gutting an important transparency policy meant to combat corruption. Well, Mr.Speaker, my response to those claims are this: Republicans are the party of transparency. We value accountability. But in this instance, the Dodd-Frank Act instructed a Federal agency, without any substantial experience in resource extraction or foreign policy, to craft this mandatory disclosure for certain public companies. As many of my colleagues have said today, industry is already publicly disclosing the work they do in foreign countries and will continue to do so. The difference is simple; they do it at a level that does not cause competitive harms.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution and erase a top-down, Washington-knows-best provision that is harmful to American companies and American investors.

2598,topic-id,195,"Madam Speaker, life begins at conception. I believe it is our responsibility to protect the millions of unborn children whose voices go unheard.  As a Christian and a father of three, I believe the lives of all children, including the unborn, are just as important as yours or mine. That is why I stand here today in support of H.7. This bill safeguards the lives of unborn children who are robbed of their opportunity to experience the marvels of life.  H.7 closes loopholes that have permitted the subsidization of abortions by taxpayers who are morally opposed to the practice. Additionally, this bill also requires insurance providers who receive Federal subsidies through participation in the healthcare exchanges to report to consumers whether or not they will be subject to a surcharge that covers abortion services at the time of purchase.  It boggles the mind that our Federal Government had the arrogance to skirt longstanding laws in order to trick the American taxpayer into unknowingly contributing to abortions in the first place.  This bill has passed the House numerous times. The merits of the bill are clear. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of H.7.
