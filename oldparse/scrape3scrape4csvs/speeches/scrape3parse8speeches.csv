Mr.Speaker, far too often our brave servicemembers return to civilian life only to find that the skills they have gained in military service do not easily transfer to the job market. These brave men and women who have worked tirelessly to keep their country safe deserve to know that they can thrive here after their service is complete.  For that reason, Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Jobs for Our Heroes Among other critical initiatives to help our servicemembers find civilian employment, this legislation contains my bill, the ADVANCE  The ADVANCE Act will allow Active-Duty servicemembers, reservists, and National Guardsmen to access the same unique testing standards for commercial driver's licenses granted to veterans by the latest surface transportation bill.

Our Nation's heroes deserve to know that the process of transitioning out of the military will be seamless, and this bipartisan legislation will help ensure that is the case.

436,topic-id,237,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4667, which includes provisions of my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform  In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population was affected by at least one disaster. This startling statistic highlights the importance of investing in mitigation infrastructure before tragedy strikes.  Studies have repeatedly shown that, for every $1 invested up front, we can save between $4 and $8 in avoided recovery costs. My bill would allow us to realize those savings by transforming how we approach disaster spending.  It would provide FEMA with the programs, authorities, and resources to help our communities plan for, mitigate against, respond to, and recover from disasters.  Every one of our districts, Republicans and Democrats alike, will be impacted by disaster at some point. In 2011, my own district was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm People lost everything, and homes and businesses were completely wiped out.  I visited with families and employers affected by this tragedy, and it made me realize that we need to do something to help communities build better and smarter before disaster strikes. My bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act, will do just that. It will save lives, lessen damage, and speed up recovery.  I thank Chairman Shuster and my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate for their work on this bipartisan and bicameral agreement.

694,topic-id,465,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of a bipartisan bill, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017, introduced by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer from  I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership and, for my friends on the other side of the aisle, particularly Mr.David Scott from Georgia, for his leadership in support of this legislation.  Among the least transparent and most mysterious black holes of the United States Government is the process under the Dodd-Frank financial control law, by which U.financial firms are designated too big to fail.  Formally called systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, these firms are considered by all-knowing Washington bureaucrats as businesses so critical to the Nation's economy that they need to be burdened with additional regulations, supervised more strictly to further the cause of bureaucrats, and designated as a SIFI to send a clear signal to investors that it is a firm which is most likely to be bailed out by taxpayers during the next crisis.  For bank SIFIs, there is a one-size-fits-all designation model that says that any bank with more than $50 billion in assets is automatically a Bureaucrats do little to nothing to account for the unique nature of each institution that may indicate it is more risk adverse or better positioned to handle a turbulent economy.  Bank SIFIs suffer from the same plight, in that they are not told by the U.Government what they need to do to rid themselves of the shackles of this SIFI designation. Instead, these firms are left in the dark to guess what they can do to de-risk by Federal regulators. And even if firms try to make reforms, they have no idea if the changes they are making will help them shed themselves of this arbitrary designation.                              {time}  1530  In the end, the entire SIFI process does little to make our economy stronger and more resilient. Instead, designated U.firms and their workers are harmed and disadvantaged relative to their international competition, undermining credit availability, causing weaker jobs and economic growth in  For these reasons, I support the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act, which will give much-needed transparency to the SIFI designation process and eliminate the arbitrary automatic SIFI designation of banks with $50 billion or more in assets.  Under this legislation, banks will be judged by their merits, such as interconnectedness, size, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity, and substitutability, and the justifications for a designation will be clearly communicated to them. The end result will be greater credit availability for small businesses, more capital formation, more help for consumers, greater consumer choice, greater economic growth, and greater competition.  Mr.Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr.Luetkemeyer and Mr.Hensarling for their leadership on this critical issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.

On September 5, the President suddenly and cruelly terminated the DACA program. Since that date, 13,000 DACA recipients have lost their status and their protections, and every day that Congress delays a vote, another average of 122 lose their status.  That is why this is urgent, that is why this is important, that is why we need to act now.  Congress should not wait any longer to act. It cannot turn its back on these youths, on these immigrants who are leading productive, positive lives, who are giving back to our communities and contributing immensely to the economy.  Congress has an opportunity today to show the world our values, that we are going to protect DREAMers, that we are going to stand with these young men and women who enrich our country, who only know the United States as their home. The nearly 800,000 DREAMers are our doctors, our nurses, our teachers, our neighbors, and they serve in our military and are protecting us here at home.  But because Congress has not acted and because this Chamber has failed to act on the DACA issue, DREAMers are living in fear and uncertainty of their future. They are afraid to go to school. They are afraid of losing their loved ones at a moment's notice. They are anxious about whether they will be able to continue to earn their paychecks and earn a living.  DREAMers are feeling the pain now. They are experiencing the anxiety now. They are being detained now. These are real people.  Now, I understand their fear and their uncertainty, because, for many of us, this hits real close to home. I have 8,000 DREAMers who live in my district. I also have a family member who is a Many are afraid of being deported to a place where they will be strangers, to a country they haven't lived in since they were children.

The tax relief legislation that we will be voting on will be, I believe, great for America, great for the American people, and it will do a lot for the future of our great country. It has been a long process. There has been a lot of discussion, and there has been years of preparation waiting for today's vote.  The Finance Committee has held over 70 hearings on the subject over the last 6 years. When we were debating it on the floor, we had about 285 amendments offered to this legislation. There have been a lot of changes over the past few weeks to include as many good ideas as possible. After all that, it is understandable that there may be some confusion about what the legislation does. I want to speak today about the various ways that this legislation is good for hard-working Americans, like the people in my home State of  First, most people are going to pay lower tax rates. For a couple who makes between $19,000 and $77,000 a year, the rates are going to drop from 15 percent to 12 percent. So a family might see their tax bill drop by more than $1,000 just from this one part of the Republican tax relief plan alone.  The second thing I want to point out is that this legislation roughly doubles the standard deduction. It goes up to $12,000 for a single person who files and then to $24,000 for a married couple. Well, that is double. People will not have to pay Federal income tax on all of that money--none of it at all. It is a standard deduction of $24,000 for a family. So if we combine that with the lower rates--the lower rates and the higher deduction--it is even more money that people are going to be able to keep of their own money. Instead of having Washington spend it, they can spend it. They are not going to be sending it to Washington for someone else to spend it.  Mr.President, you know as well as I do that people are much better deciders about how their money ought to be spent, and they get a better value for their money than when they send it to Washington for Washington to spend it, supposedly on their behalf. It is not only that. Their taxes might be a lot simpler to figure out come April 15. We have lower rates, a higher standard deduction, and now it is simpler to figure out on April 15.  A lot of people are looking around trying to find deductions they can take and save a little money on their taxes. We have seen that for years--ways to find additional deductions. People save the receipts. Then they look at the receipts. They go through the box and find out what they spent, and how much they spent. They gather up their receipts and fill out extra forms.  Under this tax relief plan, they can choose just to take this much higher standard deduction and not have to spend all that additional time looking through the shoe box of receipts trying to find something they may have spent. This is going to make tax filing a whole lot simpler for lots of  How many people are going to benefit from this? Today about 70 percent of people who fill out their tax form choose the standard deduction. Under this plan, which doubles the standard deduction, we expect that maybe even more than 9 out of 10 Americans are going to be able to use this simplified way of filling out the tax forms. They[[Page S8078]]are going to see that it is really a good deal for them personally, individually, for them and their families.  Millions of people are going to save money and have an easier time filling out their tax form--their tax return--and they will save money. In the past, they had to pay somebody to prepare their taxes for them. They will not have to save the receipts and fill out the extra forms, and they will not have to worry that they are going to be audited by the IRS for trying to keep more of their hard-earned money. They will be able to keep more of their money and use their time doing something else that they actually enjoy doing instead of filling out forms and sending money to the Federal  That is another way Democrats are trying to confuse people. They want people to think tax relief is somehow taking away options. It is actually giving them more options. That is what we are seeing here. It is expanding the standard deduction that a lot of people already use, and many more people will be able to use it under the Republican plan.  That brings me to another important point that I want to make about this tax reduction plan. We did work hard to keep a lot of the deductions that are important to some In some cases, we even made them better. For people who still come out ahead by itemizing their deductions--and there certainly will be some--there is another way that they can keep more of their money. People can still take a deduction if they donate to charity. People can still save money on their retirement savings through an IRA or a retirement plan at work.  If someone has children, we actually double the tax credit they get to $2,000 per child. They don't even have to itemize their taxes to get that $2,000 per child tax credit. It is just a straight tax cut on top of the other cuts they get under this Republican plan. They still get to set up an account to save for their children's education, if they like.  For people who have high medical expenses, this tax relief plan actually saves them more money on their taxes than the old way. Republicans understand that medical costs remain out of control in this country. There were a lot of policies that the Democrats and President Obama put in place that raised the cost of medical care for people all across the country. Republicans are working hard at getting rid of those policies and bringing down the cost of care across the country. Until we get that completely done, this tax relief plan makes it easier for people to deduct their higher medical costs.  So today someone can get tax relief if their medical expenses are more than 10 percent of their income, under the old law. We drop that threshold to 7.5 percent so that more people will qualify. That gives people additional relief while we keep working on ways to reduce the cost of care.  That brings me to another way that this tax relief legislation is going to save a lot of people money. The Republican plan effectively repeals--eliminates--the ObamaCare individual mandate tax. This was the outrageous tax penalty that made ObamaCare a mandatory program by sending the IRS after someone if they didn't have Washington-approved health insurance. You had to pay a tax. You had to pay a fine. People knew it was unpopular. It didn't matter to President Obama and the They took it all the way to the Supreme Court to force people to pay a fine, a tax--to force them to buy ObamaCare health insurance, even though it wasn't right for them or their family and they couldn't afford it.  It didn't matter to the Democrats or President Oh no, you have to buy it. The insurance is too expensive. If you can't buy it, if you can't afford it, tough, pay the tax.  We are eliminating that tax completely. In my home State of Wyoming, over 16,000 people ended up hit with that fine, hit with that tax. Over $6 million was collected from the fine people in my State who couldn't afford ObamaCare insurance. On average, this ObamaCare mandate tax is about $700. The legislation says that tax will, in the future, be zero. It takes ObamaCare from being a mandatory program to turning it into a voluntary program. More than 6 million people paid that tax in the United States this past year. These people will now get a tax break. Under the Republicans, they will see this, and it will affect their lives and give them more money to spend.  It doesn't take away anyone's insurance, as Democrats have claimed. It just says that nobody should have to pay an extra tax just because they decide that overpriced ObamaCare insurance isn't right for them.  So those are just some of the ways this Republican tax plan legislation is good for It saves people money. It saves them time. It gives them more freedom. Together, it is about $1.5 trillion in tax savings over the next 10 years. It is money that families, small businesses, and large employers will not have to send to They can use the money any way they want.  It is interesting. Last week Nancy Pelosi was talking about this Republican tax relief plan. She said:       This is who they are. This is what they came here to do.  She probably meant it as an insult, but she stumbled upon the real difference between Republicans and Democrats like herself. Republicans believe in cutting people's taxes and letting people keep more of their hard-earned money, because we believe hard-working Americans should be able to make the decisions about what money they save or they spend or they invest. It is their money. It is not the government's money, which is the way Nancy Pelosi looks at all of this in terms of ways she can then grow the government.  Republicans look at this and say: How can we give people more freedom?  That is what this legislation does. It is very simple.  I yield the floor.

1047,topic-id,450,"Mr.Speaker, I am one of the few Members that was here back in 1986 when we had the last major tax cut before this body. The President was Ronald Reagan and the Speaker of the House was Tip O'They worked together on a bipartisan basis to cut taxes across the board. The result was the economic growth of the late 1980s and the early 1990s, up until the early 2000s, when we had 9/11. It is one of the best votes that I have ever taken as a Member of this body.  Well, now we are here on another major tax bill. The problem this time around is that there is no bipartisanship.  Why is that, Mr.Speaker?  It is not because the Republicans don't want to be bipartisan. It is because the Democratic leadership this time around has just said no.  This tax bill is a good bill.  The distinguished gentleman from Vermont who just spoke is correct in that it is not revenue neutral. But, Mr.Speaker, revenues are at an all-time high. We are going to raise more money this year than we have ever raised before at the Federal level. Let me repeat that: raise more money than we have ever raised before at the Federal level.

221,topic-id,852,"Mr.President, in 2008, the Senate took up the question of whether to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife I wasn't here at the time, but I remember the issue prompted a rigorous debate.  The Senate spent months on the topic. Experts weighed in, and the American people had a chance to share their views in a fairly open process.  It is worth pausing to recall the context for that discussion. In 2008, America produced nearly 7 million barrels of oil a day and imported another 12 million. The price of oil was roughly $150 a barrel. There was talk about the world hitting ``peak oil.''  In that context, one side claimed that drilling in the Arctic Refuge was needed to boost domestic production, reduce foreign imports, and lower prices at the pump. The other side countered that any economic benefit from drilling was far outweighed by the need to preserve the Arctic Refuge, a jewel of our public lands, a vital habitat for wildlife, and a sacred place for the Gwich'in people--a place so sacred they are reluctant to even enter it.  In the end, after weighing the facts and considering the costs, 56 Senators, included 6 Republicans, voted to protect the Arctic Refuge from drilling.  That was 2008. Now fast forward to 2017. The Arctic Refuge remains a jewel of our public lands. It remains a vital habitat for so many flora and fauna. It remains a sacred place for local tribes, and one of America's most spectacular wild places. The case for preservation has not changed.  By contrast, the case for drilling has never been weaker. Compared to 2008, domestic oil production has nearly doubled. Oil imports are down 22 percent. The price of oil has fallen 50 percent. Terminals we built to import oil and gas are now being used to export oil and gas.  For all these reasons, unlike 2008, oil companies are not clamoring for more opportunities to drill. Just last week, oil companies had the chance to bid on 10.3 million acres open for drilling in In the end, less than 1 percent of the land was leased.  Think about that. We are not even using all of the land now available for drilling in It defies reason that we would open up even more, especially in a place as treasured as the Arctic  All of this is to say that, if it made little sense to drill in 2008, it makes no sense to drill now.  So it should surprise no one that the other side doesn't want a real debate. That is why they tucked this into their massive tax bill, hoping to sneak it in under the hood.  Their justification? We need revenue from the oil to pay down the deficit that we are creating with this tax bill.  There are two problems with that. First, the Congressional Budget Office found that, because of low demand, revenue from drilling would be far less than projected, potentially hundreds of millions less.  Second, the only reason we are having this conversation is because the other side wants to spend $1.4 trillion on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest  Consider this: Their plan spends $37 billion to give an average tax cut of $64,000 to those lucky enough to make over $1 million a year.  To help pay for that, we are about to drill in one of the most stunning places in  I am not opposed to oil and gas production. We need transition fuels as we move toward low-carbon, renewable energy. I also recognize that, for many small towns across America, the oil and gas sector is a rare source of steady, high-paying jobs.  In Colorado, we have managed to increase energy production to meet our growing demand. But we have done so in a way that protects our public lands and creates jobs, for those in oil and gas and our thriving outdoor economy. We have found a way for all sides to win.  If my colleagues from Alaska want to increase energy production, create jobs, and spur growth, I stand ready to help, but let's not pretend that drilling in the Arctic Refuge is the only way to do that.  There are places in America where you can set up an oil rig, lay down[[Page S8179]]roads, and run pipelines in responsible way. The Arctic Refuge is not one of those places. It is a treasure we should leave for our children, not a place to drill for no good reason.  Sadly, the Senate voted to allow drilling in the Arctic Refuge when it took up the broader tax bill.  For every American who opposed this move, know that this isn't over.  Senator Markey and I have authored a bill, which now has 41 cosponsors, that would shield the Arctic Refuge from drilling.  So I urge everyone to keep fighting, to keep speaking out for America's public lands, which are the envy of the world, to keep standing up for the beautiful places in America we must pass on to the next generation, as our parents and grandparents did for us.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8178-2.txt,1965,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1370,",2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
267,topic-id,2355,"Mr.President, I wish to talk about the  As I have from the time I was a school superintendent in Denver until now, I had the opportunity to spend time last weekend or the week before with a group of Dreamers in Alamosa, a small town in Southern  These meetings are usually occasions for people to lay out their dreams for the future in America, the only country they know and the only country they love. This meeting was different than other meetings I have had recently. Instead of the hope and self-confidence I am so used to hearing from young people, what I heard was fear, anxiety, and pain.  Everybody in the group I met the other day came to this country as undocumented immigrants when they were children, some just months old. None of them made the decision to come here. They grew up here, and they know no other country besides the United States of  In 2012, they joined 800,000 Dreamers who came forward across the country to share their information for temporary legal status under the DACA Over the past 5 years, many of these Dreamers grew into young adults, finishing school, starting families, launching businesses. They went about their lives, trusting our government would keep its word and find a way for them to stay in the only country they know. Then, in September, President Trump rescinded DACA, throwing every one of their lives into chaos.  During our meeting in Alamosa, not a single person could share their story without breaking into tears. One young man, Julio Maldanado, told me about the iPhone repair business he opened on Main Like so many immigrants, he poured himself into that enterprise as an entrepreneur. Thanks to his efforts, it is now not only turning a profit, it is providing a service to his community and supporting his family. Now all of that is in jeopardy.  As I said, Julio couldn't tell his story without starting to cry. When he turned to his business partner who was also there to help, his partner began crying too. Versions of that played out again and again in our meetings and in the meetings I have been having here in Washington, DC, as Dreamers take the risk to travel to Washington to share their stories--honest dream after honest dream being crushed by uncertainty, young people trembling in fear.  We hear a lot around this place about how we don't have to act until the last moment. We don't have to act until March 5. This is not true. There are so many children, young people, and young adults in my State who are losing their status as we sit here, unable to accomplish something everybody seems to say they want to accomplish. The President says he wants to accomplish it. The Speaker says he wants to accomplish it. Senators on both sides say they want to accomplish it. We have created this crisis that President Trump set off when he rescinded  This isn't just affecting Dreamers, although that ought to be enough for us to do the job we are supposed to do. For years, farmers and ranchers have told us they need workers with clear legal status. Undocumented workers have told us they face exploitation without legal resources. Families have told us they fear being split apart and sent to places they hardly know, and, today, this week, those fears were confirmed again as we lost another father from Just last week, we had a family torn apart in  Melecio Andazola came to America in 1998 as an undocumented immigrant. Over the last 19 years, he has paid taxes in America, he has raised four children in America, he has followed the rules. Then, on Friday, he was deported.  Now it is unclear whether he will ever see his daughter walk across the stage for her college graduation next spring at Yale, in New It is unclear how he will be able to support his four kids. Because of the choices we have made in Washington, the lives of everyone in that family have been spun into chaos, like so many other families across the country.  For years, stories like this have demanded action. That is why the Senator from Illinois who is here today, Senator Durbin, has led this charge for so many years, standing on the floor with photos of the Dreamers from his State and across the United It is the reason I was so honored to have the chance to work with him and six others of our colleagues back in 2013, the so-called Gang of 8, a group of four Democrats and four  I was just talking with my friend from Oklahoma about how this place doesn't work. That was an instance where it worked. We came together to write a bipartisan proposal for immigration reform. Over the course of 8 months, in Washington, we worked through a process that I think would make every American proud for once--both sides sitting down to solve problems. The result was a great piece of legislation.  Our bill had more funding for border security, not just a wall but smart and effective border security. It had more funding for internal security. It had a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people who are here, including all of the Part of that bill had the most progressive DREAM Act ever written. It got 68 votes on the floor of the Not everyone got what they wanted. As I just said to the Senator from Oklahoma in a different context, it is unreasonable to expect that here. Each side had to give, but the result was a great vote. It got almost 70 votes in the Senate, at a time when you can't pass anything through the  For the first time in a generation, we had a real opportunity to resolve our differences on immigration, but as is so often the case in Washington, politics got in the way. In the House, Republican leaders denied our bill a simple up-or-down vote, which would have[[Page S8218]]passed. They preferred to keep immigration alive as a political weapon to divide the American people and distract from the real challenges in our economy.  By the way, the Senator from Illinois will remember this. We heard a lot of stretching this week about how much economic growth this tax bill was going to create--0.6 percent here or 0.1 percent over there. The CBO estimate on the Gang of 8 immigration bill was that by bringing people out of the shadows and putting them in a position to contribute legally to the economy, that would have added 3 percentage points to our GDP, to our Nation's economy over the first 10 years, and five incremental points over the second 10 years. That would have been a useful thing to do for our economy.  As a result of what happened--or didn't happen--in the House, the rhetoric around immigration has just become more toxic, evermore divisive, evermore unrecognizable in America, a Nation that has inarguably been made great by immigrants.  As I said, there are a lot of economists who are awfully skeptical about the economic claims that have been made about this tax bill. If we look at what happened in 2001 and 2003, when they tried to do it before, we all know how that story is going to end. On the other hand, nearly every expert agrees that forcing out the Dreamers would hurt our economy.  The Cato Institute found that removing the Dreamers would stunt economic growth by $280 billion. Another study found that comprehensive immigration reform would grow the economy by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and support nearly 1 million new jobs.  Despite these facts, there has been a lot of talk around here about how immigrants detract from America or how they somehow leach off the system and lack our values. Those claims are then used to justify actions like canceling It would be hard for me to believe that anybody making a claim like that had ever sat down with a  Daniela Gomez Castro came to Colorado when she was just a year old. As a child, Daniela looked up to her grandmother--one of the few women doctors in her area--and dreamed of following her into medicine. She took classes in biology and excelled in our public schools, graduating from Smokey Hill High School in 2015.  To become a doctor, she knew college was the next step, so she enrolled at the University of Colorado Denver as a prehealth major, and in between classes, she worked as a nurse's assistant, restaurant hostess, and student mentor to help cover tuition. Everything was on track. Then, last year, she learned her legal status meant she couldn't get a medical license. After working so hard for so long, her dream is now frozen in place by forces in Washington totally beyond her control.  Today, America--especially places like rural Colorado--is desperate for physicians. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts that, by 2030, we will have a shortage of 100,000 doctors nationwide. As I say, we are feeling that shortage right now in rural We don't have enough clinics and treatment centers, even as we face an epidemic of opioid addiction. Two of our counties don't have a single doctor, and a lot of our rural counties have no primary care doctor or nurse.  Given that, it doesn't seem to me to make any sense that we should send Daniela back to a place she doesn't remember and doesn't call her home, especially when we need her here. That obviously would be cruel, but my point is, it would also be incredibly shortsighted.  Apolinar Lopez Garcia also came here when he was just a year old. His family eventually made their way to Greeley, He thrived in school and joined the Junior ROTC Program in Northridge High School, where he excelled as a cadet. He relished the ROTC sense of community, self-discipline, and duty, so much so that after graduating from high school, he wanted to enlist in the U.Marine He filled out the paperwork and waited, but when the reply came, Apolinar was crushed. Because of his legal status, the Marines couldn't accept him.  We should think about that. Of all the paths available to a bright, young person like Apolinar, he wanted to serve the country in uniform. You don't feel called to serve a place you don't consider home.

For years, America has invested in them, by educating them, by training them, and instilling in them the confidence and love of country we hope for each new generation of  It is unimaginable now that we wouldn't find a way to resolve their status. We can't avoid this any longer. The Senate and the House are so good at putting off what they should have done last week or last month or last year. This is not one of those cases anymore.  On each day we do nothing, 112 people are deported. Over 12,000 people have been deported since Every one of them represents a family torn apart, a business shuttered, a payroll not made, an education interrupted, a dream shattered. In the end, our most basic job here--lost in this sometimes--is to look out for the next generation of Instead of looking after them, we have spent an entire year trampling over them.  Let's review the record.  With the Dreamers, we have ransomed their futures for political leverage. We are doing it right now. With our backtracking on climate change, we have made their futures more dangerous and costly. With our failure to reauthorize CHIP, we have jeopardized the healthcare of, among others, 90,000 kids in Colorado who may lose healthcare if we don't act. Now, with this tax bill, we have handed another $1.4 trillion in debt to people whose futures we are not investing in because we say we cannot afford to do it--by rebuilding our roads, by improving our schools, by spurring innovation. Instead, we have taken another bet on trickle-down economics at a time when we already have a substantial budget deficit.  That is what brings us here at the end of the year, once again, with our not having done our work and passing something called a continuing resolution that no other government enterprise in America gets to do--a temporary budget that doesn't reflect the priorities of the American people. In that mix, the Dreamers find themselves caught up in a political discussion without any assurance that it will be resolved.  The good news is that I know there are Republican colleagues here, as well as Democrats, who want a solution for the They see in these young people all of the qualities we cherish as Americans--family, community, service, enterprise, and patriotism.

After a while, something inadvertent has to be advertent because if you have knowledge of it and if you know what is going to happen, it leads you to believe that you should have acted. We need to stop the brinksmanship and the partisanship, and we need to work together to ensure that their futures will be here in the United States, where we need them, in the only country they know.

305,topic-id,626,"Mr.President, this is not the topic that I came to the floor to talk about; I will talk about it in a minute. But while the Senator from Oklahoma is here, I thought I would just respond to what he was saying--not on the merits of his particular proposal, because I haven't had a chance to study that yet, but to his plea that this place start to work again. I couldn't agree more with that sentiment.  The Founding Fathers were very deliberate people, and they understood that in exercising self-government in the Republic that they were establishing, which subsequent generations of Americans have made more democratic over time, that we would have disputes. People these days in our political system and especially on the cable television at night seem to be astounded that there are people who don't see the world the way they see the world. The Founders knew that, by definition, if we were going to be a self-governing republic, we would have disagreements, and they set out to form[[Page S8217]]an incredibly elegant mechanism to resolve those disputes. It was elegant on the outside of this Chamber--freedom to assemble, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to vote--and it was elegant on the inside of this And generations of people who occupied this place understood that the way it was meant to work was not that you always got your way all the time and that part of being here was not just to have disputes but to resolve disputes--and not even our disputes but disagreements that the country might have for a legitimate reason--and, on average, hoped that we would move the country forward.  I quite agree that recently--certainly in the time that I have been here--we have been using this place simply to have disputes, not to resolve them. That may be OK if we were in North Korea or in the Soviet Union--the old Soviet Union; it doesn't work in a democratic republic.  I want to finish a little bit of the history that my friend from Oklahoma talked about. After the Democrats invoked the nuclear option, which I have said before on this floor is the worst vote that I ever took as a Senator, the now majority leader pocketed that precedent when we changed the rules in the middle and used it--used the nuclear option to change the rules so that now a person gets a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court not with 60 votes but with just 51 votes. My issue with that is that now your party can advance people to the Supreme Court without any reasonable expectation that my party should take responsibility for it, or vice versa.  Instead of having potential nominees come here and say: You should put me on the court because I can attract both Democratic and Republican votes because I have an open mind, I worry we are going to have people from both sides say: We are going to have a litmus test for Supreme Court nominees, which says we either have the most conservative jurist in the country or the most liberal jurist in the country, depending on who it is. We have infected the Supreme Court with the partisanship of this body.  My hope is, we can actually come together on a set of rule changes that would recognize not just that this place may need to move a little faster in the 21st century but that we ought to be pushing people together to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the country.  Without passing on the merits of the proposal, I thank the Senator for coming to the floor to talk about--to put it in the vernacular--how busted this place is.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8215.txt,1965,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 1370,",2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

768,topic-id,228,"Mr.Speaker, the tax bill we passed today has little in common with what Speaker Ryan described to us yesterday. Putting more money into the pockets of working people would be great, but that is not what they wrote this bill to do.  I have grown a business, made payroll every 2 weeks for more than 40 years, and invested many millions of dollars in plant and equipment. I still voted ``no,'' though, because I was just wise enough to realize that without our people, our employees, we have nothing. I would be enthusiastic about a tax bill that actually put more money into their pockets instead of mine.  We have 381 hardworking men and women on our payroll today. Not a single one will benefit from the doubling[[Page H10333]]of the estate tax exclusion, but every one will be affected by the medical insurance premium rates, which this bill will drive up.  Every one will be at risk when their minimal so-called tax cuts expire in just a few years. Mine, by the way, are permanent. Our children and grandchildren will suffer ever more greatly as we continue to balloon the Federal debt.  This tax bill may be the greatest transfer of wealth from working Americans to the idle rich in the history of our country.

77,topic-id,962,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding.  This is a very important topic. I am going to touch on this by beginning with this idea of the distinction between the current administration and its foreign policy as outlined in the recent statement from President Trump and that of the previous administration.  The distinction is very clear. The previous administration basically clung to an idea of neo-liberal institutionalism. That is to say, where there was a vacuum of power, we did not set the stage. America did not fill it. It remained a vacuum, with the idea being that an institution would fill that. Maybe the United Nations, maybe some other regional institution. But in doing so, we ceded over much of our sovereignty and failed to act to preserve and protect America's best interests.  The current administration has taken a more realistic point of view. They are realists. That is, America's interests will be first and paramount. We will see to it, we will foster alliances, and we will foster participation with our fellow nations to preserve America's best interests.  When America is strong, there is a greater chance for peace in the world. I believe that. That is the position of realists all the way back to Hans Even neo-realists like Kenneth Waltz might agree.  One thing that we know is that this particular episode that unfolds is a scandalous episode that put America in greater danger, probably, and perhaps, in order to foster political gains by the previous administration.  One Treasury Department official who served in the Obama administration testified to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that, under the Obama administration, these Hezbollah-related investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.  That becomes the heart and the rationale for how the previous administration handled a political decision instead of a foreign policy national security decision.  We know a number of things that took place, and this is why the House needs to conduct its own investigation: so we can know how this played out, why this played out, who is responsible, and we can resolve never to do this again.  We had Project This was a DEA campaign designed to expose a money laundering scheme in which Latin American drug-running was being funneled to  Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Lebanese malitia and has been a foreign terrorist organization since 1987, and so designated. It fosters alliances with rogue nations such as North Korea, Iran, and is violently anti-Israel and anti-United  It has become a player in international cocaine trafficking--using the proceeds of that drug trafficking to purchase explosives, EFPs, which is the deadliest type of IED used against American soldiers in  EFPs killed hundreds of American soldiers, and they were supplied by the Iranian Government and its Hezbollah allies. EFPs were literally ripping M1 Abrams tanks in half. It is a weapon that makes all the armor protection they have irrelevant. Mere threats of EFPs shut down all ground supply routes near American bases on the Iranian border.  The result: cut off the head or the financing of Hezbollah through these international cocaine distribution routes.  Project Cassandra was born in 2008. It found clear evidence that Hezbollah had grown from a Middle East-focused military and political organization into an international crime syndicate, likely collecting somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities.  For 8 years, DEA agents conducted high-stakes investigations--dangerous investigations--using technology as well as undercover operations and informants. That type of capital is expensive and dangerous.  The result was to map these illicit drug networks. They did this with the help of 30 U.and foreign security agencies. They saw worldwide, far-flung international drug trafficking from South America to Africa, from Europe to the Middle East, and in the United States, where drug funds were funneled through an array of businesses, including used car lots.  What happened?  As we saw the previous administration's desire and design to leave a signature legacy foreign policy win, the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal got going and were in place. Project Cassandra's agents say the Justice and Treasury Departments repeatedly hindered their attempts to pursue these investigations--the prosecutions, arrests, and financial sanctions against the key figures in this far-reaching drug scheme.  This was a policy decision. It was a systematic decision.  David Asher is quoted as saying: ``They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.''  They didn't bring criminal charges. They didn't continue to pursue these Hezbollah members or the banks that were laundering those billions in drug profits. Instead, they tore down the apparatus that was working on apprehending the head of the snake.  Well, we are going to go on with this. We need to go on with this. We need to investigate this further. This type of political decision that impacts and actually works cross-wise to our very purpose in the Middle East must be stopped, and we must find out why that happened. Those who allowed our men and women to be put in harm's way for a political decision need to be held accountable.  So, Mr.Speaker, those who cling to the neo-liberal institutionalist mantra, who rely on multilateral institutions rather than putting America first, are the ones who produced this result.  We are going to find out more in the coming weeks. My request is that the leadership in Congress, in this House of Representatives, instigate and prosecute an investigation to get to the bottom of this very heinous and very wrongheaded and dangerous decision.  I thank the gentleman for allowing me to participate and for his lead on this tonight.

149,topic-id,305,"Mr.Speaker, this is truly a monumental day for the American people.  During my 7 years here in the House serving on the Ways and Means Committee, we have studied, considered, and outlined the sorts of reform that could benefit the American people.

It has been more than three decades since our Nation's tax system has been modernized, and this is finally the day to change that.  I want to remind my colleagues that the process began long before this year. When passage of the budget provided the key, our ideas for conservative tax reform were finally unlocked and could be pursued for real tax reform.

457,topic-id,658,"Mr.Speaker, it has come to this: Republicans are poised to pass the largest transfer of wealth in our Nation's history, financed by mortgaging our children's future with a mountain of increased debt.  What is wrong with this picture?  Well, first of all, nobody really knows everything that is in this bill. It has been written over the last few days to satisfy donors and win the final few votes necessary for Senate passage. It is not tax reform. It is not even a policy, but a collection of special interest provisions being sold on a false set of promises.  It is, decidedly, not middle class tax relief. It is permanent, massive tax reductions for the largest corporations and wealthy individuals. Every independent expert agrees and the American public understand that the benefits of this bill flow not primarily to the middle class, but to people like Donald  The vast majority of Americans get little and temporary tax reduction, only to see the bottom 80 percent of our taxpayers, on average, actually facing a tax increase when the bill is fully phased in.  The permanent, massive tax reduction for the privileged few comes at a very high cost for the rest of Despite false promises, it will not remotely pay for itself through economic growth.  We start with a massive increase in national debt; increased interest costs; a total increase of $2.3 trillion, and likely very higher as the accountants and lawyers discover how to fully exploit the many new loopholes created by lobbyists.  This bill is not tax simplification. It greatly complicates the Tax Look at trying to understand just the passthrough provisions.  Also, we have an IRS that is struggling right now because my Republican friends have cut its budget 17 percent since 2010. They have 23,000 fewer employees, an outmoded data processing system, and more taxpayers--10 million more returns. It is not clear the IRS can even administer this bill.  Middle America will pay with increased economic insecurity, as it will increase insurance premiums an average of 10 percent a year. It will destabilize the health insurance market and increase the ranks of the uninsured by 13 million people over the next 10 years.  Most Americans will pay the price with the massive increase in debt, making it harder for everyone who wants to borrow money to start a business, finance a college education, or buy a home. It increases the likelihood of sending even more American money overseas to pay for the foreign holders of American debt that has increased.  It does not address the problem of offshoring our economic activities and the resulting revenue loss. It provides more incentives for this to continue and even get worse. The increased debt will make it even harder to rebuild and renew America and to meet the needs of our aging and growing population.  After the wreckage of the Amtrak train in the Pacific Northwest, Trump pointed out the need for infrastructure investment to rebuild and renew the country. That is not going to happen.  It is already triggering an automatic $25 billion cut in Republicans are scrambling to figure out how to avoid that. We are hearing from Republican leadership that this increased debt illustrates the need to cut back on programs that meet the needs of average Americans and low-income citizens while we are showering increased tax benefits on the wealthy.  It has been a bonanza for all the attorneys, accountants, and lobbyists finding ways to further enrich the most privileged. In the weeks to come, we will find out more special gifts used to nail down the last few votes. I don't know whether the Corker kickback is true or not, but it leaves the public wondering why the immediate about-face from the Senator from Tennessee when nothing has changed except there have been a few provisions added.  No wonder the American public is opposed. They are right, and the Republicans are wrong.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgH10183-3.txt,99,VENEZUELA HUMANITARIAN CRISIS,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122,topic-id,1625,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, Senator Mark Warner from Virginia, for his powerful and eloquent remarks on the floor less than 24 hours ago. He talked about the threat that exists now--looming larger every day--of a constitutional crisis. It is a crisis that threatens the foundations of our democracy. It involves a potential confrontation and, indeed, a legal conflagration between the President of the United States and the special counsel who has been appointed to investigate wrongdoing in our government.  None of the facts that justified--indeed, required--the appointment of a special counsel has been controverted in any reasonable way by anyone since[[Page S8208]]the appointment of that special counsel. Now a campaign of mistruth and misdirection has been launched against that special counsel investigation. It is a campaign that is calculated, concerted, and coordinated. It is calculated because it is planned and premeditated; it is concerted in its consistency and vehemence; and it is coordinated among officials within the government, including the U.Congress and commentators and individuals outside the government.  The danger of a constitutional crisis is real and urgent, and we must come together in the U.Senate to face it and address it and deal with it.  This body has come together in the past when America has faced a foreign adversary that has sought to do our Nation harm. We have come together to hold our leaders accountable when they have broken faith with the American people. We have come together when forces of dissension and misdirection have sought to undermine or weaken respect for the law and law enforcement and, indeed, the rule of law. What is at stake here is nothing less than the rule of law.  Let's recognize what is happening. The President, in effect, is going down two tracks. On the one hand, he is saying that he has no present intention to fire the special counsel or to pardon anyone--yet. He adds that word very distinctly. The other track involves a coordinated, concerted, and calculated campaign that is continuing--indeed, rising--in intensity and volume.  The President's supporters, even in raising that volume, have reached extraordinary lows. Let's remember. At first, our Republican colleagues appeared to recognize that Robert Mueller was eminently--indeed, uniquely--qualified for his important task. Republican House Members called him a ``man of the utmost integrity'' and ``someone we all trust.'' Now we hear that the Mueller investigation is somehow biased. One commentator known to be close to President Trump suggested that the special counsel should not only be fired, he should be arrested. Even Members of Congress who once recognized Mr.Mueller's stellar record as a member of the Armed Forces, as well as in his capacity as the FBI Director, as a prosecutor, and as a public servant, have impugned his integrity. Indeed, they have begun to sow seeds of doubt.  A chorus of defenders and sycophants has launched this campaign--calculated, concerted, and coordinated--to smear the special counsel, to impugn the integrity of the FBI--to, indeed, directly attack this great and important institution. They have decided to do it in that concerted and coordinated and calculated way. The President, himself, has said that the FBI's reputation is in tatters.  An article that appeared today in POLITICO described an effort by a House Republican on the Intelligence Committee to initiate a sustained attack on the Department of Justice and the The President's chorus of defenders and sycophants describes routine law enforcement activities as a ``coup'' and traffics in the kinds of conspiracy theories that we usually associate with fringe internet chat rooms.  What is their justification for this vituperative attack on the Department of Justice and the FBI?  One of the FBI agents expressed his political views in a private text to an FBI attorney, but the special counsel took swift and decisive and deliberate action to remove that FBI agent from the investigation.  More broadly, let's recognize the reality here. As a Federal prosecutor, as the U.attorney for Connecticut for 4\1/2\ years, and then as the State attorney general for 20 years, I know--and all of us who have been prosecutors know--that investigators, like FBI agents, have political views. Some are on the right end of the political spectrum; some are on the left. The mark of their professionalism is that they leave them at home when they go to work. They park them at the door, not just because it is what they are taught and trained to do, but they believe in unbiased law enforcement because they know that a criminal investigation, ultimately, comes down to facts and law. It cannot be based on political opinions. Investigations that are biased by political opinions are doomed to disaster.  Perhaps most importantly, there is not a scintilla of fact--not a shred of evidence--that the special counsel investigation has been impacted in any way by any political view of any FBI agent or, for that matter, anyone else in that investigation. There is, simply, no evidence that political views have impacted the special counsel's investigation.  The simple fact that prosecutors know is that all such investigations must seek to uncover the facts and apply the law, and that is what Special Counsel Robert Mueller has done. The proof is in the results so far--two powerful convictions that have shattered the Trump Presidency and two indictments that indicate this investigation is just at its beginning, not at the beginning of the end but, simply, the end of the beginning. These trials of the two indictments will go well into next year, as will the investigation. That there will be more convictions and more indictments, I think, can be pretty reliably predicted to a near certainty.  Beyond this investigation, we all know in this Chamber--and, certainly, any of us who have been involved in law enforcement--that public trust and confidence are essential. The President, himself, has said he is ``a true friend and loyal champion'' for law enforcement and ``more loyal than anyone else can be.'' He has pointed out that law enforcement officials, like our police and FBI agents and DEA and others, ``rush into danger every day,'' and he has criticized the folks who have subjected them to ``relentless criticism.'' He has promised to always stand with them. Those promises apply, apparently, to law enforcement as long as they are not investigating him.  The President has said that he has no present intention to fire the special counsel, but he has far from ruled it out. For anyone who thinks it would be too outside the bounds of normal standards, remember that the firing of Jim Comey as FBI Director was regarded as unthinkable. It was unthinkable until President Trump did it.  Equally important, this chorus of defenders and sycophants can undermine the Mueller investigation even if Mueller, himself, is never fired. They can poison the well of public opinion and, indeed, a jury pool. They can sow seeds of doubt regarding the special counsel and his team, and they can lay the groundwork for firing Robert Mueller as well as for issuing pardons.  Let no one have any doubt. Firing Robert Mueller would create a firestorm that would be every bit as vehement as the Saturday Night It would provoke an uprising, an outcry, and outrage in the American people and in this The time to make that fact clear is now, not just for this side of the aisle but with unanimity and force on both sides.  That chorus of defenders and sycophants may think or imagine it can prevent the special counsel from revealing his finding or reporting to the American people at the conclusion of his investigation or that it can discredit or demean those findings or that it can undermine his credibility before a jury. It would be wrong because this body and our colleagues are committed to uncovering the truth, to pursuing it wherever it leads, and to enforcing the law.  That is my hope and belief, but it must not only be a hope; it must be reflected in action--in real action. That involves passing legislation that will send a message about this body's resolute and unwavering commitment to making sure that the special counsel cannot be fired, that pardons cannot be issued, and that this investigation cannot be a victim of political interference.  The President has indicated that he is averse to hearing about Russia or considering its threat to this country. That aversion certainly sets back his ability to defend this country against the Russian threat by sanctions and other means and deterrents that will assure that Russia is made to pay a price so they do not do it again.  In conclusion, let me just say that that aversion must be overcome. We need to send a signal, as we did by passing sanctions, that we will take action against Russia to stop it from interfering again in this election, that we will make sure that Russia is made to pay a price, and that our constituents know that we will insist on a fair[[Page S8209]]and independent investigation without political interference, passing legislation that is bipartisan that has been offered by Republicans as well as Democrats, including myself, and should be moved through the Judiciary Committee and to the floor of this That message is all the more important now as this investigation penetrates the White House for the first time in the Flynn conviction, coming closer to the Oval Office itself. A real and robust congressional investigation of those efforts through the Judiciary Committee, as well as obstruction of justice, continues to be necessary, but we should combine our efforts to make sure that law enforcement and the judicial process moves forward without political interference that will undermine its credibility.  I yield the floor.

770,topic-id,2332,"Mr.President, a tax bill is a fiscal document. It is a legal document. It is also a moral document. It involves choices, much as we make choices as families when we own a car that is unsafe or a house that has a front step that is about to collapse or when a college student needs money to pursue her education. A family can make choices. A parent can go to the casino and gamble and lose the money or spend it on luxuries that are unnecessary or unwise, and nations make those kinds of moral choices as well.  This tax document is a moral document. It involves choices. Will it make our country safer, rebuild our infrastructure and our national defense or, instead, in effect, squander resources of $1.5 trillion or more on a giveaway to the very wealthiest in our country? It relates directly to the tragedy that this Nation experienced outside of Tacoma, WA, just yesterday.  I want to extend, first of all, my thoughts and prayers to those families and loved ones who have suffered losses. The three deaths and injuries have taken their toll emotionally as well as physically. In these dark days, we are demanding answers.  Unfortunately, the National Transportation Safety Board is there, beginning its investigation. We know now that the train apparently was traveling three times the limit on speed, 80 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone. That fact is absolutely stunning and scandalous, and the NTSB, no doubt, will present its results after its investigation.  I call on the NTSB to finish that investigation as promptly and quickly as possible. As responsible an agency as it is, it often works much more slowly than taxpayers deserve. I call on it to produce its investigation, not in months or years but in days or weeks. We need to know the answers as to why this catastrophe occurred. We now know with certainty, apparently, that the train was traveling too fast.  You may be forgiven for thinking it seems like deja vu. Didn't that happen also in Spuyten Duyvil, where four people were lost? Didn't it happen in Philadelphia, where eight were killed in 2015? Yes, again, three people were killed yesterday.  Three hundred people have been killed in these accidents since 1970, when the NTSB first recommended impementing this new technology. It[[Page S8079]]was new technology in 1970 called positive train control. Now it is old technology, but it still has not been installed in many of the Nation's railroads. The deadline for installing it was postponed from 2015--over my vehement protests and those of others on our side of the aisle in the Commerce Committee and on the floor of the U.Senate--until 2018. Even now, the railroads are seeking an extension to that time, saying that the resources aren't available.  Well, the costs of those 300 lives lost and of the crashes that have resulted from derailments and other kinds of very severe mishaps due to excessive speed are way in excess of the costs of installing positive train control since 1970, since 2015, and if it is postponed again, the costs will exceed the expenses that we saw in the system.  It is available now. It is fully ready for installation on railroads across the country. The resources aren't preventing its installation; it is the will and determination to do so.  The failure of Federal authorities to require and provide support for positive train control is a moral choice this Nation has made. It is not only about dollars and cents; it is about basic moral choices, and those choices are a factor in those three deaths outside of Tacoma, We know excessive speed was a factor. We know positive train control slows down trains when they are going too fast in zones where the limit is 30 miles an hour rather than the 80 miles an hour that this train was traveling. Regardless of driver fatigue or distraction, regardless of any of the other contributing sources, positive train control is there to stop or slow down trains when human error may lead to crashes.  The new deadline is now 1 year away. If we do nothing else in this Congress, let us insist that this deadline be met without additional delay. Our failure to do so would be a moral failure.  The dollars and cents required to install positive train control and to repair our aging and decrepit roads and bridges involve investment.  To show you what is happening in Connecticut, very much like the rest of the country, we know that 78 percent of our roads are in poor or mediocre condition. That is a moral choice, not just a physical choice. It has the same kinds of consequences as failure to install positive train control. The cost per motorist annually is $864, which is needed for vehicle repairs from driving on roads that are in disrepair.  Now, as a result of this so-called tax cut, a lot of people in Connecticut are going to, perhaps, see a few crumbs, a few sweeteners--very minor deductions in their tax bill. It is nowhere near the $864 that they are now paying because of inadequate roads and bridges. That is a hidden cost. It is a moral choice because it not only creates costs in vehicle wear and tear, it also leads to crashes that, in turn, take lives and cause injury.  This legislation will put America in debt by $1.5 trillion. That is a moral choice because it shifts the burden of tax breaks and giveaways now to future generations. It also deprives us right now of funds that could be applied to infrastructure--rebuilding roads and bridges.  Lest you think the Connecticut situation is an anomaly or an exception, the grade for our Nation as a whole in infrastructure is a resounding D-plus.  I know this may seem to many of my colleagues like an oversimplification. Yes, it is, but it is an oversimplification with real facts that support it and with real consequences to the American people.  When the President of the United States suggests in a tweet, as he did yesterday after the Tacoma tragedy, that his infrastructure program will be ready ``soon,'' that is ducking responsibility. It is a moral choice because ``soon'' has meant delays, month after month, into the first year of his He can take action today. He can disavow this shameful program that he has supported--the tax cut that slashes resources for the Federal Government--and, instead, decide that investment is the right course--investment in roads, bridges, rail, broadband, VA facilities, ports, and airports. That is a moral choice that this tax scam makes.  It is a tax scam with moral consequences in terms of inequality in this It tilts the benefits in favor of corporations and the wealthiest who will receive permanent tax cuts. It will hurt working families, students, public schools, firefighters, police officers, local government, and sick people, who will receive nothing but crumbs by comparison.  It will desperately hurt States like Our State and local taxes will no longer be deductible above set limits; $10,000 will barely cover and, in fact, will fail to cover many, many of the tax bills that formerly could be deducted. It will impose limits on mortgage interest deductions that will harm our real estate industry in Connecticut and many other States across the country.  Yes, there are crumbs and sweeteners, and they are temporary. They pale in comparison to the tremendous benefits that will go to corporations and the wealthiest.  It narrows our tax base, shifting the burden, in fact, from corporations to individuals. It makes the Tax Code more complicated, not less so. It grossly increases inequality, and it steals $1.5 trillion from our children and from us insofar as it deprives our national defense, as well as our infrastructure, of resources that are needed.  I am a member of the Armed Services Committee, and I remember very well the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mike Mullen, saying, ``The most significant threat to our national security is our debt,'' which surprised me at the time. For the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to say that the biggest threat to our national security is our national debt--how could that be? Well, having watched the National Defense Authorization Act year after year, constrained by resources that are now going to be less available because of this $1.5 trillion debt--and larger, probably--that is created by this tax plan, I better understand what he meant.  The Republicans are essentially pursuing two inherently irreconcilable objectives. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a man whom I respect as much as anybody in this Chamber, has called for an additional $430 billion over the next 5 years to build up our military and rebuild it. I can tell you without doubt that there is no way to increase defense spending by $86 billion every year, as the chairman has said we need, while slashing Federal revenue $150 billion every year. The math fails. It will not work.  So for my Republican colleagues to say that we need to rebuild, we need to invest in our national defense and in our military and in the skill training of our warriors is a fiction. It is blatant deception, and it is a disservice to the brave men and women who have enlisted and serve us in uniform now and others who will join them in the future. We cannot have the most advanced and strongest military in the world if we use the same tax code as the Cayman  This year, our country experienced a tragic loss of life--in fact, the loss of more than life, needlessly, preventably. Seventeen sailors perished on the USS John McCain and the USS Two of them were from I attended ceremonies in their honor. Those deaths are largely attributable to a lack of resources. There may have been other causes, but this tax bill is a moral choice about our military. The failure to invest in those ships, in the training and necessary rest that is required for our men and women in those positions, will be aggravated by the debt we see here.  Our national security is more than just military spending in the face of Russian cyber attacks in our elections, horrific hurricanes hitting Puerto Rico and Texas and Florida, and fires still burning in Western We know our military alone is not enough to keep us safe and secure. Those natural disasters and those challenges from our adversaries require investment as well, and, again, the loss of this $1.5 trillion to debt that will be paid largely by future generations is something that hobbles our ability to make our Nation safe and secure.  This tax scam is morally reprehensible. It cuts taxes for the wealthiest while jeopardizing programs that are essential to the safety and security of many in our Nation who are most vulnerable.  Under current law, the GOP tax plan will trigger $25 billion in Medicare cuts next year alone. With this self-inflicted[[Page S8080]]$1.5 trillion hole in our Federal deficit, we know what will come next: savage attacks on Social Security as well as Medicaid and This assault on healthcare doesn't end with these programs. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate will raise premiums and eventually lead to $13 million--13 million--more uninsured  Republicans are sabotaging these critical programs that provide care to the most vulnerable Americans so those at the top can avoid paying their fair share.  What corporations benefit the most? There is a very simple answer. The ones that benefit the most with foreign cash that will be distributed almost certainly to their shareholders and to their CEOs are listed right here. In the red is the foreign cash, and the total is listed as well. They are the ones who are going to benefit. Apple has been singled out as the single largest beneficiary, but many other corporations around the country will benefit as well.  The picture that I think was most powerful in assessing how these corporations will use this money occurred when the President's chief economic adviser asked a room of CEOs: How many of you will spend these additional resources on creating jobs? There were no more than a few hands raised in that room. This money will go to shareholders.  These corporations have zero incentive to provide new jobs if there is no increase in demand and sales. The failure to provide real tax cuts--real benefits to middle-class families and to our working families--means that sales and demand will not lead to more jobs because there will be no increase in demand with the crumbs and pittance tax cuts that are complicated.  So Republicans, let me say finally, are borrowing $1.5 trillion, and they are putting it on a credit card.  Sometimes pictures are worth a thousand words. Here is the ``American Excess'' tax scam card. It will not buy you much because it is debt. With sincere apologies to American Express, the ``American Excess'' tax scam card can be used by our children--my children and your children--as a symbol of what they are losing in opportunity costs, including the roads and bridges and rail that remain unrepaired; the new schools and airports that are unbuilt; the national defense that becomes far less adequate because the investment can't be made; the government programs, whether it is Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid that are in peril--deeply in jeopardy because of this tax scam--and positive train control that can save lives and could have saved lives, in fact, in Tacoma when that train was traveling 80 miles an hour when the speed limit was 30. These opportunity costs are real. The choices to incur them are moral, and the debt that will have to be paid by future generations is equally real, and it is immoral.  Thank you.

231,topic-id,1635,"Madam President, we are quickly approaching the end of this year, and I think it is a good time to reflect on what has been done this year. Certainly, the Senate and the Trump administration have been able to do a number of things that are really going to have a significant impact on hard-working families.  Yesterday, we sent the most significant tax reform legislation in more than three decades to the President's desk, and we had a chance to hear the President and others respond to that. The President, at the end of that ceremony at the White House, turned to the Congress and said: ``This is the work that you have done.'' I think the Members of Congress appreciated that. That showed a President who is constantly learning and constantly understanding how important relationships are here.  I thought it was interesting that we heard Chairman Brady, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, say that there are three important dates about to occur for America's economy and America's families. One is January 1, when the new tax bill goes into effect, and as to the wages people are earning, people are going to be allowed more of those wages to stay in their billfold rather than go to the government's billfold. It doesn't stay very long in the government's billfold; that is for sure. January 1 is important. As for February 1, by then, that is the time by which we hope all of the new information is out to employers, and people are going to see in their February check more money than they saw in that same-sized check this year going home with them. This is about who is a better person to spend your money--you or the government. It is also about a debate about whether the government is better off with higher taxes or more taxpayers and, of course, it is better off with more taxpayers.  Chairman Brady said that the other date is April 15, because that is the last time in the foreseeable future that families are going to have to deal with a Tax Code that they don't understand, that they believe to be unfair, that they believe does not treat everybody equitably in how that Tax Code is applied. Many of the special provisions are going to be out of the Tax Next April 15, probably 9 out of 10 taxpayers would have filled out an income tax form on a card about this big and, for 9 out of 10 taxpayers, they are going to look at double the personal exemption from this year--that is $24,000, if you are a married couple, that you just subtract immediately from your income--and double the child tax credit, up to $2,000. Somebody said to me just yesterday: You mean my son with his three children is going to be able to take $6,000 off of whatever their tax bill would be at the bottom of that form, and the answer is yes. If they didn't have a tax bill, at the bottom of that form that totals $6,000, those families get a credit that allows them to take money for other taxes they have paid and take that home with them.  So this is after a decade of historically low growth, a decade that defies virtually the entire history of the country going back to 1789, where 3 percent growth has been the normal growth. Less than 2 percent growth has been the normal growth for 9 of the last 10 years. The 1 year that is going to be an exception is this year. It looks like we are going to get close to and maybe even exceed 3 percent and get back to where the economy should be growing. I think with the new tax bill, we may exceed that and most of people's concerns about a lot of the things in this bill will go away when the economy starts growing again.  Buying power is almost 3 percent lower this year than it was in the 1990s. Now, their wages may have gone up between now and the 1990s, but prices have gone up more, and it is time to get our economy growing again and let families have more of the money they have earned to spend on their family. If you are a family of four earning about $73,000 this year and $73,000 next year, next year, your tax is going to be $2,000 less than it is this year. If you are a single parent with one child earning $41,000, next year your tax will be $1,300 less than it is this year.  Now, some will say--as a matter of fact, I have heard it on the floor of the Senate--a few hundred dollars a month will not matter. Well, now that is clearly somebody who doesn't know how much a few hundred dollars a month or a few hundred dollars a year does matter.  This bill will give us ways to compete that we don't have now. The bill also will provide Missouri families and other families more jobs and more opportunities because we are going to be more competitive. We will have moved our corporate tax rate. It will not be the lowest in the world, but it will no longer be the highest in the world. It will be in the very middle. Twenty-one percent is right in the middle of the countries we compete with. At the time that 35 percent was our rate in 1986, it was the middle, too, but every other country that we compete with has figured out that that gives you a competitive disadvantage, and they have all lowered their taxes as our corporate tax stayed the same. We are restoring our competitive position. We are hoping and actually going to go ahead and tax the money that is trapped overseas, whether it comes back or not. So I think it is safe to assume that somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 trillion will come back into our economy.  There is more U.money overseas that would like to come home--but wasn't going to come home if we took 35 percent out of it--than at any time before. There is more U.capital in this country on the sidelines than at any time before. You put that money into the economy, and you put that 2 trillion or so dollars into the economy. You make us the best, safest, and most predictable place in the world to invest money. Foreign investment in our economy--not in their economy but in our economy--will increase, and it is time for that to happen.  This Tax Code will increase take-home pay immediately, and it will make us more competitive, and we will have jobs that pay more in the future.  The rolling back of redtape is one of the reasons that the economy in our country is already growing faster than it has in a decade. People saw the regulatory overreach. Most importantly, President Trump saw the regulatory overreach. The House and the Senate saw the regulatory overreach. We were able to block 15 regulations before they went into effect. Other regulations, like the totally ridiculous power rule that was proposed, which in my State would have doubled the utility bill in less than 12 years, is not going to happen now. The waters of the United States, which would have suddenly put the EPA in charge of anything involving water, is not going to happen now. The $52 million increase in just the cost of getting something where you could start, which was the anticipated cost of the waters of the United States, is not going to happen now.  Chairman Isakson of the Veterans' Affairs Committee was on the floor earlier, talking about what we have done with his leadership for veterans, and that list is long. The Veterans Choice Act continues to give veterans more opportunity to get the care where they want it rather than to be stuck in a system that didn't seem to always care that much whether veterans got care or not. It was more about the Veterans' Administration than the veterans, and competition and choice is in the process of ending that with good leadership at the VA administration and being sure that happens.  We were able to pass a bill that I sponsored, the HIRE Vets It is being implemented right now to recognize companies that hire vets, that promote vets, and that give vets credit for the skills they learned in the military. The Department of Labor has worked hard to put that on fast-forward and get it done.  In the military, the Military Family Stability Act means that families, for the first time, have the opportunity that they have always hoped to have for the family to move a little earlier or stay a little longer, if that works for education purposes or the spouse's education or career purposes. This is a dramatic step, appreciating the fact that the strength of the military is in military families. We recruit, generally in the military, single adults, and we retire from the military adults with spouses and children, and this looks at that.  There is a lot to talk about as we end this session. It is never perfect, but that is why we come back for the next session. There are going to be things[[Page S8203]]that could have been done better, but so many things have happened that haven't happened in a generation. I know that I am eager to go home and talk about those, as I was on the radio this morning and yesterday morning doing that already. I know that my colleagues are too.  I yield the floor.

616,topic-id,745,"Mr.President, I rise today to recognize the commissioning of the USS Little Rock, a Freedom-class littoral combat ship. I was proud to celebrate this historic occasion with all who gathered for the commissioning in Buffalo, NY, this past weekend.  It is an honor to have one of the Navy's more versatile warships named after our State's capital city. The USS Little Rock's logo features one of the most recognizable images associated with Arkansas--the The University of Arkansas football team was given the nickname after the head coach at the time said the team played like a bunch of razorback hogs. I am confident this crew, known as the Warhawgs, will carry on that same work ethic. It has been more than four decades since the Navy had a ship named after the city of Little Rock, and we are thrilled that it will again be represented in the Navy's fleet.  Saturday marked the first time in the history of the Navy that a ship was commissioned alongside her namesake. This special occasion brought together members of the original USS Little Rock and those like LT Robert Dyer from Mountainburg, AK, who is a member of the current crew.  During its time as a light cruiser and then as a guided missile cruiser, the original USS Little Rock and its crew were vital to defeating the growing threats of its time. The new USS Little Rock is just as critical to our Navy's sea power. This ship and the strength and resolve of the Warhawg crew are the future of the Navy, offering unique capabilities to defend against evolving threats around the globe.  There are things this Chamber and our colleagues in the House of Representatives can do to ensure that the Navy has the resources to stay ahead of the threats our adversaries pose to us and our allies, and that begins with passing individual appropriations bills. As Congress continues discussions for fiscal year 2018 funding, it serves as a reminder that continuing resolutions are an inefficient method to keep the government operating. We should be approving individual appropriations bills instead of relying on continuing resolutions.  The starts and stops in the budgeting process impact the Defense Department and the Navy significantly. They certainly slow down the already long timetable to achieve the goal of a 355-ship fleet. Continuing resolutions negatively impact our military ratings and take our eyes off the focus of eliminating wasteful spending. They hinder our Navy's leaders' ability to plan and purchase equipment in support of its missions. They restrict the Navy from starting new programs or eliminating old and unneeded ones.  Earlier this month, Navy Secretary Spencer said the service wasted $4 billion since 2011 because of continuing resolutions. This could have gone a long way toward growing our fleet. Instead, it is gone. A continuing resolution means that the Navy is operating on the previous year's budget level and last year's priorities. It means delays in shipbuilding and ship repair. It also means reducing training opportunities, flying hours, and steaming days. That forces more requirements onto the operational fleet, which is already stretched thin after decades of constant worldwide deployment. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has said that the longer the continuing resolution, the greater the consequences for our force.  Funding the government is the basic responsibility of It is an obligation that my colleagues and I on the Senate Appropriations Committee take very seriously as we craft the appropriations bills, set priorities, and make difficult decisions on how to spend taxpayer dollars.  We must return to a process in which we debate and pass annual spending bills in order to provide much needed predictability to our military leaders, as well as other agencies of government. We can make this happen by returning to regular order and passing individual appropriations bills. I can't say that enough. We owe it to our servicemembers, their families, and all We owe it to the crew of the USS Little  Admittedly, Little Rock is not the first place most people think of when you mention the Our State doesn't border an ocean. But now the State capital will once again have a place on the high seas. This is a tremendous honor for the city of Little Rock, and I know the ship and its crew will make Arkansas proud.

899,topic-id,1691,"Mr.President, as co-chair of the Air Force Caucus, I rise to pay tribute to Michael Short, who served this country faithfully for over 51 years, 35 years as an Air Force fighter pilot and another 16 years as an Air Force and joint senior mentor to leaders and future leaders of our military. Lieutenant General Short passed away on 27 October after a battle with cancer, and for those who knew him, it is the only battle he ever lost.  Born in Princeton, NJ, on 24 February 1944, Lieutenant General Short was the only child of Janet MacDonald Short and Charles Francis He grew up in a military family and lived in New Jersey, North Carolina, Japan, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Lieutenant General Short's father, Charles, was a paratrooper and a member of the 82nd Airborne When Lieutenant General Short was born, his father was stationed in England preparing for the D-Day invasion. On 6 June 1944, Charles Short jumped into occupied France as a member of the 507th Parachute Infantry He fought in the Battle of the Bulge and helped liberate Europe from Nazi  As most military children, Lieutenant General Short attended several schools growing up and excelled athletically and academically at every one. He attended high school in France, participating on his school's football, basketball and baseball teams, and graduating at the top of his class. Lieutenant General Short applied for and was accepted into the U.Air Force Academy, entering as a basic cadet on 26 June 1961.  In February 1965, then-Cadet First Class Short met the love of his life, Virginia Suhonen, a fourth-grade school teacher, in Manitou Springs, Lieutenant General Short graduated the Air Force Academy on 6 June 1965 and married Jini on 14 August 1965, and together, they began an incredible journey of partnership and selfless service to each other and our Nation that lasted 52 years.  Their first of 23 assignments began at Webb Air Force Base in Texas, where he attended pilot training. Follow-on assignments included Arizona, South Vietnam, Florida, Minnesota, Colorado, Washington, Thailand, Philippines, the Pentagon, North Carolina, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Germany, and Along the way, they grew their family, with Jini giving birth to a son, Christopher, and daughter, They lovingly welcomed in their daughter-in-law Brooke and son-in-law Scott, and celebrated the birth of five grandchildren, Emily, Rachel, Sara, Jacob, and Of course, no family is complete without its pets and those who knew the Shorts will always remember Hobo, Bogie, and Lieutenant General Short understood the importance of family and was a devoted son, husband, father, and grandfather. He was also an airmen's airman.  Lieutenant General Short exemplified what the Nation should demand of its military members and senior leaders. He was a master in the profession of arms, a master of employing the military tool of national power, and a master instructor to generations of officers who continue to follow him and keep his legacy alive in service to our Upon earning his silver wings, he began a flying career focused on fighter aviation. He amassed over 4,600 flying hours and flew the F-4C, F-4D, F-4E, RF-4C, F-102, F-106, A-7, F-117, A-10, F-15E, and F-16. He flew 276 combat missions over Vietnam in the F-4, flew and commanded combat missions during Desert Storm in the F-15E, and directed over 35,000 combat missions during Operation Allied Force over  In 1969, then-Captain Short, an F-4C pilot, was awarded the Silver Star for courageous action in General Short was enroute to a target in North Vietnam when he was diverted to support an F-105 pilot that was shot down, had ejected, and was in the water off the coast of North He was tasked to take out the antiaircraft artillery sites that had shot down the F-105 so they could bring in the rescue aircraft. Both he and his wingman were hit multiple times by antiaircraft artillery but were able to make it back to base safety after delivering all their rockets on target, knocking out the gun sites, and enabling the rescue of the downed F-105 pilot.  In 1986, then-Colonel Short was hand-picked to be the operations group commander of the 4450th Tactical Group at Nellis Air Force Base, which operated the highly classified F-117A stealth fighter. He soloed in the F-117A on 14 January 1986, Bandit 199, and commanded the group until 1988.  In 1995, Lieutenant General Short was the chief of staff to the commander of NATO's Allied Air Forces Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, during Operation Deliberate Force, NATO's first air campaign, that brought the war in Bosnian-Herzegovina to an end. The following year, as the director of operations for U.Air Forces in Europe, he was responsible for the deployment and sustainment of NATO forces and their equipment in Bosnia-Herzegovina during and after Operation Joint Gen George Joulwan, the then-Supreme Commander Europe, said, ``He did the planning for the bombing of Bosnia in 1995 and then, when we put the force into Bosnia, he was critical coordinating the air transport. He was impressive because he was not only professional but innovative--this was all new stuff''  In 1998, Lieutenant General Short returned to Naples, Italy, now as the commander NATO's Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, leading the 19-member NATO alliance and directing all air operations in southern It was during this time our Nation called on General Short's expertise in the employment of military power to try and achieve peace. Lieutenant General Short, who always left political discussions to others, was directed to travel with Richard Holbrooke to Belgrade, Serbia, to be part of negotiations with Federal Republic of Yugoslavian President Slobadan During the meeting, President Milosevic leaned forward and said to Lieutenant General Short, ``So, you are the man who is going to bomb me.'' Lieutenant General Short replied, ``Well, I hope that won't be the case. I have a plan to propose to your generals that will prevent your country from being bombed, but in essence, you're right. I have U-2s in one hand and B-52s in the other, and the choice is up to you.'' His statement broke the tension, and the discussions went on from there. The negotiations successfully postponed the war, but on 24 March 1999, Lieutenant General Short was directed to begin air operations against He successfully executed Operation Allied Force, a 78-day NATO bombing effort to stop the Serbian ethnic cleansing of Muslims in  Lieutenant General Short received a bachelor of science degree from the Air Force Academy, a master's degree in systems management from the University of Southern California, was a distinguished graduate of Air Command and Staff College and attended the Industrial College of the Armed Forces in Washington, His decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with one oakleaf cluster, the AF Distinguished Service Medal with one oakleaf cluster, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross with one oakleaf cluster, and the Air Medal with fourteen oakleaf clusters. In 1999, he was presented the Air Force Association's highest honor to a military member in the field of national security, the H.Arnold Award for commanding the air campaign during Operation Allied  Lieutenant General Short retired on 1 July 2000 and began 16 years of work as an Air Force and joint senior mentor focusing on the command and control of airpower. Lieutenant General Short was known and respected by servicemembers from all services in the United States, as well as our allies. He always gave clear, hard-hitting advice, passing on his knowledge of things he did right and things he did wrong. He traveled to the Republic of Korea, Qatar, and many other locations to advise, teach and train airmen[[Page S8251]]of all ranks in the art of ``operational'' level warfare. Long after the senior mentor ranks thinned, due to intense scrutiny and significant pay cuts, Lieutenant General Short stuck with the program because it was his passion.  Lieutenant General Short touched many lives as evidenced by comments written about him by those who knew and served with him:  ``He was a father, a husband, a grandfather and what made it all work was his complete devotion to those he loved and commanded. It was an honor to serve alongside him ``  ``High standards, demanding, but fair. You knew where the bar was and he challenged you to exceed it. He pushed me to limits I did not know I could reach.''  ``He was a no-nonsense leader who let his Commanders command. He was also a hands-on mentor who touched thousands; admired by all and will be greatly missed.''  ``A superb officer, great warrior and outstanding teacher.''  ``A great leader . . . as the Air Boss for Operation Allied Force he provided clear guidance and support for me and the men and women in my deployed Wing . . . I consider it a high honor to have served under him in combat!''  ``He really was the kind of leader that made you want to work for the organization and its goals. His name always comes up when we talk about the good men in those days.''  ``General Mike Short was a great leader and He was a mentor and more importantly a friend. Mike loved his Family and his Country . . . he will be missed.''  ``He did a superb job in a very tough situation. With leadership and top cover like that, the U.Air Force is unstoppable.''  ``I will miss your words as they were always on target and well understood. Rolling a nickel on the grass in your remembrance, sir.''  I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mike Short for his selfless service to this Nation, to his wife, Jini, and to his children, Chris and Jenn, and their families, for a lifetime of service to this Words cannot describe the extraordinary character of Lieutenant General Short, his accomplishments, or the lasting impact he will have on generations of service members. His personal accomplishments live on through the examples set by his son and daughter, two highly capable and highly respected Air Force senior officers. My prayers are with his family, and I pray the ``Lord Guard and Guide the Men Who Fly.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8250.txt,1687,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1103,topic-id,333,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Hydraulic Institute and pay tribute to the exceptional role that pump manufacturers have played in improving the delivery of water to American homes, American industry, and American agriculture over the past century. Today pump systems touch the lives of every American, and the Hydraulic Institute plays a central role in developing the policies and standards needed for safe, reliable, and efficient pump operations.  On April 18, 1917, the Nation's leading pump manufacturers met in the La Salle Hotel in Chicago for the purpose of forming a trade association that would ``promote friendship and cooperation among manufacturers in improving overall pump performance.'' Since this auspicious gathering of pump manufacturers, government agencies have relied on the Hydraulic Institute to provide the technical expertise required to set pump standards that reflect the evolving priorities of society.  In recent years, energy efficiency has emerged as a national priority, and the Hydraulic Institute has worked closely with the U.Department of Energy to improve the efficiency of pumping systems. These systems now account for over 20 percent of domestic electrical energy use and the standards, laboratory testing, and labeling advanced by the Hydraulic Institute will ultimately save consumers and businesses billions of dollars.  Pumping systems protect our communities from flooding and fires, deliver drinking water to our homes, irrigate our farms, and bring water and fuel to American manufacturers. The Hydraulic Institute works closely with Congress to ensure that the laws governing energy, water, and infrastructure reflect the prominence of pumping systems in the management of these essential resources.

87,topic-id,1743,"Yesterday, Madam President, a bunch of Members of Congress, with healthcare paid for by taxpayers, went to the White House and celebrated a handout for corporations that sends jobs overseas--companies that shut down in Mansfield, in Zanesville, in Lima, and Toledo moved to Wuhan and Sheshan and Shanghai and  Families here in America, at the same time--I am still incredulous about this. Families in this country, at the same time--in this State of Virginia, just a few miles from here--are getting letters in the mail saying their kids are about to be kicked off their health insurance through something that was bipartisan and never interrupted for 20 years since Chairman Hatch and Senator Rockefeller and Senator Kennedy wrote this bill to create CHIP--and a number of us worked on it in the House of Representatives--because Congress hasn't done its job.  Think about that. Because Congress hasn't done its job, we are about to go home for Christmas--most of us--and those who don't celebrate Christmas are about to go home for the holidays and celebrate the new year. My grandchildren are coming from Columbus, and another one is coming from the Virgin Islands with his father--our son and his daughter-in-law. We are going to go home, and our families have health insurance, but Members of Congress who get good health insurance paid for by taxpayers are willing to leave here and not reauthorize, not continue the Children's Health Insurance To make it worse, several States, including Virginia--Ohio is in a little better position because there is a little more money left over to take care of this--but letters are going out in State after State after State to parents saying: Sorry, the health insurance for your children is going to expire. The health insurance for your children will no longer be there.  Imagine you are a parent, and you get this letter. You are just vaguely aware that Congress is fighting about something. You are vaguely aware of the hard-heartedness of a whole lot of people in this You are vaguely aware that a bunch of politicians--privileged, elected officials who make good salaries and make good benefits--are going to turn their backs on you. You don't really think much about that. All you know is, you take this piece of paper, tear open this envelope, and you start reading this letter, and you see, oh, my gosh, the insurance for my children.  Now, overwhelmingly, these parents are people who are working. They are earning $8, $10, $12, $15 an hour. They are not making enough that they can afford insurance for their families. They are not working at a job where insurance is provided as part of the compensation your employer is paying you. So that is why the Children's Health Insurance Program is so important.  A new report from the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families reports that 1.9 million children could lose coverage in January--1.9 million children. Almost all of them have a mother or a father who will open a letter and see that, oh, my gosh, the insurance for my daughter, for my son is about to expire. That is 1.9 million in January and another 1 million will lose insurance by the end of  Parents will panic, parents will be confused, and parents, to be sure, will have their Christmas ruined by this. Think about those families getting that letter. It should be a joyful time of year for families, spending time with family, enjoying the holidays. Imagine checking that mailbox and kind of thinking maybe this is a Christmas card and opening it and finding out it is that letter. Imagine telling your daughter: I am sorry, honey. Santa is not going to bring much this year. We don't make a lot of money--you know that--but we will not have any presents under the tree. Then you have to[[Page S8212]]look into your children's eyes--you have to look into your son's eyes, you have to look into your daughter's eyes, and you hope they don't see the worry in your eyes because you just got this letter. Now you are wondering how you will afford to take him or her to the doctor if he or she gets sick. These are often families with two working parents who, as I said, aren't lucky enough to work for an employer who provides insurance.  These are often families with children who have special needs. Like Crystal Lett and her son Noble, a first-grader in Dublin, OH, which is a suburb just west and northwest of Crystal and her son Noble--I met them. This is obviously I met Noble and his mother Crystal in Washington this spring when they came all the way from Ohio to talk about what CHIP means to their family.  Noble was born with a rare genetic disorder. He needs three therapy sessions a week. He needs daily hormone injections to treat his condition. His medications run about $1,500 a month.  I talked to Crystal again at the end of last month. She and her family are scared to death about what will happen to them if Congress doesn't save She said CHIP is ``the difference between living a middle class lifestyle, or being part of the poverty line.'' It is the difference between a middle-class lifestyle or being part of the poverty line.  Over the last several weeks, Congress was busy. Congress had the time to hand out massive tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations but didn't have time to help these families. Some of you may have been in this Chamber a few nights ago when I pointed down the hall to Senator McConnell's office, the Senate Republican leader, and described the lobbyists who went in and out of his office to get these tax breaks. It was the lobbyists from the oil companies and from the oil industry. There were lobbyists walking in and out of Senator McConnell's office, the leader's office, from the tobacco companies. The lobbyists from the big drug companies and the lobbyists from Wall Street were going in and out of his office.  When you look down the hall to Senator McConnell's office, do you know who didn't come out of his office? There were no lobbyists for the Children's Health Insurance Program because, you know what, children like Noble don't have lobbyists. They can't hire lobbyists. Parents are just hoping to keep their head above water because they have a child who needs medical attention, and any child obviously can need medical attention. That is the importance of  So CHIP doesn't have a lobbyist. CHIP has people like Crystal Lett, who stands up for her family, who stands up for her children, but she can't come to Washington full time. She came here with a delegation from Nationwide Children's Hospital in  Congress had time to hand out these massive tax cuts, but they don't have time for Noble It is a disgrace. It is a program that was bipartisan, and it has always been bipartisan. It was voted out of committee bipartisanly, but I guess the right crowd of lobbyists hasn't visited Senator McConnell down the hall in his office. It is despicable.  We passed a bipartisan CHIP extension out of the Finance It is ready to go. If Republican leaders would put it on the floor today, it would pass. I assume it would pass with at least 90 votes. There is no excuse for this delay.  There is talk the House is going to pass a 3-month CHIP extension. We have never done that. We have extended CHIP 1 year, 2 years, 3 years. This is going to get a 5-year extension. That is what we ought to do. They are going to do a 3-month extension.  Three months provides no certainty to the States that are running It provides no certainty to Crystal Lett to take care of Noble and manage his healthcare. It provides no certainty to anybody. The Presiding Officer's State of Alabama is already taking steps to close down their programs and freeze enrollment. I know Senator Strange doesn't want that to happen, but I also know Senate Republicans need to talk to their leader to make this happen.  States have to give families a heads-up so these parents have time to do what they can. Maybe some of these parents can find an alternative source of coverage, maybe they are going to fit in one more doctor's appointment before their coverage lapses. Think of that. You get this letter in the mail saying the insurance for your children is about to expire, so what do you do? You start dialing the hospital and dialing the doctor's office because you have CHIP coverage for another month or another 5 weeks or whatever, and you start scheduling any possible appointment you can, the Christmas season notwithstanding.  Providing a 3-month extension doesn't solve this problem; it just makes the situation more complicated. This body can pass massive permanent tax cuts, but they can't give families certainty? I know the tax cuts are permanent for corporations, and I know they are temporary for individual people in this country. Of course, this Congress--as special-interest controlled as it is--first takes care of corporations, but it would be nice if they gave some certainty to these children's families.  I want my colleagues to explain to the Crystal Letts in your State--because every State has thousands of concerned parents who don't know what to do with the expiration of this. My State has 209,000 children who rely on this program.  Senator Hatch said last month: We are going to get it done. Now we are hearing that Senator McConnell is only going to let us vote on a 3-month extension.  This is about whose side you are on. Do we work for corporations that send our jobs overseas, or do we work for families, such as Crystal Lett and her son Noble? Do we work for families who might wake up on Christmas morning without health insurance? I guess the answer is pretty clear: Most people in this body are working for large corporations that are getting huge tax cuts and that send their jobs overseas, and they are turning their backs on those families who need us to simply do our jobs and pass this extension of the Children's Health Insurance  I yield the floor.

124,topic-id,346,"Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues Senator Warner and Senator Blumenthal for their words on the Senate floor--Senator Warner's words yesterday especially, defending Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in his leadership on the Senate Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation. Senator Warner is absolutely right that we must protect the integrity of the Justice Department's independent investigation.  Congress needs to make clear that there are redlines. Any attempt to fire Robert Mueller, to shut down the investigation, or to presumptively pardon key witnesses essential to the investigation would be an abuse of power and a direct threat to the rule of law and to our constitutional system.  Ohio's Ukrainian community knows the impact of unchecked Russian aggression in Russia's effort to undermine democracy around the world. Getting to the bottom of Russian interference and protecting our future elections from that interference are critical.  My priority is getting to the bottom of what happened so that our democratic process is upheld and so we can move forward with the business we were sent here to do--creating jobs, combatting the opioid crisis, as Senators Johnson, Markey, and I will speak about in a moment, and helping middle-class families. Any efforts to delay that conclusion or interfere in the investigation, I believe, will not be tolerated by Senators in either party.  Thanks to Senator Warner for making that clear. Thanks to my colleagues in both parties who take this seriously. All of us have had serious conversations with Members of both parties to discuss what all this means, and thank you for all of us working together to complete the independent Senate investigation. It is important that we make clear to the American people that this is not a partisan issue. It is about the integrity of our elections, about protecting our country from foreign powers.  Any attempt to discredit Robert Mueller and his investigation and to turn it into a partisan issue makes us less safe as a nation. Let's allow the Justice Department and the special counsel to do their jobs. Let's get back to doing ours.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8207.txt,2106,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
537,topic-id,3154,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to this special interest, tax breaks for the rich, trickle-down economics bill that history shows doesn't work.  I want to start by thanking Senator Wyden from Oregon, the leader on our side--the Finance Committee has done very good work--and Gideon Bragin in my office who has been one of the tax reform experts in this body. I want to thank both of them.  This bill should have been an opportunity for all of us to work together to put money in the pockets of working[[Page S8116]]people. It is pretty simple. Instead of cutting taxes for the middle class, though, Washington chose to cut taxes for millionaires and corporations and pay for it by cutting Medicare and kicking people off their health insurance.  It ought to be pretty simple. If we want to cut taxes--if we want to talk about cutting taxes for the middle class--if we want to cut taxes for the middle class, then let's pass a bill to cut taxes for the middle class instead of giving the money to corporations and the richest CEOs and relying on a bank shot, hoping it trickles down. Cut out the middleman. That is what my colleagues claim to want. That is what the President said to us and the country that he wanted, but that is not what this bill does. This isn't a middle-class tax cut--not even close.  According to the Tax Policy Center, 83 percent--you see a Monopoly man here on this chart--83 percent of the benefits in this tax bill by the end of the decade go to the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. Imagine, 83 percent of the benefits go to the richest 1 percent of people in this country. That is even worse than the Senate bill passed--which wasn't that great--earlier this month. It was already pretty bad. Sixty-two percent of the bill's benefits would have gone to the top 1 percent of households by the end of the decade. Apparently, 62 percent wasn't good enough for the Republican members of the conference committee. They thought 83 percent of the benefits--83 percent of the benefits--should go to the richest 1 percent in this country, so the bill has actually gotten worse and worse and worse for middle-class families.  How did the bill get this bad? It got this bad through massive, permanent tax cuts for the wealthy, for so-called passthrough businesses and corporations, which mostly benefit the richest people in this country. It got this bad through paltry tax cuts for some middle-class families that expire after a few years.  Get this. The corporate tax cuts are permanent. They last forever. The tax cuts for individuals, inadequate and immodest as they are, expire after a few years. Gee, I wonder why they did that. It was through a new way of calculating inflation called Chained CPI, which will primarily hurt middle-class families. That doesn't even take into account the millions of Americans--my colleague from Pennsylvania was part of it; in the middle of the night they put a new provision in this bill that will cost 13 million Americans their health insurance. So 13 million Americans will lose insurance under this bill.  All kinds of elected officials, all kinds of us in the House and Senate have insurance paid for by taxpayers, and my colleagues are willing to take insurance away from 13 million people, most of whom have jobs. They don't have jobs that pay what we make. They don't have health insurance like we have. They don't get pensions like we have. They are making $8, $10, $12 an hour and can't afford insurance. We, as privileged elected officials, are going to take insurance away from 13 million people, and at the same time it will raise insurance premiums 10 percent--not 10 percent over time, but 10 percent a year. If you are paying $500 a month in insurance now, you will pay $550 the next year, and you will pay more than $600 the following year.  It didn't have to be this way. Our door, as Democrats, has always been open. Democrats represent half this country. Democrats wanted a seat at the table and wanted to help write a bill. Let me illustrate.  A number of us in the Finance Committee in both parties, including my colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, and Senator Toomey, Senator Wyden, and others, were invited to the White House to meet with the President to talk about the tax reform bill. I presented the President two bills I have been working on. One was the Patriot Corporation Act, which was pretty simple. It says that if corporations do the right thing--if they pay good wages, if they provide good health insurance and pension benefits for their employees, and if they keep their production in the United States of America--they get lower tax rates.  The other bill, called the Working Families Relief Act, is also pretty simple. It puts money directly in the pockets of people making $25,000, $50,000, and $75,000 a year. The President of the United States looked at me and said: I like the Patriot Corporation Act, and I like the Working Families Tax Relief  After the hour-and-a-half meeting, which was witnessed by a dozen Senators in both parties and a number of his Cabinet officials, including Secretary Mnuchin in the Cabinet room at the White House, I walked up to the President and said: Thank you for your interest. I handed him and his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn--whom I am proud to say is from Cleveland--copies of the bill.  Then, something started to happen. Then the meetings started in Mitch McConnell's office. For people who don't work here and live here and see this, I would point out that down the hall, 100 feet, is Senator McConnell's office. Pass the Ohio clock--that is my State; pass the Ohio clock, and 100 feet down the hall is Senator McConnell's office.  The meetings started in Senator McConnell's office. The President of the United States said that he liked the idea of the Patriot Corporation Act, liked the idea of the Working Families Relief Act, but then he turned it over to Senator Do you know what happened? Wall Street lobbyist after Wall Street lobbyist walked in that door and out that door; tobacco lobbyist after tobacco lobbyist walked in that door and out that door; oil company lobbyist after oil company lobbyist walked in that door and out that door; drug company lobbyists from all over the country walked in that door and out that door.  They walked in that door. They didn't literally carry bags of money out that door after they made their points and made their pitches, but they carried provisions in the tax bill that will make their employers bags of money. They didn't carry bags of money themselves. That would be uncouth. But they sure wrote provisions in this tax bill that provide bags of money for their companies--for the tobacco companies, for Wall Street, for the oil companies, for the drug companies.  Over and over and over, Republicans made clear--not that they would pass the Patriot Corporation Act even though the President had said that he liked it, not to pass legislation like the Working Families Tax Relief Act even though the President had said that he liked it; they made clear that they are benefiting one class of people--the wealthiest Americans, corporate CEOs, board members, and stockholders who see their profits rise and grow their businesses when they ship jobs overseas.  Remember, we have said many times here as we have tried to end this tax loophole that if you shut down production in Mansfield, OH, or you shut down production in Hamilton or Zanesville or Chillicothe or Lima and you move it overseas, you get a tax break. They open a factory there and ship it back into the United States of  This bill didn't fix it. It didn't close that loophole. It didn't fix that. It made it worse. It greased the skids for those companies to shut down faster in Mansfield, Lima, Chillicothe, and Zanesville, OH, and move their production overseas. They get bigger bonuses, they make bigger profits, and they get bigger stock dividends.  Republican leaders like to claim that somehow, if you give a big corporate tax increase, if you cut corporate taxes as this bill does, about 40 percent, $4,000 would end up in the pockets of every working man and woman in this country; workers would get a $4,000 raise. Of course, nobody believed them, but that is what they said: They would get a $4,000 raise.  Do you know why I know that is not true? Because history shows that anytime they get big tax cuts, anytime they bring dollars from overseas, the money doesn't go into employees' pockets. It doesn't usually go to create jobs. It goes to give more benefits to the executives.  The other reason I know that is not going to happen--that these dollars will not go to employees and not go to investing in more jobs--is that their corporate pals let the cat out of the bag and made clear they won't. CEOs from the largest corporations, already on record, state plainly that they are not raising wages; they are not going to hire more workers.[[Page S8117]]  What are they going to do with this windfall? I know this will come as a shock. They are going to keep it for themselves.  Imagine, these CEOs in and out of Senator McConnell's office--the drug companies, Wall Street, tobacco companies, oil companies, all the others. Believe it or not, the CEOs of these corporations are already making $8 million, $10 million, $12 million--some are making $20 million a year. That is not enough for them. Why would that possibly be enough? If you are making only $20 million a year, you have to do something to juice it a little bit, so they will keep that money for themselves. They will do bigger bonuses, they will do stock buybacks, and they will do dividends.  End this charade. I have heard all this happy talk on the floor about how this is going to make Americans more competitive and how it will trickle down to the middle class. If you want to do a middle-class tax cut, do a middle-class tax cut. Don't bank-shot it. Don't take out the middleman. Don't give it to corporations and say: Please, oh please, oh please, give us a middle-class tax break. It never works that way.  Republican leaders had a chance to work across the aisle. I heard Senator Toomey say that Democrats didn't want to be involved. I heard Senator Cornyn say that Democrats didn't want to be involved. I like those two gentlemen. I have worked particularly with Senator Cornyn on a number of things. We are working on a couple of issues right now. They know that is not true. They sat in that White House meeting. They heard the President of the United States say to me and to Senator Casey and to Senator McCaskill and to Senator Stabenow and to Senator Wyden and to a couple others--they heard us offer reasonable proposals. The President was agreeable. Many of them were part of his campaign. Candidate Trump was saying a lot of these things during the campaign. But then, lo and behold, they said: Democrats don't want to be a part of this. Well, not exactly.  We had a bill to expand the child tax credit. We had a plan to reward companies that create jobs here. All that got jettisoned down the hall in Senator McConnell's office. Down this hall, down this hall in Senator McConnell's office, 100 feet away, is where these deals were cut--these deals with the drug companies and oil companies and tobacco companies and Wall Street lobbyists going in and out of his office. I didn't see all of them come out, but I am guessing they had really big smiles on their faces.  These massive cuts for corporations come at a heavy price for the middle class. When 1 percent gets richer and richer and richer, we know the middle class shrinks. These massive cuts come at a heavy price.  This bill will explode the deficit. We know that. Even my colleagues call themselves deficit hawks when there is a Democratic President, but following the enforcer in chief, the Wall Street Journal editorial page--they call themselves deficit hawks when there is a Democratic President, but all of a sudden, they say: We will grow out of the deficit.  We know this bill will explode the deficit. We know what the plan is to deal with the deficit. Do you know what they will do? They will steal the money Americans have paid into Social Security and How do we know that? I am not just saying it. As a progressive Democrat in this body, I am not just saying: Of course they are going to cut Social Security and I think that, but do you know why I am sure of it? I am always pretty sure of it because that is what they do. But I am sure of it because they said that. They made their plans crystal clear. Speaker Ryan said that he wants to turn next year to what he calls entitlement reform.  There are retirement and health benefits that people earn over a lifetime of work--social insurance. You pay into Medicare over the course of your life. When you need Medicare, when you are 65, you get this insurance. You pay into Social Security your entire life. You either get survivors benefits for your children or you get disability or you get retirement when you reach the age of 66, more or less. You pay into unemployment insurance. If you need it--God willing, you don't, but if you need it, you get help. That is what social insurance is. You pay for it, and you get help from society. It is societywide social insurance. But the Ways and Means chairman, Kevin Brady, said that the next stop for Republicans is to tackle entitlements.  Here is what we know. This bill is going to cause huge deficits. We know that. They have acknowledged it, and 2, 3, 4 years from now, Republican Members will come to us--after the lobbyists have been down the hall in Senator McConnell's office, they will come back and say to us: We have this huge budget deficit. We are going to have to raise the eligibility age to maybe to 70. Some of them have talked about that. We are going to have to privatize They will say: We have to make these programs stronger and sustainable. Nobody thinks they want to make them stronger. They want to cut them. That is how you save money, even though you don't in the end.  Here is what is aggravating about this. Think about it. All of us--a number of people here in this body are past what society has designated as retirement age, 65. A number of Members of this Congress, particularly in the Senate, are over 65.  I work in my garden. I work outside. I do things. But I am not working in a diner, I am not working construction, and I don't use my arms and shoulders and brain and legs to do my work. We work here. We work in jobs we are privileged to have, and we get good compensation. We get a good salary, and we get good benefits. But we are going to tell a bunch of people who work with their hands and work with their brains and work with their bodies and work with their arms and shoulders and whose knees break down over time--we are going to tell the barber in Barberton, we are going to tell the truckdriver in Evendale, we are going to tell the construction worker in Conneaut, we are going to tell the waitress in Warren, we are going to tell the nurse in Newark that they are going to have to work until they are 70, sorry. Is that what we are going to do?  Follow this simply. This tax cut causes a huge budget deficit to give money to the wealthiest people in the country and creates a huge hole in the budget. Who is going to fill the hole in the budget? Not the lobbyists walking in and out of Senator McConnell's office 100 feet down the hall. They are not going to pay for it; they are not going to have to pay for it. It is going to be the nurse in Newark who has to work until she is 70; it is going to be the waitress in Warren who has to work until she is 70; it is going to be the carpenter or construction worker in Conneaut; it is going to be the barber in Barberton and the truckdriver in  If we pass this bill, 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent, and this 83 percent, a lot of which blows a hole in the budget deficit, is going to be paid for by working families. So cut out all the crap about this being something for working families. It is not.  I will say this for Republicans in Congress: They are making it pretty easy for the American people to see whose side they are on. You are either on the side of everyday working Americans, who are working more hours than ever before and getting too little pay for the hours they are working--they are either working for them or they are working for the people in Senator McConnell's office down the hall.  I want my colleagues to just pick through this. I want my colleagues to think about this picture, this stream of lobbyists in and out of Senator McConnell's office, this stream of lobbyists from America's largest, richest corporations--the drug companies, the tobacco companies, the insurance companies, the companies that tend to run this government. I want you to think about that.  Are you on the side of the workers who are doing the heavy work and can't work until they are 70 or are you on the side of CEOs and politicians who do the bidding of these CEOs? It is a pretty clear case. It is a picture that is pretty obvious. Americans deserve better. We can do better for them by starting from scratch with one goal in mind: If we want a middle-class tax cut, I say to the Senator from Utah, don't talk about a middle-class tax cut, don't do trickle-down economics. If you want a[[Page S8118]]middle-class tax cut, then give a middle-class tax cut. Give a tax cut to the middle class. It is pretty simple.  I yield the floor.

1315,topic-id,545,"Madam President, as we await Senator Markey's and Senator Johnson's remarks, I wish to set the stage. The CDC released a new report last night showing a massive increase in the number of Americans dying from drug overdoses.  My State is second to the Presiding Officer's It has the second highest rate of deaths per capita in the country. In my State of Ohio, unfortunately, far too many people die from opioid overdoses than any other State in country. Families are torn apart. Children lose parents. Parents lose sons and daughters.  The CDC pins much of the blame of this epidemic on this relatively new deadly synthetic fentanyl. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin. Senator Capito knows that, as do Senators Johnson and All of us in the Senate are aware of that.  This drug is being illegally trafficked into this country from Mexico and We have a bill to stop this today. The INTERDICT I want to thank Senator Markey for his leadership on this bill and also my colleague Senator Portman for his support. Senator Portman and I have been working on a number of issues across party lines for months and months. It would provide more funds for Customs and Border Protection to screen packages effectively and safely, to stop fentanyl whenever possible before it reaches Akron, Toledo, Dayton, or the smaller cities of Chillicothe, Mansfield, and  This passed the House with only two or three negative votes. It has the support of major law enforcement organizations, including sheriffs and police officers. Our law enforcement officials, better than anybody, see the devastation that fentanyl causes our communities. They know the risk our officers face dealing with this deadly substance. That is why this bill needs to pass into law.  Just this week, the National FOP, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Police Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative--a recent phenomenon, unfortunately--all publicly asked us to pass the bill.  Americans are dying in record numbers. Life expectancy in our country--I believe, for the first time in the lifetimes of any of us--actually dropped last year. Think about that.  We have made progress, as I mentioned, in this body. I wear a pin on my lapel of a canary in a bird cage. The mine workers in West Virginia, Ohio, and elsewhere would take this canary down to the mines. If the canary died, the mine worker was on his own. He didn't have a union strong enough or a government that cared enough to help him. In those days, people lived 45 years on average--for a person born in the United States in 1900.  Today we live 30 years longer for a whole host of public health reasons--from Medicare to Medicaid, to safe drinking laws, to clean air, to minimum wage--all the things that we do. For the first time, I believe, in our lifetime, life expectancy actually has dropped because of drug overdoses for the second year in a row, and it is in large part because of these overdose deaths.  Why shouldn't we take steps today to stop this? We can do this by putting the INTERDICT Act on the President's desk, immediately giving law enforcement the tools they need to keep fentanyl out of the country and off our streets.

This      epidemic has worsened with the influx of synthetic opiates      like fentanyl from foreign countries, especially China and      For example, synthetic fentanyl is cheaper than      normal opiates bought on the street and it is 50 times more      deadly than heroin.       Our law enforcement officers at the United States Customs      and Border Protection (CBP) are on the forefront of stopping      the deadly influx of synthetic fentanyl into our communities      from these foreign countries. The CBP needs all the resources      they can get to stop this devastating flow of drugs into our      country.       This legislation will ensure that CBP will have additional      portable chemical screening devices at ports of entry, mail      and express consignment facilities, and more fixed chemical      screening devices at CBP laboratories. The bill will also      provide CBP with sufficient resources, personnel, and      facilities, including scientists to interpret the screening      test results from the field.       With all the additional resources CBP will be better      equipped on all fronts to thwart the deadly flow of synthetic      opiates across our borders.       On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to thank you for helping fight      against the heroin and opioid epidemic and fighting every day      to rid our communities of these drugs.

Mitchell McConnell, Jr.,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: I am writing on behalf      of the members of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers      Association (FLEOA) which is a professional organization      representing more than 26,000 federal officers and agents in      65 law enforcement agencies including the United States      Customs and Border Protection (CBP). FLEOA has endorsed H.     2142, the ``International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency      Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband and Technology      (INTERDICT) Act'' which passed the House with a 412-3 vote. I      urge the Senate to consider this bill for passage.       Probably the most serious crisis facing law enforcement is      the proliferation of heroin and opiate drugs, which are      causing more deaths from overdoses than ever experienced      before. In fact, synthetic opiates like fentanyl are now the      leading cause of overdoses because they are cheaper and      dramatically stronger than heroin.       The INTERDICT Act will provide CBP with portable screening      devices at ports of entry and mail facilities. In addition,      it will increase detection devices at CBP testing facilities      and laboratories. The Act will also provide CBP with      additional staffing and resources. This will allow CBP to      successfully diminish the importation of synthetic opiates      into the United       FLEOA applauds your assistance in helping CBP and the other      federal agencies in their efforts to reduce the plague these      illegal substances have induced on our country.

Mitchell McConnell, Jr.,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,     Charles Schumer,     Minority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,       Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: The Police Assisted      Addiction Recovery Initiative (PAARI) is a nonprofit      organization that trains and supports more than 360 law      enforcement agencies that have launched programs that serve      as a pre-arrest bridge to treatment. PAARI was pleased to      offer its strong support for 708, the bipartisan INTERDICT      Act, which was introduced by Senators Markey, Rubio, Brown,      and This bill will expand U.Customs and Border      Protection's ability to use technology to detect fentanyl and      other narcotics coming into the United States from abroad and      which are causing a public health epidemic in our      communities.       While the Senate has yet to act on 708, the House of      Representatives took action and on 25 October 2017, passed      companion legislation HR 2142, by a vote of 412-3. As this      year draws to a close, we urge the Senate to take up and pass      the House version of INTERDICT this year.       Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in      the United States, with more than 54,000 overdose deaths      reported in 2015. Almost 33,000 of those overdose deaths--     roughly 60 percent--involved opioids, including prescription      opioid pain relievers, heroin, or the synthetic opioid      fentanyl. In particular, as the CDC's recent report has just      shown, fentanyl and its analogs are becoming increasingly      responsible for these overdose deaths.       Fentanyl is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin and      100 times more powerful than morphine. It is dangerous and      potentially life-threatening to simply touch or accidentally      inhale the white powdery substance. Sometimes, unbeknownst to      the user, fentanyl is often mixed with heroin or other      substances, or formed to resemble prescription opioid pills.      Most illicit fentanyl comes to the United States from China      and Mexico, delivered through the mail or express consignment      carriers, or smuggled across the southwest border of the      United The INTERDICT Act will help the United States      better identify and stop these dangerous substances from      landing in communities across       Now is the time to act.

79,topic-id,780,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, Representative Jody Hice, for the opportunity to speak this evening on such an important issue.  We are here today to discuss the recent revelations that the Obama administration, in their pursuit of the Iran deal, blocked important efforts by U.law enforcement officials to fight the terrorist organization  The past administration's treatment of Iran reveals an imprudent and negligent approach to American foreign policy that must never be repeated. We see in their actions, at best, an incompetence born of a lack of clarity and information and, at worst, an administration determined to create a false foreign policy legacy so that America's[[Page H10338]]best interests were thrown to the wayside.  In a recent report from Politico mentioned by some of my colleagues already, we have learned that the Obama administration allegedly blocked efforts by U.law enforcement officials to fight Hezbollah's transnational drug and weapons trafficking operations.  Hezbollah, Iran's terrorist proxy organization, has also become one of the world's most powerful and dangerous criminal organizations, receiving over $1 billion every year from their illicit activities. We have learned that, through an expansive criminal trafficking network, they funnel cocaine throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Latin America, and the United  It has also come to light that Hezbollah launders millions of dollars through schemes involving used car purchases in the United States, and, ultimately, the money earned through these activities can be used for violent terrorist activities aimed at spreading fear and pain throughout the world.  Politico quoted the following from a confidential DEA report on Hezbollah's criminal activities: Hezbollah ``has leveraged relationships with corrupt foreign government officials and transnational criminal actors . . . creating a network that can be utilized to move metric ton quantities of cocaine, launder drug proceeds on a global scale, and procure weapons and precursors for explosives.''  It ``has at its disposal one of the most capable networks of actors coalescing elements of transnational organized crime with terrorism in the world.''  The DEA's acting deputy administrator in 2016 stated that Hezbollah's criminal operations ``provide a revenue and weapons stream for an international terrorist organization responsible for devastating terror attacks around the world.''  Certainly, an organization like that deserves America's utmost scrutiny; and for years, the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra poured their lives into investigating Hezbollah's criminal activities. These agents tracked financial transactions, cultivated sources, and trailed operatives. But, in several cases, when the DEA asked for prosecutions, arrests, or sanctions, President Obama's Department of Justice delayed or denied their requests. The State Department also reportedly declined to demand the extradition of important suspects who could have aided the investigation and spearheaded the downfall of this international operation.  Unfortunately, thanks to multiple sources involved in the matter now coming forward, we have learned that the Obama administration likely stalled the Hezbollah investigations and prosecutions in order to keep Iran happy and nuclear deal talks on the table. If the DEA rocked the boat by arresting and charging key members of Hezbollah's drug and weapons trafficking operations, then Iran might walk away from the negotiating table.  This thinking reveals a fundamental blindness to reality. Hezbollah is funded by Hezbollah is While negotiating with Iran, the former administration turned a blind eye to Hezbollah's extensive criminal activities that were only worsening the drug crisis here in the United States and feeding weapons to terrorists in the Middle East region.  American foreign policy can be pragmatic, but this was not pragmatism. This was foolishness. U.foreign policymakers traded an end to Iran's nuclear program for the protection of Iran's terrorist program. And even then, we can't even trust Iran to abide by the agreement meant to end their nuclear program.  So we are left with a bad deal. I have said it many times before. But now we know the deal is even worse than we suspected. Aside from just delivering pallets of cash to Iran, aside from just freeing billions in frozen assets, aside from just lifting important sanctions, we are also giving a transnational criminal organization and terrorist network free rein over the world.  We are here today to affirm to the world that Iran and its affiliated terrorist organization, Hezbollah, are enemies of the free world.  We should never negotiate with terrorists. I urge President Trump and America's law enforcement community to once again turn its attention to This terrorist organization has spread its evil influence throughout the world, and we have a duty to fight it.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for this opportunity today, and I thank him for bringing this issue up and shining some light on this important subject.

376,topic-id,657,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.4015. I thank Chairman Duffy for his leadership on this bipartisan piece of legislation, which will improve our country's shareholder proxy system.  Since the early 2000s, we have seen market share and the shareholder proxy system consolidate, essentially, into a duopoly, as two firms control 97 percent of the market, so, under the current system, potential conflicts of interest abound.  For example, proxy advisory firms that provide voting recommendations to advisers often provide consulting services to those same public companies. So wouldn't it make sense that they at least notify their shareholders of this potential conflict of interest?  Well, right now, while the SEC has offered guidance on this problem, the proxy firm wouldn't be required to do so. We need to get this bill on the books just to address this problem.                              {time}  1345  This bill is also timely because we have seen proxy firms align themselves with political causes, unions, and interest groups that do not always represent their shareholders' best interests. Shareholders oftentimes aren't even aware of these conflicts. Again, reform is needed.  So it should go without saying, Mr.Speaker, that the two problems outlined above pose problems for the shareholder and for the average investor. We cannot continue to allow the security laws and processes to be wrapped in a service of political agenda.  Mr.Speaker, we have dealt with this issue in the Financial Services Committee on a number of fronts with regard to disclosure of information that is being weaponized against public companies, from mining to conflict minerals. It is time to deal with the proxy issue today.  The number of public companies has fallen in recent years. It was never easy to be public, to be subject to the financial markets and the pressures that come from being accountable to your shareholders. This issue, the proxy issue, is part of a larger tapestry of challenges that public companies face. They are increasingly choosing not to play the game. They are getting capital from dark pools; they are getting capital from hedge funds; and they are just staying private. That puts investment opportunities in the hands of the 1 percent, and that leaves retail investors out in the cold.  Mr.Speaker, my constituents and North Carolina shareholders are from the part-time trader to the full-time trader. They deserve better than this. Luckily, this body can do something to address these problems, and that is where Chairman Duffy's bipartisanship legislation comes into play. His bill will bring about much-needed accountability, competition, and, most importantly, transparency in the proxy advisory firm industry.  This bill also protects clients and their financial future from being influenced by activists and outside interest groups. His legislation accomplishes this by mandating that proxy advisory firms register with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest to the shareholders, and make their methods for coming up with proxy recommendations available to the public.  Two proxy advisory firms should not have this much control of the marketplace and the power to disproportionately affect fundamental corporate transactions. This bill is a win for the consumer, a win for the free market, and should be a bipartisan priority for this body.  A number of outside commentators have been clear that the proxy industry has gained a worrisome degree of authority over companies. In fact, Columbia Law Professor Jeffrey Gordon said that the burden of annual voting would lead investors, particularly institutional investors, to farm out evaluation of most pay plans to a handful of proxy advisory firms who, themselves, will seek to economize on those very proxy review costs. There are a host of others who are saying these same things about the way things are today in proxy voting.  Ultimately, the shareholder is the one who suffers. We should put a stop to it.  Mr.Speaker, once again, I want to thank Chairman Duffy for leading the fight on this issue, and I urge adoption of his legislation.

343,topic-id,288,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, late in June of 2012, like many Americans, I anxiously awaited a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States while they were considering the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Of course, we were[[Page H10258]]told during the run-up to that law, the Affordable Care Act law, that the individual mandate was not a tax; it was, in fact, just a requirement that everyone should buy the insurance.  It seemed unreasonable under the Commerce Clause that that requirement, in fact, would be constitutional. Then, at the end of June, the Supreme Court made the ruling. I was probably right that it was unconstitutional under the Commerce But with some creative work, the Supreme Court said: It is a tax, and the Congress has the absolute power to tax; so, of course, it can stay in the law, and the law stands.  So here we are today, considering tax reform for the first time in 31 years. And since the Supreme Court told us the individual mandate is indeed a tax, it is appropriate, it is right that the individual mandate be part of the discussion today.  The House bill, when we passed it, did not include anything on the individual mandate; but the Senate, in their wisdom, sent it back to us with the individual mandate repealed.  Now, make no mistake about it, the House has repealed the individual mandate any number of times over the last several years. The Senate has not. So the Senate has repealed the individual mandate for the first time.  I say: Let's meet them where they are, let's pass this bill, let's repeal the individual mandate, and get on with making America great again.

526,topic-id,441,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the significance of this historic legislation to all  It has been more than 31 years since comprehensive tax reform was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Reagan, and it has been nearly two decades since the United States has experienced a period of sustained economic growth of 3 percent or more.  Similar to the Tax Code prior to the last major overhaul, today's Tax Code is overly complex and burdensome on American families and businesses. The current code is riddled with nearly 200 tax deductions, credits, exclusions, and tax breaks that ``cost'' the government nearly $1.5 trillion in lost revenue each year. These costs unnecessarily burden hard-working Americans, who spend more than 6 billion hours each year to understand their tax liability and comply with filing requirements.  The Finance Committee began to lay the groundwork for tax reform years ago, during which time the committee held over 70 hearings on how to reform the Tax Code and promote economic growth. In the 113th Congress, the committee also formed five bipartisan[[Page S8109]]working groups to examine options for reform. This years-long process has enabled us to produce the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am confident this legislation, based on ideas from both parties, will benefit all Americans by ensuring our Nation remains competitive in the global economy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will make American businesses competitive again by permanently lowering the corporate rate to roughly the average rate that our competitors have already adopted. This legislation will also end the lock-out affect many American businesses face today by adopting a territorial system. This will encourage American companies to invest their profits here at home and hire more people.  On the individual side, this legislation will lower individual income tax rates for all Americans and greatly simplify the code by roughly doubling the standard deduction. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this will result in fewer than 10 percent of Americans itemizing deductions, meaning the vast majority of Americans will benefit from tax simplification.  I am especially pleased the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act preserves the child and dependent care tax credit and dependent care flexible spending accounts, enhances the ABLE Act, and sharply reduces the number of Americans who are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax, a parallel tax system that adds layers of complexity.  This is historic legislation that hard-working Americans across the country have long deserved, and I look forward to passing this legislation tonight to ensure all Americans have more economic opportunity and prosperity for years to come.

318,topic-id,914,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I have been listening to my colleagues from the other side of the aisle talk about the 1 percent, the people at the top of  Let me tell you who benefits from the status quo of our Tax It is the 1 percent. They can afford the lawyers, the accountants, and the lobbyists to get them all these special tax treatments that the rest of us don't get. If you want to do something about the 1 percent, fix the current Tax  Instead, what our friends on the other side of the aisle keep doing is defending the present Tax Code, because if you don't pass this bill, we have the present Tax We have the status quo, and the rest of us don't see the benefits from the present Tax The rest of us need a break.  Now, I asked the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, when he was before the Rules Committee the other night, three questions that I think are relevant to everybody in  The first thing I asked him was: Will the average individual taxpayer in my district get a tax cut? He said: And he pulled out a sheet of paper. He said: In fact, in your district, Congressman, the average family of four is going to get a tax break of over $2,100 a year.  I know in some places in America, $2,100 a year extra in people's pockets doesn't sound like a lot of money, but in south Alabama, an extra $2,100 in the pockets of hardworking parents who are trying to raise two kids, that is a lot of money. So that is a good thing that is coming out of this bill.  I asked him: Will it be easier for those individuals to fill out their tax returns? He said: By making the changes we made in here and taking out some of these special tax breaks, we made it easier for everybody to fill out their tax return.  Then I asked a third question. I just heard the gentlewoman from New York talk about how this benefits big corporations. I don't have big corporations in my district in south I have got mainly small businesses. Let me tell you about one.  It is called Fast Time Convenience Now, we call those in Alabama filling stations, because you go there and you put gas in your car. In the morning, you go get a cup of coffee, you get one of their breakfast biscuits, and you see a lot of people in there getting ready to go to work. You go in there at lunchtime. You have also got something called Fred's Kickin' You go in there and get a good thing of fried chicken and a soft drink, and he has got some barbecue in a little trailer across the way. That is the sort of businesses I have got in my district.                              {time}  1030  I think those businesses are darn important. The owner of that business asked me the other day when I was in there: I don't care about the big boys.[[Page H10254]]Are you going to do something that helps me, that helps businesses like me?  So I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee: Are we going to be helping those small businesses?  They are going to see historic tax cuts, particularly if they are one of these passthroughs; historic tax cuts. Yes, their tax returns will be simpler to fill out.  So when I think about it from the standpoint of south Alabama--and I daresay my district is not that much different from most every other district that is being represented here--I see a threefer. Individuals get a substantial tax cut, more money in their pocket. Individuals will have an easier time filling out their returns. These small businesses that are the backbone of America are getting a real break.  Now, I know that our friends on the other side of the aisle think that the government needs to be more involved in the lives of ordinary But in order for the government to do that, the government has to have money. The government doesn't produce anything and it doesn't provide a single service, so they don't sell anything.  So how does the government get money?  It takes money. A tax is a taking. It takes money from people in the private sector.  We on this side of the aisle don't think the government should be so involved in people's lives in America, and we don't think we should be taking so much money from them through taxes. So we have come up with this bill that gives sort of tax breaks to ordinary people and small businesses, and we believe that that benefits America in two ways:  Number one, giving people more control over their money is a good thing in and of itself.  Number two, we are absolutely convinced--and dozens and dozens of economists have told us--that this is a major shot in the arm for the American economy.  This is also a jobs bill because this is going to pump up the American economy and get our economy growing at a much faster rate. When we do that, we not only create more jobs, but we create a sort of lift in our economy when we start seeing real wage growth. What we have been missing out there is real wage growth.

500,topic-id,949,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak about this legislation.  At the outset, I thank my colleague from Georgia and the Senator from Utah for their work on the affordable housing tax credit. The Senator from Utah said: Let's work together. I stand ready to work with him on affordable housing in the future, and, hopefully, with the Senator from Georgia, we can make progress on what is a crisis in  I come to speak in opposition to the legislation before us today, the tax reconciliation bill.  One of the requirements of the legislation that I most ardently oppose is including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas development.  Basically, this bill pays for the tax cuts for corporations and millionaires by raising taxes on the middle class, undermining healthcare, and requiring oil drilling in one of our Nation's most iconic national wildlife refuges.  Everyone should understand that a vote for this reconciliation bill is a vote that will go to the biological heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and require drilling. I believe that opening up the Arctic Refuge to oil drilling is being done as a supposed revenue raiser to offset the soaring costs of this tax bill for corporations and the wealthy, but the process that it went through is a sham.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that drilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge will raise less than $1 billion over 10 years. This doesn't even meet the $1 billion reconciliation instruction, and it certainly doesn't represent a serious offset to the huge deficits in the bill. To put this in perspective, less than seven one-hundredths of 1 percent of the $1.5 trillion increase in the national debt will be from this policy in this legislation.  Drilling in the Arctic really has nothing to do with serious budgetary policy, but it has everything to do with evading regular order to pass something that could never pass in the regular order of the legislative process.  In addition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, this bill would sell 7 million barrels of oil from our Nation's Strategic Petroleum A portion of that sale is simply to meet the reconciliation instructions--that is to say, to make this bill work. Yet the sale of oil from our petroleum reserve would also provide a $300 million windfall to four States--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and So this bill is selling off oil in order to pay for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife I do not believe that that makes sense.  Under this sham process, the bill will turn one of our Nation's wildest and most pristine areas into an oil field. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest refuge in our Nation and is one of the crown jewels for us in the United States for wildlife refuges. I believe it is a U.

I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter we received from the Jane Goodall Institute be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   The Jane Goodall Institute,                                    Vienna, VA, November 14, 2017.       Dear United States Senator: It seems that each day brings      ever more dire news about what we humans are doing to harm      our planet, the animals that share it with us and, by doing      so, harming ourselves also. You have an important opportunity      to make a difference both now, and for future generations, by      voting to oppose oil development in one of the world's most      spectacular wilderness areas--the Arctic National Wildlife            This Refuge is a truly wonderful place--nearly 20 million      acres of pristine and ecologically significant habitat. There      is compelling scientific evidence as to why it is truly      important to protect this place. For one thing, it provides      key breeding habitat for the millions-upon-millions of birds      that migrate there from six of our planet's seven continents.      It is also a calving ground for the 200,000-strong Porcupine      caribou herd. And it is one of the most important denning      habitats on earth for polar bears. Moreover it plays a      significant role in helping to protect us from the onslaught      of climate change.[[Page S8095]]       But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is more than that.      Its very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual      connection to nature, a necessary element of the human      psyche. The Gwich'in people understand this and call the area      ``The Sacred Place Where Life Begins''.       If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil      beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the      Gwich'in people for they depend upon the caribou herds to      sustain their traditional way of life. Around the globe so      many indigenous people have been harmed in the name of      `progress'--let us not add one more tragedy to the list. We      have other sources of energy.

501,topic-id,1656,"Mr.President, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, describes it as ``the only conservation system unit that protects, in an undisturbed condition, a complete spectrum of the Arctic ecosystems in North America.'' It is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife--47 different species of mammals, including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, Dall sheep, moose, musk ox, and caribou. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge also provides important habitat for over 40 species of fish and more than 200 species of migratory birds.  So why would we want to destroy this refuge?  It was first established by the Eisenhower administration. Congress later protected this amazing Arctic area and its ecosystem in order to protect the wildlife and protect the habitat because of its incredible diversity. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is really known as the ``last great wilderness'' in our country, one of the great, last wild places, but this legislation turns that on its head.  It would make oil and gas development one of the statutory purposes of the Wildlife Refuge, and under this legislation, this Refuge would become the only Refuge where oil and gas development is required by law. It opens up the entire 1.5 million-acre coastal plain for oil and gas exploration and requires the leasing of at least 800,000 acres. It requires the leasing of areas with the highest oil and gas potential, no matter the consequences for the wildlife or the environment.  The bill requires that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be managed as a petroleum reserve, which is unprecedented, and it undercuts managing the Refuge for wildlife.  The bill includes no clear requirements to comply with environmental laws or to protect wildlife. Its sponsors, however, say that they are not preempting environmental laws and that, in fact, laws like the National Environmental Policy Act will ``fully apply.'' Yet this bill undercuts those assurances of compliance with environmental laws by adding oil development as a purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife Adding oil development as a purpose is contrary to the purpose of a wildlife refuge.  The purpose of a wildlife refuge is to protect wildlife and to make sure that the managers of wildlife do so in a sound fashion.  At every other wildlife refuge in the country, development within the refuge is only permitted to the extent that it is compatible with protecting wildlife. This bill tries to waive one of the most important management protections that applies to every other national wildlife refuge--that development must be compatible with protecting wildlife. They have to do this because they know that oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not compatible. It is just the opposite.  It is important to note also that this bill does not provide any energy security. There is no prohibition in the bill against exporting oil from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and in all likelihood, much of the oil will be exported.  In addition to opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to development, the bill also requires the sale of 7 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to give $300 million, as I mentioned earlier, to several States--Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and  So at the same time as we are being told that we must ruin a national wildlife refuge because we need the oil, we are selling oil out of the Strategic Petroleum It does not make sense for It just doesn't add up.  The impact of oil and gas exploration in the wildlife area and the danger to our wildlife cannot be overstated. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain and nearby waters are designated as critical habitat for polar bears, which are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Female polar bears head to the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain so that they can create snow dens, where they give birth to their young. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has a higher concentration of polar bear denning habitat than any other area on Alaska's North  The refuge is also the summer calving grounds for the porcupine caribou herd. This herd's range extends into Canada, and we actually have a treaty between both of our countries to protect this herd. The almost 200,000-member herd has an annual migration of hundreds of miles--and in some cases, thousands of miles--wintering in the south of the  I think that this herd of caribou is so important because scientists say that it has an entirely different kind of migration pattern than other caribou in Alaska, that it has been adept at dealing with the adaptation that comes along with climate change.  Why not, instead of ruining their habitat, study and understand this migration that has been studied since the 1950s? It has been part of our national investment in understanding wildlife. It has been supported by both Democratic and Republican administrations, to understand the science and background of this caribou herd. These caribou are an important food source for many Alaska Natives but in particular the Gwich'in people who live south of the Wildlife biologists argue that the risk to the caribou herd and to those who rely on them could be quite significant.  So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?  The last few years have been a difficult budget situation in Relying on oil for 90 percent of the budget, I agree with many others, is unsustainable. Every dollar the price of oil per barrel drops, reduces the State budget by $30 million, or close to 1 percentage point per dollar. The general revenue fund in Alaska dropped over 80 percent after 2012, and that situation caused Alaska's $4 billion deficit projection last year. Difficult choices had to be made about taxes, savings, spending, and what the State government should do. Thankfully, their economy hasn't collapsed, but in the last big oil-driven recession in the 1980s, Alaska's banks failed, housing prices collapsed, and 15 percent of the population left.  Why am I bringing this up? Because the good news is today's Alaska economy is more diverse than it was 30 years ago. I know this because I talk to my colleagues and because we are interacting in a lot of ways in the Pacific  Alaska is well known for its tourism. Two million visitors to Alaska spend $1,000 per person in the State, supporting a $7.3 billion outdoor industry. My colleagues here may not realize what my colleagues from Alaska and Washington know, and that is that the State of Alaska and Washington have a lot of interdependence. A recent study found that 113,000 jobs in Puget Sound are tied to Alaska's economy, and this number has doubled in the last 30 years.  What are those jobs? One-quarter of those are in the seafood industry. Almost 1,000 commercial-vessel owning fishermen who work in Alaska's fisheries are part of the trade between us. The Alaska trade accounts for one in five containerized shipments through the Port of Seattle and the Port of Another 14,000 jobs are tied to passenger transportation to Alaska, including 430,000 cruise ship passengers who come through Puget Sound every year. That is just one way of saying the Washington-Alaska economies are tied[[Page S8096]]together, and as a hub for Arctic commerce, I have worked with my colleagues Senator Murkowski and Senator Sullivan on issues such as new Coast Guard Arctic icebreakers that are so needed for the future. I have supported more funding for demonstration programs for renewable energy and microgrids in an effort to help the local economy. I feel the same way about rural broadband across the Nation, and we want to make sure we are deploying and helping with everything we can to bring more connectivity to Alaska, but I really question how opening the Arctic Wildlife Refuge is a solution to these problems.  Even under CBO's aggressive view, if leasing occurs in the Refuge, it will be many years before Alaskans see any significant revenue. So my colleagues should be aware that doubling down on oil by sacrificing one of the great wildlife refuges will not, in my opinion, help close Alaska's budget deficit, and it will not help them diversify for the future.  This Arctic Wildlife Refuge is too special, too important. It is one of the crown jewels of our National Wildlife Refuge system. We should be preserving it. We should not be destroying it. We should not be turning it into an oilfield.  I am reminded that many people over many decades have fought for this great area of our country, to maintain its environmental stewardship, starting with Olaus Murie, who went there and did great explorations and convinced many people here in this Washington that it was something so special and worth preserving.  After decades of his scientific exploration in Alaska, Olaus testified in 1959 in support of creating the Arctic Wildlife He said: ``We long for something more, something that has a mental, a spiritual impact on us. This idealism, more than anything else, will set us apart as a nation striving for something worthwhile in the universe.''  So what is setting us apart today? Some very short-term gains. In 100 years, when this economic tax bill will long be forgotten, the question will be whether something important in the universe still exists in the Arctic wildlife area. We didn't create the Arctic Coastal Plain, but I can state this: We cannot recreate it. What we are doing today is taking a step toward destroying it.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this reconciliation bill. Do not sacrifice the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil development. Don't take one of the great, wild, pristine places on this planet and turn it into an oilfield. We can do better as a nation. I know we can do better as a region, and we can do better with a better Arctic strategy for our Nation's future.  I yield the floor.

1161,topic-id,1140,"Madam President, I wish to call attention to several urgent and bipartisan health programs that Congress must renew without further delay.  The Republican majority has spent much of this year trying to pass partisan healthcare and tax legislation. As a result, they have neglected to extend numerous uncontroversial healthcare programs, threatening these programs' very existence and causing needless chaos and uncertainty.  It is past time that the Republican-controlled Congress extend these programs to provide healthcare access and certainty to millions of  First, I would like to address the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP is a bipartisan healthcare success story. Enacted 20 years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and the late Senator Ted Kennedy, CHIP brings affordable health coverage to children in families who are not eligible for Medicaid but struggle to afford private insurance.  Washington's successful CHIP program, Apple Health for Kids, covers about 60,000 children. Through CHIP, parents get peace of mind, and States and the Federal Government pitch in to share the cost.  CHIP means affordable healthcare for 9 million children. On average, a family of four pays $158 per year in premiums and deductibles for each CHIP-enrolled child. The same family would likely pay more than $1,000 in annual out-of-pocket costs on a commercial insurance plan, even after counting available financial help. That is a difference of more than $800 per year for millions of families across the country and represents real affordability.  Because of CHIP, children have a medical home. In fact, more than 90 percent of Washington children with CHIP coverage visited a primary care[[Page S8146]]provider at least once in 2014, the most recent year in which data were available. CHIP also provides kids with benefits that are often more comprehensive than those offered in the commercial insurance market, including immunizations, periodic screenings, hearing exams, and dental care. We know that prevention and early detection are key to reducing the burden of disease and health costs. CHIP emphasizes these early interventions during the critical early years of a child's life, helping kids grow up to be healthy, productive, and successful adults.  Yet, despite CHIP's near-universal popularity and lack of partisan controversy, this Congress has allowed CHIP to go unfunded since October 1, 2017. This long and unprecedented lapse threatens CHIP's very survival. Already, it has thrown States, including Washington, into crippling uncertainty and administrative disruption. Some States have been forced to send letters to CHIP families informing them that their coverage will end. Moreover, if Congress fails to extend CHIP, my State will be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars to make up for Congress's failure to act.  Next, I would like to highlight the urgent need to reauthorize funding to community health centers.  Community health centers are a bedrock of the healthcare safety net and are the preferred medical home for tens of millions of working Washington's 26 community health centers serve 1 million people in every corner of my State, from Spokane to Seattle, Omak to Port  Community health centers are a lean and efficient healthcare delivery model, focusing on primary care, prevention, case management and social services for their patients. They are also good for the economy, supporting more than 9,000 jobs and $1 billion in annual economic output in my State alone.  The Community Health Center Fund, which comprises the majority of these health centers' Federal funds, expired on October 1, 2017. As a result, community health centers in my State are at risk of having to turn off the lights and turn away patients. Already, the expiration of the Community Health Center Fund has threatened these centers' ability to retain and hire nurses and doctors and make financial arrangements for the coming year.  The Community Health Center Fund was enacted in 2010 so that millions of newly covered Americans would have a medical home. The fund is doing just that. Moreover, the Community Health Center Fund was extended with strong bipartisan support in 2015, when an overwhelming majority of the House and Senate, myself included, supported its extension as part of the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act, It is past time for Congress to extend this program without delay.  In addition, Federal funds have been allowed to expire for a number of additional but equally important health programs. All enjoy a history of strong bipartisan support. These programs include the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, the Special Diabetes Program, the Teaching Health Center Program, and certain Medicare provisions.  The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting--MIECHV--Program is an evidence-based grant that is helping States and Tribes improve early childhood and maternal health. MIECHV-funded home visiting programs, which are voluntary, have benefited 1,650 Washington families in 15 counties and have reduced in half the likelihood of child abuse and neglect. MIECHV is a prime example of evidence-driven policymaking that is improving the health and well-being of vulnerable mothers and children. It is also strongly bipartisan. Unfortunately, MIECHV's Federal funding expired on October 1, 2017.  The Special Diabetes Program and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians are modest investments with a proven track record of combatting diabetes. As a senior member of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I recognize that diabetes is a leading cause of death and a major driver of healthcare costs. In particular, the Special Diabetes Program for Indians supports 27 community-driven grant programs in Washington's Tribal communities, helping Tribal members prevent, diagnose, and manage this condition through lifestyle changes, counseling, and treatment.  The Teaching Health Center Program is also a small investment with a big return. Teaching Health Center funds are currently being used to train 722 primary care medical residents in 27 States and the District of Data show that many physicians eventually practice close to where they train, and the Teaching Health Center Program is training physicians where they are needed most. In Spokane, Toppenish, Tacoma, Yakima, and Auburn, Teaching Health Centers are training a new generation of safety-net physicians to serve those most in need. While the Teaching Health Center Program has received a short-term extension, its funding will expire on January 1, 2018, if Congress does not act.  Lastly, several temporary Medicare provisions have expired and must be renewed. These provisions help rural Medicare patients get hospital, ambulance, and home health services where they live. Additional Medicare ``extenders'' prevent essential services like physical therapy from being arbitrarily capped for Medicare patients. Extending these provisions is important to preserving healthcare access in rural Washington State and empowering our healthcare delivery system to continue to improve and innovate.  The programs I have highlighted and many more are vital to my constituents, my State's economy, and our healthcare delivery system. They are also strongly bipartisan. I call on my Republican colleagues to work with us in a good-faith negotiation to extend these programs immediately.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8145-3.txt,172,1015,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
232,topic-id,1935,"Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague from Missouri for highlighting a lot of the good work of this past year in the Senate and touching on some highlights, particularly in the veterans area, that have great impact across the country. It is something on which we all joined together compassionately, wanting to help our veterans and wanting to make sure they get the best care in the best way as quickly as possible, and I appreciate his highlighting that.  I wish to highlight the positive change that this Republican majority has brought to the American people in the first year of President Trump's administration. I am going to talk about a few different things than my colleague from Missouri, and I think you would expect that. I come from the State of West Certain policies impact us differently, and so that is what having the time to talk about our accomplishments over the past year gives us the ability to do.  I can't begin without talking about one of the biggest and boldest actions that we have taken this week, and that is our pro-growth tax reform bill. Throughout the process, I traveled across the State and heard from many constituents--friends and many strangers--all about this effort. Not only at the beginning did they realize what a difference this will make in their lives, but, as my colleague from Missouri said, as we move through this year, when you start to see your paychecks change and you bring home more of your own money because your rate went down or when you begin to file in April, realizing that this is the last time you have to file this complicated thing--I am going to be able to make it easier on myself--families, workers, and small businesses across our State are really counting on relief, and this week we delivered on that.  In West Virginia, particularly when asked ``How is this really going to help the bulk of the people in the middle-wage earning families?'' I like to highlight the fact that in my State in particular, 83 percent of our tax filers don't take itemizations. They file with the standard deduction. That has now been doubled.  The child tax credit has been doubled, as the gentleman from Wyoming said. It gives that child tax credit, and that goes right to the heart of the middle-wage earning family trying to make ends meet at the end of the day.  They are predictions, but we feel certain that with the doubling of these deductions and this credit, more people will file on the smaller form and also push that number to maybe over 90 percent.  This year, we also delivered on significant regulatory reforms, especially in the energy realm, which is absolutely impactful in my area of the country. Under the Congressional Review Act, the Senate has repealed 14 of President Obama's very onerous regulations.  I led the effort to enact a CRA to fix the burdensome stream protection rule. This rule really threatened what was left of the coal industry in our region. The Obama-era rule would have prohibited many forms of coal mining in I kept saying: Let's balance this.  Under Scott Pruitt's leadership, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan--another onerous regulation with minimal benefit. We can do it better, and I believe, in this EPA, we will.  For years, I asked the Obama administration--Madam President, we serve on the same committee--I asked the EPA to come to my State and see what the impacts are of the rules and the regulations that they are putting forward. They never came. This year, the EPA finally answered my calls and came to the State of West Virginia--the State capital, Charleston, WV--to listen to both sides of those who will be impacted by any regulations that the EPA puts forward.  We also reformed the waters of the United States--or WOTUS--rule, which has severe impacts not only in the mining community but particularly in the agriculture community and other industries in and around the country.  Many parts of West Virginia continue to feel the impact of the devastating floods that we suffered a year ago So with my service on the Appropriations Committee, I worked diligently with others to ensure that our community needs are met.  That is the great thing about this country. I know Texas certainly and Florida, Puerto Rico, and other areas are weaving through these devastating weather-related and natural disasters. With all the sadness that is occurring and all the destruction that we see, the one thing we appreciate as Americans is our ability to come together and help one another. The first person I met when I was going to see the floods had traveled 51\1/2\ hours with their church to come and help those who had been flooded out of their homes. On the Appropriations Committee, we were able to get more funding for damage to roads and other property and individuals so that West Virginians could get back to work and provide for their families.  I also focused my efforts on ensuring that our State had the resources it needs to fight back against the continued devastation wrought by the drug epidemic.  Just yesterday or today, the CDC came out with a report that had lines on a graph that showed the different age groups and the number of deaths that occurred because of opioids, and every line was going up.  The State of West Virginia has been particularly hard hit with this. We have the highest rate of opioid drug overdose deaths per 100,000 of any State in the  I worked with the new CMS to try to help secure a Medicaid waiver that would allow West Virginians to expand substance abuse treatment and also services for Medicaid members and expand the ability for treatment to be offered to folks who have I partnered with officials from the Office of National Drug Control Policy to hear directly from West Virginians at a roundtable. The Chief of Staff of the White House office also participated in roundtables at the White  In honor of West Virginian Jessie Grubb, Senator Manchin and I saw the passage of Jessie's This law bolsters our fight by requiring HHS to develop standards for hospitals and health professionals on a patient's history with addiction. Jessie Grubb admitted she was addicted when she was in the hospital. She wasn't in the hospital for addiction issues; she admitted she had an addiction problem. She left with opioids. She didn't live another 24 hours. In her honor, Senator Manchin and I have worked hard to see that this doesn't happen to another family.  As West Virginia continues to be ground zero for this epidemic, I won't stop my work for those who are suffering, including looking at innovative solutions like those we have at Lily's Place in Huntington for the babies who are born drug-exposed--again, innocent victims of those rising lines I saw in the charts the CDC put forward.  We have been working with law enforcement to ensure that they have the tools they need to administer emergency assistance, such as naxolone, to those who may be overdosing, or build on telehealth projects, demonstration projects that can help with substance abuse treatment.  I have always said that we need a spectrum of solutions. As we look back, we have done a lot. As we look forward, we have to do more because the problem is getting worse.  I think we also have had tremendous success and impact in our quest to connect West I created a program called Capito Connect that would move high-speed internet connectivity into the rural parts of our country, in places like West Virginia that are underserved. Through Capito Connect and my GO Act, we have seen accelerated broadband access in West Virginia certainly but also in rural I was able to work with the USDA to get our local communities a consortium to secure a USDA loan to be able to move broadband to 9,000 more West  So working with other agencies, EDA and others, on not just moving on broadband but economic development projects, we have seen impacts in 45 of[[Page S8204]]the 55 counties that I represent but also being able to create an associated 1,400 jobs.  Federal grants like these help not only our communities but our universities, such as Marshall and West Virginia Universities, which provide great benefits to our communities.  These are tangible achievements over the last year--both more global, such as the tax reform, and more local, as in broadband deployment.  The Senate also plays an important role by giving advice and consent on President Trump's nominations and confirming them. This year, Republicans made significant progress in shaping the judiciary, most certainly starting with the confirmation of our Supreme Court Justice Neil His strong record and straightforward approach are just what we expect from a Supreme Court I was proud to vote for his confirmation this year. We have also confirmed 12 circuit judges--the highest number during a President's first year since 1891.  I am pleased to say that as of yesterday, we had confirmed both of our U.attorneys in the State of West I am very grateful for that because this fight against opioids has to have the U.attorney's help. It has to have the U.attorney aggression--not just with law enforcement but also helping with treatment.  So this year, I am proud that we addressed a lot of America's concerns. We have tackled challenges head-on and delivered real results. I am proud that President Trump and his administration are listening to the needs of small States like mine, West Virginia, and working with me to deliver that relief.  It has been an honor for me to host some Cabinet members in the State of West Virginia--I didn't see that over the last 8 years--Secretary Perry, Secretary of Energy; Secretary Mnuchin, Secretary of Treasury; and also the Secretary of We went on a coal mine tour with Secretary This helps them see the kinds of ups and downs of life in rural and central United States--in Appalachia in particular.  We have a lot we have to do. We have a lot on our plate. I think it is always this time of year that, in my personal life, I like to look back at some of the great things that we have accomplished as a family or for those whom I love or some of the things that happened to us that maybe haven't been quite as good as we would have hoped. I also take this time to be a grateful person, to be a grateful American, to be a grateful West Virginian because we are so blessed with where we live and how we live and the bounty of our friendships. But I also take the time to look forward to what we are going to be able to do. So when I see tax reform kicking in next year, in 2018, that is what I am going to be looking forward to for so many hard-working West Virginians, so many hard-working small business owners, and so many people who have been waiting for years--decades, in some cases--for the kind of reform that we put forward.  With that, I would like to yield back my time, but first I would just like to say that I am grateful to be serving with the three Members who are in here with me today. I wish everybody here and everybody listening in this country a very wonderful holiday season.  Thank you.

377,topic-id,531,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, this is one of those mundane issues that 95 percent of America doesn't understand. I didn't understand much about it a while back because I don't have any proxy advisers. I do have money in retirement funds. I do get those 100-page documents in the mail, saying, ``We are having a proxy fight and you should read it,'' in the smallest print possible, and I do what 95 percent of America[[Page H10322]]does when I get those: I throw them right in the trash.  Now, that doesn't make me smart. It just means I can't read through that stuff. I can't understand what they are doing with my pension funds. I kind of have to go on faith that they are not sticking it to me. That is what most of us do, and most anybody listening to this, that is the only thing they have to do with this issue.  So I went out and found out what is a proxy adviser. Here is what it is.  The pension funds--not always, but mostly pension funds--that invest my pension money do it all across the board. Many of them are small. Some of them are big. And when it comes time to reading those 100-page documents and the thousands of companies they invest in, they go and hire somebody to help them do it, a proxy adviser. They go through those documents with accountants and actuaries and give them advice. Not a demand--advice.  Now, I don't know about you. I get advice from my lawyer on occasion. I get advice from my accountant on occasion. I get advice from my priest on occasion. And it is none of your damn business what advice they give me, because two of them I am paying and one of them loves me.  When a person or an entity hires someone else to give them advice, it is no one else's business what that is. This bill says it is. It now would be the business of the company about whom they are giving the advice.  I paid them. Why should I share that information with you? That is what a proxy adviser is. It is not some big swami sitting in the back sticking it to big corporations. It is a paid adviser.  Now, we have heard, oh, terrible things that these advisers do.  Who do they work for? Well, they work for pension funds--mostly pension funds, by the way, that are public pension funds, not all. They have the pension money of teachers, firefighters, police officers, trash collectors, water workers all across this country.

269,topic-id,1124,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Durbin for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and so many others.  The Dreamers are part of this country. They are America's future. They are helping to build this great Nation, and they need our attention now.  The Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White One of their principal responsibilities is to pass a budget. We are now 3 months into the fiscal year, and we don't have a budget, and we are talking about another continuing resolution. A couple of weeks ago, we were told on the floor to give it a couple of more weeks, and we would work out some of these issues. I agree with Senator The time to act is now. We should not be going into recess without dealing with the problems of our country. We need to deal with the budget problem, and we, certainly, need to deal with the problem of the Let me just talk a little bit about them.  They entered the United States before they were 16 years old--that is required--before 2007. Under President Obama's Executive order of 2012, they were entitled to a 2-year renewable work permit and the ability to remain in this country without being in fear of deportation. Each one has to go through a criminal background check. They need to be enrolled in school. They must either be high school graduates or in the U.military. In the United States today, we have 800,000 who are registered under the There are 10,000 in my State of Maryland, and they are contributing a half a billion dollars to Maryland's GDP, or gross domestic product. They are our next generation of teachers, doctor, engineers, and entrepreneurs. They are going to help build America, and they know no other country but the United States, which is their home.  In our values, what makes America the great Nation that it is is that we are a welcoming country. We are a country in which people have come over the years to build this great That is America's strength.  Are we going to turn our back now on the values that built this country? Are we going to rip families apart? Is that what America stands for? I find that hard to imagine. Would we do this to our own economy and hurt ourselves, as we are growing with their help?  I have met with many Dreamers, not as many as Senator He probably has the record. But I met with several Dreamers in We had one in our office yesterday who had tears in her eyes. She said: I have an expiration date on my back. She doesn't know what is going to happen when that date occurs.  How would you like to live under that fear in the United States of America? We are not talking about some communist country. We are talking about America, where people are living in fear.  I have had several roundtable discussions with Dreamers in I have had them in College Park, Baltimore, and in other areas. Let me mention two Dreamers I met with. Adam was originally born in His family grew up in He came to the United States with his parents when he was very young. Becky was born in Peru and came here with her parents to the United I mention them collectively because they both attend the University of Maryland at College Our State allows Dreamers to have instate tuition so they can go to college and get the tools they need in order to succeed. They need work permits because they have to work. Otherwise, they never would have been able to get through school. They need a driver's license. Adam explained to me that he needed a driver's license to go to a magnet school so that he could advance his own education. That was all possible through President Obama's Executive order. Now all of that has been put into doubt because of President Trump's announcements that the program will end. It puts their lives on hold and in fear, and they wonder whether they need to go into the shadows in the United States of  President Trump's actions were wrong. We can correct that, and Congress must act. We must act now before we go home for the holidays.  I wish to talk about a similar group of people in our country--a large number in my State of Maryland--those under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, because it is a similar situation. There are 437,000 people in America from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and In Maryland, 22,500 people are here from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti--from those three countries alone--and 90 percent of the TPS people in this country are from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the three principal countries. My own State's recipients contribute $1.2 billion of our gross domestic product. This is a very similar situation to the They get a 6- to 18-month extension. They have been here for decades because the underlying conditions in the countries from which they came still exist today. I have been to Central I can tell you that it is not safe for these people to be returned to those gang activities. They have the same similar situation. They know no other country but If they are required to go back to the country in which they were born, it will tear families apart. They have been disadvantaged by the President's actions where he is now threatening to end these programs.  We need to act. We need to act in order to protect this group of citizens. I want to acknowledge that my colleagues have introduced legislation on this. 2144 provides a pathway to citizenship for those with TPS status. It is sponsored by Senators Van Hollen, Feinstein, and others. We should take that bill up and pass it. Let's provide protections. Let's strengthen American values. Let's do our work. Let's do it now. Let's do it before we go on recess. It is the right thing to do.  Let me just conclude by quoting from Becky again, one of the Dreamers I met. She said the best present she ever got was on her 13th birthday, when President Obama executed the Executive order that gave her legal status and hope here in  Well, we can give her an even better present right now before we take the recess for the Christmas holidays. We can give her a present of Congress, acting to provide protection for the Dreamers and for those on TPS so they don't have to worry again and they know they have a home here in  I yield the floor.

548,topic-id,3329,"Mr.President, the American people understand this bill. They understand this bill will hurt middle-income families, and they know this bill will add to the deficit. They understand the Joint Committee on Tax has scored the bill as adding to the deficit. I hear so many of my Republican friends talk about these deficit hawks. We follow the recommendations of our professionals. This bill will add to the deficit. That is why the American people believe this tax bill, which has been advertised by Republicans as a tax cut, is not good for It is an extraordinary thing to get the majority of Americans against a bill that is purported to be a tax cut, because they understand it is not a tax cut for middle-income families.  Let me give one number. The corporate tax rate under this bill will be reduced from 35 percent to 21 percent. That is a substantial reduction in the corporate tax rate. Now, understand that only about 5 percent of the largest businesses in America pay the corporate tax rate. It isn't a rate paid by small businesses. This is paid by megacorporations. They are getting a tax cut.  When we look at the cost of that tax cut as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation--the professionals--it is about $1.5 trillion of business tax relief. Guess who pays that $1.5 trillion. It goes on our national debt, and middle-income taxpayers are going to be asked to foot the bill.  They get that. They understand this doesn't help middle-income families. You are not helping middle-income families when you raise the estate tax limits so fewer families pay the estate tax, which already affects only the 0.2 percent wealthiest in They are getting a break. Already, we have a concentration of wealth in The top 1 percent owns close to 40 percent of the wealth in They understand that doesn't help middle-income families because they understand that we have seen in America the shrinking of the middle class and that we have had an increase in income and wealth disparity in  That is not good for our economy. That is not how you grow an economy or how you grow a middle class. This bill will not grow a middle class. This bill will make even more extreme the income and wealth disparities in this country.  They also get it when we talk about what is temporary and what is permanent. I really appreciate my friends talking about the deficit. Of course, they don't include the fact that many of these tax provisions are only temporary, such as the major tax relief for individuals. That is temporary in nature. The business tax is permanent.  I hear my Republican friends saying that we will just extend it. If you extend it, the deficit is even larger than the $1.5 trillion. As to the individuals and the middle-income families who get some of the benefits of this bill, when we add it all up, they lose. The benefits they get are temporary, but business tax relief is permanent. This bill is an assault on middle-income families.  When we take a look at how we are going to have to pay off that deficit and who is going to pay off that deficit, it is going to be middle-income families left holding the bill. We know that. That is why this bill is not popular. That is why we know that it is not good for middle-income families and it is not good for our economy.  But they even go further. It has been pointed out in the Senate that they have added a provision that is now in the conference report which takes out an essential part of the Affordable Care Act on individual responsibility that would ultimately leave about 13 million Americans without health insurance.  Why was this done? It was done for two reasons. First, Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and these 13 million people who have benefits today are going to lose it. But a second thing is that you can use those savings--and they are not real savings; we are talking about less money being used to help people get health insurance--to provide additional tax cuts for wealthy Americans and corporations. So you are knocking 13 million people out of health insurance and using that money in order to extend these tax breaks for higher income and businesses. That is unconscionable.  What is going to come next when you are not even subtle about this? They now are going to say that the deficits are bigger than previously expected. I hear my friends on the Republican side. They are deficit hawks. Well, you are not deficit hawks when you deficit-finance a tax cut. That is not helping this country.  So what comes next? Well, we are going to have to cut Medicaid and Who suffers when you cut Medicaid and Medicare? It is going to be middle-income families again.  Then we have to take a look at the Federal budget. We have heard some of my colleagues already talk about this. I see plans right now that we are going to take it out on the Federal workforce--the Federal workforce, which has already contributed about $182 billion to the deficit, through getting pay adjustments below the cost of living, having freezes, going through continuing resolutions, sequestration, and government shutdowns, asked to do more with less.  We are talking about critical services to the American people, whether it is research done at the National Institutes of Health, whether it is food safety, whether it is veterans services, or whether we are talking about dealing with the opioid crisis in All of that is in jeopardy, and we know that. We know they are coming back with cuts in these programs because we now have a bigger deficit as a result of giving corporations these big tax cuts--not all businesses, just the biggest businesses--and giving the high-income people this tax relief. That is why the American people do not like this bill.  We talked about creating jobs. I heard my friend again talking about creating 1 million jobs under this tax bill--spending $1.5 trillion and creating 1 million jobs. We had bipartisan legislation in the last Congress that took a couple hundred billion dollars of one-time only revenues and said the responsible thing would be to use that to seed infrastructure. If we could get[[Page S8129]]that up to about $300 billion, we create 4 million jobs. So that is 4 million jobs for $300 billion. Here we have 1 million jobs, by their own number, and spending $1.5 trillion. It is a terrible investment for the American people. We can do better.  This bill is also an attack on our It is an attack on It is an attack on the State of Marylanders will come out much worse under this bill. There are many reasons for it, but one of the major reasons is that the bill eliminates the deduction for State and local taxes. I am going to talk for a moment about that because I did serve in the State legislature, as did many of the Members of this body. I believe we should respect State and local government. It is the same taxpayer who pays local taxes, pays State taxes, and pays Federal taxes. Ever since we adopted a Federal income tax, one of the only provisions that remains intact throughout the entire history of the income tax is to say that we are not going to tax on tax. We are not going to impose taxes on State and local taxes. That, of course, was one of the reasons why a constitutional amendment was changed, to allow income taxes, and now we are breaking that commitment on  We are really breaking the constitutional spirit to tell our State and local governments that we are going to impose taxes on taxes and make it more difficult for them to raise the revenue they need in order to finance State and local services.  In Maryland, about 45 percent of Marylanders use the State and local tax deduction. We happen to rank 1 in the Nation on the number of taxpayers that use State and local tax deductions on their Federal income tax returns.  The average amount in Maryland on deductions for State and local taxes is $12,900. That is the average. So the average taxpayer in Maryland is going to pay more taxes as a result of the $10,000 limit imposed in this bill. But it even gets worse for Marylanders, and I think this is going to be typical in a lot of States around the Maryland has an itemized deduction. It has standardized deductions on their income taxes, as many States do. But I think Marylanders are going to be surprised to find out they may not qualify for itemizing their deductions at the Federal level because, as a result of the changes that have been made here, only about 5 percent of the people in this country will still use the itemized deduction.  So go and do your Federal taxes, then go do your State taxes, expecting to be able to deduct the State items, only to find that if you haven't deducted at the Federal level, you can't deduct at the State level because we harmonize in our enforcement with the Federal You didn't think about that when you put this provision in the bill.  I heard my friend say we had hearings. We didn't have hearings on that provision. We have never had a hearing on that provision. We never brought State people into our committee and say: What happens if we raise the deduction? What impact does it have on the States? What are the impacts on the States if we eliminate State and local tax deductions? We haven't had those discussions.  Quite frankly, it is going to be more challenging for our States and local governments to meet their needs. They have the primary function for educating our children and keeping our communities safe. That is a primary function of local government, and sanitation and dealing with public health. It is going to be much more challenging for our State and local governments to be able to do their finance. Did we consider that when we took up this bill? The answer is no. There are so many consequences to this bill that have not really been thought out. Let me just give a few.  There is a reason why people concerned about the real estate industry are concerned about this bill. The limitations we put on the deductions of property taxes and the limitations that have been increased on the amount of interest you can deduct on mortgages will all have an impact on property values. Properties that Americans own will be less valuable with the passage of this bill because they will not be able to get the same tax advantages as they had prior to it. Have we thought about that impact? Have we thought about what that does to wealth and middle-income families? Have we thought about what impact that has on assessed evaluations on local governments that depend upon property taxes? There has been no consideration of that.  I met this week with leaders in our nonprofit community in We went over some of the issues they deal with in providing help to our community. Several were faith-based-type charitable groups. I went over what impact it is going to have with the restrictions on the number of people who are now going to be using itemized deductions.  One of the charitable faith-based groups I met with told me that the overwhelming majority of their givers are in the middle income. Today, they are able to take a deduction because they use itemized deductions. Under this bill, most of those families are going to fall within the standard deduction and will no longer be itemizing their deductions on their Federal tax returns.  Now, they don't know what impact that is going to have. But when their givers find out there is no tax advantage to that gift, you know it is going to have an impact. We know that. Charitable giving is going to be down. I hear my colleagues talk frequently that a lot of what we do to help people is that we rely upon the private sector. We rely upon the charitable groups. Did we have the courtesy to bring them into a hearing to understand the impact this is going to have? No, it is going to have a negative impact on our nonprofit charitable groups, and that is another consequence of this legislation, that we don't have the full impact to understand.  Let me talk just a minute about this 20 percent deduction on passthrough income. Just so people in this country understand, this is a rather complicated provision that was added to the bill. It provides additional tax relief for businesses that do not use the C tax rate. These are our partnerships, our S corporations, our limited partnerships, and our sole proprietorships. Understand what we are trying to do here. Because we have cut the corporate rates so low--down to 21 percent from 35 percent--we recognize that other businesses now are going to be at a disadvantage. That is true. So we are trying to figure out some way to give them tax relief.  Now, I have heard my colleagues talk about simplifying the Tax This provision does anything but simplify the Tax It has what is known as guardrails as to how we calculate how much you can take, up to the 20 percent of the distribution, as a nontaxable event. That guardrail affects the type of business you are doing, it affects the amount of assets you have, it affects the amount of salaries you give, the labor that is done within it, whether it is actually services performed by the partnership or not. My goodness, it is a minefield for accountants and tax lawyers to now develop shelters.  I am old enough to remember the 1986 tax debates here in the United States I was not part of the I was in the State legislature at the time. I remember the effort to get rid of shelters, because shelters are an inefficient way that you set up business structures in order to minimize taxes. Well, this passthrough provision is going to be used as shelters. There is no question about it. We have had no hearings at all as to how we are going to deal with that problem.  Then I heard one of my colleagues on the Republican side talk about how this is going to bring all these jobs back home.  Let me make this clear. What this bill does is move toward a territorial tax system. What does that mean? That means companies today that outsource some of their work to another country will be able to pay only that country's tax rate rather than the U.tax rate. That means that in some cases they will be able to pay less in taxes. What they can now do--because we are harmonizing to a territorial tax, we are rewarding some companies to outsource.  Do we understand what the lower tax rates for corporations--what the net impact will be on jobs in America? All we hear is: Oh, we are going to create new job opportunities because we have lower rates for businesses. But we don't[[Page S8130]]tell the American people that they can keep those jobs overseas and pay a lower tax rate. Let's be honest about that.  Why didn't we have a hearing on that part? The consequences are far from understood.  I have heard several of my colleagues talk on the floor of the Senate about preserving credits, that we preserve this credit--like you are getting credit for leaving something in the Tax Let me say something. Credits are important. In the city of Baltimore, we have used low-income housing tax credits, historic tax credits, and new market tax credits to generate a lot of economic activity. It is very difficult to put together a major economic program within our urban centers. I could point to West Baltimore and how we have used all those tools for urban redevelopment. I could point to our arts district and how that has been used.  I know this. Credits are not going to be worth as much under this bill as they were before because we have changed the value of a tax credit. What impact is that going to have? I don't know. The problem is, none of us know, but it is going to have a consequence. It is going to affect economic growth, and it is not going to be positive. We haven't taken steps to try to counter that.  I noticed there were some changes in the renewable energy sector. I don't fully understand all the changes, but I do know those who are involved in wind and solar believe that what we have done will make it more difficult for them to get investors. It sort of looks as if, perhaps, this was an effort to help the fossil fuel industry.  When you look at the ANWR provision, which opens up the pristine areas of the Arctic to drilling in Alaska, you know that this bill is tilted toward fossil fuels rather than having a level playing field for America's energy. I worry, is this the first step to mid-Atlantic drilling off the Atlantic coast off of Maryland? I worry about the impact it could have on the Chesapeake  I must confide that I have been in conversations with some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, asking whether we will cooperate on a corrections bill. I find that amazing. We haven't passed this bill yet, and we are talking about the process to correct the mistakes that are clearly in this bill. That is not the way we should be legislating. We know that we are going to have to revisit the passthrough provisions because we know they are not drafted right. We know the tax credits are going to need additional time. We know the energy provisions are going to have to be revised. We know we have done damage to middle-income families who are going to demand we correct this. Why don't we get it right the first time? Why do we have to look at passing a bill that we know is badly flawed?  The last point I want to make is, there has been a commitment that when we take up a tax bill--don't we want to simplify the Tax Code, so Americans understand it better and feel more comfortable that everyone is being treated fairly? Secondly, the one argument I hear from all stakeholders is: Make the Tax Code predictable so that we can plan. Give us the rules. Don't change the law all the time. Don't put temporary provisions in there because Congress has a habit of missing extender dates. We have already missed extender dates in this Congress, and now we are talking about leaving town this week while we have provisions that have expired, such as the Children's Health Insurance  What does this tax bill do? It has numerous provisions that expire, some within a short period of time, adding uncertainty to our Tax Code and the planning of our Tax This bill is anything but simplifying the Tax Code, and it is certainly not providing predictability.  The American people get it. That is why they believe this bill should not be passed. It is an assault on middle-income families.

789,topic-id,808,"Mr.President, I wish to take this time to talk about two matters of human rights, which I know the Presiding Officer has been very much engaged with as an active member of the Senate Foreign Relations I want to share this information with our colleagues.  This month marks the fifth anniversary of the 2012 Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Today, with the publication of five new sanctions designations, the citizens of the Russian Federation--many of whom strive for a future governed by the rule of law--can claim a small victory over oppression. I hope that today's news provides a semblance of justice for the family of Sergei Magnitsky and those who continue to fight against corruption and human rights abuses across the country.  The Magnitsky list now includes 49 names--an important testament to the central importance that accountability and human rights should play in U.foreign policy.  I think the Members of this body are familiar with the circumstances surrounding Sergei Magnitsky's death. He was a young lawyer in Russia representing a company. He discovered corruption, and he did what any lawyer should do. He reported it to the authorities. As a result, he was arrested. He was tortured, denied medical care, and died in prison.  As a result of that, legislation was introduced. I was proud to sponsor it with my good friend Senator It was enacted into law, as I said, 5 years ago. It holds those who perpetrate these violations of human rights accountable by denying them the right to visit our country--visa applications--or to use our banking systems.  The five additions to this list include Andrei Pavlov, Yulia Mayorova, and Alexei Sheshenya for their roles in the Magnitsky case and Ramzan Kadyrov and Ayub Kataev for gross violations of human rights. I appreciate the work of career officials at the Treasury and State Departments for their work in investigating and designating these important cases.  Andrei Pavlov is a Russian lawyer who played a central role orchestrating the false claims used in the $230 million tax fraud that Sergei Magnitsky uncovered. His addition to the Magnitsky list is long overdue, as he played an essential role in the plot.  Yulia Mayorova is the former wife of Pavlov and a Russian lawyer. She also reportedly played a role in helping to facilitate the fraud uncovered by Sergei  Alexei Sheshenia also reportedly played key roles in both the 2006 theft of the $107 million in taxes paid by RenGaz and in the 2007 theft of the $230 million of taxes paid by I understand that in both tax thefts, shell companies beneficially owned by Alexei Sheshenia used forged backdated contracts to obtain judgments against companies that paid a significant amount of taxes.  Ramzan Kadyrov is a renowned human rights abuser who has brutally run the Republic of Chechnya for more than 10 years. Under his rule, human rights offenders have been murdered, and gay men have disappeared. He has destroyed any semblance of the rule of law in the Over the course of his time in power, there have been credible allegations of his directing assassinations deployed across Russia and Human rights groups have documented many cases of torture and extrajudicial killings by forces under his control.  Ayub Kataev is a prison warden and head of the branch of the Chechen internal affairs ministry. Earlier this year, Chechen authorities reportedly set up concentration camps for gay men under his control. He certainly belongs on this list.  Since 2012, Senator McCain and I have conducted rigorous oversight to ensure robust implementation of the Magnitsky law. In 2016, we wrote to the State Department with certain suggestions for inclusions on the list relevant to the death of Sergei We also expressed concerns that the allegations of torture in Chechnya against gay men and other human rights violations in the North Caucasus should be investigated. I am pleased they took action that was responsive to both of our inquiries.  I want my colleagues to know that I do believe this administration has conducted the review on the Magnitsky list the way it should have been--keeping in close contact with Members of the I think the result speaks to the quality of work that was done in this year's list.  America's values are our interests. As a country, we must remain steadfastly committed to the principles embedded in the Magnitsky law--accountability, the rule of law, and respect for human rights. The American people expect U.policymakers to advance these principles in all aspects of our diplomatic relations. I welcome today's announcement and also expect the first publication of the ``Global Magnitsky'' sanctions designations this week.  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, we have recently passed the ``Global Magnitsky'' law that applies similar standards for human rights violations globally. That list should be made available, we hope, sometime this week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8170.txt,,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS",2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1164,topic-id,1140,"Mr.President, a second subject that I wish to talk about today on human rights deals with the collapse in I come to the floor to speak about Venezuela's growing humanitarian tragedy and accelerating economic collapse.  Late last June, here on the Senate floor, I described Venezuela as a nearly failed State, where authoritarian leaders profit from links to corruption and drug trafficking, while the Venezuelan people are subject to precarious humanitarian conditions and human rights abuses. Disturbingly, the situation has only deteriorated since the time I was last on the floor talking about the circumstances.  With Venezuela's humanitarian crisis growing daily, conditions facing Venezuelan children are particularly dire. This week, the New York Times published a heartbreaking investigation of how Venezuelan children dying of hunger. It states:       Parents go days without eating, shriveling to the weight of      children themselves. Women line up at sterilization clinics      to avoid having children they cannot feed. Boys leave home to      join street gangs that scavenge for scraps. . . . Crowds of      adults storm dumpsters after restaurants close. Babies die      because it is hard to find or afford infant formula, even in      emergency rooms.  That is in our hemisphere in  The Catholic relief organization Caritas has determined that over 50 percent of the children are suffering from nutritional deficiencies. They project that 280,000 Venezuelan children could eventually die of hunger without an urgently needed humanitarian response.  As the Venezuelans increasingly suffer the ravages of hunger, the country's hospital system is collapsing. Essential medicines are in short supply, and more than half of the Nation's operating facilities no longer function or have sufficient supplies. Disturbingly, international relief organizations have found that over 60 percent of the Venezuelan hospitals don't even have potable water.  Amid these crisis conditions, Venezuelan President Maduro repeatedly denies the existence of this country's humanitarian crisis. He has even taken to the unprecedented step of setting up a party-controlled food distribution system referred to as CLAPS, and his government now uses food as a tool of political patronage.  The result is that the United States and our partners in the hemisphere now confront the situation where the Maduro regime would rather see its people go hungry than accept the foreign assistance the Venezuelans desperately need. This man-made tragedy is absolutely unacceptable.[[Page S8171]]  Today I have written to Ambassador Nikki Haley, our Ambassador to the United Nations, to urge her to call an emergency special session of the U.Security Council to evaluate which United Nations mechanisms, including U.Security Council resolutions, should be pursued to alleviate the humanitarian suffering inside  As humanitarian concerns mount, human rights abuses of Venezuela are rampant. Last month, the U.High Commissioner for Human Rights told the U.Security Council that this year Venezuelan security forces ``systematically resorted to the arbitrary detention of more than 5,000 protestors.''  A more recent report by Human Rights Watch and Foro Penal, a Venezuelan nongovernmental organization, documents how Venezuelan security forces have subjected political opponents to ``torture involving electric shock and asphyxiation.''  In response, Luis Almagro, the Secretary General of the OAS, has convened a series of hearings to receive testimony to ascertain whether members of the Venezuelan Government have committed crimes against humanity that should be referred to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. These efforts deserve our attention and our support.  Against this alarming backdrop, we require no explanation for why the United States has received more asylum requests from Venezuela than from any other nationality for 2 years straight.  These challenges will only grow as Venezuela's economy continues to collapse. The country is in a selective default on its bonds. Hyperinflation and rapid currency devaluation are ravaging family incomes. This week, the country's parallel exchange rate reached 12,000 times the official rate, meaning that the average Venezuelan now earns less than $10 a month.  The reasons for this collapse are simple. Venezuela's economy is plagued by endemic corruption and gross mismanagement. As this calamity grows, Senators need to be aware that Venezuela will eventually need a major IMF program that may well surpass the $17 billion intervention that Ukraine required in 2014. The international community will have to respond, which will also include, of course, the United  We also need to recognize that Russia and China are now major stakeholders in Venezuela, in our hemisphere, and will be at the table as the international community copes with the pending collapse.  Russia, in particular, is playing geopolitics with the situation--refinancing Venezuela's debt, offering loans in return for financial stakes in U.S.-based CITGO, securing stakes in Venezuela's oil industry, and expanding its influence in our hemisphere.  In response to these growing challenges, the Trump administration has applied greater pressure by imposing targeted sanctions against a number of individuals, including President With this designation, President Maduro has joined the list of notorious heads of state on U.sanction list, including the likes of North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Zimbabwe's former President Robert Mugabe, and Panama's former President Manuel  President Trump has also imposed financial sanctions blocking the issuance of new bonds to fund the Maduro regime's ongoing repressive and economic mismanagement. The bond market has been one of the last lifelines for the Maduro government. Investors are right to lose trust in Venezuela's ability to pay its debt.  We must recognize, however, that sanctions alone will not resolve the challenges the people of Venezuela are facing. We need a comprehensive strategy that utilizes all elements of U.diplomacy. We must provide critical foreign assistance to help mitigate the humanitarian crisis and bolster essential support for human rights and democratic civil society.  In May I introduced 1018, a bipartisan bill that lays out a comprehensive strategy for U.policy. My bill includes humanitarian assistance and funding to protect and promote human rights and democracy. It also includes a more aggressive approach to tackling the endemic corruption.  Earlier this month, the House of Representatives approved its version of this bill. It is time for the Senate to act. While I see an opportunity for bipartisanship in the Senate on U.policy toward Venezuela, I must say that I was alarmed by President Trump's statement in August about a potential military option. Such cavalier comments are not helpful and, once again, call into question whether he has the temperament and judgment for dealing with serious national security challenges.  We must rise to the challenge of Venezuela as a great nation, bringing our full diplomatic resources and skills to bear and avoiding stooping to mere saber rattling.  I urge our colleagues to take on this challenge, to help the people of Venezuela, who are suffering from this humanitarian crisis, and to allow America's entire toolkit to be used to help resolve this problem in our hemisphere.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

550,topic-id,2825,"Mr.President, it is a pleasure to be on the floor tonight with my friend the Senator from The Navy salutes the Marine Corps and salutes him for his service before.  Now I just want to follow up on a couple of things that he mentioned. He need not stay on the floor if he doesn't want to, but he is more than welcome to as he spent a little bit of time criticizing the individual mandate.  Harry Truman used to say that the only thing new in the world is the history that we forgot and never learned. So I just want to take a minute and talk about the history of the individual mandate.  The individual mandate was not invented by Barack ObamaCare was never invented by Barack Obama--the idea for exchanges in all 50 States and the sliding scale tax credit to buy down the cost of healthcare in those exchanges. The idea to have an individual mandate so that everybody has to buy healthcare and that if you are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare, you need to get healthcare and that, if you don't, there is a fine was not Barack Obama's idea. The idea that employers of a certain size and with a certain number of employees have to provide healthcare coverage for their folks was not a Barack Obama idea. The notion that the insurance companies could not deny coverage to folks who had preexisting conditions was not an idea that was invented by Barack  ObamaCare with those five provisions--exchanges in every State, a sliding scale tax credit to buy down the cost of the care, the individual mandate to make sure that everybody is getting coverage, the employer mandate by which the employer has to cover the employees, the prohibition against insurance companies in their not providing coverage for those with preexisting conditions--had its origin from right here in the U.Senate in 1993--right here in 1993.  The legislation was introduced by a Republican Senator from Rhode Island, It was cosponsored by 22 other Republican Senators, including the chairman of the Finance Committee--one of the people I most admire here in this body.  Those five ideas didn't go anywhere in 1993, but do you know who took them? A Governor of Massachusetts took those five ideas and said: Maybe we could use those five ideas to cover everybody in the State of Governor Mitt Romney created Do you know what? For the most part, it worked. It covered just about everybody there. Initially, it had problems with affordability, but it has done better over time.  When we worked on the Affordable Care Act, we took that Republican Senate proposal from 1993. We took RomneyCare from 2006, and we included it in the Affordable Care Act because it was a market-based approach to making sure that everybody who didn't get coverage from their employers and who were not eligible for Medicaid and were not eligible for Medicare could get coverage.  We see in this legislation before us tonight not just changes to the Tax Code but also a further effort to destabilize the exchanges, which is something that the current administration spends a lot of time trying to do. It is a Republican idea. It is a market-based approach. They happen to be good ideas. They happen to work in Massachusetts, and they could work in the 49 other States if we didn't have an administration and my colleagues here in this body and in the House who were trying to destabilize the exchanges.  I hope that when this legislation passes and we repeal the individual mandate that we will not just repeal it. Why do we have it in the first place? It is to make sure that young, healthy Americans are going to be getting coverage in the exchanges. You can't just have sick and elderly people in the exchanges. You have to have some young, healthy people in there too. That is why we have the individual mandate. If we are going to get rid of it, we need to replace it with something that works at least as effectively. That is one of the things that we need to work on in our going forward between now and 2019 when the individual mandate is repealed under this legislation.  I had the privilege of serving as the Governor of my State of Delaware for 8 years. During those 8 years, we cut taxes in 7 out of the 8 years. We also balanced our budgets for 8 years in a row. We paid down some of our debt. We earned AAA credit ratings for the first time in the State's history. We still have them. For those 8 years, we had a general assembly whose majority was Republican in the House and whose majority was Democrat in the Do you know what we did? We actually worked together. We worked together in that we used sound budgeting practices, and we used sound economic analyses and forecasts. We worked together, but neither side got everything it wanted.  In Delaware, we have something that we call the Delaware I describe it with the letter C--four Cs--communicate, compromise, collaborate, civility. That is it. That is the Delaware Way--communicate, compromise, collaborate, and use some civility. We don't do much of that around here, and we are the worse for it.  During those years that I was privileged to be Governor and we cut taxes for 7 out of the 8 years, I would read each tax proposal with four questions. One, is it fair? Two, does it foster economic growth or impede it? Three, does it simplify the Tax Code or make it more complex? Four, what does it do to the deficit? Do we end up with a deficit? Do we end up with a balanced budget? Do we end up with a surplus? I asked those four questions.  Twenty years later, as we took up tax reform here in the U.Senate, I asked the same four questions. Is it fair? Does it foster economic growth? Does it simplify the Tax Code? What does it do to the budget or to the deficit situation that we face? Those are the four questions.  Others have already talked about fairness. Let me just say that when you look at what is going to happen in the first couple years after the passage of this legislation, lower income folks, families, are going to get a tax cut too. It is not just the wealthy; low-income families will get a tax cut, too, for a couple of years. Families making $30,000 will benefit. They will end up lowering taxes for the first 2 years after the implementation of this legislation. After 3 or 4 years, families making $40,000 or less will be on the losing side. After 5 years, families making $50,000 will be on the losing side. After 8 or 9 years, families making as much as $75,000 will not be paying less taxes, they will actually be paying more taxes.  Meanwhile, folks whose income is half a million, $1 million, or more, for the most part will realize very substantial reductions in their taxes--very substantial reductions--and as that income goes up, the greater those reductions will be in their tax obligation. Some people ask: Is that fair? It depends on whom you ask. If you happen to ask people who are making $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 a year, maybe not. It is fair for a while but not for long enough.  I mentioned the 8 years I served as Governor of our State and how we balanced our budget to pay down debt and got an AAA credit rating. More jobs were created in those 8 years than any 8 years in the history of the State of I did not create any of them. I did not create one of them. I helped create a nurturing environment for job creation in our State so that little businesses could get started and grow into bigger businesses and bigger businesses could make a profit and hire more people. The Tax Code is an important ingredient in nurturing an environment for job creation and job preservation--not the only ingredient but an important ingredient.  Senator Cardin stood right in front of me a little while ago and talked about how important it is to have certainty and predictability. That is almost as important as the tax rates, to actually know what we are going to face and not face, the uncertainty of rates going up or down and the rules changing in the years to come. But I would like to run through a short list of other ingredients needed in the nurturing environment that I don't believe we are addressing in these changes to the Tax  One is commonsense regulations, regulations that protect us, protect our[[Page S8133]]health, our environment, and do so in a way that is cost-effective.  Another way to create a nurturing environment is to make sure that we are producing, out of our high schools, colleges, universities, and community colleges, people who can read, write, think, use math and have technology skills in science and engineering. The inability to come out of these schools and go to work in the millions of jobs that are going unfilled these days is because the skill sets that are demanded by employers for these millions of jobs are not met by the people who are looking for work, for the most part, except for about 800,000 people--the DACA folks who fill 800,000 of those 3 or 4 million jobs that are unfilled.  What is another ingredient? Access to capital, the ability of a business to get money, to raise money to be able to invest in plant and equipment and in employees in the workforce.  Another is access to foreign markets to be able to sell the products or the services we provide to other countries around the world, get into those markets.  Another is energy costs. My colleague from Alaska said in his comments that one of the things we ought to be in America is the superpower of energy. Who invented nuclear energy? We did. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. We create, as far as I know, as much electricity from wind and solar as I think any nation on Earth, and we need to do a whole lot more, and we can.  With regard to healthcare costs, we pay way too much money for healthcare in this country. Actually, we have a pretty good idea of how to bring it down. One of those good ideas is the exchanges, and if we stop undermining them and degrading them and destabilizing them, they would actually work like they do in Massachusetts and a bunch of other  Public safety is a key ingredient among the forces and factors that are helpful in creating that nurturing environment.  Investing in research and development that could be commercialized in terms of jobs and economic opportunity is hugely important.  There is also protecting intellectual property, protecting against cyber attacks, transportation, infrastructure. Earlier this year, the Nation's Society of Civil Engineers evaluated our transportation infrastructure in this country, and again this year, D--``d'' as in dog--because our roads, highways, and bridges are in deplorable shape in many parts of this country. Did we invest any money in that in this tax bill? If I had $1 trillion to invest in this country to strengthen our economy, I would put it in infrastructure, roads, highways, bridges, ports, airports, broadband, just deploying broadband in vast areas of the country and rural areas of the country where we don't have access to the internet. That is what I would do. We don't do any of that in this legislation.  In terms of economic growth and job creation, what we are told by most economists is, sadly, a lot of companies will make extra money from--realize greater profits from the changes in the Tax Code, the majority of them. According not to me but to economists who are a lot smarter than I, a good deal of that money is not going to further investments in plant and equipment, not into their workforce, it will be turned into dividends and stock buybacks and not to create the kind of economic growth we all want.  Let me talk a minute about the third question I always ask about tax reform proposals; that is, does it simplify the Tax Code or make it more complex?  During our markup, our vote, and debate in the Finance Committee on the proposals, one of my colleagues--I think it was Senator McCaskill--had a stack about this tall of the Federal Tax One of our expert witnesses from the Joint Tax Committee was asked: Will this legislation that is before us tonight actually make that stack of books that make up the Tax Code--is it going to make it smaller?  He said: No, quite the opposite--it is going to make it larger. Now, the idea of doubling the standard deduction, enabling more people to not have to itemize their taxes--that makes the Tax Code simpler. That is a good idea. But overall, when you look at all the other changes in this legislation, that stack which represents the Tax Code is not going to go down; ultimately it is going to go up.  Those are not my words but the testimony from the Joint Tax  Lastly, what is going to be the effect of these tax changes? What is going to be the effect on the budget deficit? And here is where I think we really missed the boat. When Bill Clinton became President in 1993, we were in a deficit. We were in a recession, and he became Eight years later, when he turned the reins over to George Bush--in those 8 years, more jobs were created than in any 8-year period in the history of the United On top of that, in the last 4 years of that administration--1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001--we had a balanced budget and a surplus. When the reins of leadership were turned over to the next administration, George Bush's, I think CBO was forecasting a budget surplus of at least $5 billion, probably more. There was a concern that we were actually growing the surplus too fast.  Well, it didn't take too long for the surpluses to be eliminated, and when that administration came to an end, we were in the worst economic recession since the Great We called it the great recession. We went from 4 years of surpluses to the worst economy since 1930. That is what Barack Obama and Joe Biden and a new Congress in 2009 inherited.  I know some of my colleagues think that there has not been any kind of economic recovery. Just look at where we were in 2008 and 2009. For the last 8 years, we have had economic growth and job creation for 8 consecutive years. I don't think we have ever seen that kind of sustained economic growth in the history of our country.  Instead of paying down debt after 8 years of economic growth and job creation, we actually, last year, increased the deficit by $666 billion. With this legislation, we are going to add another roughly $2 trillion to our debt over the next 10 years.  This is a missed opportunity, folks. It doesn't have to be this way. There are good ideas in this legislation. The corporate tax rate is too high. Let's bring it down. I am for that. The standard deduction ought to be doubled. I think Democrats are for that. The child tax credit ought to be increased, maybe doubled, made refundable to help lower income families too. I am for that. The capital gains rate maintained where it is--I am for that. The repatriation of overseas profits--I am for that. There are a lot of things I think could actually serve as a foundation on which we could come to an agreement on bipartisan legislation. As far as I am concerned, we never really had a fair chance.  I will close with an African proverb. My friend Senator Scott is about to follow me, and he has heard me say this before. The old African proverb says: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together.  If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want to go far, travel together. We should have traveled this road together. If we had, we would have maybe some short-term pain but long-term gain. But I fear that with this legislation, it will be just the opposite. There will be some short-term gain but I figure, in the long run, long-term pain.  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor and will pass it on to my friend from South  ",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8088-2.txt,179,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS",2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
540,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I wish to commend the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for his hopes for more bipartisanship and his concern about the way the Senate is working today. I appreciate that. I think we all hope that in the new year there will be more bipartisanship. I think there are some areas where we can work together.  On this issue, though, I think we have some basic disagreements, and we are still debating those and articulating our differences before we cast a vote tonight. I have said for a number of weeks now--not months but certainly weeks--when describing the bill that is before us, the prior iteration of the bill in the Finance Committee and the version in the House, that I thought that each one of them had a few things in common, in my judgment. This is my sense of the overall bill.  First of all, I think every one of these bills has been a giveaway to the rich or the superrich and a giveaway to profitable corporations. I think it is excessive. We have a difference of opinion on that.  This is a tax bill, and yet it will have a substantially adverse impact on health care because of one basic provision that was added in the last couple of weeks. That provision alone will cause healthcare premiums to increase by an additional 10 percent a year, and it will cause 13 million people to lose their healthcare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including, by one estimate, 5 million fewer Americans benefitting from At a time when we should invest substantially in the middle class and invest in our children, roads, bridges, schools, scientific research, skills training, and broadband in rural communities--we can make the list even longer--this tax bill prevents that from happening in a significant way because of the giveaways that I talked about to profitable corporations and the superrich.  This bill will literally pay for a permanent corporate tax cut on the backs of middle-class families in the next decade. Congress's official scorekeeper, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, tells us that in the next decade, meaning the second 10 years that this bill is in effect, the bill uses hundreds of billions in tax increases on working families to pay for a permanent corporate rate cut. I will say that again. In the next decade, taxes go up for you across America, working families, to pay for a 14-percentage-point cut for profitable corporations.  This kind of result, where we have a corporate tax break which increases debt and someone else has to pay for it down the road, is a result that only a swamp dweller could support, but unfortunately that is where we are today.  How about for children? There has been a lot of discussion about the child tax credit. Thankfully, there was debate about that. We don't talk about children in this body nearly enough or that tax credit, but, unfortunately, even the proposals by some on the Republican side weren't adequate enough. Even the ones rejected may not have been enough. Under this legislation parents of 10 million children in the lowest income working families will either receive no improvement in the child tax credit or a token increase of $1 to $75. The last minute changes to the bill, which got a lot of publicity in the last couple of days--those last-minute changes to the bill--will do nothing additional for these families.  Another 14 million children in low- and middle-income working families would get something by way of the child tax credit but less than the full $1,000 per child increase that a family making $400,000 a year would receive. For a fraction of the hundreds of billions of dollars going to the very wealthy and profitable corporations, we could have, in this bill, made sure that every low-income parent gets the full $2,000 per child tax credit, but because of the way the bill is written, it doesn't allow that to happen for every low-income parent. I think that would have been a worthy goal of the legislation, but that is not where we are. To say that is unfair is a vast overstatement. The families who need it the most aren't getting the full benefit of the child tax credit increase, but those who are wealthy get an extra $2,000 of child tax credit.  I mentioned the Joint Committee on Let me give you another way to look at the bill according to the Joint Committee on The JCT estimates that in 2019 alone, the second year the bill is in effect, were it to pass, more than $36 billion in tax cuts will go to households worth more than $1 million. That is in the document entitled JCX-68-17 of the Joint Committee on It is a $36 billion cut for the wealthiest Americans, while over 57 million middle-class households--my definition for those making under $100,000--will see a tax increase or tax cut of less than $9 a month in 2019. So for 57 million middle-class households, they will see a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $9 a month in 2019.  Instead of lining the pockets of the rich with $36 billion in tax cuts in 2019, that money could have been used to connect Americans to the internet, especially Americans who live in rural areas. Let me be precise: 39 percent of the people living in rural America don't have high-speed internet.

543,topic-id,1568,"I want people to make sure that people know the document. This is the document, JCX-68-17. If you look at the category of Americans who are making $100,000 or less--that is 57 million households who make under $100,000--they would see either a tax increase of one kind or another or a tax cut of less than $9 a month in 2019.  I don't think that is much help when we consider that it is not as if that is the only revenue available--that all we can come up with is $9 a month--because I just walked through the other number which is relevant--the $36 billion that will come in 2019, the second year that the bill is in effect, going to households worth more than $1 million.  If I had to choose, I would say that we should give all of that $36 billion to middle-income families or folks trying to get to the middle class or at least a substantial percentage of the $36 billion. I have been asking for months: Why do people making more than $1 million, that category of Americans, need $36 billion in tax cuts? I don't think they do.  It is interesting--I want to commend the work of the ranking member of the Finance In some of our debates, one of the numbers that came out in the last couple of weeks was what has happened to the top 1 percent since 1980. I said several times that they have had a bonanza. I didn't have an exact number when I said that; now I do. Since 1980, the share of national income for these folks in the top 1 percent, which is less than $1 million a year, but it is about $730,000 and up, so that is--the 1 percent goes beyond the millionaires and up. But since 1980, the top 1 percent have had their share of national income go up from 11 percent to 20 percent, from 1980 to 2014, so it has almost doubled. So my point is, they have done pretty well since 1980, so why do a big share of them--meaning the million-dollar-and-up crowd--why should they get $36 billion in this tax bill? It doesn't make a lot of sense.  So that is one way to look at it. What we could invest these dollars in--a bigger tax cut for the middle, a bigger tax cut for those struggling to get to the middle, working families trying to get to the middle, or other priorities, such as infrastructure. I mentioned just one idea on rural broadband. I think rural America should get some help being connected to the internet. That is one way we could focus on priorities.  Let me give another example--the estate tax. As many people know, once fully implemented, this bill doubles the estate tax--it exempts the first $22 million of inheritance from the tax, which is $11 million per individual. The cost of doing that will be roughly $9 billion a year. In the earlier versions of the House and Senate bills, that number was a lot higher. There was a lot higher revenue loss from the elimination of the estate tax, but even with the changes, there is still a revenue loss of an estimated $9 billion a year.  Well, what could we do with $9 billion? Well, in the midst of this debate about the Children's Health Insurance Program, just for 5 years of the Children's Health Insurance Program, that is roughly the number that we need. So 1 year of revenue losses from the estate tax equals 5 years, roughly, of paying for the Children's Health Insurance And that is not done yet. The Children's Health Insurance Program expired September 30, and I hope that in the midst of all of this work on tax policy, we are going to get that done. I know that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, for years, from the beginning, has been a strong advocate of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and I commend him for that, but we have to get it reauthorized in a few short days.  I wanted to talk as well--I know I probably am limited on time, and I will move quickly--on the Republican budget because you can't really read the tax changes in isolation; you have to also consider them in the context of the Republican budget resolution that passed. That budget proposal, which did pass, proposes to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion over the next 10 years. So that is $1 trillion with a ``t'' for The Republican budget also proposes to cut Medicare by over $400 billion over the same period, over 10 years. So the proposal roughly proposes to cut about $1.5 trillion from just Medicare and All the while, this Republican tax bill contains almost the same amount of unpaid-for tax cuts.  We heard recently from Speaker Ryan that he wants to ``reform'' Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Well, my view of that is, when they talk about reform in that context, that means cutting--cutting funding for programs that working men and women of my home State of Pennsylvania and the country have paid into to ensure that they have some retirement savings and a safety net for when tragedies and unforeseen events occur. Some people refer to Social Security and Medicare as earned benefits because they are. They have earned those benefits for Social Security and  How about outsourcing? The Republican tax bill gives U.companies that offshore jobs a large tax cut on old profits that is unavailable to companies that kept jobs and production in the United This means that a company that outsourced to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labor will pay less taxes on accumulated profits than a domestic company that kept jobs in the United In fact, once the bill is enacted, some profits from an overseas factory may never be taxed in the United States, while a company that keeps those jobs here could be taxed at the U.corporate tax rate. This disparity could actually encourage companies to move production and jobs overseas.  We mentioned earlier the tax cut for major corporations. One of the great leaders of corporate America for many, many years, Jack Bogle of Vanguard, said the following a few weeks ago. I don't know what political party Jack Bogle is in, but he said this most recently about corporate profits:       Corporate profits after taxes last year were the highest      they've ever been in the history of GDP going back to 1929.      And we are thinking of giving relief to the corporations at      the highest levels ever. Individual wages are at the lowest      level in about 15 years as a percent of  Those are not my words; those are Jack Bogle's words.  So corporations will have a tax windfall to spend on increasing executive compensation if they want or increasing stock buybacks or increasing dividends. All this is with absolutely no guarantees that workers will see benefits from this tax cut, despite assertions by many here in Washington about what would happen on wages and other benefits.  Mr.President, I have maybe 3 more minutes. I know we are maybe a little over time.  There has been a little bit of discussion--not enough--about what happens to the Consumer Price Index, which is used as a baseline for measuring programs over time. Maybe the most pernicious tax--and that is the best word for it--in the bill is the so-called Chained CPI, which alters the way inflation is measured. This bill raises an estimated $134 billion on the backs of hard-working Americans by changing how the Tax Code measures inflation--so-called Chained So it is the measurement of inflation that is going to change, and that is going to have an adverse consequence for untold millions of This number grows over time. The Joint Committee on[[Page S8123]]Taxation told us that this single provision increases taxes by at least three times as much in the next decade as it did in the first decade--potentially as high as $400 billion in the second 10 years. This will be in full force when a lot of young people are entering the workforce. Someone who is just starting their professional life will see this tax increase haunt their paychecks for the next 50 years.  There is a lot we could talk about in terms of missed opportunities here, but let me conclude with this: There is nothing in this bill that invests in rebuilding I thought we would have an opportunity to do that, as we seemed to be headed that way a couple of years ago, but we don't have that opportunity with this bill. We could be using this opportunity to make a substantial investment in roads, bridges, schools, water systems, or the like, but that won't happen. In our State, we have 4,500 structurally deficient bridges, and we wish that we would get some more help in addition to State dollars going for those.  There is nothing in the bill to expand college affordability and nothing to ensure that workers' wages increase. Amendments like that were offered in the committee. It was all Democrats for the amendment and all Republicans against it.  Those in the middle class and those working to join the middle class continue to tread water in this bill, while the superrich zoom ahead.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

665,topic-id,575,"Mr.President, today I wish to commend Robert Mueller's career as a public servant and to condemn partisan, political attacks on Mr.Mueller's reputation and American democratic systems.  A brief glance at Mr.Mueller's biography reflects his consistent commitment to serve the American people with honor and courage. As a young man, Mr.Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam war. His list of commendations and military decorations, including a Bronze Star, two Navy Commendation Medals, the Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, are emblematic of his leadership and exemplary service.  Mr.Mueller not only fought courageously on the battlefield, but upon returning home and earning his law degree, he continued serving his country throughout his legal career. He cut his teeth working in U.attorney's offices in Boston and San Francisco for over a decade, and when he later served at the Department of Justice, Mr.Mueller was nominated by President George Bush to lead the criminal division, where he oversaw cases as diverse as the prosecution of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and the Lockerbie bombing.  In 1995, Mr.Mueller's dedication to public service led him to leave a high-paying position at a private firm to join the DC U.attorney's office homicide division to hold violent offenders accountable for their crimes. Three years later, he became a U.attorney himself, serving in San Francisco and earning himself a reputation as a dogged and fair prosecutor committed to enforcing the rule of law.  In 2001, Mr.Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President, George Bush, as the Director of the FBI, a position to which he was confirmed unanimously by this body. Whether navigating our response to the atrocities of 9/11, leading the Bureau's reform in its aftermath, or trailblazing the Bureau's role in combating cyber crimes, his tenure has been widely lauded. In fact, in 2011, as his 10-year term was set to end, we in the Senate voted 100 to 0 to extend his term until 2013.  In an era of increasing political and cultural tribalism, each time Mr.Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has received bipartisan and unabashed praise--and rightly so.  Mr.Mueller, as an expert in law enforcement, could not be better suited for the task at hand: an investigation into Russia's interference in the U.elections. That Russia interfered in our elections is neither conjecture nor an attempt to rewrite the political outcomes of 2016. It is a fact that was true for the U.and many European allies in the last year and will remain a serious risk to the validity of our future elections if we do not take action. Mr.Mueller's investigation will serve as a necessary step to secure the ability of Americans to cast their vote in confidence for those who will represent them in Nothing could be more sacred or more  Serious, prudent, and thorough congressional oversight is always appropriate. Reckless, partisan attacks on the integrity of an honest public servant are not the same as congressional oversight. Attacks like these embolden our enemies, animate opponents of democracy, and inspire terrorists. These attacks are nothing short of unpatriotic.  I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for the integrity of the process that Mr.Mueller is leading. Skepticism of the outcomes of his investigation triggered by dishonest smears on Mr.Mueller's reputation by Washington politicians would have lasting results and would compromise the ability of law enforcement to protect U.from our enemies, foreign and domestic.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8249.txt,1828,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS",2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

856,topic-id,598,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about ``A Beautiful Here,'' a memoir by Linda Phillips that chronicles her struggle to overcome the extraordinary grief of losing her son, Nuci, to suicide following his long battle with depression.  Linda writes about an empathetic, caring, and happy child who grows increasingly distressed through adolescence. Nuci retreated from their close-knit family and, despite their efforts to support him through several periods of crisis and treatments, he succumbed to his disease.  Though the family was distraught and heartbroken by Nuci's death, Linda Phillips was also appalled at the lack of supports for individuals struggling with suicide and for families who have lost loved ones to depression.  At multiple points, Nuci failed to receive services or the compassionate support he needed. Indeed, after calling a crisis hotline while in college, Nuci was taken into custody by police and placed in handcuffs. Ultimately, the incident resulted in his expulsion. On another occasion, he was told to wait over a month for services when seeking support for his depression while in school.  Linda also saw other families pull their children from much-needed treatment programs because they could not afford the costly care. She saw firsthand that survivors of suicide are often relegated to the shadows, met by uncomfortable silence, or blamed for their loved ones' deaths.  Linda's personal account sheds light on this tragic and pervasive problem. Though Nuci Phillips took his own life 20 years ago, his story, sadly, remains just as relevant today.  The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports that nearly 36,000 American's die by suicide each year; that is one American every 15 minutes. According to the Center for Disease Control, CDC, suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people between the ages of 10 and 24 and results in approximately 4,600 lives lost each year.  In recent years, a shocking number of young people have attempted or ended their life through suicide as a result of bullying. Though not all instances of bullying lead to suicide, bully victims are between two to nine times more likely to consider suicide than nonvictims, according to studies by Yale  Nearly one in four students aged 12 to 18 are affected by bullying and harassment, according to recent data from the Department of Another Department study estimates that 60,000 students in the U.do not attend school each day because they fear being bullied. Bullying and harassment are a significant problem in our schools.  These are issues that we can begin to address today by confronting bullying in our schools through strong antibullying policies. In far too many communities, whether in Pennsylvania or across the Nation, we are forced to deal with tragic consequences of bullying or harassment when these policies or organizations do not exist. Other resources include school counselors and crisis hotlines.  My bill, the Safe Schools Improvement Act, may not prevent all incidences of bullying, but it is an important step in the direction of tackling this problem and holding school districts accountable.  Depression and suicide, whether brought on by bullying or not, is a serious disease with potentially deadly results. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined.[[Page S8250]]  We must fight against this destructive illness by ensuring all children and young adults have access to affordable and effective mental health treatment and services, such as counseling, medication, and crisis intervention. I would like to thank Linda Phillips for sharing her story and helping to shine a light on this pervasive disease.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8249-2.txt,1828,1015,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
896,topic-id,1264,"Madam President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program and, particularly, the reauthorization of that program. By reauthorization I mean taking action to continue a program that is not just worthy but battle-tested now for almost a quarter of a century nationally, at least 20 years. In States like Pennsylvania, it is more than 20 years, more like 25.  The unfortunate reality, though, is this isn't done. This program should have been reauthorized at the end of September, and it is not done yet. It has gone from unacceptable to inexcusable. We should not leave this week without either having it reauthorized or having a game plan that would guarantee it will be reauthorized in the very early days of 2018, literally, the early days of  In just the last 2 weeks, I met with families across Pennsylvania and even families that came from beyond Pennsylvania here to Washington to talk about what the Children's Health Insurance Program means to them.  CHIP provides health insurance to some 9 million American children each year, including over 342,000 children in Pennsylvania, if you look at it over the course of the year. As you might recall, when the CHIP program expired on September 30, there were a lot of indications or promises made that it would be reauthorized rather soon, but that was 81 days ago. Whether you want to express it in days or months--81 days or 2\1/2\ months or more now--that is inexcusable. We have to get this done for these families.  I just saw a report this morning on ``NBC News'' that profiled a family. They were talking in this case to the mom and talking to her children, and it was a very moving story about the importance of the Children's Health Insurance Program and what would happen to that family if the program were not reauthorized.  This is a bipartisan program. It was bipartisan in its inception in the mid-1990s, and it has remained bipartisan. Now there is only one party that runs the House, the Senate, and the administration, and I hope that this one party--in this case, the Republican Party--can get the votes. You don't even have to talk about votes. It is really talking about floor time and really making sure there is an agreement on a pay-for.  The most recent action by the Finance Committee on CHIP was in the Keep Kids' Insurance Dependable and Secure Act, known by the acronym The KIDS Act came through the Finance Committee by a voice vote. That almost never happens, even on reauthorization. There was a voice vote on October 4. It seems like a long time ago now. It is ready to go. If it came onto the Senate floor, we can pass it here. I have to ask: Why isn't that happening?  Maybe the better person to ask that question would be a family who is benefiting and who could be harmed if it is not reauthorized. I am thinking about Connie, a woman I met here in Washington just last week. Then, I saw her again on Monday in Pittsburgh at Children's Hospital of That is one of those great institutions for children across our country. She was there with two of her children. Carmen and Diego are both on the CHIP program. CHIP provides good health insurance so that they can get the healthcare they need.  I had a picture with Connie's daughter Carmen here in She dutifully handed me a copy of the picture when I saw her just a few days later in Pittsburgh at Children's  Both Carmen and Diego might lose their health insurance because there is a lot of activity here and focus and a result when it comes to a big tax bill. In this case, it is a tax bill that gives permanent corporate tax cuts to multinational, profitable corporations. At the same time, there is almost no action or any sense of momentum right now to get the Children's Health Insurance Program in place again, or reauthorized, as we call it.  We had an event here in Washington yesterday where not only were there child advocates but so many others coming together to talk about this program. Maybe the most important thing we did yesterday, in addition to the mechanics, was to talk about the children in the room. Here are the children and the States they came from. I will just read through them quickly: Jason and Kelsey from Utah; Deanna came from New York; Malachi came from Colorado; Addie and Cailin from Kentucky; Patience, Serenity, Tyler, and Harmonie, all from the State of Texas; Jeridan, Kendra, and Makayla from the State of Wisconsin; and, finally, another Michaela--spelled a different way--and Grace came from the State of West They and their parents--these children and their parents--spoke about what CHIP means to their families. Several of the parents said CHIP means their children can get the prescription eyeglasses they need.  I have to ask: How is a child supposed to learn and succeed in school without eyeglasses? CHIP provides that.  So while these kids don't know if they are going to be able to get the glasses they need to be able to read and to learn, the Senate is busy passing a tax bill. It is OK to pass a tax bill, even if I didn't agree with it, but we should find the time in the remaining hours of this year to get CHIP done.  I saw a tweet just 2 days ago that said the following: ``Congress must renew funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program so the parents of the nine million children who are covered by CHIP can know their children's healthcare is secure.''  The good news about that tweet is, it was a Member of The even better news is, it was a Better news even than that, the Senator happened to be the Senate majority leader, Senator  I ask Senator McConnell, please allow floor time and please obtain the consensus you need in your own party to get this on to the floor and get it passed.  As I said, the KIDS Act, the Finance Committee bill, is ready to go. I ask for the majority leader's help because I know he cares about this program as well. We have to get this done.  Just a final note before I yield the floor. I wanted to note several other healthcare priorities that Congress must address.  Community health centers are facing a funding cliff that will hurt millions of people around the country, and over 800,000 in Pennsylvania whom they serve, and other priority community health centers. Medicare extenders--meaning tax provisions that are extended from one year to the next or from one year into the future--including support for rural hospitals and lifting the so-called therapy cap to ensure seniors and people with disabilities have access to physical and occupational therapy services have also expired, just like the CHIP program, or will expire at the end of this calendar year. Failing to address these extensions is also unacceptable and will harm our children, our seniors, and our communities.  So we have a lot of work to do in a short amount of time on all of these healthcare issues. I think we should start with voting on and reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program for 9 million American children.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1080,topic-id,485,"Mr.President, I rise this morning to outline some ideas about our national security as we approach the end of the year.  Many Americans are heading into the holiday season with some very reasonable fears about the threats facing our In 2017, we saw an emboldened North Korean regime testing missiles and nuclear weapons. Terrorist groups continue to execute attacks across the globe. Violent state and nonstate actors continue to destabilize Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Yemen, Nigeria, and others. We saw Russia continue meddling in elections, just as they did in ours last year.  This is a year of great volatility and uncertainty. However, we also saw the U.military leading an international coalition that is loosening the stranglehold ISIS had on parts of Iraq and We saw the recovery of American hostages, including constituents of mine, held captive for years by terrorists. In Europe, U.and NATO forces partnered to counter Russian aggression and dispel propaganda. U.development assistance projects helped hundreds of millions of people across the world, including 11 million farmers and 27\1/2\ million children under the Feed the Future  Even when it seemed like there were many reasons to be afraid, the U.military, diplomats, and development professionals were responsible for a lot of good progress this year.  On Monday of this week, President Trump laid out his administration's national security strategy. I commend the work of the national security professionals who crafted the document which warrants a thorough review. It is a substantial body of work, but it paints a very dark picture of the world and our role in it.  A little more than 2 years ago, I stood on this floor and invoked the words of Senator Vandenberg--the Senator from Michigan back in the World War II era--for ``maximum united effort'' and Senator Vandenberg's admonition that politics should stop at the water's edge. When I spoke these words, this was at a time when it seemed the only response my Republican colleagues had to the Obama administration's foreign policy moves was categorical condemnation.  I will not categorically condemn the administration's new strategy, but I will pose a challenge to reject the false choice between investing at home and engaging abroad; utilize our diplomatic and development toolkit as much, if not more, than we exercise our defense capabilities; lead by example. The world will indeed become a dark place if we hide America's light under a bushel basket, to use words from  In the face of our adversaries' aggression, we can choose between competition and cooperation. The new strategy outlined by the administration references competition nearly three times more than cooperation. I suggest to the administration the words of President Franklin Roosevelt, who said: ``Competition has been shown to be useful up to a certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is a thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves off.''  Mr.President, I yield to the distinguished Democratic leader.[[Page S8191]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8190-2.txt,1828,1015,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1204,topic-id,2022,"Mr.President, I want to thank the Democratic leader for his remarks.  When I was speaking a few moments ago about national security, I had made a suggestion to the administration that there is a national security strategy that has been outlined and that the administration reject the false choice between investing at home and engaging abroad and make sure that they utilize our diplomatic and development toolkits as much as if not more than they exercise our defense capabilities.  We have major challenges, and that is why I think it is important to outline this morning some of those challenges and some of our responses as we head into the new year.  Just for discussion purposes, I wanted to paint the picture of a nation that--it doesn't describe one nation, but I think we can imagine a country that fits this description or at least a number of countries that might. Imagine a sovereign state, a member of the United Nations, a nation whose leaders are singularly focused on staying in power and who will do anything to remain in power, including undermining their colleagues and erstwhile friends. In this country I am describing, those who speak truth to power are dismissed, ridiculed, or, at worst, treated as criminals. This particular country or profile of a country looks inward, putting its domestic troubles first as its reputation in the world declines. Out of fear of its near-peer competitors, the country retreats from diplomatic engagement and doubles down on military capabilities. Does this sound familiar? It might to some. It may describe a number of countries in whole or in part.  Of course, there are a number of countries that fit this description. Certainly, the dictatorial regimes that rule North Korea, Syria, and Iran prioritize self-preservation over the welfare of their citizens. In Russia and China, journalists and opposition leaders are regularly silenced, jailed, or worse.  Here in the United States, we are going through an especially turbulent chapter in the American story. As we celebrate the holidays, we might be dreading the inevitable political debates with family members or friends whose views differ from ours. However, in that fictitious, oppressive country that I described earlier, you can't have these debates, or you can try, but you won't last too long because the authorities will come knocking.  That is what is great about our country. The United States is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and I am reminded of that every time I meet with servicemembers and veterans who are willing to put their lives on the line every day to defend our inalienable rights to criticize and to disagree with our leaders.  So what about this new strategy that the administration just outlined this week? This new strategy states, in pertinent part, that ``America possesses unmatched political, economic, military, and technological advantages.'' That is what the strategy says, and that is certainly true. But I think we should add a few other advantages, even attributes, that are part of the American story, part of the American advantage.  Certainly, our history of generosity sets us apart from the world, a tradition of pluralism as well, the freedom to debate and dissent without fear, the respect for the rule of law, and finally a culture of innovation unmatched anywhere in the world. As I have said before, Americans don't wait for the future; we invent the future.  Through the execution of its strategy, the administration has an opportunity to invent the future of our Nation, as well as its role in the world--a future where the American economy is firing on all cylinders, where investments here at home lift up everyone, where our researchers and manufacturers lead the world in the production of cutting-edge technologies.  For the last 11 months, this administration has sent the world mixed signals about what ``America first'' really means, from pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, to threatening to walk away from NATO, to hollowing out the State I believe the strategy implementation presents an opportunity to reverse that course. We cannot turn away from the world and try to go it alone. We should ask our allies, certainly, to pull their weight and pay their fair share. Whether it is NATO or the counter-ISIS coalition, the United States can always press our partners to do more, but not by threatening that we will abandon these alliances or by creating any uncertainty about these alliances. Simply put, we need partners to tackle some of the greatest threats facing our Nation and the world.  Let's go through a couple of them.  North Korea is first on the list. The North Korean regime is unpredictable and armed with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and the means to deliver them. Just across the demilitarized zone are tens of thousands of U.forces and our South Korean allies. Just across the water are more[[Page S8193]]U.military personnel and our Japanese allies. This regime is a significant threat--the North Korean regime. It is a threat exacerbated by reckless ridicule, bombastic statements, and ill-considered tweets. One miscalculation can be disastrous. The administration should accelerate serious, sober diplomacy in lockstep with our allies. For the New Year, let's agree to a new rule for all of us--both branches of government: Leave the tweets for domestic policy only. Sound foreign policy and security policy cannot be done in 280 characters.  Congress has offered the administration powerful leverage in this circumstance in the form of several pieces of legislation. First, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act passed this summer, and the Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act is pending before the Senate now. I support these tough, bipartisan sanctions measures because I believe turning the economic screws, coupled with genuine diplomacy, can yield results. In the New Year, I urge the President to tone down the rhetoric and to empower the Secretary of State and our senior diplomats to find a diplomatic path toward a stable North Korea that doesn't threaten the United States or our allies.  How about terrorist groups around the world? Over the last 16 years, the U.military, the intelligence community, and our homeland security professionals have worked hand in hand to meet the rise of terrorist groups head on. We owe the men and women in uniform a debt of gratitude for tirelessly leading the coalition fight that has rolled back ISIS's territorial gains. Implementing the administration's new strategy and its call to fight terrorism at its source is not just about the military fight. The United States should also lead the international community in addressing the underlying issues that drive terrorist recruitment and help to rebuild communities newly liberated from terrorist control.  Think about this. More than 65 million people around the world are displaced from their homes right now. There is no purely military solution for this refugee crisis. A successful counterterrorism strategy requires us to work with our partners for information sharing and for contributions of development assistance.  Another trouble spot in the world is In Syria, the connection between instability, displacement, and terrorism is clear. This conflict has been raging for nearly 7 years. In the absence of U.engagement on a political solution to this crisis, regional powers--namely, Russia, Iran, and Turkey--have run the table, to the benefit of the murderous Assad regime and at the expense of the Syrian people. The United States has abdicated its leadership role and ceded control of the outcomes to nations with interests often in direct conflict with our own.  Recently, we learned that the administration will endorse a political transition plan that leaves Bashar al-Assad in power for at least another 4 years. This is unacceptable and dangerous. Assad is responsible for terrible war crimes that led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians and the displacement of millions more. The strategy outlined by the administration says: ``We will seek a settlement to the Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for refugees to return home and rebuild their lives and safety.''  I agree with that goal. Most people would agree with that goal, but the administration has missed the bigger picture. We need a strategy that pushes back on Russian and Iranian influence in Syria and addresses the underlying grievances that led to the conflict in the first place.  Let me move to The Iranian regime remains a powerful force for instability in the Middle East, especially through its support of terrorist proxies and militias. We know that the Iranians want to maintain control of territory linking Tehran with So they will continue to act against U.interests in Iraq and Here, again, Congress has offered powerful tools to the administration in the form of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions  The nuclear deal with Iran is giving us an unprecedented visibility on the Iranian nuclear program, but the multilateral diplomatic channels built alongside that agreement have atrophied under this administration. Every time the President threatens to walk away from the Iran nuclear deal, he sends a clear signal to our allies and adversaries alike: U.commitments are written in disappearing ink.  If the administration wants to get tough on Iran's nonnuclear bad behavior, there are concrete steps to take today:  1, work with our allies to step up maritime interdictions of any illicit weapons traffic to or from  2, push the Europeans to do more to combat the financial networks that enrich the Iranian terrorist proxy, My bipartisan Stop Terrorist Operational Resources and Money Act, or the so-called STORM Act, which is bipartisan, could help with that.  3, begin diplomatic conversations with our allies about a multilateral strategy to curtail the Iranian ballistic missile program.  All of these efforts take cooperation with our allies, which the President makes harder every time he calls into question the future of the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Finally, as to Russia and China, the new strategy by this administration repeatedly describes Russia and China as our competitors. Let me be clear. These countries are not our friends. They actively work against U.interests. They are threatened by American military dominance and economic power, and both are trying to game the system to undermine our advantages.  China systemically, perniciously games the international trade system to its advantage. I firmly believe American workers and industry can outinnovate and outproduce any others in the world when the playing field is level. Driven by similar motives, Russia has meddled in elections across the Western world, trying to undermine confidence in one of our most fundamental institutions of democracy. Again, there are concrete steps the administration can take to counter these threats from both China and Russia: 1, shore up our electoral systems and help others do the same; 2, counter propaganda; 3, fight corruption; and 4, get serious about holding trade cheaters like China accountable.  Through engagement and cooperation, we can lead the rest of the world away from the Cold War-era clash of major powers that Russia and China want to create.  In conclusion, if this outline of some of the threats and challenges posed seems like a tremendous challenge--a great challenge for our Nation--it is because it always has been so. It has always been a challenge.  President Truman once said:       America was not built on fear. America was built on      courage, on imagination and on unbeatable determination to do      the job at hand.  When faced with a challenge, whether it is Pennsylvanians or Americans, we don't shrink inward. We step up. Our adversaries want us to be divided and dispirited. These adversaries underestimate the courage, the imagination, and the determination of the American people.  President Trump might see it differently, but as we close out 2017, I see a world that needs American leadership more than ever. To paraphrase President Kennedy, we should seek not a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war but a genuine peace that makes life on Earth worth living. The American people are ready to rise to that challenge. I hope the administration is too.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sullivan).

643,topic-id,868,"Mr.Speaker, with a little help from Seuss, I would like to share the story of how the Grinch stole middle class tax cuts:     Every middle class family wanted tax cuts a lot,     But the Grinch, who lived in a big white house, did not.     The Grinch hated middle class tax cuts, he wanted the whole            Tax Code uneven,     Now, please, don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason.     It could be his head was screwed on a bit wrong,     It could be his ties were 2 inches too long,     But I think that the most likely reason of all,     Was his heart, or his hands, were two sizes too small.     Whatever the reason, his heart or his ties,     He stood on Christmas Eve, planning workers' demise,     Staring out from his office with a sour, Grinchy frown,     At the workers' warm, lighted windows below in their town.     ``Tomorrow is Christmas, it is practically here,''     He said from his office with a terrible sneer.     ``Why, for 71 years I have put up with it now,     I must stop these middle class tax cuts. But how?''     Then he got an idea, an awful idea,     The Grinch got a terrible, awful idea.     ``I know just what to do,'' the Grinch thought with a pause,     ``With this coat and this hat, I look just like Santa            Claus.''     Then he loaded some empty bags on his plane,     And he took off to cause some mean Grinchy pain.     While working families dreamed of sweet tax cuts without            care,     The Grinch came to the first little house on the square.     ``This is stop number one,'' the old Grinch Claus hissed,     And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.     Then he slid down the chimney, Santa suit all in place,     And he stuck his head out of the small fireplace,     Where the tax deductions all hung in a row,     ``These deductions,'' he grinned, ``are the first things to            go.''     Personal exemptions, home equity interest, State and local            taxes, too,     ``I'll take almost every deduction away from you.''     Then he slunk to the tax brackets--the corporate tax cuts            were huge,     Why, that Grinch even took the Arctic Wildlife     ``And now,'' grinned the Grinch, with his sacks in a net,     ``I'll stack the deficit with $1 trillion in debt.''     Then he heard a small sound, a child's soft cry,     ``Why are you taking our deductions, Grinch? Why?''     But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,     That he thought up a fib, and he thought it up quick.     ``Why, my sweet little tot,'' the Grinch said on the fly,     ``I am here because corporate taxes are far too high.     ``So I am taking most of your deductions away,     ``To help corporations . . . and you get to pay.     ``See, my dear child, there is no reason to frown,     ``We will make them more wealthy, but it will all trickle            down.''     His fib fooled the child, then he patted her head,     And he got her a tax postcard, and he sent her to bed.     The Grinch took one last look at her sad little pup,     And he went to the chimney and shoved the deficit up.     Healthcare for 13 million was the last thing he took,     Then he slithered away without another look.     In their homes he left nothing but debt and despair,     While giving out handouts to corporations--the Grinch didn't            care.     And the one deduction that he extolled,     Was even too small for a single household.     He rode with his load of deductions for dumping,     ``Pooh-pooh to the middle class,'' he said, gleefully            jumping.     ``They're just waking up, I know just what they'll do,[[Page H10185]]     ``Their mouths will hang open a minute or two, and they'll            all cry, `boo-hoo.'                              {time}  0915     ``That's a noise,'' grinned the Grinch, ``that I simply must            hear.''     So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.     And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.     It started to low. Then it started to grow.     He stared down aghast. The Grinch popped his eyes.     Then he shook. What he saw was a shocking surprise.     Every American, the tall and the small, loudly demanding tax            cuts for all.     We want our deductions and a better deal, not tax cuts for            corporations while you cut Meals on     And the Grinch, with his small hands ice-cold in the snow,            stood puzzling and puzzling:     ``How could it be so?     ``Am I a fool?     ``Are my policies all wrong?     ``Without those deductions, can the Nation be strong?''     And he puzzled 3 hours until his puzzler was sore.     Then the Grinch thought of something he had not tweeted            before:     ``Maybe tax cuts should help more than just corporations.     ``Maybe this Christmas I can help the whole     ``America's middle class is what made it thrive.     ``They need these deductions if they're to survive.''     We all know how the real story ends.     The Grinch finds his heart and he makes amends.     Now we know this tax bill won't end with such glee, because            the President and corporate lobbyists control the     This Christmas, families will get just coal in their            stocking.     Thanks to President Trump, the final result will be shocking.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgH10184.txt,2055,1015,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I rise in strong hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will come to their senses and defeat this job-killing bill that will explode the deficit and hurt working people.  It is important to note 83 percent of the benefits of the cuts in this bill go to the top 1 percent; 86 million hardworking middle class families will actually see a tax increase. Of course, we need to reform our Tax Code, but we need to do it in a way that raises wages, produces good-paying jobs, and makes sure the people have a brighter future.  This does just the opposite. It ransacks Medicare and It creates an unsustainable burden for the next generation, and it is very, very important to recognize it is not going to create jobs. This is trickle-down economics. Let everyone at the top hold on to all of their money, and it will trickle down to the rest of us.  It doesn't work. This is a failed economic policy. This does not support strengthening the middle class. We need to defeat this bill and reform our Tax Code in a way that will really promote job growth, that will raise wages, that will ensure working families can get ahead. There are millions of Americans tonight who will go to bed worrying about how they are going to take care of their family; how they are going to make ends meet.

1142,topic-id,965,"Mr.Speaker, yes. The bill will come back. So, hopefully, the American people will have another opportunity to make certain their voices are heard.  But this is not the way to do a complicated piece of legislation. The last time the Congress did tax reform, there were 400 witnesses, experts who came in, hearings month after month, because it is complicated. You want to make sure it works right. You are talking about the American economy.  None of that happened here. It was written in the dark of the night. Some of our Republican colleagues didn't see the text. This is not a way to do legislation, and it is one of the reasons that excluding the Democrats from contributing to this process was a terrible, terrible mistake.  What is the result?  We end up with a bill that does exactly the opposite of what it says it will do.  This is a job-killing bill. There is no more urgent priority that all of us have to create good-paying jobs, family supporting jobs. We Democrats have launched a very bold economic agenda that focuses on better jobs, better wages for a better future.  Millions of Americans will go to bed tonight and lie awake worried about whether or not they have enough money to pay their bills, whether they can put aside some savings for their retirement, whether they can send their kids to school.  All of those anxieties come from the fact they are not making enough money to make ends meet. They haven't seen an increase in their income in a very long time. What this tax bill does is make those problems worse. This will raise taxes on 86 million middle class families in this country.  They call it a tax cut. For those 86 middle class families, it is a tax increase. In fact, 83 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent, the very richest people in this country and the biggest corporations. It also makes more generous tax provisions that incentivize companies to ship American jobs oversees.  This is not a job creator. The idea that if we just let the people at the very top hold on to all their money, it is going to trickle down to the rest of us, is a job killer. We know that doesn't work. They tried during the Bush administration. We had the worst job loss in a generation.  It doesn't work because we all know the way you actually create jobs is you grow the middle class. You make sure folks have good-paying jobs, have more money in their pockets to buy the goods and services.  Go to any small business in my State of Rhode Island, and I am sure it is the same in the State of California, and ask a small-business owner: What do you need to add a job? What do you need to increase the number of people who work in your business?  They will say one thing: I need customers. I need people to buy what I make and sell.  That is why strengthening the middle class, raising the income of people in this country, is the way you grow the economy. This is just the opposite.  I was sickened when that bill passed the floor a few moments ago and I saw our Republican colleagues cheering and hooting and hollering like they were at a ball game. They put points on the board. They didn't put points on the board for the American people.  We are going to keep fighting for a tax reform bill that actually provides cuts to middle class families that will help to promote economic growth and create good-paying jobs.  We think the Tax Code is broken. We have always been willing to work together in a bipartisan way to make the Tax Code simpler, more competitive, and work for the American people.  That is not what the Republicans did. This is a giveaway to their donors. Some of our colleagues said it out loud: If we don't pass a tax cut, our donors told us to not call anymore. They actually said that out loud.  That is not how you write legislation. Let's not forget who sent us here and whom we should be working for.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for giving me an opportunity to contribute to the conversation tonight. This is a bill which will hurt Rhode Island, hurt this country, and hurt our economy.  Finally, it also will result in the gutting of Medicare and Everyone forgets this creates a $1.5 trillion debt which, by our rules, is going to result in automatic cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, student loan programs, block grants, vocational rehabilitation programs, and on and on and on.[[Page H10237]]                                {time}  1800  They give away $1.5 trillion that we don't have. They borrow the money to give away the tax cuts, and then next year they come back and say: Oh, we have no money. We have to cut Medicare and cut Medicaid and cut Social Security and cut Pell grants and not rebuild the infrastructure of our country.  Our Republican colleagues have said this is part one. Part two will be these cuts. The American people know this, which is why this bill is overwhelmingly unpopular with the American people. They see what the Republicans are up to. They are insulting the American people. They think they haven't figured this out. They are going to dangle a couple of dollars in front of them but then whack them with huge cuts next year.  The American people are smarter than this. The Republicans are going to be held accountable. We have to fight with every fiber in our body to stop this because it is really going to hurt people.

183,topic-id,249,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Ryan-McConnell tax scam bill. This bill should be named the ``Republican Donor Class Relief Act'' because that is what it is, and several of my Republican colleagues and many in the media have admitted as much.  This tax scam represents a grotesque set of priorities revealing deep depravity of American values. One of the first[[Page H10209]]principles of our Judeo-Christian value system is grounded in what we do ``for the least of these.''  From the outset, this bill violates that principle by lowering the marginal tax rates on the wealthiest among us by 2.6 points, while raising those rates on the least among us by 2 points.  This tax scam bill adds insult to that injurious act by doubling the estate tax exemption from $11 million to $22 million.  The Republicans add further insult to injury by lowering the tax rates for corporations by 14 points while raising tax rates on 86 million middle-income families. It makes the tax cuts for corporations permanent and the miniscule individual cuts temporary, while also kicking 13 million people off their health insurance and increasing premiums for millions more.

They showed their values in the tax bill that gave 83 percent of the dollars to the upper 1 percent of the economic strata in this country.  They showed their values in giving real estate developers special tax breaks, like President Trump and others, and gave people who are extremely wealthy the opportunity to will more money to their children or whoever they choose than they can today, an $11 million break.  It has been sad sitting on the Judiciary Committee and watching the Republicans be aiders and abetters of the President in trying to demean the reputation of one of the finest Americans and public servants I have ever had the opportunity to know, Bob Mueller, and probably with the intention of firing him, something that should wake Republicans up to the fact that our country is in jeopardy.

660,topic-id,482,"Mr.President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in introducing the Museum and Library Services Act of 2017. This bill would reauthorize the core programs administered by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which support libraries and museums in Maine and across the country. This bill includes important updates to improve the abilities of libraries and museums to meet the needs of local communities.  The Museum and Library Services Act represents a commitment to supporting libraries and museums that enrich our communities. Libraries provide not only a wonderful learning tool, full of books, public documents, and internet access, but also are community hubs where citizens can meet to share and explore ideas. Likewise, great museums do more than accumulate artifacts--they tell stories. The programs reauthorized in this bill would help libraries and museums across Maine and the United States better serve the public by helping with research, planning, and programming.  The Museum and Library Services Act would make important improvements to IMLS's ability to collaborate with states and communities. It would reauthorize the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), the only federal program that helps public libraries meet their community's needs, enhance their services through technology, reach underserved and rural populations, and recruit new professionals to the library field. Ensuring that federal resources reach our rural communities is particularly important to me, and I am pleased that this bill highlights support for rural and tribal areas.  Every state in our country receives its share of the LSTA, which leverages the federal investment with a state and local funding match. In Maine, the LSTA has helped libraries lend books and other materials by mail to reach residents in communities that do not have libraries nearby or who are homebound. It has helped Maine libraries serve individuals with disabilities through access to book recordings and special media players, including braille and audio downloads. It has helped my state improve online access to magazines, newspapers, and reference books, and spurred innovative collaborations with schools statewide.  The bill would also reauthorize the Museum Services Act, providing support for museums to collaborate with schools, libraries, and colleges and universities, and to encourage new technologies to extend the reach of programs and museum collections. As with the LSTA, museums are incentivized to leverage other sources of support to match the federal investment.  This reauthorization underscores the role that libraries and museums play in community revitalization. Libraries are important information centers for workforce development, health information, and digital and financial literacy. Museums are also vital community partners that work to connect our communities to the cultural, historical, natural, and scientific pieces of our heritage.  From providing job search resources and free internet access to exposing children and families to enriching literary and educational experiences, libraries and museums serve vital roles in our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8261.txt,2121,REPUBLICAN TAX BILL,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1268,topic-id,1477,"Mr.President, I rise in strong opposition to the point of order that will be offered by the Senator from Kentucky, which would have the effect of allowing harmful, indiscriminate budget cuts to be triggered. While there are certain safety net programs like Medicaid, food stamps, and Social Security that are exempt from these automatic cuts, the Medicare Program is not exempt, and there are a number of other vital programs in addition to Medicare, including Federal education programs, agricultural support for farmers, and funding for Citizenship and Immigration Services, among others, that would be subject to immediate automatic cuts if we failed to take action tonight to avert that outcome.  It has been deeply disturbing to me to see seniors frightened about the possibility that a $25 billion cut in Medicare--that is a 4-percent reduction--would be automatically triggered. By waiving this point of order, we will prevent such cuts from taking place, reassuring our Nation's seniors and their loved ones.  Although the law that could cause this reduction has been waived some 16 times--and indeed never implemented since it was enacted--I felt that it was essential that our leaders publicly commit that Medicare reductions would not be triggered, given the amount of fear, anxiety, and misinformation that is out there.  I wrote to the Senate majority leader, urging that we immediately remove the threat of an automatic cut in Medicare's funding. In response, I am pleased to say that both the majority leader and the Speaker of the House released a joint statement that pledged this will not happen, and that is the issue before us tonight.  Medicare provides essential healthcare benefits to our Nation's seniors. We must remove, immediately, the threat that an automatic reduction in the program's funding could occur, which would affect healthcare providers and diminish access that beneficiaries--including our seniors and disabled individuals--have to the services they need.  Earlier this month, AARP sent a letter to the House and the Senate leadership, alluding and supporting my inquiry and warning Congress of the potential consequences. The letter says:       The sudden cut to Medicare provider funding in 2018 would      have an immediate and lasting impact, including fewer      healthcare providers participating in Medicare and reduced      access to care for Medicare beneficiaries. Healthcare      providers may choose to stop accepting Medicare patients at a      time when the Medicare population is growing by 10,000 new      beneficiaries each day. . . . Furthermore, Medicare Advantage      plans and Part D prescription drug plans may charge higher      premiums or cost sharing in future years to make up for these      cuts now.  These potential cuts would have an enormous impact on our hospitals, our nursing homes, our home health agencies, and other essential healthcare providers who play a critical role in providing healthcare services and also as important economic drivers in our communities.  It is critical for Congress to act quickly, to act tonight before we go home, so seniors do not have the anxiety of wondering whether the tax bill will somehow negatively affect their healthcare. We can act tonight to remove that anxiety and assure them it will not.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the exchange of letters I had with Majority Leader McConnell and also the letter from AARP be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.Senate,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell: I write to express my deep      concerns with the Congressional Budget Office's determination      that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to      be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be      triggered by the passage of tax reform legislation as a      result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though      there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.       Since I do not believe it is anyone's intention to allow      automatic cuts to Medicare to occur, I urge swift action to      waive the PAYGO requirements. Medicare provides essential      benefits to our nation's seniors, and we must remove      immediately the threat that an automatic reduction in the      program's funding could occur.       Since PAYGO was enacted, sixteen laws that would have      otherwise triggered PAYGO's automatic spending cuts have      included provisions to exclude all or part of the law's      budgetary impact, including the American Taxpayer Relief Act      of 2012 that was enacted under the previous       I look forward to working with you to ensure that no      Medicare cuts are triggered under PAYGO, a goal I believe is      supported by members on both sides of the aisle. Thank you      for your attention to this critical issue.           Sincerely,     Susan Collins, U.                                 ____                                                  U.Senate,                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2017.     Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington,       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter expressing      concern about the across-the-board spending cuts. You will be      pleased to know that Speaker Paul Ryan and I issued the      following joint statement earlier today:       ``Critics of tax reform are claiming the legislation would      lead to massive, across-the-board spending cuts in vital      programs--including a 4-percent reduction in Medicare--due to      the Pay-Go law enacted in 2010. This will not happen.      Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,      which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is      no reason to believe that Congress would not act again to      prevent a sequester, and we will work to ensure these      spending cuts are prevented.''

AARP, with its nearly 38      million members in all 50 States and the District of      Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, represents      millions of individuals whose health care depends on      We urge you to act now to prevent these cuts to            The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently provided an      explanation of the impact H.1 and its $1.5 trillion      deficit increase will have on Medicare and other programs.      The CBO estimated that because of statutory pay-as-you-go and      the increase in the deficit, Medicare providers will be      subject to an automatic $25 billion cut in fiscal year 2018,      and additional cuts in subsequent fiscal years. According to      CBO, the automatic cuts, or sequester, would begin as soon as      January, 2018.       In a statement responding to Senator Collins's inquiry on      statutory pay-as-you-go and the risk of Medicare cuts, Leader      McConnell and Speaker Ryan provided the following assurance:      ``Congress has readily available methods to waive this law,      which has never been enforced since its enactment. There is      no reason to believe that Congress[[Page S8235]]     would not act again to prevent a sequester, and we will work      to ensure these spending cuts are prevented.'' It is of      paramount interest to our members, and other older Americans,      that you act to prevent these spending cuts as soon as      possible.       The sudden cut to Medicare provider funding in 2018 would      have an immediate and lasting impact, including fewer      providers participating in Medicare and reduced access to      care for Medicare beneficiaries. Health care providers may      choose to stop accepting Medicare patients at a time when the      Medicare population is growing by 10,000 new beneficiaries      each day. Cutting reimbursement in 2018, and possibly each      year thereafter, would discourage health care providers from      treating this growing population. We need to protect and      strengthen the Medicare program and ensure there is a health      care workforce able and willing to take on new patients.      Furthermore, Medicare Advantage plans and Part D prescription      drug plans may charge higher premiums or cost-sharing in      future years to make up for the cuts now. These cuts also      come at a critical time in the program when providers are      adopting the new payment systems according to MACRA (P.     114-10) which overwhelmingly passed Congress in 2015. An      across-the-board cut to provider reimbursement will leave      health care providers fewer resources to invest in their      practices, and make them less inclined to take on risk in new      alternative payment models. The sudden payment cut will      stifle the transition toward payment based on value, having      implications for future Medicare cost growth. In any event,      Medicare beneficiaries will pay the price for these sudden      and significant cuts.       Our members and other older Americans are counting on you      to preserve their access to Medicare services, including      their doctors and hospitals. We urge you to act swiftly to      prevent automatic cuts to If you have any questions      or need additional information, please feel free to contact      me or contact Joyce Rogers, Senior Vice President of      Government           Sincerely,                                                Jo Ann Jenkins,                                          Chief Executive  ",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8234.txt,2121,THE REPUBLICAN-LED SENATE,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

975,topic-id,1122,"Mr.President, as we know all too well, the Senate of the United States has an annual job to do--to adopt a budget and then appropriate it; to lay out the framework for what to spend and then to make deliberate decisions in the Appropriations Committee and move forward by the end of the fiscal year.  This may not be well or widely known, but the Federal fiscal year begins October 1. It is by October 1 that we are supposed to figure out what we are going to spend and how we are going to spend it and why we are going to spend it.  As we all head home to celebrate the holidays on December 21, I just wanted to take a moment and go over the list of things that are unaddressed and unresolved at the end of this calendar year.  The way it is supposed to work here and the way it is actually working here are strikingly different. In my 7 years now in the Senate on both the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee, I have seen people of good will of both parties try mightily and so far consistently fail to get us back to regular order and to end this process of moving crisis to crisis, continuing resolution to continuing resolution.  While I didn't hope that tonight the Federal Government of the United States would shut down, it is depressing, concerning, even alarming to me that we head home having not resolved so many issues.  We have heard from other Members here about the pressing needs of their home We have concerns all over our country, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, which is a literal lifeline to 9 million low-income children. Authorization and funding ran out months ago. Some States are already notifying parents that their children's health insurance coverage will lapse. There are community health centers on which 26 million patients rely. There is the pressing need to fund a response to the opioid crisis, the need to fund veterans' care, infrastructure, shore up pension plans, invest in education, and, of course, respond to natural disasters. From Americans in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to Americans in Texas and Florida and Louisiana, to those in California and the West--whether it is hurricanes or forest fires, parts of our Nation are literally flooding and burning. Yet we head home having not addressed their challenges.  Of course, I feel concerned that we have failed to act to protect the Dreamers here in our country, the young men and women brought here who have never known any other country, men and women who reflect the best of our country. I met many in my home State of They are high school and college students, members of our military, parts of our neighborhoods and communities. But given the Trump administration's decision, the President's decision to end an administrative policy allowing these young people to come out of the shadows and[[Page S8238]]live without fear of being deported, we wait for bipartisan legislative action to give them the security they deserve and the ability to participate wholly in the American  I believe we can pass a bipartisan Dream Act that both protects Dreamers and makes our borders more secure, but all of these issues seem to become more partisan and more difficult fights than they need to be. We should be able to work together to resolve our differences and not have to go home with yet another continuing resolution, keeping the government afloat while we head out to celebrate. Our constituents didn't send us here to fight endless partisan battles, to avoid the strictures of the Budget Act and the appropriations process, and when things get tough, to just kick the can down the road.  Before I leave the floor, I want to speak about one other pressing concern I have, and that is about the importance of maintaining the independence of the investigation currently underway under the leadership of Special Counsel Robert I have heard concerning, even alarming attacks on the special counsel by colleagues in the other Chamber and by folks in the press.  I just want to take a moment to say that our Nation relies on a few key institutions and principles that protect this experiment in democracy, and none are more important than the rule of law and the institutions that make up our system of justice. As partisanship, gridlock, and distress have become more prevalent in our country and corrosive to our politics, these institutions that sustain our democratic system are more important than ever.  I have traveled to other countries that have on pieces of paper Constitutions and legal systems that literally mirror our own, but they are ineffective and their systems are nondemocratic because their courts are not independent and their national leaders are not held accountable.  Across our country for generations, from classrooms to courtrooms, in Congress and communities, we have affirmed to Americans of all backgrounds the importance of the principle that no one is above the rule of law. Our country has been able to grow and change and improve because we are a nation of laws--laws that can be debated and changed but must be followed and respected.  The Department of Justice isn't respected because of its role on a piece of paper, no matter how treasured and important, or because of its title engraved above the door of the building or its motto; it is respected, trusted, and relied upon because it has strived to uphold our highest ideals and to enforce the law.  It is easier to save an institution like the rule of law than it is to restore it once torn down. This is why I helped author bipartisan legislation that would seek to further affirm the rule of law and the independence of the Department of Justice specifically by protecting special counsel investigations from unwarranted political interference.  We have spirited debates over taxation, immigration, our Federal budget, but this issue is too important for me to yield the floor before this end of the year without urging my colleagues to seriously consider the important task we face to maintain the independence of the Department of Justice and uphold the rule of law.  I hope folks in this Chamber will consider the importance of protecting this investigation and this special counsel and, frankly, of continuing to protect the independence and integrity of the Department of Justice and our system of courts and law into the future. It is part of the bedrock on which our democracy rests, a bedrock which we cannot afford to have shaken.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

107,topic-id,1823,"Mr.President, the second matter I would like to address is the historic vote that the House will take today and that we will take later on this evening on the Tax Cuts and Jobs  This bill will dramatically reduce taxes on American families and incentivize the creation of new jobs. It is a major victory for all Americans who want to know that Washington has their best interests at heart. It does exactly what we told the voters we would do in 2016, and it is important to keep our word. We are delivering tax reform in a way that is real, comprehensive, and substantial, and we are doing it through what we usually refer to as regular order in the  I know that ever since the Affordable Care Act was written in then-Democratic Leader Harry Reid's conference room and was brought to the floor, there has been a lot of concern about the way the Senate conducts its activities. Senator McCain, who unfortunately will not be able to be with us today, has been a stickler for returning to regular order--by that, meaning introducing a bill, having it marked up and debated in the relevant committee--in this case, in the Finance Committee--then having it brought to the floor, where it is amended, and then debating it until we finally pass it. Then we go to a conference committee with the House and reconcile the differences between the Senate version and the House version. That is exactly what we did with this piece of legislation.  I have spoken at length about certain provisions in the bill before, but I want to make one point abundantly clear. For the American people, this represents the very best kind of Christmas gift we can offer them--one that will actually make their lives better and one from which they will benefit right away. This tax reform may not bear the ribbons and bows of a Christmas present, but the men and women who are trying to make ends meet will benefit from having lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and a resurgent economy that will produce more jobs and better opportunities.  I will refer to an article that came out in January of this year which cited[[Page S8075]]a shocking statistic, really. The statistic is, most Americans remain one misstep away from having a financial crisis. Fifty-seven percent of Americans don't have enough cash on hand to cover an unexpected $500 expense. These findings from this CBS News report shed light on how many households continue to struggle with their basic finances more than 7 years after the official end of the great recession of 2007. A typical American household still earns 2.4 percent below what it brought home in 1999. When people talk about less purchasing power and flat wages, that is what they are talking about.  At the same time, we know costs for essentials, such as housing and childcare, have surged faster than the rate of inflation, which puts even more stress on these household budgets. That is one of the reasons we will pass this conference report later on this evening--because we believe these families deserve to keep more of what they earn so as to make sure they don't go into debt when they suffer an unexpected financial expense of $500, like the 57 percent of the respondents to the poll said they would, which was reported by CBS That is why it is a big deal.  For example, a typical family of four who earns the median family income of $73,000 a year will receive a tax cut of $2,058, which is a reduction of nearly 58 percent. Now, that may not seem like a big deal inside the beltway, but to those families who are living paycheck to paycheck and who cannot deal with unexpected financial expenses, this will help them in a real and meaningful way.  Consider the single mother--or father, for that matter--with one child and an annual income of $41,000. That parent, that family, will receive a tax cut of $1,304.50, which is a reduction of nearly 73 percent. This may be shocking news to most people who are listening because all they have heard about is what is bad in this bill.  There are a lot of very good things in this bill, but it could have been made better if our Democratic colleagues had worked with us rather than resisted us at every step along the way. I guess they are satisfied with the status quo--the fact that purchasing power for the average family is actually 2.4 percent below what it was in 1999. The message I would like to convey is, we are not satisfied with the status quo. We think life can be better, and one way it will be better is to start with letting people keep more of what they earn.  For a married small business owner with an income of $100,000, he will receive a tax cut of $2,603.50, which is a reduction of nearly 24 percent. So you can see, across all incomes and among people in very different circumstances, each of them will benefit from the bill we will pass tonight and send to the  This bill also does something for which Barack Obama had argued in 2011, that of having a bipartisan consensus formed to cut the corporate income tax rate. I know people aren't necessarily immediately attracted to the idea of cutting corporations' taxes, but the fact is, America has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. What that means is, it is cheaper for businesses to move to other countries, to invest in jobs there, and to keep the money overseas that they earn abroad. By reducing it to 21 percent, as we do in this bill, we will basically have achieved the average tax rate in the industrialized world, and we will move from a worldwide tax system to a territorial one. This really is a bipartisan consensus move.  When our Democratic friends criticize us for corporate giveaways, we are embracing the very same reforms they have advocated in the past, whether it is President Obama, Democratic leader Senator Schumer, or the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator All of them have advocated reducing the corporate tax rate and making our corporate business tax more competitive because they recognize, as we all recognize, the fact that the status quo kills jobs and encourages businesses to move overseas. We want to grow jobs in America, along with investment, and encourage those businesses to come back home.  I daresay that all Americans from every walk of life will benefit from this stimulus to our economy. Janet Yellin, who was last appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve by Barack Obama, said that in part as a result of this tax package, the Federal Reserve has raised its projection on growth of the U.economy from 2.1 percent next year to 2.5 percent--four-tenths of 1 percent. That is a big deal.  Every American will feel the benefit of that economic growth in terms of the wages they earn, the opportunities they have, and their ability to protect themselves against unexpected financial expenses, as I mentioned earlier.  What could someone do with $2,600 more in their paycheck? Well, you could install concrete countertops or laminate flooring in your house. When it comes to a cell phone--everybody seems to have a cell phone--you can pay your cell phone expense for 2\1/2\ years. You can go online at a Texas college and pay for your education for a full year. You can breathe a little bit easier in Dallas by having enough money to pay for 2 months of average apartment rent. You can drive down Interstate Highway 35 in Texas, knowing that almost 5\1/2\ months of an average car payment is taken care of. If you need a little dental work done, you can go to your dentist for a little tune-up and pay for that out of the savings you will achieve as a result of this bill.  Stories like these, stories of how busy, hard-working and multitasking Americans will benefit from our plan, simply leave me with confusion as to why our Democratic colleagues have simply refused to participate in this process and have blocked and dragged their feet every step along the way, trying to stop us from providing this relief, from keeping our promise to the American people. It seems in the process they have given up on the American dream, they have settled for the status quo, and they are even rooting for failure.  This bill's final passage won't wait for our Democratic colleagues to wake up. We are simply determined to get this win even without them because American families need more take-home pay, they need higher wages, they need greater job opportunities, and they need a competitive economy and the benefits it brings. American families should not have to settle for anything less, and we will make sure they don't.  There is one more aspect of the bill I want to bring up. Our tax reform plan strengthens our long-term energy security by opening up an area in Alaska to responsible energy development. At the invitation of Senator Murkowski, I traveled to the North Slope of Alaska about a year or so ago, and I am amazed at the technology they were able to deploy in extracting oil from the North They literally have ice roads that don't exist except during the coldest part of the year in order to protect the environment and allow equipment to travel overland. Thanks to directional drilling, they are able to occupy basically a very small footprint and literally drill hundreds of wells in a multitude of different directions and pump the energy from that location. It creates jobs, it creates wealth, and it helps create energy security for the people of Alaska and for the United  I come from a State with a huge energy presence, and I understand the importance of developing our natural resources responsibly. Limited development with modern technologies will not ruin this area, as some of the critics have charged, because a very small portion of the acreage is allowed. It will provide jobs.  Let's not forget why we are doing this. One reason we are increasing our domestic energy production is because we want to make ourselves less dependent on foreign energy sources. It also helps lower the price at the pump for millions of hard-working  So I can't wait to vote on this bill later today, and I can't wait to hand-deliver to the President's desk this important bill this week and for him to sign it into law. We will all benefit from passage of this Tax Cuts and Jobs  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

301,topic-id,233,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to stand with the DREAMers, both in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout our country. Protecting our DREAMers is the responsible, moral, and just thing to do.  The majority of Americans want legal protection for our DREAMers, and Congress must listen. I have been listening to those who have visited my offices, university presidents, religious organizations, my constituents, who simply want us to provide legalization for these individuals who have come to this country at an average age of 6 years of age. This is the only country they have ever known.  Passing the Dream Act is a priority for Democrats and has strong support for many We just need to vote on the bill.  I am a cosponsor of the Dream Act, and I have joined nearly 200 of my colleagues signing a discharge petition to bring this legislation to the floor.

John has been with me since before the beginning of my congressional service, leading my first congressional campaign. He officially became my chief of staff when I was sworn into office in the U.House of Representatives in January of 1993. His encouragement, wise counsel, and friendship have been invaluable in decisionmaking and advancing policy and legislative objectives. I cannot thank him enough for his dedication and ongoing assistance.

He works to preserve Idaho's natural resources and quality of life. His passion for collaborative problem-solving in addressing natural resources challenges has helped give collaborative efforts every opportunity to succeed. John has been a driving force in bringing stakeholders with often diverging viewpoints to the table to build common ground and has helped provide room for stakeholders to talk and resolve concerns rather than resort to litigation. His involvement was essential in the enactment and implementation of the Owyhee Initiative and has been of great assistance with other collaborative efforts, such as the Clearwater Basin  John has also been at the forefront of helping Idahoans who have had challenges with Federal agencies. Earlier in his tenure, he helped get reason to prevail to the benefit of an Idaho community in a dispute with a Federal agency over how to best address mining cleanup. He was also heavily involved in addressing problems a timber company in southeast Idaho was having with another Federal agency. John intervened on the company's behalf and helped resolve the issues. These are just a few of the many achievements John has assisted with for  Every step of the way, John has been there with reasoned counsel and a great sense of the bigger picture. I serve the people of Idaho in Washington, DC, and I believe in strong ties to the Although it seems to be a less common arrangement to have a chief of staff based in the State, I have been fortunate to have a principal member of my staff based in Boise fulltime and centrally involved in Idaho issues. His deep knowledge, understanding of Idaho, and ability to effectively represent me have been beneficial. John is well respected in all corners of our great In an era and political environment where turnover is common, John's 25 years of committed service is a testament to his deep dedication to  Thank you, John, for your extraordinary counsel and friendship all these years.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8147.txt,250,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1085,topic-id,476,"Madam President, today I wish to honor Susan Hawkes Wheeler, chief of staff for my Washington, DC, office, for her 25 years of congressional service. Susan's trusted, dedicated, and perceptive counsel have been of great value throughout my congressional service.  Susan is a native of Idaho and has always had the Gem State's interests in the forefront of her mind. I am fortunate that she chose to serve Idaho through my office. I first met Susan when she worked as a television reporter and news manager in Boise and Idaho She covered me when I first ran for public office. Later, after a job interview on a twin-engine plane flying between Boise and Twin Falls, I hired her to help me get elected to Her sharp wit and directness was and is refreshing and effective.  After my election to the U.House of Representatives, Susan joined my congressional staff as press secretary and moved from Idaho to Washington, This was back at a time when faxes still came on thermal curly paper and speed dials were limited to 10 numbers per machine. Radio actualities were done by actually splicing audiotape and calling each radio station separately to play the soundbite for them over the phone line, which was a landline. As technologies advanced, she met those changes with imaginative approaches and implemented innovative ways to improve communications and outreach with Her responsibilities also increased in my office.  Susan served as my acting administrative assistant during my last year in the Then, in the Senate, she served as my communications director until June 2011, when she earned the job of chief of staff-She proved herself someone who can always be counted on for a straightforward and reasoned approach, no matter the situation or the audience. She helped make the office more effective and has been integral to improving the way our office communicates with  She improved the quality of the communication in my office, both externally and within the office. Her extensive work making the website a better resource for Idahoans has also resulted in it being recognized through multiple awards. Another of her achievements is the focus she has given to establishing office procedures and working with Senate administrative offices to fine-tune policies that enable smooth office operations. She also serves as a great example of leadership, communicating well with staff, and empowering them to share insight. While helping me become more effective, Susan has also taken the time to mentor countless staff and help young people start their careers.  From day one, no matter the job title, Susan has always been a senior counselor with trusted insight given her deep familiarity with Idaho, experience, and sound judgement.  Thank you, Susan, for dedicating so much of your time and talent to serving the people of Idaho in Congress and for your strong support and steady friendship.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8147-2.txt,250,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

421,topic-id,521,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me this time, and I thank her for her work. I thank Mr.Frelinghuysen, as well, for his work and my colleagues on the other side, but I have reservations, strong reservations about this bill.  I appreciate the very real needs of those still recovering, our American citizens and friends and family in Florida and Texas, and that concern is genuine. I have always supported aid to other parts of the country, even when some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refused to help New York and left New York hanging after Superstorm I have never let that get in the way of my wanting to be helpful to my fellow citizens anywhere in this country who are under duress.  But I can't, in good conscience, vote for this bill. It leaves some of the hardest hit and most vulnerable Americans, American citizens, without the help that they need. It treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands as second-class citizens--not second-class people, but second-class, literally, citizens--and will stall the efforts there to rebuild.  I appreciate Mr.Culberson saying that the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are a long way from recovery. I am paraphrasing what he said. I do appreciate those words. I do hope that it is an insight for my Republican colleagues and the leadership on the other side of the aisle that more help will be on the way for the people of Puerto Rico, but simply not enough is being done in this bill to help the men and women of Puerto Rico and the children of Puerto Rico today.  Our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are no less American than those in any of the 50  I wonder if anyone would argue that point as to whether they are citizens of the United States or not. I would argue they are no less citizens of the United States than any other individuals in the rest of the 50 States, and they should be treated the same and with the same respect.  The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands suffered direct hits not from one, but from two massive hurricanes, the likes of which we have never seen before, not in our modern history. Maybe you have to go back to Alexander Hamilton and the hurricane that he wrote about back in the 1700s that rocketed him to stardom.  Here we are 3 months later. Millions--not hundreds, not thousands, but millions--of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin Islands are without power. Far too many still, because they are without power, lack clean drinking water. Thousands are unable to receive adequate healthcare, and earlier this week, the Governor of Puerto Rico ordered a recount of the storm's death toll, which could number, now, into the thousands. If that is not a sign of how neglectful the response has been to this disaster, then I don't know what would be.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Smith of Nebraska).

1200,topic-id,155,"Mr.Speaker, Republicans have moved on from doing nothing to help middle-class America, to actively undoing everything America's middle class relies on. First, they cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, instead of lifting up the middle class. And they did it twice. Now they're kicking the can down the road while millions of Americans suffer through the holidays. They've left millions of kids in the lurch for months by letting the Children's Health Insurance Program expire instead of protecting sick children in need of care.

But here is what the Republicans aren't going to fix:  They didn't fix the fact that this bill won't provide economic security to hardworking families.  They didn't fix the fact that this bill will subsidize mansions for the wealthy, not renters or first-time home buyers.  They didn't fix the fact that it won't help families save for education or their retirement.  They didn't fix the fact that it will saddle our grandchildren with $2 trillion of debt.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is not an investment in hardworking men and women or In fact, it rips healthcare from 13 million It is an investment in the GOP's base--corporate special interests--the wealthiest among the wealthiest, and the entire Trump empire.

564,topic-id,1989,"Mr.President, tonight is a momentous evening, but it is also a sad evening. It is a momentous evening because the Senate is on the verge of passing historic tax cuts that are designed to bring back jobs and economic growth, to create millions of new jobs, to raise wages, and to cut the taxes on working families, but it is a sad day because it is a day of a demonstration of Democratic partisanship that is ill-befitting for the institution that is the U. For two centuries, tax reform has been a bipartisan endeavor. For two centuries, Democrats have been willing to work with Republicans on cutting taxes.  In 1981 and in 1986, when Ronald Reagan enacted historic tax reforms and tax cuts, Democrats participated. Indeed, a Democrat, Tip O'Neill, was Speaker of the In the House, then a conservative Democrat, Bill Graham, carried the Ronald Reagan tax cuts. In the Senate, in 1986, one of the leaders was then a liberal Democrat, Bill Bradley, from New  Those Democrats, the so-called conservative Democrats, the Democrats interested in cutting taxes on working men and women have disappeared from this institution.  When the House first passed tax cuts, zero Democrats voted for it--zero--not a single Democrat in the entire body. When the Senate passed tax cuts, zero Democrats passed it. We can expect tonight not a single Democrat will break from party discipline. Why? Because they are so united in their rage at President Trump that they are willing to tell middle-class voters in their State: We don't care.  Tonight every Democrat is going to vote against doubling the child tax credit. If you are a single mom at home and you have three kids, right now the child tax credit is $1,000. In just a couple of weeks, it is going to double to $2,000 per kid, which means $6,000 in tax credit in your pocket, and every single Democrat in this body is going to say to the single moms: Tough luck. We aren't cutting your taxes. What a sad statement.  We have seen floor speech after floor speech after floor speech where Democrats claim this tax cut is going to raise your taxes. There used to be a standard for veracity in this body, but the beautiful thing is, when one political party makes representations to the American people that aren't just a little bit wrong but are wildly outright falsehoods, that tends to become public.  The beautiful thing is in January the American people are going to see. So I am going to encourage the American people, in January, take a look at your pay stubs. The Democrats are claiming wildly, falsely that somehow your taxes are going to go up. Let me tell you, for virtually every American taxpayer in this country, your taxes will go down.  In the Old Testament, when someone came forward and claimed he was a prophet, the test the Old Testament provided is, if you claimed you were a prophet, the people were to demand, make a short-term prediction, and let's see if it comes true. Well, the Democrats have made a short-term prediction. They told the American people: Your taxes are going to go up. In January, take a look at it. I guarantee you, for that single mom, when you look at the child tax credit, your taxes are going down.  Every single income tax bracket is going down. Not only that, the standard deduction that you could take is doubling for a couple from $12,000 to $24,000. The first $24,000 you make, you pay zero, nothing, nada. Yet the Democrats, with their friends, their compliant friends in the media, have succeeded in scaring people to think a historic tax cut is somehow a tax increase.  The beauty of it is, for every voter at home, determine if they are telling the truth or if they are misleading you because they are so filled with partisan animosity for the President that they can't vote for a tax cut. It is a sad state of affairs.  Despite that, this bill is going to pass. Despite that, we are going to see job creators, we are going to see farmers, we are going to see ranchers, and we are going to see small businesses growing because the taxes on each of them are going to go down. We are going to see the taxes for working families go down.  By the way, there is one subset of people whose taxes will go up under this, the rich people in high-tax Democratic The irony of all the high dudgeon from our Democratic friends pounding the table about this is a tax cut for the rich, the only people whose taxes are going up are the really rich. The middle class, their taxes are all going down. The working class, their taxes are going down. Every taxpayer, their taxes are going down, except rich people in Manhattan and San Some of them, their taxes may go up.  You see this Kabuki theater of Senators on the Democratic aisle pretending: We won't defend the rich people by claiming we are defending the working class. Well, the facts are the facts are the facts, and the facts are the taxes for the working class are going down. Those are the facts, and you will see that.  I ask everyone watching at home, go look at your pay stub in If they weren't telling the truth, if you see in your pay stub you are paying less taxes, you ought to stop and ask: Why did 48 Democrats in the Senate all tell me something that was false? Why did they say something that is not true in my family?[[Page S8139]]  It is even sadder than that. One of the most important elements of this tax reform bill that we are getting ready to pass is an expansion of educational opportunities for parents. It is an amendment I introduced and this body passed. It was divided 50-50, and the Vice President cast a tie-breaking vote. It expanded 529 college savings plans.  Right now, 529 plans are immensely popular. Parents and grandparents can save for college education for their kids and grandkids in a tax-advantaged way. The amendment I introduced that this body adopted expands 529 college savings plans to also include K-12 education, to also include letting parents spend up to $10,000 per child per year from a 529 plan on public school, on private school, on parochial school, or on religious school, and as the amendment was passed, on homeschools. It puts the parents in charge; it puts the grandparents in charge, saving their own money--not taxpayer money--their own money.  It is the most significant Federal school choice legislation that has ever passed the U. You know what we are in the middle of, right? The Democrats have raised an objection. They raised an objection to all of it. They were horrified that a benefit could go to 50 million schoolkids, that parents would be able to save for those schoolkids. They raised an objection under the Byrd rule, which is an obscure procedure rule that nobody at home knows what it is, but they objected to it. They said: You can't benefit 50 million schoolkids.  Indeed, as we argued in front of the Senate Parliamentarian, one of the arguments the Democrats said is: This is really popular with the American people. We don't want to do something that is really popular with the American people. This is a big policy change. They love 529 plans, and now the parents of 50 million schoolkids--schoolkids in Texas and every other State--will be able to save for the education of their kids, and that has the Democrats horrified because every single Democrat voted against the parents in their State saving in a 529 system for K-12 education.  Well, the Senate Parliamentarian issued a ruling earlier tonight rejecting most of the Democratic claims but, sadly, adopted one small portion of it. I think that claim was an error. I think the Parliamentarian's ruling is contrary to Federal rule.  Let me tell you what the Democrats are objecting to because there was a moment for conscience to strike them. The Democrats' position--they have raised a point of order. The Senator from Vermont stood up and raised a point of order and said they want to exclude homeschoolers from 529 plans. There are 1.8 million kids who are homeschooled right now.  To every kid who is being homeschooled right now, to every parent, to every mom who puts in the time--some dads but a lot of moms who put in the time day after day after day homeschooling their kids, what every Democrat is standing up to do right now is saying: We are going to discriminate against homeschoolers. We are going to cut you out. Why? Because the Democratic Party can't stand the audacity of a parent who would take it upon himself or herself to educate their child free of centralized control. So their point of order is to carve homeschoolers out of this.  Now, one of the provisions they want to carve out is a provision that says homeschooled students can pay from a 529 college savings account for tutoring. Every Senate Democrat is getting ready to vote against tutors for children at home.  Another provision they are objecting to that is going to be carved out says that parents can pay for 529 plans for books, for additional materials, can pay for a student in high school who is duly enrolled in community college, can pay for that out of their own money in a tax advantage plan. Do you know what the Democrats are saying? If you are a student signed up in a community college, we, the Democratic Party, object to you paying for that out of the tax advantage plan.  Let me tell you what is most striking, a provision the Democrats are arguing to strike provides that parents with a child with disabilities can pay for educational therapy from a 529 plan that is their own savings that they put together, and the Democrats are saying to the parents with kids with disabilities, no, you can't.  Let me ask my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, are you prepared to look into the eyes of a kid with disability and explain why you said you are cut out? Every other child in America has the ability to have their tuition paid for from these 529 plans, but children with disabilities being homeschooled, the Democrats--and not one, not two, every single Democrat--stand united. Why? Because they can't stand the They are angry at the  That is fine. If they are angry at the President, stand up and yell at the President, but don't take it out on kids who are homeschooled. Don't take it out on kids with disabilities. The Democrats have an opportunity to demonstrate they are not going to punish children with disabilities because of their partisan anger. We have right now a motion to waive this mean-spirited, vindictive point of order that discriminates against homeschoolers and carves out kids with disabilities.  I would ask my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle--there are going to be issues we disagree on, but the vote to allow parents of children with disabilities to spend their own funds in a tax-advantaged fund to provide for educational therapy for those kids with disabilities--that ought to be 100 to nothing. All of us should agree on that. We might disagree on other things, fine. The death tax, or as Democrats like to call it, the estate tax--we can disagree on that. But educating kids with disabilities--you are really standing up raising that objection?  I would ask my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle: Don't do that. Don't discriminate against the homeschoolers.  I yield the floor.

1228,topic-id,874,"Mr.President, as the jet fumes swirl around the Halls of Congress and Members get ready to head to the airport to get home for the holidays, I rise to remind my colleagues that there are still hundreds of thousands of people in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico who are still hurting from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and They will be spending Christmas not in their homes but in a hotel or with family and friends or in temporary housing.  All across these regions, there are houses, businesses, schools, churches, and community establishments that still need to be rebuilt. They are waiting, counting on our help. It is wrong. Indeed, it is maddening to those in the affected regions that the Senate is not taking up legislation today to give them what they need to continue to rebuild and recover.  In my home State, there is no doubting that Texas's gulf coast communities suffered tremendous losses in Hurricane Harvey, but the hurricane also brought out the best in We saw Texans standing together and lifting up each other, first through rescue and response and now as we come together and rebuild our communities. The Nation witnessed our iconic moments, from the thousands of Texans who went out on boats to save their neighbors, to Houstonians of all ages lining up to volunteer at disaster recovery centers, embodying the Texas can-do spirit.  Texas has worked diligently since August on cleanup and recovery efforts from Hurricane Harvey, but I am sorry to say that the U.Senate is now leaving town without delivering on its commitment to help Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico recover.  Congress has already passed two disaster relief bills in the wake of these hurricanes. In addition, Congress passed a bipartisan disaster relief tax bill that I was proud to offer. But there is still much more that needs to be done.  Just hours ago, our colleagues in the House passed a bill to further provide for emergency rebuilding efforts. This bill represents progress, but much more work needs to be done to make sure that it does enough, especially for Texas, which was promised by both this Congress and by the administration that Texas would be given everything we need to rebuild. Early estimates from the supplemental bill that passed the House are that Texas would be eligible for only a small percentage of the $81 billion in that legislation. That is unacceptable, and the Senate needs to fix it.  Texas experienced the worst flood event in U.history. Hurricane Harvey was unlike any other storm we have seen before in Texas--the number of people impacted, the scope. It brought 250 miles of devastation to our Texas gulf coast as winds obliterated whole communities and rain flooded out parts of Texas that have never flooded before.  Due to the level of damage the storm caused to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, Hurricane Harvey was the costliest disaster this year and may well prove the costliest natural disaster in U.history. According to the Governor of Texas, the damage to our State from the hurricane is well over $120 billion and could prove to be closer to $180 billion. Any bill to provide disaster funding brought to this floor should recognize the unprecedented level of damage wreaked upon the State and should provide the level of assistance necessary to help Texas rebuild.  I spoke this afternoon with Governor Greg Abbott, and he expressed serious concerns that the supplemental bill coming out of the House does not direct nearly enough resources to the State of Texas given the magnitude of the damage, the magnitude of the suffering. Disaster relief needs to focus where the suffering occurred and where the disaster occurred.  I am hopeful that when this body returns in 2 weeks, we will work together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the promises made to the State of Texas are fulfilled and that the resources are there to help our State rebuild. The emergency response is over, but recovery and rebuilding efforts go on. As we keep working to keep our promises, I remain determined to keep fighting to ensure that Texas has the Federal resources to which the State is entitled under Federal law.  The spirit of Texas is strong. Some weeks ago, I tweeted out a picture that I think captured some of that spirit. It was a picture of a man in his living room. The Sheetrock was torn down from all the walls--nothing but studs on the walls and no carpet. The flooring was taken up. There was no furniture. He had a lawn chair. He had an Igloo ice chest as a coffee table and a TV screen, and he was wearing a Houston Astros jersey and cheering as the Astros won the World The tweet simply said: ``This is why it matters.'' That is the spirit of We need to remember that spirit, and we need to make sure the disaster relief responds to the real damage and real suffering that Hurricane Harvey visited upon the State of  I look forward to working with my colleagues, hopefully from both sides of the aisle, to deliver on that commitment that Texans are owed.  I yield the floor.

504,topic-id,479,"Mr.President, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will keep over $700 million per year in Montanans' pockets. That is not a number that I calculated; that came right from the Montana Department of And that is just for the individuals in That $700 million will be moved from Washington, DC, back to the people of  I can tell you something: Hard-working Montanans could use a pay raise. In fact, in Montana, we have some of the lowest per capita wages in the Contrast that with what is going on in Washington, In fact, if you Google ``wealthiest counties in the U.S.A.''--I challenge you to do that. Take your smartphone and Google ``wealthiest counties in the U.S.A.'' and look at what you find. The top three wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington, In fact, 6 out of 10 of those counties are counties adjacent to Washington, Montanans don't need to send an additional $700 million of their money back to Washington, In fact, according to the Montana Department of Revenue, nearly 99 percent of Montanans will see a tax cut under the Tax Cuts and Jobs On average, Montanans will keep approximately $1,600 of their hard-earned money each year.  Moreover, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repeals once and for all ObamaCare's poverty tax--the so-called individual mandate. This tax has systematically penalized the low-income for not being able to afford health insurance. Frankly, repealing this tax is one of the most compassionate things we could do as part of this legislation.  Adding insult to injury, when you peel back what is going on with this poverty tax, 42 percent of those paying that poverty tax, that ObamaCare mandate tax, make less than $25,000 a year. In fact, 82 percent of the penalty payers paying this tax make less than $50,000 a year. Repealing this tax is the right thing to do.  At the end of the day, the question here is pretty simple: Who deserves more money? Who deserves more control? Is it right here in Washington, DC, or is it the American people? Is it the people of Montana? I think the answer to that question is pretty easy. I believe Montanans do. So I will be voting for hard-working Montana families so they can keep more of their own money. As we debate what we should do with the cash here in Washington, DC, whose money is it anyway? It came from the people of this country. It came from the people of I will be voting for Montana Main Street businesses, for the hard-working middle class of Montana so we can grow wages--some of the lowest in the Nation--and grow jobs. I will be voting to return some of Montanans' hard-earned money back to the people who sent it here in the first place.  Mr.President, I yield back my time.

802,topic-id,216,"Mr.President, this week, I have the distinct honor of recognizing the community of Glasgow for leading the way with their generosity during the holiday season. Earlier this month, members of the community successfully conducted their annual Block of Bucks program to help raise funds for local families to have warm clothing during the winter months.  This charitable effort brought together a broad collection of the community, including the Glasgow Soroptimists, student council leaders from Glasgow High School, members of the National Guard, the local Elks Club, a host of local businesses, and dozens of other volunteers. Through their focused actions, the community of Glasgow raised over $30,000 to provide more than 300 hundred children with winter clothing. If you have ever experienced winter along the Hi-Line in northeast Montana, you will know how important it is to have the proper gear. The generosity of neighbors in towns like Glasgow is something that we can all appreciate.  It is a Montana hallmark for neighbors to identify a need and then gather the people and resources to meet that need at a local level. Going into Christmas, I would like to offer a heartfelt thank you to the folks in Glasgow for giving their time and talents to help others by adding warmth to the holiday season.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8252.txt,2138,ROBERT MUELLER SMEAR CAMPAIGN,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
713,topic-id,246,"Mr.Speaker, I am so pleased to join Mr.Luetkemeyer in supporting his bill. I am so encouraged that this is a bipartisan bill.  Listening to the Members opposed, I am concerned that the bill is being highly mischaracterized. It occurred to me that when the Member opposed mentioned that 97 percent of banks would not be affected by this, that it automatically excludes 97 percent of banks from being affected by this.  Mr.Luetkemeyer doesn't pick a number and say big is bad. He says: Let's judge the bank by its behavior, not by the size of its balance sheet.  This is a rational, measured approach, and that is why it has drawn bipartisan support. It is focused on solving the problem, not driving regulatory burdens.  Let me explain that the SIFI designation is an arbitrary number, and it subjects banks with $50 billion or more in assets to the same standards as trillion-dollar globally important financial banks.  So a bank with $51 billion would be regulated the same way as JPMorgan Chase, for example.[[Page H10228]]  Even former Chair Barney Frank, as has been mentioned, seized the problem. Janet Yellen seized the problem.  People look at it and say: What can be a solution?  The Federal Reserve has seen a possible solution as judging the character of the business activity. Mr.Luetkemeyer's bill firmly addresses that.  A simple asset threshold captures numerous banks that are widely perceived to be no threat to financial stability. It also distorts growth decisions.

248,topic-id,465,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from I thank him for his leadership on this issue and shining a light on this very important issue tonight.  Mr.Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about the promise of America: that[[Page H10339]]every person living in this country, a country that we say is the greatest country in the world, where every person can have an opportunity, where every person can have a right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the pursuit of justice.  The promise of America, though, relies on the police officer who walks his beat, come rain or shine. Mr.Speaker, either we enforce our laws, or, if we do not, they are just words on a piece of paper. The promise of America is fulfilled every time a person receives a fair trial. For you see, without a fair-minded search for the truth, we have no society. Or, Mr.Speaker, put it another way, the truth will, indeed, set us free.  The special counsel is a decorated veteran. You have heard my colleague say it, a registered Republican appointed by a Republican President, President I have personally met Mr.After serving 27 years in law enforcement, working very closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I know him to be a person of honor and integrity.  Mr.Mueller has been praised for his integrity by every Republican leader. You see, he is, Mr.Speaker, a man searching for the truth, and the truth does matter. Without truth, life becomes death, liberty becomes slavery, and the pursuit of happiness becomes impossible.  If a President can shut down an investigation into his activities and deny our right to the truth, then the promise of the America that we love to celebrate is broken. Over the past year, our institutions--law enforcement, the judiciary--have come under daily assault, so persistent, so relentless, that we, on occasion, have tuned it out or brushed it aside. But these assaults, Mr.Speaker, undermine what is essential to our country and our society.  If President Trump chooses to fire the special counsel or otherwise interfere with the legal and appropriate investigation into himself and his staff, it would be a deliberate act to dismantle the fundamental institutions that preserve American democracy and liberty.  Mr.Speaker, we cannot allow that, and I hope that my Republican colleagues will remember why they came to Congress in the first place. You see, Mr.Speaker, as Members of Congress, we are truth seekers, and we know that the special counsel will go only where the evidence leads him. That is the man President Bush appointed, and that is the same person leading this investigation at this very time.  Mr.Speaker, we must let the special counsel finish his work. Failure to do so leaves us with only one question: What is the administration afraid of?

Here, at Christmas, we think of the children first, but the children are not put first in this underlying bill. The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is barely left on life support.  There are children out there right now, some with dreaded diseases or disabilities, and their access to a family physician is not assured because this Congress has not acted on the Children's Health Insurance Instead of Christmas cards, they are about to get cancellation notices.[[Page H10352]]  And there are children who were brought here to America, through no fault of their own, without a visa.

And we, in Congress, have our own responsibility. It is a responsibility to respond to their passionate pleas.

156,topic-id,167,"Mr.Speaker, between tweets, Trump apparently had time to take those calls from his rich friends that kept asking for more. Not even this lapdog Republican Congress initially did enough to satisfy the Trump family and their billionaire buddies.  Instead of adjusting the differences between the House and the Senate, Republican conferees, last week, secretly concocted even more benefits for them. Those real estate moguls, like Trump, who had already been granted preferential tax treatment, can now take advantage of an entirely new loophole that was not in either of the previous bills.  Just in case their endless loopholes left some donor behind, the Republicans have provided a new, across-the-board tax cut for billionaires. It is working families who will pay to put the platinum tinsel on this Christmas tree for the elite.  This is not tax reform. It is a reward for the privileged.

But is he willing to send one official--even one--to come before any committee of this Congress and respond to questions about the many wrongs that are contained in this bill? Of course the answer is absolutely no.  What about the businesses across America that are impacted by this bill?

519,topic-id,1936,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the tax bill.  I am disappointed. You see, I am one of the many Americans who believe that we need to reform our Tax Code to benefit middle-class families. I also believe that we need to make those reforms in a commonsense, responsible way. Sadly, that is not the approach that was taken with this legislation.  From the very beginning of this effort, I have been willing to partner with Republicans or Democrats and with President Trump and his team. In fact, when President Trump unveiled his tax priorities in my home State of Indiana, I traveled with him on Air Force I wanted him to know that I was listening to his priorities and that I agreed with his stated goals of supporting the middle class and keeping jobs right here in I also wanted Hoosiers to know that I was committed to working with the President to reform our Tax Code in a way that helped Hoosier families and businesses.  After that trip with the President and in every meeting with the administration, including two meetings at the White House, my attending Vice President Pence's speech in Anderson, IN, and in multiple discussions with top administration officials, I left feeling optimistic that we could work together to reform our Tax Code to achieve those goals we had agreed upon. I expected a proposal that was focused on cutting taxes for middle-class families. I expected a proposal that would help keep jobs in America and take away tax incentives from corporations that flagrantly outsource jobs to foreign competitors in foreign countries. Unfortunately, that is not the bill that the majority leader pushed through the Senate, nor is it the final bill that he and the Speaker of the House agreed upon.  The reasons I oppose this bill are plain and simple, clear, and make common sense. Instead of providing a tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the middle class, this bill cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans while it raises taxes on a majority of families who will be making less than $75,000 in the coming years. Instead of closing tax loopholes like the shameful one that allows Wall Street hedge fund managers to pay a lower tax rate than a Hoosier firefighter, than a Hoosier teacher, than a Hoosier policeman, or a Hoosier steel worker--imagine a hedge fund manager's tax rate being lower than that man's or woman's who is fighting a fire in Evansville this year. This bill preserves these giveaways. Think of that. It is outrageous.  Instead of protecting American jobs by adopting provisions from my End Outsourcing Act--an effort that President Trump has told me on numerous occasions that he is all-in on and supports--this tax bill does zero to claw back tax breaks and incentives awarded to corporations that later decide to outsource American jobs. It also retains loopholes that allow corporations like Rexnord and Carrier to continue deducting the moving expenses when they ship those American jobs to other countries. Imagine that. There is a tax deduction for moving expenses to ship American jobs to other countries. They left it alone.  Perhaps, there is no better example of an issue on which the President and I agree than preventing the outsourcing of American jobs. Right now in my home State of Indiana, nine companies have outsourced or will outsource the jobs of 2,200 This is impacting moms and dads, sisters and brothers, wives and husbands, our neighbors, and our friends. This is our opportunity to stand up for American workers and make it clear that if corporations want a lower tax rate or special tax deductions, if they want the American taxpayer to invest in them, then, they must invest in American workers. That is the conversation I had with the President when we talked about our shared goals for tax reform, and these are the issues where I know there is common ground.  Gene Sperling, formerly the chief economic adviser to two different Presidents recently, wrote:       If there is one thing the Republican international tax bill      was advertised to accomplish, it was that it would favor      locating jobs and profits in the United It does just      the opposite--expanding the degree our tax system tilts the      playing field against American taxpayers and American      workers.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article by Gene Sperling, recently published in The Atlantic, titled ``How the Tax Plan Will Send Jobs Overseas.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Atlantic, 8, 2017]                How the Tax Plan Will Send Jobs Overseas   companies are going to be able to save a ton of money by locating                             factories abroad                         (By Gene Sperling)       Despite Donald Trump's ``America first'' rhetoric, many      suspected that the tax plan he would support would actually      increase the incentives for U.multinationals to move both      profits and operations overseas. I wrote about this      inevitability a few weeks ago, before the details of the      Trump-GOP tax plan emerged.       Now that the bill is advancing, it's clear that things      aren't as bad as many feared. They're worse.       As discussed in the previous piece, Trump administration      economic officials argue that by lowering the corporate tax      rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and moving to what is      called a territorial system--mainly, companies pay taxes on      foreign earnings only to the foreign nation where those      profits are booked and never owe anything to the U.no      matter how low the foreign nation's tax rate is--would lead      to more jobs and profits staying in or coming back to the      United       Yet, it is clear that a territorial system could have just      the opposite impact: It could give a permanent preference to      foreign income and lead companies to shift more profits to      tax havens knowing that they could permanently avoid      virtually all taxation on such profits. One crucial safeguard      against that perverse impact is to apply a strong minimum tax      on the profits of U.multinationals in each country (a      ``country-by-country'' minimum tax). If a U.company had to      pay a minimum tax of, let's say, 19 percent (as President      Obama had proposed), even if they engaged in complex tax      planning to book $100 million in profits in zero-tax Bermuda,      they would have to pay $19 million in U.taxes to ensure      the 19 percent minimum tax was enforced. Under such a      country-by-country minimum tax, you can run, you can shift      profits to tax havens, but you cannot hide from paying a 19      percent minimum no matter where you are. Under this type of      true minimum tax on foreign earnings, U.multinationals      would have little incentive to engage in the ongoing race to      the bottom.       As discussed in my previous Atlantic piece, the GOP plan      was rumored to use only a 10 percent minimum tax, and to make      it worse, would make the minimum tax determination based on      the average of a company's total global profits. What was      problematic about this design was that it not only encouraged      companies to move profits to tax havens, but it actually      encouraged them to simultaneously move jobs and operations      such as manufacturing to industrialized countries that had      typical tax rates and to shift more profits to tax havens.      Why? Because if you had $100 million of profits in Bermuda      facing no tax, you might have still had to pay $10 million in      U.taxes to meet the new global minimum tax. But if you      moved a factory to Germany that made $100 million and paid 20      percent in taxes there, you could still pay zero on your      profits in Bermuda because the average taxes paid on your      global profits (from both Bermuda and Germany) would be the      global minimum rate of 10 percent. This perverse design means      the more a U.multinational shifts jobs and operations to      industrialized nations with similar tax rates to the U.S.,      the more it can get away with shifting more and more profits      to tax havens.       So how did it look in the fine print? As several tax      experts including the Tax Policy Center's Steve Rosenthal,      Brooklyn Law School's Rebecca Kysar, and Reed College's      Kimberly Clausing have written, it is even worse than      anticipated on at least two additional grounds. First, it      turns out that the Republican idea of a minimum tax is that      it only taxes what you make over what they think is a      ``routine'' profit, deemed to be 10 percent in the Senate      bill, on ``tangible'' investments (think factories and      equipment, including for manufacturing). As Rosenthal notes,      ``because `routine' returns are not subject to U.tax, this      definition of `routine' returns could give U.firms a      perverse incentive to shift more tangible assets to lower-     taxed overseas locations.'' That means, under the GOP bills,      if you shift less profitable operations to a tax haven you      would pay zero taxes on those operations as long as you are      only making 10 percent a year--whether that is $10 million or      $100 million--while you would pay 20 percent if the      operations were located in the United So, the      ``minimum'' tax is really a much lower rate than 10 percent,      and would essentially be an invisible, non-existent tax      except on highly profitable operations and income from      intangibles.       Second, this limitation to only excess profits encourages      even more shifting of operations and jobs overseas through      complex efforts to blend different income streams.[[Page S8106]]     How? Profits from ``intangibles'' like patents do not receive      the 10 percent exemption for ``routine'' returns, so the      minimum tax is seemingly designed to at least capture those      well-known cases where major technology companies shift      intangibles to low-tax nations and book their profits there.      If a company does that and earns extraordinary profits, a      global minimum tax would capture some piece of that. But      again, here is where the GOP bill's global ``averaging''      actually creates the incentives to move jobs and operations      overseas.       Let's say a U.multinational has highly profitable      intangibles located in a tax haven that earn $50 million in      income without any tangible investment. If the company has no      other foreign profits or operations, then that income would      face a mere $5 million in U.taxes from the 10 percent      minimum tax under the GOP plan. But if the company decides to      build a new $1 billion factory overseas that earns profits of      only 5 percent ($50 million) from the factory, the company      will not pay a penny in U.taxes on its income from the      factory or the intangibles. Why? Because when you add the      income together, the $50 million from the intangibles plus      the $50 million from the new factory, it equals the      ``routine'' profit of 10 percent on the $1 billion of new      tangible investment, which will allow it to completely avoid      paying taxes on any of the above mentioned profits.       This shows how deeply the tax plan fails when it comes to      incentives to shift profits and operations overseas and to      curtail the obsession of major multinational companies with      international tax arbitrage that has nothing to do with      innovation, productivity or job creation. Indeed, the ability      to blend income from intangibles and routine profits, and      from investment in higher tax nations with tax havens with      zero taxes, leads to a worst of all worlds scenario: an even      greater corporate focus on international tax minimization      through a careful mixture of shifting profits and operations      overseas.       If there was one thing the GOP international tax bill was      advertised to accomplish, it was that it would favor locating      jobs and profits in the United It does just the      opposite--expanding the degree our tax system tilts the      playing field against American taxpayers and American      workers.

520,topic-id,473,"Mr.President, the majority leader's bill before us today continues the same broken tax system that incentivizes companies to move jobs to foreign countries, hurting more American communities and undercutting thousands of working American families.  In Indiana, we know there is no such thing as a free lunch. In the Hoosier State, we work hard and we expect everyone else to pay their fair share. The tax bill we are considering cuts taxes for corporations and the wealthy by asking some middle-class families to pay more and by making healthcare more expensive for millions and millions of  According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, if we account for budget gimmicks, the cost of this bill could reach $2.2 trillion--not billion but trillion dollars.  Here is what that means. This means our kids' and our grandkids' paychecks, the hard-earned money they make in the years ahead, will be sent to China to pay for tax cuts that will be given today to the wealthiest people in Our kids and our grandkids will be paying the bill for this tax cut that puts money in the pockets of the very, very wealthy. That is almost beyond belief.  We need tax reform that actually benefits Hoosiers who go to work in the dark and come home in the dark. These are the folks that I run into at church or who stop by my office or I see at the gas station or at the diner. They look me in the eye, and they tell me they are working hard to make a decent living, to pay the bills, to raise their families, and to have a shot at retiring with dignity. They are not looking for any handouts. They simply want a good-paying job and a fair shake. Unfortunately, this bill is a significant missed opportunity to provide relief to middle-class families and to protect American jobs.  From the very, very beginning of this debate, I have engaged in a good faith effort to exchange ideas and priorities for what we would like this tax bill to look like and to work together in a bipartisan manner. I worked to improve the bill that my colleagues have rushed through in a largely closed and partisan process. That includes my support for Senator Rubio's effort to expand the child tax credit for hard-working families, for which I give him much credit.  Our country is stronger when we work together and when we pass legislation that focuses on the middle class and on regular families and that leaves a better future for all our children. Sadly, that is not what this bill would do. This bill raises taxes on many middle-class families, makes healthcare more expensive, does not address outsourcing, and significantly increases our national debt.  I yield the floor.

1092,topic-id,676,"Mr.President, at some point this evening, we expect the House of Representatives to send the Senate a bill that would keep the Federal Government open for another few weeks before our heading home for For most families, the holidays are an opportunity to take a break away from our busy lives and enjoy time with the people we love. It is safe to say, however, that will not be the case for tens of thousands of American families who have lost a loved one this year due to a drug overdose.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released two important new reports this week. First, they found that life expectancy decreased in the United States for the second year in a row. Second, the likely cause of that decrease in 2016 is that over 63,000 people died of drug overdoses. That is more than 144 deaths per day, and it is a 21-percent increase from 2015.  This is a crisis. People are dying in communities across this country every single day. Congress must do much more to address this scourge. Here in Washington, we have talked at length about the massive size and scope of the problem.  Last year, we passed bipartisan legislation that was signed into law and is providing our local communities with more tools to fight the epidemic, and we approved initial funding to begin to support these and other efforts.  I was proud to help bring nearly $11 million of that funding to Earlier this fall, the President rightly declared the opioid abuse epidemic to be a nationwide public health emergency. On the frontlines, in places like my home State of Indiana, however, the battle is raging. Despite a unified response, there is more work to do.  Our Governor, Governor Holcomb, has made the fight against opioid abuse the priority it needs to be. He and his administration are working closely with local communities to provide resources and support. Together, we have engaged our healthcare providers--both public and private--the business community, our educators, and the clergy who are all committed to this cause. Yet the message I continue to hear from people on the ground is, we need more resources and we need to expand treatment capabilities as soon as possible.  We all know this is not a partisan issue. Over the last few years, I have been honored to work with seven of my Republican colleagues to introduce seven bills and amendments that address everything from prescribing practices to the shortage of addiction treatment professionals, and many of these ideas have already been signed into law.  I am partnering with my State's Republican Governor to make sure we do everything in our power to help those who are battling with addiction, but it is not enough unless we provide our communities with the resources they are asking for and they need.  This is the time of year that many Americans reflect on the year that has passed and identify the priorities in the years to come. In Congress, we need to do the same. More than 63,000 Americans died last year from opioid abuse. Those are 63,000 moms and dads, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters who are not with us this year. We must make this issue a priority.  I hope Congress will demonstrate to the American people that fighting the opioid epidemic is a priority. One way[[Page S8231]]to do that is to include meaningful resources in the bill to fund our Federal Government and key programs when we deal with this again before January 19 of next year.  I implore my colleagues to make this a priority, to provide the robust and meaningful funding our communities need to seriously address this problem. We are in the midst of a crisis. We must do more in 2018. We have families all across our Nation with broken hearts tonight for the ones they love and the ones they miss. Let's make sure there are no more in 2018; that this ends today.

641,topic-id,705,"Mr.President, I rise today to bring to this body's attention and to the attention of all Americans what can best be characterized as a modern-day slave trade. It is an outrage that is hard to fathom but that still exists today.  I was recently speaking to a group of pastors from my home State of Illinois who do wonderful work advocating on behalf of human rights and human dignity. One of them, Walter Johnson of the Greater Institutional Church in Chicago, shared his frustration that abuses and atrocities being inflicted upon migrants and refugees in Libya have received not nearly enough attention or outrage in the American public, government, or in the press. I couldn't agree more. That is why I have come to the Senate floor today to speak on this alarming human rights crisis.  Every American should be appalled by chilling images of modern-day slave auctions. Earlier this month in an investigative piece, CNN released video of an auction taking place. It was not an auction for a piece of art or another item one might bid on but an auction for human beings--human beings sold for the equivalent of $400.  The reports were a wake-up call for the world about the gravity of this situation in North Africa as migrants fleeing danger and economic hardship face new horrors on their journey to seek a better future. The wars in the Middle East and instability in North Africa have upended huge swaths of the region, displacing thousands of vulnerable men, women, and children. Thousands of people fleeing Africa and the Middle East make their way through Libya, hoping to cross the Unfortunately, many of them face horrifying human rights abuses and danger along the way.  Because of Libya's limited capacity to govern, its restrictive policies against migrants, and its inability or refusal to accommodate the migrants, conditions are ripe for exploitation and abuse in their detention centers. Particularly horrifying have been reports from survivors about the exploitation at the hands of smugglers who are openly engaging in human slavery, preying on the most vulnerable, who have surrendered everything for a shot at the future. Migrants have been subjected to horrible human rights abuses in Libya over the past few years, including forced labor, torture, and sexual violence.  The administration must put this issue front and center when we engage with Libyan officials and demand accountability and progress. Sadly, it appears the administration missed such an opportunity to address this issue during Prime Minister Fayiz al-Saraj's visit to Washington earlier this month.  The United Nations-backed Government of National Accord in Tripoli, however, has taken an important step in acknowledging these abuses and is requesting international support. The European Union and African Union evacuation plan to repatriate the detained migrants that was agreed upon in the Ivory Coast is a move in the right direction.  In 2016, the United States provided emergency funding for the International Organization for Migration--the IOM--to help shut down migrant detentions centers in While the EU rightly picked up the majority of funding to repatriate migrants, the United States should once again consider another emergency infusion to the IOM to help accelerate the closure of these facilities in addition to the $31 million in foreign operations funding for Libya that the administration requested this year.  Additionally, we have a former American Ambassador, William Lacy Swing, who is the Director General of the International Organization for He is on the frontlines of this fight and stands ready to work with Libyan authorities, the European Union, and African Union countries so that he can help address this crisis. The United States can play an important role in supporting Director General Swing and other international efforts to protect these migrants from exploitation and abuse.  Human rights are essential to the functioning and well-being of our global community, and that community is threatened when migrants fleeing persecution are forced into inhumane, exploitative conditions and slavery. Given this country's own dark history with slavery, we cannot afford to remain silent in the face of such suffering. We must stand together with[[Page S8163]]the help of the United Nations and other international partners to eradicate slavery and the conditions that precipitate it.  Thank you.  I yield back.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8162.txt,2123,DEFICITS,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

381,topic-id,783,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding time to me, the chairman of Financial Services, Mr.I appreciate his leadership and stewardship on our committee.  Mr.Speaker, I want to get into the bill in a second, but I can't let the Dominican Sisters reference go.  It is not the Dominican Sisters who are using proxy advisers. It is the largest financial investors in the world that are using these advisers, which we are going to get into in a little bit.  And if you want to talk about sisters, I will talk about the Little Sisters of the Poor, who have been ravaged by ObamaCare because they can't practice their faith, if you want to talk about sisters. We are not going to go there today.  Mr.Speaker, we are in a situation where, my friends, if you listen to the debate, you might say, ``Well, Republicans are asking for a little more regulation in the proxy advisory space,'' and Democrats, miraculously, are saying, ``We don't want any regulation.''  Well, our concern is that you have consolidated power in two companies that control 97 percent of the industry, and some have made the claim and the allegation that there might be political motivations behind both--or at least one--of these massive proxy advisory firms, because Glass Lewis is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension fund, and they might have a political agenda that might affect the recommendations that have a massive impact on American corporate governance. Maybe that could be the distinction between the two parties in today's debate.  Mr.Speaker, we have covered this quite a bit, but I want to go into it again. The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.economy is incredibly important. It is important stuff.  These firms counsel pension plans and mutual funds and institutional investors on how to vote their shares. No one is trying to get rid of proxy advisory firms. We think they are a good thing, but we think they should have a little bit of regulation and a little bit of oversight.  I think it is troubling, when you look at the share of institutional ownership, in 1987, it was 46 percent. Today, that has grown to 75 percent, meaning that institutional investors control billions of shares.  There was a recent study that was done by Stanford that says that asset managers with $100 billion or more under their control only make 10 percent of the decisions on these proxy issues, meaning they outsource 90 percent of the decisions to one of two firms, consolidating great power in these proxy advisory firms.  This was pointed out before as well, but, again, two firms, 97 percent of the market share, writing analysis reports, voting recommendations that affect the fundamentals of corporate governance, mergers, acquisitions, approval of corporate directors, and shareholder proposals.  What is of greatest concern is that these firms are not free of conflicts of interest. For example, in addition to providing recommendations to institutional investors about how to vote, proxy advisory firms may advise companies about corporate governance issues, rate companies on corporate governance, help companies improve those ratings, and advise proponents about how to frame a proposal to get the most votes. They are playing every side of the issue. They are getting every dollar from anybody who cares about the corporate governance space. They play everybody. And if you want access, you pay.  I am going to give you an example in just a little bit of one of the hundreds of letters that I have received on this issue. But before I do that, I think it is important to say: What are we asking for? What is the radical idea that we brought to the floor today, which, by the way, had six Democrats' support?  Mr.Scott commented about his support as well, and I know he had an issue about the cost that this would have on proxy advisory firms; but the CBO, which I rarely quote, did a study on this and said the cost to proxy advisory firms of this bill is minimal, if[[Page H10323]]anything. I think his concern might be misplaced.  But what are we asking to do here? We are asking for accountability. We are asking for transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory space. By doing that, we will improve corporate governance, and, in the end, we are going to protect investors.  Specifically, again, this bipartisan bill will ensure that proxy advisory firms are registered with the They will disclose potential conflicts of interest. They will maintain a code of ethics and make publicly available their methodologies for formulating their proxy recommendations.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Holding).

31,topic-id,1117,"Madam President, years ago, a man with a famous name aspired to be President of the United Critics dismissed this idea as ridiculous. One of the leading political columnists of the day wrote that the man's initials stood for ``Feather Duster Roosevelt, a lightweight''--nothing to him.  Al Franken's decision to run for a seat in this Senate from Minnesota was met in many quarters with the same sort of mockery.  Many people said: He is a comedian. He doesn't have the knowledge or the skill or the patience or the vision to be a lawmaker. You can't joke your way into the  The pundits were wrong about He was one of our greatest Presidents during one of our darkest hours.  Madam President, the doubters were wrong about Al Franken too. Al Franken has been my friend, my personal friend, for more than two decades. For the last 7-plus years, he has been my colleague in the He has been a credit to the Senate, a passionate advocate for his home State of Minnesota, a defender of our Constitution, and a determined fighter for justice. He became a better Senator every year. His work in the Senate has made life for millions of people better in Minnesota and far beyond. He and his dedicated staff can take pride in that fact. Al Franken has been and I am sure will continue to be an effective champion for those whose daily struggles too often go unnoticed and unaddressed in the places of power.  During his time in the Senate, Al Franken has always been there when his Senate colleagues asked for help. He was one of the most sought-after voices in our party. He never failed to pack a bag, catch a plane, and spend another night away from his family to help each and every one of us.  Twenty years ago, when I first met him, he was this well known, successful comedian on ``Saturday Night Live'' who happened to play the role of a fellow named Paul Simon, a Senator from Illinois who was my predecessor. Paul Simon invited Al Franken to come to Makanda, It is not even close to He agreed on a Sunday afternoon to be there on behalf of my campaign, although we had never met, and he came. He limped onto Paul Simon's front porch, saying: ``I twisted my ankle playing squash.'' I thought it was another perfect example of a reason he could have used to avoid the invitation, but he came anyway. We had a great afternoon and a terrific time with Paul Simon of ``Saturday Night Live'' and the real Paul Simon and a senatorial candidate who was grateful for Al Franken's presence that day.  When people ask me to describe my politics, I say that I follow the gospel of By that, I mean I try to emulate three of my greatest political heroes, who happen to share that name.  The first Senator, Paul Douglas of Illinois, was a champion of honesty, economic justice, and civil rights, and the man for whom I had the good fortune of interning when I was a college student; Paul Simon, whom I just mentioned, my predecessor from Illinois, who was one of the smartest, most decent men I have ever met in any walk of life; and Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who has received many deserved tributes today. Paul Wellstone was the champion of farmers, hotel maids, grocery clerks, cafeteria workers, and everyone who worked hard and struggled for dignity and enough money just to pay the bills.  Paul Wellstone, as we have heard from both Senator Klobuchar and from Al Franken himself, is the man Al Franken chose to emulate in public life. He stated Paul Wellstone's famous quote: ``We all do better when we all do better.'' It is a simple statement, a profound truth, and it has been the guiding light for Al Franken's Senate career.  Senator Wellstone died 15 years ago in a tragic plane crash. On the 10th anniversary of that terrible loss, Senator Franken wrote an essay about Paul Wellstone's legacy for The Atlantic magazine. I want to read a short section from that essay.  Senator Franken wrote:       One of Paul's most famous quotes is this: ``Politics is not      about power. Politics is not about money. Politics is not      about winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the      improvement of people's lives.''       That quote is often used to criticize those on the other      side who seem to forget the human consequences of their      political agenda. But progressives should keep it in mind, as      well.       The big fights--war and peace, justice and liberty--are      important. But there aren't any small fights. And where Paul      made the biggest impact--where his work resulted in the      greatest improvement of people's lives--was on issues that      don't usually lead anyone's stump speech: mental health,      domestic violence, homelessness among veterans.  When future historians look back at the legacy of Senator Al Franken, I believe they will say: Here is a man who loved his State and his country, who worked hard to be a good Senator, and who never hesitated to take up an important issue, large or small.  Al Franken and I served together on the Senate Judiciary Over the years, I have watched him mature into one of the best, most insightful questioners on that committee. His questioning of Supreme Court Nominee Gorsuch, now Supreme Court Justice Gorsuch, helped to expose the Justice's troubling record of ruling against workers and families.  It was a story about a truckdriver who deserted his position on the roadway, was freezing in the middle of the night, who finally got his day in court, and the decision by Judge Gorsuch at the time, in my opinion and Al's opinion, did not serve justice. Many of us raised that issue; no one raised it more effectively than Al  His probing questioning also exposed Attorney General Sessions for misleading America about his meetings with Russians during the 2016 Presidential campaign.  He has been equally effective on the HELP His questioning of the future Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, showed her to be unfamiliar with some of the most basic and important debates in education policy and clearly exposed the fact that she was unready to serve as our Nation's leader at the Department of  I guess some people seek elected office to make a name for themselves, but Al Franken didn't need to be a Senator to achieve that. He already had a well-known name as an entertainer, radio host, and best-selling author before he entered politics. He and his wife Franni have a good life, two great kids, and wonderful grandchildren who followed.

When it came down to it, Al Franken wanted to do more than just entertain and be well known; he wanted to make a difference in the lives of others. More than anyone, as he said this morning, his wife Franni inspired him. As he explained in his book, her family wasn't as lucky as a lot of us. Her dad died when she was a young baby girl.

268,topic-id,1786,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague from We have been engaged in this battle of immigration reform for years. He is a worthy ally, thoughtful, and always thinking of a solution. I thank him for his continuing commitment to this cause.  In the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln got so frustrated with General McClellan that he sent him a message. He couldn't get him to attack. He wouldn't do anything.  He asked: General McClellan, if you are not going to use your Army, can I use it? Can I borrow your Army?[[Page S8219]]  So I would like to ask the leaders of the House and Senate: If you are not going to use your Congress, can I borrow it for a minute? Can we fill up this empty Chamber and actually have a real debate over a real bill to solve a real problem?  I think that might be a worthy thing for us to do. In fact, I think that is what we are paid to do; isn't it? Didn't we swear to uphold this Constitution? Didn't we take this historic job on with the goal of making America a better place?  On September 5, President Trump, along with Attorney General Sessions, eliminated the DACA This was a program that gave to almost 800,000 young people--brought to the United States when they were little kids--a chance to go to school, to work, to have futures in this country. They had to go through criminal background checks, turn over all of their information, and pay their taxes--all of the above. Then, for 2 years, they could operate in They were not citizens, but they were legally in On September 5, President Trump and Attorney General Sessions said: It is over--as of March 5, 2018, no more.  Then the President said: I challenge you, Do something about it. Pass a law.  That was almost 4 months ago. What have we done in 4 months to address this problem that affects the lives of 800,000 DACA-protected young people? We are not using this General McClellan was not using the Isn't it time that we do something? Wouldn't the American people be so pleasantly surprised if we did something on a bipartisan basis that solved a problem in America?  I know my Republican colleagues are euphoric over their tax bill. Two out of three Americans are not. I am not. I will put it aside for a minute. They spent a lot of time. They passed it. So be it. They did it on a strictly partisan basis. They had a right under the Senate rules to do it that way, and they did it that way. This cannot be done on a strictly partisan basis. You cannot fix the immigration system unless you engage both political parties in the solution.  I am lucky. I care about this. I also found some Republican Senators who care just as much. Jeff Flake of Arizona announced his retirement. I am sorry to see him go because he is a good person of good values. He stepped up and cosponsored the Dream Act that we are talking about here. I didn't even have to call him on the phone. I thanked him, and he said: It is the right thing to do. Lindsey Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, was my cosponsor. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska stepped up and said: It is the right thing to do for these young people, to give them an opportunity to earn their way into legal status, to earn their way to citizenship.  I thank them for that. We need eight more. If we get 8 more, we will have 12 Republicans out of 52. With eight more, we are ready. We are ready to put 60 votes up when they call the roll. With 60 votes in the Senate, you can get things done.  What has happened? What opportunities have we had in the almost 4 months since the President eliminated this program? None--not one.  Senator McConnell said to Senator Flake when his vote on the tax bill was in doubt: I promise you that we will bring this up in January--this coming  I can tell you that I read the promise very closely, and there are a lot of contingencies on there. I hope that Senator McConnell is going to give us our chance early in January to find out if we can come up with a bipartisan solution to this problem.  If you think there aren't other Republicans who support this, 34 Republicans in the House of Representatives sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and wrote: Pass the Dreamer legislation this year--34 So we are not alone. They are not the only ones.  Yesterday, 11 Governors--11 of them, Republicans and Democrats--sent a letter to Congress, calling on us to do this. The letter was signed by the Democratic Governors from Minnesota, Montana, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina and by the Republican Governors from Nevada, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Utah, and by Alaska's Independent  We are hearing from those in the business community. They want this done. They have seen these They have seen these young people. They believe in them, and they want us to do something to help them. We have heard it from the labor organizations, and we have heard it from the faith organizations.  Across the board, 76 percent of the American people support what we are trying to do here--76 percent. What issues get 76 percent? The flag? I will bet you it gets even more, but not many others get 76 percent approval, including 61 percent of the Trump voters. They think it is the right thing to do. Do you know why? Because many of these people have met the When you come to know them and hear their stories, you come to the conclusion--at least I do--that, for goodness' sake, these are extraordinary young people. Somehow or another, they have survived and have even flourished in a country that doesn't recognize them as legal. They went to our schools. They pledged allegiance to our flag. They sang the national anthem. That is the country they know.  Let me tell you about one before I turn the floor over to my colleague from This young lady's name is Miriam She is the 105th Dreamer whose story I have told on the floor.  When she was 6 years old, her family brought her to the United States from Mexico, and she grew up near Los She was a good student and a good athlete. In high school she played softball and golf. She was a member of the bible club, the chemistry club, and the reading club. She was an active volunteer in her community, including assistant teaching at the local elementary school. She was the valedictorian of her high school class. She was accepted at She majored in anthropology and minored in classical civilization.  Let me give a postscript here. If you are undocumented and go to college in America, you get no Federal assistance--no Pell grant, no Federal loan. You have to earn the money. You have to work jobs to do it. She did. She held down the necessary jobs and commuted to school from her parents' home by taking public transportation for 2 hours each way on every schoolday.  She was involved in student groups, mentored students at Van Nuys High School, and encouraged them to go to college. She continued to excel academically. She made the dean's honor roll and was awarded a certificate for her research at Today, she is assisting students in low-income neighborhoods and schools.  After graduation, she went to work with Teach For Do you know what that means? It means taking a job that pays hardly anything to teach in one of the most challenging schools in She did it. She taught seventh- and eighth-grade students in L.She teaches five classes for students who are having trouble with math and reading, and she gives one-on-one tutoring.  She is involved in the school's parents committee and tries to get the parents of these kids who need their helping hands to excel as well. She is a full-time graduate student at Loyola Marymount University, where she is pursuing a master's degree in education.  I am going to read her letter and then turn over the floor.       Every day for [my] first two months [as a teacher] my      students would ask me if I would be returning the next day,      week, and month, and I would reassure them that I was there      to stay. Eventually, they began to trust me and believe that      I was there to support them. . . . Now students believe that      I am there for them and truly care about helping and      preparing [them] to succeed academically. My students have      made huge improvements academically, [and] I am particularly      proud of how hard they all work. After hearing about the fate      of DACA--  She is talking about President Trump abolishing DACA--     my students were worried that they would be losing me. I      continue to reassure them that I am not going anywhere      anytime soon and will fight to be able to see them finish      middle school.  What is going to happen to her if we don't do what we are supposed to do--if we don't use this Senate and that House to solve this problem? What is going to happen to her and her students? Are we so busy? Do you notice it on the floor? Are we so busy that we[[Page S8220]]can't take up a piece of legislation here, debate it, and pass it today?  Before the end of the day, we are going to pass a measure to keep the government open and functioning for about 3 or 4 weeks. It is something that may pass the We will find out later this afternoon. I am troubled by it. It doesn't have one word in it to deal with this challenge, and we have known for 4 months that it was coming and that we had to do it.  I am going to be voting no on that, and it is not because of the merits of the continuing resolution. Until we address this issue and take the time to use the Senate and use the House to solve this problem, I am not going to be standing here and saying: I am going home for I don't know what is going to happen to I don't know what is going to happen to 800,000 others--get back to you later.

It turns out that in 2027, 83 percent of the tax breaks in this bill go to the top 1 percent of wage earners in Boy, how can you sit down and write a tax bill that is so lopsided for the wealthiest people in America? You had to have said to the staff first: Find out what taxes are left that the wealthy might pay and get rid of them--reduce them right and left. And they did.  Imagine that that is your starting point for Tax Code reform in America--that you are ignoring working families and the reality of the life they lead, you are ignoring small and medium-sized businesses, and you are focusing on the wealthiest people in America and the biggest corporations.  Do you know what I found in Illinois? When you travel around my State and meet the business leaders and ask them point-blank: Tell me about Federal taxes, the biggest corporations never complain because the Tax Code is loaded with escape hatches for the biggest and wealthiest corporations and individuals. It is small and medium-sized businesses that pay the most taxes. They are the ones that should have been the biggest beneficiaries on the bill. Secondly, there are the working families. People who are struggling paycheck to paycheck, who can't save money for their kids' future, are worried about their kids' student loans. Wouldn't it have been great if the Tax Code reform really focused on them instead of on the wealthiest people in America?  It is a stereotype, I know, that the Republicans worry about the rich instead of the working folks, but when you look at this bill, sadly, that is the reality.  Here is the good news, if there is any good news in that terrible story I just recounted. The American people get it. They understand it. How in the world[[Page S8125]]could you write a bill and call it tax reform and tax cuts, and have two-thirds of America hate it instantly? They did it. You put together a bill, which, instinctively, the American people knew was a bad deal for them. And it is.  When you take a look at this bill, you realize why we are asked to vote on this Republican tax plan--a plan written behind closed doors and rushed through Congress on a last-minute rush this year. It is because the Republicans are bound and determined to have something that they passed this year. In all fairness, they passed the Defense authorization bill, but they spent month after month on repeal and failure to replace our healthcare system, and now, before they leave town at the end of this calendar year, they are bound and determined to get this done, whatever it takes, their so-called tax reform plan.  After a year in control of Congress and the White House and extraordinarily few legislative achievements to show for it, Republicans are forcing through this partisan tax plan only a few short weeks after it was unveiled.  You may not remember unless you were watching C-SPAN that night--I came to the floor when we were finally given the Senate tax bill. It was about 500 pages long. As I was going through it, on page 257--I remember the page--I looked at it, and I thought, what is this? There was a page in the middle of the tax bill with all sorts of scribbled handwriting that was absolutely impossible to read. Now, remember, this is a Tax Code that is going to have an impact on individuals, families, and businesses to the tune of millions of dollars, and here was a page in it that no one could read. Do you know why I know no one could read it? I submitted it to the Record, and the clerk of the Senate came and found me afterward and said: Senator, you can't put this in the Congressional Record because we can't read it. That is what was going on here in writing the Tax Code of the United States of It was a slapdash, hurried effort that sadly does not reflect the best of this institution or the best of the Members who are part of it.  Why would they do this? Because if this bill were subject to proper scrutiny, as it should have been--you only really reform the Tax Code once every several decades--a monumental giveaway to corporate America would have emerged, a tax break or giveaways to the wealthiest  So while most families are focused on getting ready for the holidays, my Republican colleagues and friends are hoping most Americans will be too busy to notice them passing a tax bill that will raise taxes on middle-income families.  This is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, the U.Senate, and my Republican colleagues threw regular order and bipartisan input right out the window of the They have spent the past 2 weeks behind closed doors writing the final version of this tax bill. Only last Friday evening--last Friday--we finally saw the text of this tax plan fully released, fully revealed. There are more than 1,000 pages of new Tax Code, and that is what we are expected to understand and to vote on in a matter of days.  Are the memories of my Republican colleagues so short that they have forgotten their repeated calls of ``read the bill'' when we considered the Affordable Care Act? Did they forget their criticism of that process, which took place, incidentally, over many months, characterized by transparency, multiple bipartisan hearings, and included well over 100 Republican amendments? Have they forgotten all the criticism they leveled on that effort to try to provide health insurance for more Americans?  This is no way for major legislation to be written, this tax bill before us. It certainly reflects the best wishes and hardest work of many of the lobbyists and corporate donors who benefit my Republican colleagues.  Is it any wonder that after this rushed process, the initial analysis of the final bill shows that millions of working families in Illinois and across the Nation will be hurt, while the wealthiest 1 percent of wage earners in America receive a massive windfall? Sadly, it is no surprise.  In their plan, Republicans chose to make essentially all individual provisions to the tax bill temporary in order to pay for massive, permanent corporate cuts that will overwhelmingly benefit the wealthiest investors. The result? As I said, when the bill is fully phased in by 2027, more than half of all Americans will see their taxes increase under the Republican plan. These are tax increases that will be felt particularly hard by those households in the bottom 60 percent and those families with kids. By 2027, while middle-income families pay a higher tab, the richest 1 percent of Americans will receive a whopping 83 percent of all the tax cuts under this plan. I just can't believe they pulled this off, that the Republicans figured out how to give 83 percent of the tax breaks to the top 1 percent of wage earners in America and sell it as tax reform to help working families. It is indefensible.  This devastating result was baked into the DNA of this Republican plan from the start. There is no greater example of this than Republicans' determination to erode State and local tax deductions. It used to be a standard principle in American taxation that you wouldn't tax people on the money they paid in other taxes. We didn't tax a tax until this bill came along. We used to say that if you pay a State income tax or State sales tax or State property tax, we are not going to impose a Federal tax on your tax payment--no tax on the tax. They didn't buy it. They changed it. They put limits on the amount of deductions that you could take for this. What does it mean? Ask the Realtors in my State, the homebuilders, and they will tell you that this is going to be a damper on economic growth in the State of Illinois--a growth that we desperately need in my State to create jobs and opportunities.  This deduction is taken by nearly one-third of all taxpayers, and taxpayers in my home State benefit from it among the most in the The principle is simple: Under the new Republican plan, Illinoisans will start paying Federal taxes on the local, State, and property taxes that they pay, and they don't receive the deduction that historically has been there.  Republicans apparently feel differently because in the face of weeks of warnings from Realtors, homebuilders, local school districts, State and local officials, and first responders about the increased difficulty that the elimination of this deduction will create, it didn't deter them one bit, and every single Illinois Republican Congressman ignored all of this and voted for this terrible plan. It means higher tax bills for middle-income families in my State and many others and a strain on crucial State and local investments in education, infrastructure, and public safety.  That isn't the only hit to middle-income families. Here is the one that I find the most reprehensible. Millions of people will lose health insurance because of this tax reform bill. It guts one of the major provisions of the Affordable Care  After failing miserably to achieve one of their campaign promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take away healthcare from millions of families, Republicans slipped into this tax bill a provision that undermines the Affordable Care The net result of it is an increase of 10 to 20 percent for health insurance premiums for those buying in the marketplace, and--this is a kicker--13 million Americans are going to lose health insurance because of this health reform bill that is brought to us by the  I don't see how you can go home to any State and say: Good news. I gave a tax break to the wealthiest people in America and the biggest corporations, and average working folks here are going to lose their health insurance. How can you stand up and say that is good for your State or for this country?  Republicans' efforts to take away healthcare from families and give tax cuts to the wealthy shouldn't surprise us. The surprise here is that so many of the so-called fiscal hawks--how many times have I heard my Republican colleagues come to the floor and pose for holy pictures when it comes to the national debt. Oh, it goes over and over again, the speeches they give when there is a Democratic Now that there is a Republican President, political amnesia has set in.  It turns out that this Republican tax reform--giving tax breaks to the[[Page S8126]]wealthy and not to the middle-income families of America--will add $1.5 trillion to our national debt. Who will pay off that debt for these tax breaks to the wealthy? I am afraid it is our kids and our grandkids. Somehow these fiscal hawks are able to convince themselves that cutting taxes on the wealthy is worth a new burden on our kids.  When you get past all the fancy rhetoric, the bottom line is, Republicans believe that we can afford to add $1.5 trillion to the debt if it means giving tax cuts to the wealthy but that we can't afford it as a nation when we know we are going to need it to make massive investments in things that mean a lot to working families. Shouldn't we have put more money into fighting the opioid crisis that claimed almost 2,000 lives last year in my home State of Illinois? Shouldn't we have put more money into helping kids go to college so they aren't burdened with student loans that change their lives? Shouldn't we have put more money into medical research? Couldn't we have put more money into investing in our infrastructure? The Republicans say there is a much higher priority--tax cuts for wealthy people.  What does make sense to my constituents and millions more across America is that $1.5 trillion increase in national debt poses a real threat to our economic future and a threat to the future of Medicare and  Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, Republican leader, said they are going to take care of the added deficit and debt by cutting entitlement programs like Medicare and I would say to Paul Ryan, my neighbor from Wisconsin, you are in for a fight, my friend--and it will not be just the Democrats; it will be a lot of folks in Wisconsin who aren't going to stand for that outcome.  Americans deserve better than what the Republican leaders in Congress have brought to us in this bill--rushed through without bipartisan consideration and without review by experts. This may be a ``big political win for the Republican Party and their donors,'' but it is on the backs of hard-working families.  Some of these consequences that we face are already dangerously clear, others, which we will only discover as we pore through the fine print of this 1,000-page bill--we can only guess what they will mean.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

592,topic-id,2427,"Mr.President, I rise today to speak to an issue that I have spoken to many times on the floor of the It is the issue of the DREAM Act, a measure which I introduced in the Senate 16 years ago.  Sixteen years ago I tried to find a way to give young people brought into the United States, who grew up here in this country but did not have legal status, a chance--just a chance--to earn their way to legal status, to earn their way to citizenship. We set a number of hurdles in their path. We made it clear that they had to complete their education. We made it clear that they had to pass a serious criminal background check. We gave a timetable when they would be able to reach legal status and not fear deportation.  That was 16 years ago, and it still is not the law of the land. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of young people who fit the description that I have just given.  When President Obama was in the White House, I wrote him a letter and said: Mr.President, can you do something to help them? And he did. He created something called DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood It was an Executive order that said to these young people: If you fit that definition of the DREAM Act and if you will come forward and pay a filing fee of $500 or more, if you will submit yourself to a criminal background check and give us all of your background information about you and your family, then, we will give you temporary, renewable status to stay in America, not be deported, and be allowed to work.  It was a big leap for many of these young people to do it because they had grown up in families where, in whispered conversations in the evening, their parents told them: Be careful. If you get arrested and they come to see this family, many of us will be forced to leave this country. Be careful.  These young people decided to trust the President of the United States, to trust the Government of the United States, and to run the risk of disclosing everything--giving the most sensitive, personal information about themselves and about their families. They trusted us, and they trusted this country to treat them fairly and justly.  So 780,000 have come forward. They submitted their filing fees. They paid for the expenses of the government. They did it knowing that even with this new status--this DACA status under President Obama's Executive order--they didn't qualify for one penny of Federal Government benefits, and by working, they would be forced to pay taxes, which they were glad to do. Again, 780,000 came forward.  Then came the last election--the election of a President of the United States who had made immigration the centerpiece of his election message and who had really sewn doubt, and even fear, about allowing immigrants into our Nation of immigrants. It is not a new message in It is hardly a new message around the world. Being suspicious and fearful, even hateful, of immigrants has been a part of human experience from the beginning of time.  So what would happen to these DACA-protected 780,000 young people? President Trump announced, through his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, on September 5 of this year, that DACA protection was ending. As of March 5 of next year, 2018, no one could sign up for DACA protection, and as the protection expired for each of them, there was no renewal for 780,000 young people.  The President then challenged Congress and said: Do something. If I believe, he said, that DACA is wrong, pass a law; take care of the problem. He said that on September 5. Here we are in December, just days away from the end of the year, and we have done nothing--nothing. And what has happened?  Across America, these young people, their families, and the people who believe in them have begged us to step up and do something. They have said: In the name of justice, in the name of fairness, in the name of morality, do something. And we have done nothing--nothing.  Many of them have decided in desperation to bring their message here to the Right now, as I stand and speak on the floor of the Senate, there are thousands outside on the Mall, roaming through the corridors, trying to stop people who they believe might be Congressmen or Senators, to beg for the passage of the Dream Act, to beg for the reinstatement of the DACA protection. Some of them have made great sacrifices. I have gone out to talk to a lot of them. They have never been to Washington before. They have never been inside this Capitol They don't know what it means to lobby. They can't afford a lawyer or a lobbyist. They are coming here to beg for their lives and to beg for their families. Some people are shunning them, refusing to talk to them. Others are gracious and warm and welcoming. They get on people's nerves because there are a lot of them and they want to talk to people about solving the problem. Some of them have sat in our offices--even my office--and I understand it. As awkward as it may be, as uncomfortable as it may be, I welcome them. I want them to know what America is about--a place where people in this country have the right to speak, to assemble, to petition their government. They believe this is their government. They look at that flag and they say: That is my flag too.  Legally, they are wrong. They are undocumented. Many have no country at all to which they can turn.  Who are they? Who are these 780,000 young people? I can tell you who 900 of them are. Nine hundred of these undocumented young people stood up and took an oath to a country that will not legally recognize them to serve in our military and risk their lives for each and every one of us. What greater proof can we ask about their commitment to this country? Nine hundred of them did this. If we fail to provide DACA or Dream Act protection to them, these 900 will be forced to leave the military of the United States of They will be turned away, despite the fact that they have volunteered their lives for this country.  Twenty thousand of them teach in our classrooms around I have met many of them. They are teaching in inner city schools through a program called Teach For America, which sends them to some of the poorest school districts in They are spending their lives, as undocumented in America, trying to help the least of those of the population, those in desperate need of their assistance.  Among them are thousands who are going to school now and college. Let me tell you that their challenge in college is a heck of a lot harder than the challenge for most young people. They don't qualify for any Federal assistance to go to college--no Pell grants, no Federal loans. They have to go to work. They have to work and earn the money to pay for tuition. That is what their lives are all about.  So for those who would dismiss these as lazy people who really can't offer much to the future of America, take a minute to get to know them.  Yesterday, one of my Republican colleagues looked me in the eye and said: We are talking about amnesty; these are people who violated the law. You are talking about forgiving them for violating the law.  Some of them, by his definition, violated the law when they were carried in their mothers' arms to the United States at the age of 2. Does that sound right? Does that sound just? Does it sound fair to say that these are people who have broken the law in America? I don't think so.  Let me say a word about their parents. There are some people who say: OK, I don't hate the Dreamers, but I get to hate their parents, right? They did break the law.  Technically, they probably did. I will not argue the point, but I will tell you something. As a father, I would risk breaking the law for the life, future, and safety of my children. I would, and most people would, and they did. It wasn't for any selfish motive. It was so that their kids had a chance. That is what it was all about, and that is why they came to this country. They knew that at any minute it could fall apart and they would be asked to leave, or worse. They risked it for their children. So I am not going to stand in[[Page S8164]]moral judgment of these parents of As to legal judgment, the case is clear. But as to a moral judgment, no, I just will not do it.  What I have done 101 or 102 times is to come to this floor and just tell a story--a story about a Dreamer--so that people know who they are. Today I would like to tell you the story of this young lady whose name is Karen Karen Reyes is the 104th Dreamer whom I have introduced on the floor of the Senate, brought to the United States from She grew up in San She had a childhood like other American kids--Girl Scouts, summer camps, church groups, volleyball. Karen didn't even know she was undocumented until she was in junior high school.  She was a good student. She graduated with honors from high school. She was a member of the marching band. Here is what she said about growing up in America:       I might be an undocumented American, but I am an      I came to this country when I was 2 years old. The only      recollection that I have of Mexico is when I visited as a      young child. I have not gone back in 20 years. I grew up      here. I formed a life here. I made friends here. I received      my education here.  After high school, Karen went to San Antonio College and then transferred to the University of Texas San She made the President's Honors List and the Dean's  She found time to volunteer at the University Health System and at the San Antonio Youth Literacy project. She tutored second grade students in reading, and she worked with communities and schools where she mentored and tutored elementary students.  In 2012, Karen graduated with a bachelor of arts in interdisciplinary studies. She went on to the Deaf Education and Hearing Science Program at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San  In 2014, Karen graduated with a master's degree in deaf education and hearing science.  Today, she is working as a special education teacher in Austin, Here is a picture of her with the kids. She teaches 3- and 4-year-old kids who are deaf or hard of hearing. She teaches kids with disabilities. Here is what she said about DACA, the program that was abolished by President Trump, which allows her to live in the United States and to work as a teacher:       DACA made me visible. DACA made it possible for me to teach      children who are deaf and hard of hearing. I am helping these      students and families on their journey to being able to      communicate and achieve their dreams. Before I didn't think I      had a voice, but now I do. . . . I get to change lives every      single day.  Twenty thousand other DACA students and recipients like Karen are teachers in our schools. Because DACA was repealed, Texas stands to lose 2,000 teachers. I ask the State of Texas: Are you ready to lose Karen? Are you ready to lose 2,000 more just like her because the Senate and the House of Representatives refused to act, refused to legislate, refused to provide protection to her?  As for Karen, her DACA expires in August of next year. This will be her last school year. If Congress doesn't step up and meet its responsibility and pass the Dream Act, her time teaching these deaf and hard of hearing children will come to an end.  In a few days we are going to go home and celebrate Christmas with our families. It is a big, important time of year. My wife and I are looking forward to it. We get to see all of the grandkids in one place. It is going to be pure bedlam, but we are going to love every second of it. Christmas means that much to our families. Being together means so much to our families.  Think for a moment about those who are protected with This may be their last Christmas in the United They don't know where they will be next Christmas because the President abolished the protection program and because Congress refuses to act. They don't know where they will be and they don't know whether they will be with family or not. That is the reality.  What a reflection on our Nation that we have reached this point to punish someone like Karen, a giving, caring, educated professional person who is spending time helping little boys and girls who desperately need her help.  Some in this Chamber--and I have seen them face to face--are ready to tell her to leave: We don't need you anymore, Go back to wherever you came from. Just get out of here. That is their attitude. It is not mine nor the majority of  Over three out of four Americans believe Karen deserves a chance. Over three out of four Americans believe she should be allowed to stay and earn her way to legal status and citizenship. Incidentally, 60 percent of those who voted for Donald Trump happen to believe that same thing.  But there are voices of division and fear and hatred in this administration. I have seen them. I have heard them. I know what they have to say. The question is, will they prevail? Will they define this President in terms of his treatment of people who are just asking for a chance to be part of America's future? The answer to that question is really not in the President's hands. It is in our hands. We owe it to these young people to do the right thing.  I yield the floor.

887,topic-id,2335,"Mr.President, yesterday I went to Benito Juarez high school in Chicago, in the southwest part of the city, in the Pilsen neighborhood. It has a predominantly Mexican-American enrollment at this high school. It is one of my favorites. I have been there time and again for so many different events. It is full of life and full of some amazing young students and some great teachers and a great principal, Mr.I was there 2 weeks ago for a mariachi band ensemble, training students across the city to be musicians in the Mexican tradition. There is so much life there.  But yesterday was not the happiest occasion. It was sad and worrisome. I met with about 20 of the students there, all of whom have been protected by DACA was President Obama's Executive order that was issued in 2012. That Executive order said that if you were brought to the United States as a child, an infant, a toddler, a young person, and grew up in this country undocumented; if you had no problems of any serious nature with the law; if you finished your education; if you went through a criminal background check and paid a fee, you would be protected and be able to stay in America 2 years at a time to go to school, to work, whatever your aspirations may be.  Under President Obama's Executive order, 780,000 young people came forward, and the 20 I met at Benito Juarez were among them. They got the protection they needed to legally get a job. For a lot of these young students, that is a critical part of their lives because, being undocumented, they don't qualify for any Federal assistance to go to college. If they want to go to college, they have to save up for it, and they have to find the money and work for the tuition and other expenses. So getting a job is a very important part of it.  These young people, as they went through the DACA process, knew that they were safe from being deported. That is a fear which many of us can't even understand, but it is a real fear for many people in this country who are here undocumented. So for these young people, they have that chance.  On September 5, President Trump announced he was ending the DACA protection program as of March 5 of next year, putting an end to the protection these young people have. As their DACA expires, they will be vulnerable to deportation. They will reach the point where they can no longer work in  The end of DACA as we know it will dramatically change the lives of thousands of young people. It will change the lives of 900 of these DACA-protected young people who volunteered to serve in our military--currently serving in our military, willing to risk their lives for a country that will not give them legal status. Imagine that for a moment. If they had to prove that they really cared about America, what more could they do then to put their lives on the line? They have done it, 900 of them. When DACA goes away on March 5 of next year, they have to leave the military service. That is the end of their opportunity to serve Many of them are in the military because they bring special skills and special capacities to lead. We will lose them.  It will mean that 20,000 of these DACA-protected young people, when it goes away for them, will no longer be able to teach--20,000 teachers across I met one of them yesterday, Katherine Katherine, whom I had met before, is a special-ed teacher. Her family originally came from She told a heartbreaking story about what happened 10 years ago. She was in high school. She was taking a shower in the morning before she was to go to school. There was a knock on the bathroom door. Her mother was crying and screaming: ``Come out. Come out.'' Katherine came out to see her father being handcuffed. They were deporting him to He was gone. That was the last time he saw her and she saw him--10 years ago. As she told the story, she said that her mother tried to make it as a single mom with her kids here in the United States and finally gave up and went back to Nicaragua, leaving Katherine to raise herself, to pay her own way through college, to get a teaching certificate and teach special-ed in the city of As of March 5 next year, Katherine is finished teaching. It is over. DACA is gone.  When I met with these students yesterday, you can imagine what they were worried about. They are worried about themselves and their future. They are worried about their families. They are worried about having turned over all this information to the government when they signed up for DACA which can now be used against them and their families. That is what they are worried about.  Many of them, I am sure, reflect on the fact that this could be their last Christmas in the United States of If that seems overly dramatic, then you need to meet them and talk to them and understand the reality of their lives. That is what they face.  While President Trump did prospectively eliminate the DACA Program, he issued a challenge to us. He said to Congress: Now do something. If I am going to eliminate this Executive order, what is Congress going to do in the U.Senate and House of Representatives? Will you pass a law to deal with this challenge?  He said that in September, and here we are in the middle of December having done nothing--nothing--and the clock is ticking. It is a clock that means an awful lot to thousands of young people across America, including those at Benito Juarez high school in the city of  There are people who want to get this fixed, Republicans and We need to come together and get this done. There is no excuse for delay. We know what needs to be done. We need to give these young people a chance.  I introduced the DREAM Act 16 years ago here in the Senate, and the DREAM Act said to these young people: We are going to put you on a path to legalization and a path to citizenship. It won't be easy, and it won't be quick, and you will have to show us that you can be a productive part of America's future, but then we will give you your chance. These young people grew up in the United States of America, pledging allegiance to that flag, singing our national anthem, believing in their heart of hearts that this was home, but it really wasn't, legally. They were undocumented and illegal in Now the question is, What will we do to make that better, to fix it, to come up with a just solution?  Some of my Republican colleagues say: Well, you have to give us more than just fixing their problem; you have to give us some fix to our immigration system. I am not against that. I was part of a group of eight Senators who spent months together--four Democrats, four We crafted a comprehensive immigration bill, which I am proud of. It passed on the floor of the Senate and was sent over to the Republican House of Representatives where they refused to even consider it. They would not bring it up for a vote. It died in the Republican  I know this immigration system in America is broken. I have talked about one specific piece of it this morning, but there are many aspects of it that are broken. The Republicans have said to us: Do something to make our borders stronger. Sign me up. I voted for that on the comprehensive immigration bill. Does that mean more technology, more equipment, making certain that it is clear that our border is going to be a real border that you cannot cross at will? Of course. I am prepared to do that, and many Democrats--maybe all the Democrats--would join in that effort. There are things that we can do to fix this system, but what we cannot do is ignore it. We cannot ignore what is happening to these young people, the threat to their future, to their families, and we can't ignore the reality that this is a basic test of who we are as  I stand here today as the son of an immigrant mother. My mom was brought to this country when she was 2 years old, and thank goodness my grandmother decided to put her on a boat, bring her from Lithuania to the United I wouldn't be here otherwise. That is my story, that is my family's story, and that is America's story. That is who we are. I cannot imagine my grandmother and grandfather, whom I never knew, making the decision to come to a country where they didn't even speak the language,[[Page S8077]]giving up everything and leaving it behind in their mother country of Lithuania to try a new country called the United States of That story has been repeated millions of times, and thank goodness it has. They not only brought strong backs and strong minds, but they brought with them a part of their DNA, which was a DNA of culture, courage, and determination, and I think that is part of who we are as Americans--and proud to be.  Let me tell you the story of one of these Dreamers, as I call them, or DACA young people. All of my speeches notwithstanding, these stories tell more about this situation than anything I could possibly say. This is Maria I have told stories of Dreamers on the floor; she is 101, I believe, of the list that I have given. She came to the United States at the age of 3, brought from Maria grew up in a rural town called Stonewall, Her fondest memories of growing up in the Texas Hill Country include haystack jumping, armadillo chasing, and fishing in a lake. Later in her childhood, Maria's family moved to San Maria was a very good student. She graduated from high school twelfth in her class. She played varsity soccer. She was recognized as a San Antonio Scholar Athlete of the Week during her junior year. At the same time, as she was going to school and playing soccer, she was working a job to help support herself and her family.  Maria was accepted at the University of Texas at San While enrolled as a full-time student, she kept right on working. In fact, she juggled three different jobs. She was a housekeeper, a babysitter, and a personal assistant. She had to come up with $40,000 out of pocket to pay for college education. She didn't qualify for any Federal assistance because of her immigration status. So these young students in college are working harder than many others just to make sure they succeed.  In May of 2012, she graduated with a degree in interdisciplinary studies. After graduation, she decided to enter a program known as Teach For Almost everyone knows about this program, but they should know that this is a program in which college graduates volunteer to teach in some of the most challenging schools across Maria was one of those.  Today, Maria continues her career as a teacher. She teaches third grade in her hometown of San Antonio, At the same time, she is pursuing a graduate degree in education, once again with no Federal assistance, no Federal loans. Without DACA, Maria would not be able to work and could be deported immediately. When asked what would happen to her without DACA protection, which President Trump eliminated as of March 5 next year, Maria only thinks of her students. Here is what she said: How are my students going to take it? What is going to happen to them? That is what scares me.  Nationwide, there are 20,000 DACA recipients just like her. With Teach For America alone, 190 of these undocumented students who have gone on to get degrees in college are teaching in the Teach For America Currently, they are teaching 10,000 students across 11 States, with one-third of them in the State of  In a few weeks, Congress is going to face the reality of this DACA provision by President Trump coming into full effect. As of that day, she and others like her will start the clock ticking to lose their jobs, be legally unemployable in  Christmas is a special time of year for every family of Christian faith and those who observe it. It is a special time of year for my family. The real question though is, Can we leave this week, ignoring this issue? Can we go home and enjoy our Christmas without thinking for a moment of how young people like Maria may be facing their last Christmas in the United States of America? That is the reality of what she faces. So why don't we face this issue?  This is an empty Senate Chamber, which is usually the case, unfortunately. I wish it were filled--filled with a healthy, fulsome debate on this issue. Let's have our disagreements, bring them out. Let's work out our compromises. Let's do something that is really radical around here. Let's come together and legislate--Democrats and Let's solve this problem. That is why we were elected, not to collect a paycheck and build a pension but to solve the problems facing This one is real, it is timely, and it is now.

1334,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, Cesar Chavez, the great champion of justice and human dignity, once offered this advice about friendship: He said; ``If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him. . . . The people who give you their food give you their heart.''  The Senate Dining Room isn't Steve Johnson's house, but for the 22 years that he has worked there, Steve has poured his heart into his job, and he has become a friend--or at least a friendly face--to Senators, our families, staff members, and visitors.  As general manager of the Senate Dining Rooms and two other eateries in the Capitol, Steve works hard to create places where people who might not normally talk to each other can sit down at adjoining tables, eat a meal, and maybe swap stories or jokes.  In the Senate Dining Room, with its white linen table cloths and crystal chandeliers, you might see Republican and Democratic Senators and staff members asking after each other's families. In the refectory on the first floor, reporters and visitors to the Capitol stand in line together to grab a[[Page S8177]]quick bite. Downstairs, in the carryout, you can find the whole Capitol family, as Steve calls them; ``the white collars, the blue collars, the green collars, and the Capitol Police,'' all eating together.  It is a little like stepping back into a better, less partisan time.  On Friday, December 22, Steve Johnson is leaving the He is retiring. Before he does, I want to take a moment to thank Steve for his many years of good and loyal service to the  Until 1995, when Steve began working as a maitre d' in the Senate Dining Room, he had never seen the inside of the U.Capitol, but he had seen the outside of this magnificent building many times.  You see, Steve grew up in Freehold, NJ, home of ``The Boss,'' Bruce He was one of six kids. His mom trained as a nurse, and his dad was a director of a  In 1963, Steve's Dad, Herbert, attended the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King gave his ``I Have a Dream'' speech. The experience made a profound impression.  During Steve's childhood and teen years, whenever there was a big march or rally in Washington, the whole Johnson family--mom, dad, and six kids--would pile into the family station wagon, drive to Washington, DC, for the day, and drive back to Freehold that night.  During those childhood trips, Steve developed a reverence for this building. After 22 years of working here, he still has it. He is still awed when he sees the Capitol dome gleaming in the sun as he arrives at work, or sees the Capitol Christmas tree lit up at night.  It is a feeling that many of us share.  Steve started his career in food service nearly 40 years ago, shortly after he graduated from Glassboro State College in New Jersey with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He went to work at a restaurant in his hometown.  A few years later, he and a business partner took over running a more than 200-year-old inn, the Liberty Tavern, in New Jersey's capitol city of They gave it their best try, with clever marketing and a hard-working staff, but couldn't make good of it.  Fortunately for us, Steve's wife, Joanne, took a job with the Federal Government in Washington, and Steve made the move with her.  Before the Senate, he worked at the Mayflower Hotel, another Washington legend. As I mentioned, he started in the Senate Dining Room as maitre d' and worked his way up to assistant general manager and finally general manager.  He works incredibly hard, from early in the morning until evening or later. With his calm demeanor, he makes a tough job look almost easy.  That calm may have something to do with the fact that Steve is a dedicated marathon runner. He has run 18 marathons, including seven Boston  He is a modest man in a sea of big egos, a scrupulously nonpartisan man in era of sharp partisan lines. He and his dedicated staff are important members of the Senate family.  There is a line in a Bruce Springsteen song where Bruce says, ``I'm ready to grow young again.''  Sadly, none of us can actually do that.  But Steve has decided that he is ready to be a rookie again and try something completely new and different. In this next chapter of his life, he will work as a volunteer literacy tutor for adults who speak English as a Second  It is another way, I think, of making people feel at home and cared for, something that Steve Johnson is so good at.  In closing, I want to thank Steve again for his many years of service to the Senate, and I want to wish Steve and Joanne the very best of luck as they start this new chapter in their lives.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8176-2.txt,326,"CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT",2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

700,topic-id,242,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, 10 years ago, some of America's largest financial institutions failed, resulting in near collapse of our entire financial system. The experience destroyed businesses, ruined[[Page H10225]]lives across the country, and left fear and uncertainty in its wake.  Congress set out to prevent a future crisis by requiring enhanced supervision and regulation of some of the biggest financial institutions in the country by passing the Dodd-Frank In Dodd-Frank, Congress defined the largest financial institutions as ``systematically important financial institutions,'' more commonly referred to as SIFIs, those with more than $50 billion in assets.  The goal of preventing our Nation's largest financial institutions from failing and bringing down our entire financial system is laudable. The problem, however, is Dodd-Frank's definition of what constitutes a SIFI: the $50 billion asset threshold. In fact, the creator of the threshold and former chair of the Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, admits the threshold is arbitrary, and he supports changing the threshold.  H.3312, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act, removes the arbitrary asset threshold and, instead, will classify the largest financial institutions by their activities. Differentiating between stable activities and those that could potentially threaten the financial stability of the United States is a more accurate way to identify and monitor risk.

1053,topic-id,274,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend from New You know, I have been here a long time now, and I have to say: This is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen; one of the worst processes I have ever seen. You know, when you were a kid, and you went to high school and college, and you learned how a bill becomes a law, well, take that and throw it out because the Republican leadership here doesn't want to work with  The reason no Democrats are working with you is you shut us out. You won't let us have any input. You won't do anything with us, and this is not the way to govern, absolutely not. You know, someone near and dear to me once said: The Republican Party is the party of the rich person, and the Democratic Party is the party of the working person.  If that was ever true, it certainly is true today. Rich people do really, really well. Middle class and the poor people don't do well at all. In fact, the corporate tax breaks last for years and years and years, and the other tax breaks for the middle class expire in 5 years. This helps the rich; it hurts the poor; it helps the middle class.  Even Ronald Reagan tried to be bipartisan and have Democrats work with him. And whatever happened to my friends on the Republican side, lectures about fiscal responsibility? This blows a hole in the budget. It is irresponsible. My State of New York, which is a donor State, is getting screwed. That is all I can say.

494,topic-id,2043,"Mr.President, we stand today on the precipice of the most sweeping change to our Nation's tax system in over 30 years. This is a historic moment, as this distinguished body begins final consideration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--tax reform that will help boost America's economy, create more jobs, and leave more money in people's paychecks.  The last time we considered tax reform similar to this magnitude was 1986. To help remind us how much our country, its economy, and the people have changed since that time, let's review some of the events of that year.  In 1986, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1,895--sure that 20,000 would never be broken, and it wasn't until after the last election. It now stands at over 24,000.  A gallon of gas cost just 89 cents. Today it is close to $2.50. We still used land lines to phone our loved ones. Iconic movies such as ``Top Gun'' and ``Aliens'' opened. Americans were watching TV shows like ``Dynasty'' and ``Hill Street Blues.'' The Associated Press chose NBA star Larry Bird as one of the Athletes of the  President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which ushered in deep tax rate cuts for American families and an overhaul of our complicated Tax When he signed the bill, Reagan commented on the length of the journey and noted that some people thought it would never happen.  Today, too, some have asserted that tax reform either cannot or should not happen, but as our strongly optimistic President said in 1986--and as I continue to believe--the American people ``haven't made this the freest country and the mightiest economic force on this planet by shrinking from challenges.'' Reagan noted:       This country was founded on faith in the individual, not      groups or classes, but faith in resources and bounty of each      and every separate human soul. Our Founding Fathers designed      a Democratic form of government to enlist the individual's      energies.  For that reason, I want to remind my colleagues about the hard work that brought us here. It is a journey that has been years in the making under the leadership of both sides of the aisle. It is one we started and will finish for the benefit of the American people and the health of the U.economy.  I am proud of the work of the Finance and Budget Committees, and I have had the honor to play a role with both. The Finance Committee held more than 70 hearings on how the Tax Code can be improved and streamlined to work better for all  Almost 3 years ago, Finance Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden convened bipartisan tax reform working groups to analyze challenges of our outdated Tax Code and develop policy recommendations for comprehensive tax reform. The conclusions reached by these groups helped identify the issues for reform and shape the contours of the legislation we are considering now. It is worth noting that the entire fiscal year 2018 budget reconciliation process has been open, transparent, and subject to regular order, starting with the passage of the Senate budget resolution.  The Senate Budget Committee marked up the bill over 2 days and accepted amendments from both sides of the aisle to make the resolution stronger. In fact, for the first time ever, the minority received a copy of the chairman's budget document 5 days prior to the start of the markup. According to many of my colleagues, it was one of the most transparent budget resolution markups in history.  The budget resolution--complete with the document reconciliation instructions--was then debated on the floor. This was an open floor process that allowed every Senator the opportunity to offer and vote on amendments to improve the resolution before its final passage.  Last month, the Senate Finance Committee held a 4-day markup before approving tax reform legislation designed to modernize our Tax The markup lasted 23 hours and 34 minutes over the course of those 4 days. Of the more than 350 amendments filed, 69 were considered in committee. Amendments offered by both Democrats and Republicans were adopted.  Since then, both Chambers of Congress have passed similar versions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and over the past 2 weeks, conferees worked tirelessly to resolve and bridge the differences between the two bills and[[Page S8089]]come to an agreement on a final piece of legislation.  In this Chamber, the legislation reflects the outstanding work and leadership of Finance Chairman Hatch and Energy Committee Chairman Murkowski in developing legislative recommendations that adhere to the budget resolution's reconciliation instructions, and I thank them for their efforts.  I also thank my Senate colleagues who earlier this month supported the Senate passage of the Tax Cuts and Job Act and whose advice and consent during the conference has shaped the final bill. The legislation is truly a reflection of the broad range and consensus of Members who engaged with this process.  Throughout my work on this bill, I have carried with me the many lessons I have learned from when I owned and operated a small business or when I worked as an accountant. I have been led by one singular purpose, to help improve the lives of millions of hard-working American families, especially the residents of my own State of  I am pleased with the outcome of our work because I believe it includes meaningful changes that will help individuals and families struggling to move up the economic ladder. The tax plan includes reforms that will help grow the economy, that will create more jobs, and that will simplify taxes. It provides American workers and families with an across-the-board tax cut and puts more money in people's pockets. It lets Americans have a greater say as to how to use their hard-earned money. The changes will help small businesses in our communities thrive and encourage the largest multinational companies to remain in the United States, investing profits here instead of overseas--not a bad wish list for  Under the plan, Americans will reap tax savings from reduced tax rates, tax savings from a higher standard deduction, which creates a larger zero tax bracket for low-income individuals and increases many people's tax refunds. It also includes a child tax credit that doubles in size to $2,000 to help struggling families and all this while preserving important deductions for medical expenses, charities, homeowners, and State and local taxes. Our farmers and ranchers will receive stronger protections from the reach of the death tax to help them more easily pass on their businesses to future generations--eliminating a double taxation.  Businesses small and large will benefit from a range of tax breaks, including lower tax rates, expanded opportunities to expense the purchase of capital assets, a new 20-percent deduction for many unincorporated businesses, and international tax reforms to give the U.S.-headquartered global companies a strong competitive footing in the global marketplace. These are changes you can take to the bank.  Now it is time for us to act. It is time for us to modernize our outdated Tax Code so our Nation can remain competitive in the 21st century economy. The code, as it now stands, hurts American workers and hampers economic growth.  Along with reforms to the code, this bill will also promote economic growth. For too long, some have accepted the presumption of a U.economy that will not grow as strongly as it has in the past. As a supporter of this bill, I reject that false narrative.  Better tax policy will boost the value of everything we produce, and this will mean more revenue for the Federal I am tired of the accusations that Republican budget hawks--and that definitely includes me--are willing to throw in the towel and accept a $1.5 trillion deficit over the next 10 years. I am still a deficit hawk. Here is why. Claims to the contrary that this bill will go unpaid for are based on an incomplete analysis of the tax bill.  We have a Congressional Budget Office tasked with impartially evaluating any legislation we do. Unfortunately, its evaluations are tied to static scoring. That means it is evaluated without considering the underlying economic effects of these changes. Let me repeat that. The Congressional Budget Office is tied to static scoring. That means it is evaluated without considering the underlying economic effects of these changes.  The problem really isn't how much revenue we will have under the new bill. I believe it will increase revenue as the tax cut did in the 1980s. The problem is spending. We never make budget cuts. In Washington, a cut in the budget brings screams if an agency or program doesn't get as much as it requested, even if it gets more than it ever had before. That is not a budget cut, but that is how it works in If we continue this way, we will not ever get our spending in line.  For years, I have tried to institute the Penny Plan, where we just cut one penny in real cuts from where we have been. It gets lip service but not votes. It is a lot easier to give away money than it is to take away money, even pennies. So we need a new approach. We need to grow the economy. We need businesses to do well so more tax money will come in. We need individuals to make more so more tax money will come in. That has been done before with tax cuts. Unfortunately, when the tax cuts performed to provide more revenue, we spent twice what we brought in.  So here is what I have done as Budget chairman. A good economy brings in more tax money. Our economy has been limping along. Last year, it grew at a mere 1.6 percent GDP--which is private sector growth, not government growth. The norm for the United States is 3.2 percent private sector growth--not like we saw during the past 8 years when this growth remained below 3 percent. In fact, since this President got elected, the growth has been 3.2 percent already. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we may almost hit 4 percent. There is a lot of hope in Every tenth-of-a-percent increase in GDP brings in $273 billion in taxes over 10 years. If we could raise that anemic 1.9 percent to a mere 2.4 percent GDP, we can recover the deficit effect of the tax cuts. If we can bring up the productivity in the private sector--the GDP--to its norm of 3.2 percent, we will pay down significant debt over the 10-year window.  The Council of Economic Advisers and some 130 economists have agreed with me. They say the balancing point of 2.4 percent is way too low, and 3.2 percent GDP is much more reasonable. Some even predict 4 percent growth to our economy. That is how you can be a deficit hawk and cut taxes. You just have to bet America can do better. Actually, we are just betting that we can be as good as we used to be. Our American spirit should say: ``We can do a lot better than that.''  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will help our economy expand. It will provide tax relief to hard-working Americans and make changes to our Tax Code that businesses large and small need to boost the economy and create jobs.  Ultimately, we know increased revenues alone are not going to solve our long-term budget and debt problems because Washington's real problem isn't revenue; Washington has a spending problem.  I urge my colleagues today to finish the task before us. Let's pass this bill to make critical and long overdue changes to our Tax Code that will jump-start our economy. Our country needs it, hard-working American families need it, and they deserve to have the opportunity to make more choices about how their hard-earned money should be used.  In closing, I again remind my colleagues of the words of President Reagan:       Let's not let this magnificent moment slip away. Tax relief      is in sight. Let's make it a reality. . . . We can do it. And      if you help, we will do it this year.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

840,topic-id,375,"Mr President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those limits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. The Senate is considering the House Amendment to H.1370, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, which provides emergency funding for national security accounts.  This legislation includes language that increases security discretionary budget authority by $4,686 million this year and designates it as emergency funding pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(1) of CBO estimates that this budget authority will increase discretionary outlays by $803 million in 2018.  As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing the revised security budget authority limit by $4,686 million and outlays by $803 million this year.

1116,topic-id,1404,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the Republican continuing resolution.  In addition to the many, many problems I have with how this bill was secretly written without any attempt to work with Democrats, I also cannot support it because of the absence of the Dream Act and long-term funding for the Children's Health Insurance  On four occasions, Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act with bills they drafted in secret. These bills had no input from Democrats--or really anyone who would have actually been affected by repeal.  Then they drafted a so-called tax reform bill, again entirely in secret, not consulting anyone outside a small group of Republican lawmakers.  So it is not a surprise that the bill they jammed through is actually nothing more than a tax cut for the richest Americans and large corporations, and all at the expense of American families, who will actually pay higher taxes.  Now, doubling down on their failed strategy of secrecy, Republicans came up with a government funding bill at the very last minute that ignores many of our highest priority needs, including passing the Dream Act and coming up with a long-term solution for  I hope that Republicans will finally realize that this isn't the right way to govern. You are not representing the country when you govern 1 month at a time and rush through poorly written bills that only benefit certain special interests.  It is time to return to regular order.  Now I would like to speak about the absence of the Dream Act in this bill, a negligent decision that even the majority of Republicans in this country disagree with.  To say that Republicans have sent mixed signals on DACA is an understatement.  During his campaign, Donald Trump said he supported deporting all undocumented immigrants, including those who had registered for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Later, he said DACA recipients had nothing to worry about. Then, in September, the Justice Department canceled the DACA program. I can't even imagine the uncertainty that DACA recipients have felt since Donald Trump's election.  DACA was put in place in 2012 by President Obama to remove the crushing fear of deportation experienced by hundreds of thousands of young people. These are outstanding individuals who were brought into the country through no choice of their own, at very young ages, and who know no other country than the United  In fact, the average DACA recipient was brought into the United States at the age of 6.  Now, there are nearly 700,000 individuals with DACA in the United States, approximately 220,000 of whom live in Each day, more than 100 lose their DACA protection, plunging them back into the uncertainty that President Obama relieved.  These young people study, they work, they pay their taxes. They are patriotic. They are American in every way that counts, and to leave them in such uncertainty is nothing less than cruel.  One family in particular has really brought this issue home for me, and that is the Sanchez family from  Maria and Eusebio Sanchez lived in the United States for more than 20 years before they were deported in  Maria was an oncology nurse, and Eusebio was a truck driver.  They had no criminal records, they paid their taxes, they owned a home, and they contributed to their community.  They also had four children, three of whom are U.S.citizens.  Little Jesus is just 12.  Elizabeth is 16 and currently enrolled in a community learning center.  Melin is 21 and is currently enrolled at UC Santa Cruz, studying molecular cell and developmental biology. She wants to be a pediatrician.  Their oldest daughter, Vianney, is 23, and she is not a citizen.  She is, however, protected under She graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in psychology, and today Vianney is taking care of her three siblings.  Imagine being thrust into the role of caregiver to your three siblings after your parents are kicked out of the country, but your own ability to remain here also remains uncertain.  Vianney will lose her DACA status in Imagine the fear and stress she carries with her every day.  All DACA recipients have to register with the government, so immigration officials know where Vianney lives and works. They could show up any day and deport her, leaving her three younger citizen siblings behind with no one to care for them.  Sadly, the experience of this family isn't rare. There are families like this across the country, people who came to[[Page S8233]]America looking for a better life, who work and follow the law and contribute.  By ignoring their plight, by not prioritizing the Dream Act, Republicans are telling them they are just not important enough.  I simply can't accept this and ask my Republican colleagues to look into their hearts and find their compassion. Tell these young people they are safe. Tell them they deserve to stay and the Dream Act will pass.  This bill also fails to provide long-term funding stability for the Children's Health Insurance Program and for community health centers. Both of these programs are vital to our communities and provide healthcare for millions of  CHIP provides health coverage for nearly 9 million children. In California, 1.3 million are currently enrolled in the program and around 2 million are covered at some point during the year.  This program is absolutely critical to support children in working families that are moderate income and can't afford private coverage. Around a quarter of kids on CHIP have special healthcare needs.  I have been hearing from my constituents about how important this program is.  Rachel, from Orange, wrote me to say, ``There are many who depend on this assistance to stay alive. I was a type 1 diabetic at 12 with two disabled parents. If not for governmental assistance, I would be dead. Don't leave someone in this same situation hopeless.''  Kathleen from Arcata wrote to me and said, ``I am a single mom and though my kids are grown now, I had the CHIP for them. I can't imagine what it would be like to raise a child living in similar circumstances now without this program.''  CHIP is also an important program for pregnant women. In California, 30,000 expecting mothers depend on the program.  This care is so important for ensuring healthy moms and babies. If funding lapses, these expectant mothers are at risk of losing their coverage.  Funding for community health centers is also at risk.  There are more than 10,400 centers that see more than 25 million patients across the country.  In California, we have more than 1,500 centers that care for more than 4.4 million patients each year in If we don't provide long-term funding for these centers, there is no doubt they will have to limit hours, lay off staff, or even close.  Supporting community health centers isn't just the right thing to do for access, but for positive outcomes and cost-effectiveness as well.  Health center patients have an 18 percent lower rate of emergency room visits. Medicaid patients receiving care at health centers have costs that are 24 percent lower, and the quality of care is exceptional. Patients do better, and it costs less.  For all the talk about bipartisan support for these two programs, I am profoundly disappointed that we have not addressed their funding in a meaningful way.  Healthcare coverage for kids and access to basic healthcare services in our communities should be a no-brainer. I strongly support these programs and hope we can provide stability soon.  In conclusion, this has been a bad year for governance, and it is being capped off by yet another disappointing display by  All of us saw and heard the thousands of Dreamers who visited our offices. We saw not only their passion but also their desire to make a difference.  Many of these young people live in fear every day.  Congress has a chance to improve their lives and provide for them a positive, productive future.  Republicans have chosen to ignore truly time-sensitive issues like DACA, CHIP, and basic government funding. Instead, they chose to spend months on tax cuts for rich Americans and big corporations.  Tax cuts for rich people aren't time-sensitive. Protecting children is.  Let's get back on track, let's add the Dream Act and CHIP to this bill, and let's return to the good governance that our people expect.  Thank you.

11,topic-id,308,"Mr.President, I rise this evening to call up and adopt a resolution recognizing this year's NCAA champions in women's volleyball--the Huskers from the University of Nebraska-This is the program's fifth national championship and second title in 3 years.  During the NCAA tournament, Nebraska played remarkably well, winning 18 sets and finishing on a 19-match winning streak. They were so fun to watch.  The entire team contributed to the outstanding victory, and I want to acknowledge their extraordinary effort: Annika Albrecht, Mikaela Foecke, Hunter Atherton, Hayley Densberger, Allie Havers, Briana Holman, Kenzie Maloney, Kelly Hunter, Chesney McClellan, Sami Slaughter, Lauren Stivrins, Jazz Sweet, Anezka Szabo, and Sydney Townsend all had their hard work pay off and they worked together to win a championship.  The Nebraska coaches worked hard, helped train our athletes, and strategized this championship run.  Head coach John Cook won his fourth national champion as a Husker head coach. He was joined by assistant coach Tyler Hildebrand, assistant coach Kayla Banwarth, volunteer assistant coach Ryan Coomes, director of operations Lindsay Peterson, video coordinator Kelly O'Connor, and graduate managers Joe Klein, John Henry, and Bre Together, as a team, they guided that outstanding group of women to another national championship. These coaches have created a foundation and a winning tradition--winning the national championship in front of a record-setting crowd of Husker fans--the best fans in college football. Nebraskans couldn't be more proud of this volleyball team and the coaching staff.  The Huskers won this national championship the Nebraska way--with hard work, sportsmanship, and determination. They deserve to be saluted by the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution and recognize their outstanding accomplishment.  I congratulate them on their victory and know they will continue to be great role models to girls and athletes everywhere.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

821,topic-id,209,"Mr.Speaker, I rise this morning to once again implore this Congress to take bipartisan action to extend Federal funding of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or  In my home State of Pennsylvania, more than 176,000 children have gained access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare coverage through CHIP, providing them with age-appropriate medical and developmental care.  Since the program became law, the percentage of uninsured children nationwide has decreased by more than half, from 13.9 percent in 1997 to 6.6 percent in 2016.  As a result of its reliability and effectiveness, CHIP has consistently enjoyed strong bipartisan support. In September, I joined a bipartisan group from across Pennsylvania in urging leaders of both parties to take action to ensure that children have access to high-quality health insurance coverage during their formative years, a move we know yields an abundance of positive outcomes: fewer hospitalizations, increased earning power, and better healthcare outcomes as an adult.  While this Chamber has already taken action, passing legislation last month to fund CHIP, the Senate has yet to act. It is crucial we provide certainty and security for children, parents, and providers and move to sign into law CHIP extension legislation as soon as possible.  Mr.Speaker, the time is now for the Senate to act.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10348-3.txt,1797,INTERDICT ACT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1065,topic-id,660,"Mr.President, 6 months ago, on a beautiful June morning, just a few miles from here in Alexandria, VA, a man with a gun opened fire on me and several of my Republican colleagues.  In the chaotic aftermath of that awful morning, the gunman's purpose slowly became clear. Because of our beliefs and our political affiliation, this individual believed my colleagues and I should die. Since that day, I struggled to understand this thinking. How could any American look onto a field that June morning, where a bunch of middle-aged men were playing baseball, and see the enemy?  Some of the bombastic rhetoric being offered this week in response to the tax reform bill has given me pause. If you listen to some of the hyperbolic vitriol that opponents of this bill are producing, the attitude that nearly killed my friend Steve Scalise and threatened many more lives begins to make a perverse kind of sense.  When respectable public figures go on television or take to Twitter and announce that thousands, if not millions, of Americans are going to die as a direct result of the passage of a tax reform bill, what impact do we expect this to have on the thinking of many Americans? If a person takes such outlandish statements as true, attacking Members of Congress in support of the measure almost appears to be a moral action. This could lead someone to believe that killing a few legislators might save the lives of millions of  Beyond the physical danger of promoting such misinformation, these claims do grave harm to the legislative process. How are we expected to work together to achieve anything if one side's position is viewed as the end of America as we know it? One of my colleagues called this tax reform bill ``the worst bill in the history of Congress.''  Upon the bill's passage, one media pundit went so far as to encourage young Americans to flee their country and declared ``America died tonight.''  Full-throated and passionate debate should always be encouraged. We all love arguing the merits of supply-side economics, but this is not that. This is demonizing of the worst kind. It leaves us all in this body unable to engage in the kind of negotiations and compromise that Congress was created to foster.  To be clear, this is not a problem with one party or of one moment. During the public debate over the Affordable Care Act, Members of my party engaged in similar tactics. I was in the House Chamber when one of my Republican colleagues stood and yelled ``You lie'' at the President of the United The accusation that passage of healthcare reform legislation would result in so-called death panels was promoted far and wide by many One conservative commentator suggested the government would begin educating seniors on how to end their own lives.  A Republican legislator claimed that the bill would put seniors in a position of being ``put to death by their government.'' This rhetoric was wrong then, and it is wrong now.  The threat posed to all of us and to the democratic process for giving in to extreme rhetoric is not theoretical. Some of us faced it on that baseball field in Alexandria in June, and all of us have witnessed its corrosive effect on I urge my colleagues, all of us, let's end this practice where raw politics drowns out the supplications of the better angels of our nature. Let us all be more humble as to our predictive powers when it comes to placing a value on the work we do here. In reality, this legislation will probably not turn out to be as good as the proponents assert, nor as bad as the opponents contend.  The country is watching. It is my hope that we--all of us--can eschew contempt and vitriol in our speech and be more measured in our tone.  I yield the floor.

One of his early contributions to Texas A&M was his appointment to the Texas A&M Aspirations This initiative was commissioned by then-President Earl Rudder to recommend changes to the university to put the institution on sound footing for the future.  Among the recommendations to come out of this committee were the admission of female students, noncompulsory membership in the Corps of Cadets, racial integration, higher admission standards, and input that led to changing the name of the university to Texas A&M  Haskell left Texas A&M, in 1980, to become president at the University of Texas-El Paso, commonly known as  After 7 years at UTEP, he became the chancellor at the University of Missouri, where he remained until 1993.

662,topic-id,2964,"Mr.President, I rise to deliver the second in a series of floor speeches that I offer as I close out my time in the  This afternoon, I want to talk about Americans' relationship with telecommunications and technology companies and what that means for their access to essential services and for their privacy.  When I entered the Senate in July of 2009, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid asked me to serve on the Judiciary I pointed out that there are a lot of lawyers in the Senate and that I wasn't one of them, but he said he needed Members with my perspective on the committee. I wondered how my background could possibly serve me on Judiciary, but it did--almost immediately--when in December of that year, Comcast announced its intention to acquire  I happened to know a lot about the effects of media consolidation because I used to work in media. When powerful corporations are permitted to acquire other powerful corporations, it is the American consumers who are left facing higher prices, fewer choices, and even worse service from their telecommunications providers. I questioned why an already powerful company should be allowed to get even bigger and thus extract more leverage over consumers and the businesses reliant on its platform.  It was through my work on Comcast and NBCUniversal that I learned about the rising costs of internet, phone, and TV services, as well as the importance of preserving net neutrality. I also became interested in how giant telecommunications companies, as well as ever-evolving tech companies, were treating the massive troves of user data they were collecting on a perpetual basis.  I believe consumers have a fundamental right to know what information is being collected about them. I believe they have a right to decide whether they want to share that information and with whom they want to share it and when. I believe consumers have a right to expect that companies that store their personal information will store it securely.[[Page S8173]]  I also believe all Americans deserve affordable access to high-quality telecommunications services--services they depend on to communicate with the world, get an education, and find a job. I believe the internet should remain the open platform for innovation, economic growth, and freedom of expression it has always been.  Perhaps it was the complex nature of these issues or even the financial incentive to turn a blind eye, but when I came to the Senate, very few Members of Congress were talking about corporate consolidation, commercial privacy, or net neutrality--issues that have gained much deserved attention in more recent years. Whatever the reason for other Members' hesitance, I felt it was incumbent upon me to get into the weeds on these issues so I could be a leader in the Senate and ultimately address the concerns of ordinary  That is why, when the interests of the American consumers have clashed with the desires of powerful telecommunications and technology companies, I have always tried to put the public first and to fight on their behalf by shedding light on corporate abuses and using all the tools at my disposal to curb them.  Again, it is through my work on the Judiciary Committee--and, more specifically, my work on media and technology policy--that I believe my perspective from my previous career has been of most value.  Comcast's proposal to acquire NBCU immediately made me uncomfortable because I had seen their motives for this deal before. In 1993, during my 13th season at ``Saturday Night Live,'' the Big Three networks--NBC, CBS, and ABC--pressured Congress to change the rules that had previously prevented them from owning any of the shows they aired in prime time. The purpose of the rules had been to prevent the networks from prioritizing their own shows over others or otherwise harming competing programming.  Unsurprisingly, after the rules were repealed, the networks--contrary to their guarantees and assurances they had given Congress--began giving the shows they owned preferential treatment. At the time, ``Seinfeld,'' which aired on NBC, was not owned by NBC and had been produced before the rules had changed--was the 1 show on television, which made the Thursday night timeslot following ``Seinfeld'' the most valuable real estate on television. I watched as shows that eventually wound up in that premium location were all owned, at least in part, by  So when I became a Senator, one of the first major deals I opposed was Comcast's acquisition of As in the case of AT&T's current bid to buy Time Warner, this deal was about giving one company the ability to control both the programming and the pipes that carry it. I knew from my time in media that a combined Comcast-NBCUniversal would have strong incentives to favor its own programming over that of others and restrict competing distributors from accessing that programming. I knew these incentives would hurt competing content creators, inhibit the free flow of information, and ultimately harm consumers.  Unfortunately, I was not wrong. In the years after its acquisition of NBCUniversal, Comcast repeatedly violated the terms of its agreements with the FCC and the Department of Justice, favoring its own news programming over its competitors in Comcast's channel lineup and failing to live up to its promises regarding offering affordable standalone broadband, racial diversity in programming--they did not live up to their promises there--and online video distribution. Because merger conditions are extremely difficult and costly to enforce, competition and consumers were harmed in the process.  Comcast's behavior in the wake of acquiring NBCUniversal was one of the major reasons I then opposed its proposal to turn around and buy Time Warner Cable a couple years later. It was also one of the major reasons I believe that later deal was ultimately dropped after objections from the FCC and the Department of  For a long time in the Senate, it was a lonely battle. For over a year, I was the only Senator to oppose Comcast's proposals to buy Time Warner Cable--a deal that would have given the combined company 57 percent of the broadband market--but advocates and ordinary citizens raised their voices, and together we were able to stop the deal.  Most recently, I have led my colleagues in scrutinizing AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, and I have once again called on regulators to move to block the deal for the inevitable harm it will cause to competition and consumers.  I have been proud to lead these efforts, and I leave here in a much different environment than when I arrived. I know there are strong voices in the Senate that will carry on the fight when I am gone.  These efforts to slow down and halt media consolidation are part of a very important, larger development we have seen in our country. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the American public's--and, in turn, Congress's--interest in combating corporate consolidation.  When I first entered the Senate, I wasn't sure most Americans understood what was at stake when these powerful companies wanted to combine. Vertical integration and antitrust laws sounded like obscure, almost boring, topics, but more and more Americans are getting educated about these issues, and more and more Members of Congress are working to get Washington focused on how they affect the lives of real people.  Just look at the fight for net neutrality. For many of the same reasons that I opposed Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal, I have long supported strong net neutrality rules to ensure that the internet remains a level playing field where everyone can participate on equal footing, free from discrimination by large internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT& Net neutrality preserves the internet as the engine for innovation that it has always been and allows businesses of all sizes to thrive--even when they are up against the largest, most profitable corporations. Here is just one example I found useful in explaining net neutrality:  In 2005, three guys set up shop over a pizzeria in a strip mall in San Mateo, CA, where they launched the now-ubiquitous Video-sharing websites were in their infancy, but these guys already faced competition from something that preceded it called Google Video, but Google Video wasn't very good. Because of net neutrality, YouTube was able to compete with Google Video on a level playing field. The giant internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay them to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumer homes.  They were treated the same, neutrally. The content was neutral--net neutrality. People really liked They preferred YouTube to Google Video, and YouTube thrived. In fact, in 2006, Google bought it for stock valued at $1.65 billion. That is a nice chunk for three guys over a pizzeria in San  It is not just tech companies and small businesses that rely on open internet. In a submission to the FCC in 2014, a coalition that includes Visa, Bank of America, UPS, and Ford explained that ``every retailer with an online catalogue, every manufacturer with online product specifications, every insurance company with online claims processing, every bank offering online account management, every company with a website--every business in America interacting with its customers online is dependent upon an open Internet.'' I have repeated this quote on the floor and at rallies time and time again over the years because I think it perfectly exemplifies the importance of this issue.  Preserving net neutrality is only controversial for the few deep-pocketed entities that stand to financially gain without it.  If FCC Chairman Pai ultimately has his way, we will be entering a digital world where the powerful outrank the majority, a world where a handful of multibillion-dollar companies have the power to control how users get their information, and a world where the deepest pockets can pay for a fast lane while their competitors stall in the slow lane.  For nearly 9 years, I have been calling net neutrality the free speech issue[[Page S8174]]of our time because it embraces our most basic constitutional freedoms. And ironically, the kind of civic participation that has aspired so many of us in recent months--and has effected real change, like in the fight for net neutrality and the successful efforts to save the Affordable Care Act--has depended in no small part on a free and open internet.  In 2015, the FCC's vote to reclassify broadband providers as common carriers under title II of the Communications Act didn't just mean good things for net neutrality; it also had important implications for consumer privacy. It gave the agency the authority and the responsibility to implement rules to protect Americans' privacy by giving consumers greater control of their personal data that is collected and used by their broadband providers. That was a big win. Republicans didn't see it that way. One of the first things they did this Congress was to repeal those rules, which was a huge blow to Americans' right to privacy.  For my part, I have long believed that Americans have a fundamental right to privacy. I believe they deserve both transparency and accountability from the companies that have the capacity to trade on the details of their lives. And should they choose to leave personal information in the hands of those companies, they certainly deserve to know that their information is being safeguarded to the greatest degree possible. This transparency and accountability should come from all the companies that have access to Americans' sensitive information. This includes internet service providers like Comcast and AT&T but also edge providers like Google, Facebook, and  In 2011, I served as chair for the inaugural hearing of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law--a subcommittee that I founded after it became abundantly clear that our Nation's privacy laws had failed to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies.  When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms. They talked about whether the government was trying to keep tabs on the books they read or the rallies they attended. Over the last 40 or 50 years, we have seen a fundamental shift in who has our information and what they are doing with it. That is not to say that we still shouldn't be worried about protecting ourselves from government abuses, but now we also have relationships with large corporations that are obtaining, storing, sharing and in many cases selling enormous amounts of our personal information.  When the Constitution was written, the Founders had no way of anticipating the new technologies that would evolve in the coming centuries. They had no way of anticipating the telephone, for example, and so the Supreme Court ruled over 40 years ago that a wiretap constitutes a search under the Fourth The Founders had no idea that one day the police would be able to remotely track your movements through a GPS device, and so the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that this was also a search that required court approval. All of this is a good thing. Our laws need to reflect the evolution of technology and changing expectations of American society. This is why the Constitution is often called a living document. But we have a long way to go to get to the point where our modern laws are in line with modern technology.  My goal for the subcommittee was to help members understand both the benefits and privacy implications of emerging technologies; to educate the public and raise awareness about how their data is being collected, used, and shared; and, if necessary, to legislate to fill gaps in the law. When politics prevented legislation, I repeatedly pressed companies--many of them more than once--to be more transparent about how they were treating their customers' private information, including users' location data, web-browsing histories, and even their finger and face prints.  As consumer awareness has evolved, these companies have taken important steps to improve transparency of their use of Americans' personal information. But unfortunately, accumulating massive troves of information isn't just a side project they can choose to halt at any given time; for many of them, it is their whole business model. We are not their customers; we are their product.  Recently, we have seen just how scary this business model can be. In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee examined Russia's manipulation of social media during the 2016 campaign, and both the public and Members of Congress were shocked to learn the outsized role that the major tech companies play in so many aspects of our lives, based primarily on the mass collection of personal information and complex algorithms that are shrouded in secrecy. Not only do these companies guide what we see, read, and buy on a regular basis, but their dominance--specifically in the market of information--now requires that we consider their role in the integrity of our democracy. Unfortunately, this fall's hearings demonstrated that they may not be up to the challenge that they have created for themselves.  The size of these companies is not--in isolation--the problem, but I am extremely concerned about these platforms' use of Americans' personal information to further solidify their market power and consequently extract unfair conditions from the content creators and innovators who rely on their platforms to reach consumers. As has become alarmingly clear in recent months, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have unprecedented power to guide Americans' access to information and potentially shape the future of journalism. It should go without saying that such power comes with great responsibility.  Everyone is currently and rightfully focused on Russian manipulation of social media, but as lawmakers, it is incumbent upon us to ask the broader questions: How did big tech come to control so many aspects of our lives? How is it using our personal information to strengthen its reach and its bottom line? Are these companies engaging in anticompetitive behavior that restricts the free flow of information in commerce? Are they failing to take simple precautions to respect our privacy and to protect our democracy? And finally, what role should these companies play in our lives, and how do we ensure transparency and accountability from them going forward?  Modern technology has fundamentally altered the way we live our lives, and it has given us extraordinary benefits. As these companies continue to grow and evolve, challenges like those we have recently confronted in the Judiciary Committee will only grow and evolve with them. So we must now muster the will to meaningfully address the tough questions related to competition, privacy, and ultimately the integrity of our democracy.  I will not be here to ask those questions. I will do what I can to find the answers from the outside, but it is my colleagues in the Senate who must prioritize them going forward. There is simply too much at stake. I know that they will do so with the help of a tireless advocacy community and the brilliant minds who have long contemplated these incredibly complex issues and ensured that lawmakers pay attention. And more importantly, they will do so with the support and encouragement of the American people.  I have witnessed significant highs and significant lows in the fight to protect consumers' rights, but the most important lesson I have learned along the way is that ordinary Americans can wield extraordinary power when they raise their voices. For this reason and despite significant setbacks in recent months, I know that it is the public's interests that can ultimately prevail.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

761,topic-id,1274,"Mr.President, unlike most of my colleagues, the time I spent here in the Senate represents the sum total of my experience in elected office. For most of my life I approached politics and public policy from a very different perspective. I tried to be an educated citizen who understood how the issues being debated here in Washington affected me, my family, my neighbors, and those in my State and my country. I tried to be an advocate for the values I believed in--honesty in public discourse, for sure, but also fairness, justice, and the idea that in America we are all in this together. I tried to be an activist, putting my voice and my energy behind candidates and causes that I cared for and about.  When I leave the Senate in a few weeks, I will continue trying to be an educated citizen, an advocate, and an activist. Over the last 8\1/2\ years, as I have had the privilege of serving the people of Minnesota, I also gained a new perspective on the issues we face and the way we here in Washington make decisions.  Before I go, I want to spend some time sharing some of what I have learned in a series of speeches focusing on the challenges I came to Washington to address--challenges that my colleagues will continue to wrestle with, challenges that will determine not just the political landscape we leave for the next generation of Senators but what kind of country we leave for the next generation of  Today I want to start by talking about education. Even at a time when our politics is more polarized and more poisonous than it has ever been, you would think that education is one place where Democrats and Republicans could come together to make progress. After all, while we do have significant differences on the details of education policy, nobody disagrees about the importance of getting it right. We all agree that education from pre-K through college and beyond is essential to providing our economy with a skilled workforce that is ready to innovate and lead us into the future.  Ever since I have been here, employers in Minnesota have stressed to me that they need employees with critical thinking and problem solving skills, with team work and creativity--tools that we need our children to be developing long before they enter the workforce. I am pretty sure that my colleagues hear this from employers in their States too.  Of course, education isn't just about our economy. It is about the most basic responsibility we have as human beings. Many of us who have served in the Senate have children and grandchildren, and we would do anything to be able to promise to them that when they grow up, they will be able to follow their dreams and take a risk on themselves to achieve more than we ever could. Many of us remember just how hard our own parents worked to keep that promise to us. All of us, Democrat and Republican alike, want to be able to make that promise not just to our own children but to every child in America, no matter where they grow up or what their family life is like or what obstacles they may encounter along the way.  We all want a country where every child has the opportunity to fulfill his or her God-given potential. We all understand that whether we can provide every child with a great education is the most basic measure of whether we are keeping that promise. Fortunately, the HELP Committee, which I had the honor of serving on since I first arrived in the Senate, has been led by public servants who share those values and a common commitment to delivering on that promise. Under Chairman Harkin and now under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, the HELP Committee has often been able to be an example of how Democrats and Republicans can work together to make progress.  When I first got here, the debate was focused on No Child Left Behind, which Congress had passed and President Bush had signed into law in 2002. Democrats and Republicans worked together on that bill back then because they all believed that it was important that our schools be held accountable for the results they achieved on behalf of all students. But by 2009, it had become clear that No Child Left Behind simply wasn't getting the job done.  A couple of weeks after I got to the Senate, I held a roundtable with principals at a school that had been turned around in a poor neighborhood by a great principal in One of the other principals told me that he referred to the NCLB tests as autopsies. I knew exactly what he meant. The kids were taking the tests in late The results didn't come back until late June or later--too late to let the results inform teachers' instruction of each child.  In Minnesota, therefore, most school districts added computer adaptive tests[[Page S8160]]in addition to the required NCLB tests--computers so the teachers could get the results right away and adaptive so that if a kid was getting all the questions right, the questions would get harder and if the kid was getting all of the questions wrong, the questions would get easier. That way, instead of measuring whether or not a student was appropriately proficient at grade level in reading and math, educators could find out exactly what grade level each student was at in those subjects--adaptive. NCLB, on the other hand, didn't allow a State to test outside of grade level. Schools and teachers were judged on whether a sufficient percentage of kids met this arbitrary standard. This became known as measuring for proficiency, and it created what teachers in Minnesota described to me as ``a race to the middle.'' It made them focus on kids just below or just above proficiency. So the ones just below would get above and the ones just above would stay above proficiency, and they would ignore the kid at the top because those kids at the top, no matter what you did, wouldn't go below proficiency. They would ignore the kids at the bottom because no matter what you did that year you couldn't get those kids to proficiency. So there was this race to the middle. Think about how perverse that is.  Think about a fifth grade teacher who takes a kid from a second grade level of reading to a fourth grade level of reading. Well, that kid didn't get to proficiency. So under No Child Left Behind, that teacher was a goat. But a teacher who helps a child grow by two grade levels in a single year is a hero. Teachers, principals, superintendents, school board members and parents all argued that it was time to stop measuring just for proficiency and to measure for growth or measure just growth, instead. This became quickly a central focus of the debate over how to reform No Child Left Behind, and it remains a pivotal debate when it comes to the future of our education system, which is why it was so shocking when President Trump picked a Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, who turned out to have no idea what the growth versus proficiency debate was even about.  It would be as if our children's future relied on the outcome of a football game and the President nominated a head coach who didn't know how many yards it took to get a first down. It was a deeply upsetting moment, not just because of what it revealed about ",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8159.txt,1969,"FURTHER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2018",2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1236,topic-id,4935,"Mr.President, this is my final speech on the floor of the U.I have come to the floor many times, as we all have. We come to the floor to cast our votes on bills and amendments. We come here to discuss and debate the issues that are important to our States and to the country. We introduce and explain legislation. We talk about our States and what we learned on our latest visit to a community health center, a farm, or a small business. What we don't talk about all that often is the work of all the men and women on our staffs who make all of this possible.  I have been fortunate to have had a dedicated, hard-working staff both in Washington and in Minnesota, and I have no doubt that they will go on to do great things and to serve our Nation well.  I am also very lucky to have a wonderful family who has stood by me throughout the good times and the tough times of being a As Senators, we have packed schedules. There are late nights. There are difficult votes on divisive issues and a lot of time invested in better understanding the challenges our constituents face every day. All too often, that important work doesn't leave enough time for our families. I am grateful for my wife, my children, and their spouses, who stood by me and who have helped me to do my work effectively.  Finally, as I leave the Senate, I take great comfort in knowing that my successor, Senator-designate Tina Smith, has a well-earned reputation for being a smart, diligent, hard-working public servant, and I have no doubt that Senator Smith will serve Minnesotans and all Americans exceptionally well.  When most people think about politics, they think about arguments--the arguments they have around the dinner table, the arguments they have online, and most of all, the arguments we have here in That is a big part of the reason why a lot of people just don't like politics.  Often, the debate here in Washington can sometimes seem arcane and tough to understand. Other times--especially in recent years--it can be so bitter that it doesn't even feel like we are trying to resolve anything, just venting our spleens at each other. I get that. I get why people want us to stop arguing and start doing stuff.  But since I am leaving the Senate, I thought I would take a big risk and say a few words in favor of arguments. After all, there is no single magic solution that can bring all 100 of us together because there is no one set of values that brought all of us here in the first place. I think many of my colleagues have heard me talk about what brought me to politics and what makes me a Democrat, and it is my wife  When she was 17 months old, her father, a decorated World War II veteran, died in a car accident, leaving her mom widowed at age 29 with five kids. There was one sibling younger than Franni, Bootsie, who was 3 months old. Franni's family made it--barely, but they made it--thanks to Social Security survivor benefits. Sometimes they had to turn the heat off in the winter. This was in Portland, Sometimes--often--they were hungry because there wasn't enough food. But they made it.  Franni and her three sisters all went to college on combinations of scholarships and Pell grants. At the time, a full Pell grant paid for about 80 percent of a public college education, but today it only pays about 35 percent.  When Bootsie went to high school, my mother-in-law got a GI loan for $300 and went to college. She got three more loans, graduated from college, and became an elementary school teacher. And because she taught title I kids--poor kids--all her loans were forgiven.  My brother-in-law went into the Coast Guard and became an electrical engineer.  Every member of Franni's family became a productive member of society and a member of the middle class.  They tell you in this country to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but first you have to have the boots. The Federal Government, through Social Security survivor benefits and Pell grants and the GI bill and title I, gave my wife's family the boots. That is why I am a That is why I am a  Over the years, I have heard Democrats and Republicans talk about their own values, the things they believe brought them to politics, the things that make them care about what happens here. I have learned so much from listening to the arguments we have in this country and the arguments we have here in this I have learned from I have learned to respect but not always agree with their opinions, and I have learned how their backgrounds can lead them to reach, in good faith, a conclusion that I never could have imagined. And, of course, I have learned so much from my fellow  But the person I learned the most from is someone who isn't here. For 12 years, the seat I currently occupy was held by Paul As I have said before, Paul was a tireless, passionate champion for working families--for working families in Minnesota and across the He fought for veterans, for farmers, and for those who simply needed a voice.  Paul was my friend. Paul had a saying that I think perfectly represents the values and the principles for which he fought. He used to say: ``We all do better when we all do better.'' That was Paul's creed. What Paul meant by that is that the whole country--the working poor, the middle class, and the well off--the whole country does better when each and every one of us is able to contribute to and participate fairly in our economy and in our democracy.  I think Paul was right, but not everybody does. Some people's values are different. Some people believe that those at the top are there for a reason and that they shouldn't have to concern themselves with what is going on in the lives of people who haven't been so lucky or even so accomplished. Some people believe honestly--honestly, legitimately, believe--that not everyone deserves to have the same standing in this country. They believe that your standing as a citizen should depend, in part, on where you were born or what you believe or whom you love or what you do for a living. Some people believe that at some fundamental level, we are all in this on our own. I don't agree with any of those values, but I respect that some people hold them, and that is why arguments matter.  When we argue, whether it is across the fence with your neighbor or on a cable news show or here on the floor of the Senate, it can help us sharpen our ability to articulate what we want and challenge us to examine our own views with a more critical eye and help highlight the choice for the American people, because, after all, in a democracy, the people get to choose.[[Page S8197]]  As I prepare to leave the Senate, I have been thinking a lot about my values and Paul's values--the values we share with many of my colleagues here in the Senate and many of the progressive activists I have met and worked alongside of in Minnesota and around the country. That is because, regrettably, the policies pursued by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans today could not stand in a starker contrast to the principles Paul championed and the values I have fought for during my time here in the  The values being advanced by the President and his allies in Congress simply don't represent my belief that our economy, our democracy, and our country work best when they work for everyone. Indeed, the values propelling the Republican agenda today are about consolidating political and economic power in the hands of corporations and the very wealthy.  Just take the tax bill Congress passed this week. At virtually each and every step of the process, Republicans drafting this bill chose to embrace the failed trickle-down policies of the past, crafting an enormous--an enormous--giveaway that benefits their corporate campaign backers and wealthy donors. For instance, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, by 2027, 83 percent of the benefits in the Republican tax bill will accrue to the top 1 percent of income earners; that is, people who make more than $912,000 a year. Eighty-three percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. Do we really need any other data point? Well, here is one: At the same time, the Republican tax bill would increase taxes on 35 million low- and middle-income families.  During his inaugural address, President Trump vowed that ``the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.'' But the Republican tax bill represents a slap in the face to those forgotten men and women. I guess the President forgot about them.  Make no mistake, the Senate-passed version of the Republican tax bill was deeply flawed, but when Republicans later attempted to reconcile differences between the House and Senate bills--a process that took place behind closed doors--even more favors were doled out to Republican donors and to special interests. New rules were created to give real estate developers like President Trump and his son-in-law the ability to pay less tax on passthrough income. The top individual rate, which applies to millionaires and billionaires, was cut to 37 percent--a rate lower than either the House or Senate versions of the bill. And provisions in the original bills that were designed to stop foreign corporations from avoiding taxes by shifting their profits overseas--a practice known as earnings stripping--were dropped altogether.  The problem in this country is not that the wealthy aren't doing well enough. After all, the top 1 percent of the country's population controls nearly 40 percent of its wealth. The problem is that too many working families have been left out of the economic growth that the top 1 percent has enjoyed in recent years. But rather than use the tax reform bill as an opportunity to help those working families, Republicans have instead decided to shower corporations and wealthy donors with tax breaks and special favors.  The tax bill didn't just come out of the blue--quite the contrary. This tax bill comes on the heels of countless Republican attempts to shred policies that offer protection to working families and the environment. But corporations and wealthy donors who support my Republican colleagues believe that these policies stand in the way of their profits.  Take healthcare, for example. Despite President Trump's campaign promise that ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' when his administration attempted to deliver on that promise, House Republicans devised and passed a bill that would have resulted in 23 million fewer people having health insurance, including 14 million people who rely on Facing unprecedented public outcry, Republican Senators eventually proposed a narrower bill--one that didn't repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act outright but instead undermined some of its foundational provisions. But this narrower Senate bill still would have left 16 million more Americans uninsured, all while spiking premiums by 20 percent, according to  The American people continued to fight, demanding that the Senate kill the bill. Thanks to the incredibly hard work of organizers and activists, including the American Medical Association and everyday Americans, that is exactly what happened. Republican attempts to repeal the ACA failed, but it seems my Republican colleagues have not learned their lesson.  Finding themselves unable to sustain an open assault on the Affordable Care Act, they instead included a measure in the tax bill that will repeal an essential component of that law--the individual mandate. As a result, 13 million fewer Americans will have health insurance in the years to come. But that doesn't matter to President Trump and his allies, who claim they need to repeal this central pillar of ObamaCare in order to pay for the massive tax cuts that their wealthy donors demand.  Those same wealthy donors also demand that Republicans turn a blind eye to climate change--an existential threat to humanity. Climate change is not just an environmental problem. Climate change stands to affect virtually every aspect of our lives, posing a great threat to public health, national security, our country's infrastructure, and our economy. Circumstances require that we take immediate action in order to protect the welfare of future generations.  Almost every Republican in Congress refuses to take the issue of climate change seriously. They continue to deny the underlying evidence and science behind it, even as Americans suffer the devastating consequences of their denial. This year alone, hurricanes ravaged Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin Islands, and wildfires raged across the West, most recently in Los  We know that climate change makes these extreme weather events worse, and this is just the beginning. What we are witnessing is the beginning of a new normal--a new normal that this country simply cannot endure.  It doesn't have to be this way. It is possible to address climate change while at the same time growing our economy and creating jobs. During the Obama administration, the Federal Government increased research and development investments in clean energy technology, both through tax credits designed to incentivize investment and through the energy title that I was proud to help write in the farm bill, which allowed people in rural America to participate in the clean energy revolution. Those investments paid off. Since 2009, the cost of wind power has decreased by 66 percent, and the cost of solar power has dropped by 85 percent. But we need to do more.  I championed an energy efficiency standard that would require utilities to become more efficient. I led legislation to encourage energy storage, a game changer that allows wind and solar to be used when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. I pushed to deploy distributed energy that makes our grid more resilient and reliable.  Rather than join me and my Democratic colleagues in confronting the challenge of climate change by driving innovation, Republicans ordered a retreat. At the behest of the fossil fuel industry and other corporate interests, Republicans have put forward nominees for key environmental posts who cut their teeth defending corporate polluters, not enforcing the laws that keep our air and water clean, and they have pushed an agenda that guts funding for science and innovation. The Republican strategy of denial and obfuscation isn't just an affront to the government; it is an affront to common sense.  The Trump administration and its allies in Congress have never let science or common sense stand in the way of ideology. Time and again, they have acted to roll back evidence-based, commonsense protections put in place to improve the lives of minority or marginalized communities, including women and LGBT people.  For example, in October, the Trump administration announced a new rule that guts a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires health insurance plans to cover birth control free of charge--a policy that has benefited more than 62 million American women.[[Page S8198]]The ability to access affordable reproductive healthcare has a powerful effect on the choices that women and families make every day--choices about whether to finish college, buy a home, or start a business. Ensuring that women have access to contraception is vital to the economic security of our families, and that is why I filed a brief in support of the ACA's contraceptive coverage requirement when it was challenged before the Supreme  Despite the millions of women who have benefited from the policy, and despite the science demonstrating that restricting access to contraception has negative health consequences, the Trump administration has eviscerated the policy.  In February, the Trump administration rescinded Obama-era guidelines that instructed schools on how to protect transgender students under a Federal law called title LGBT students deserve to learn in an environment free from discrimination, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. But far too often, LGBT kids, particularly transgender kids, experience bullying and harassment. When that happens, those students are deprived of an equal education. That is why I led the Senate in calling on the Obama administration to issue those guidelines back in 2015. Nonetheless, the Trump administration decided to scrap that guidance--a callous and mean-spirited decision that sent a terrible message to LGBT children and their parents and took away a tool designed to protect our children. It is our responsibility, not just as Senators but as adults--as adults--to protect our children, not turn a blind eye when they face prejudice and cruelty.  Nothing that Republicans have done is more galling, nothing poses a greater threat to the fabric of our democracy than their deliberate and sustained attack on the right to vote. Let's start with the Supreme Court's disastrous 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, a 5-to-4 decision in which the Court's conservative Justices effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act and eliminated a check on States with a history of discrimination at the polls.  After the Shelby County decision, States swiftly began to enact harsh restrictions on the right to vote, in many cases citing the myth of so-called voter fraud as justification.  Take North Carolina, for example. Just a few months after Shelby County, the State enacted one of the Nation's strictest voter ID laws. Without any evidence, the State described the new restrictions as necessary to prevent fraud. Without the protections of the Voting Rights Act, those changes went into effect, keeping poor and minority voters from casting a ballot.  When North Carolina's restrictions were eventually challenged in court, the Fourth Circuit found that the primary purpose of the restrictions wasn't to fight fraud but to make it harder for Black people to vote. The court found that ``the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision.''  The fact that North Carolina's restrictions stand as a blatant example of race discrimination is undeniable, but the strategy behind adopting such harsh restrictions is even more insidious. The strategy here is designed to ensure that voters who don't agree with their candidates or their policies aren't able to vote against them.  Paul Wellstone's words are more important today than ever before: ``We all do better when we all do better.'' I believe that to my core. But the policies pursued by President Trump and his allies are not about lifting people out of poverty or about giving the politically powerless a louder voice in our democracy. These policies are intended to line the pockets of wealthy donors and to protect the power of those who already wield outsized influence in our democracy. That is a far cry from Paul's creed.  When I think about what has gone wrong here, when I reflect on how this country has strayed so far from the values that I believe a majority of Americans share, I have to say that I think there is something wrong with the way we are arguing, and it started long before 2016. Lurking behind each of those issues isn't just a difference of opinion or a difference of values. There is something far worse: a lie.  Take, for example, the Trump administration's efforts to suppress votes. Shortly after winning the Presidential election, then President-Elect Trump was confronted with the unpleasant fact that he lost the popular vote. He tweeted: ``In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.''  Let's be clear. President Trump lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes. What he claimed in that tweet was that nearly 3 million fraudulent votes were cast. In fact, he later claimed that between 3 and 5 million illegal votes caused him to lose the popular vote, citing no evidence.  There were 138 million votes cast in the 2016 Presidential election. State election and law enforcement officials found virtually no credible evidence of fraud, and no States--not one--recorded any indication of widespread fraud--none. But that didn't stop the Trump administration from quickly turning the President's tweets into policy. The White House created a new commission to investigate the President's wild and unsubstantiated claim--a commission led by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a rightwing extremist who has made a career out of trafficking in the voter fraud myth and who was fined for repeatedly lying to a Federal court in voter ID litigation. When Kobach was asked whether he believed the President's claim that millions of people voted illegally, he said: We may never know the answer to that question. Really?  This episode could almost be considered funny if the ramifications weren't so deadly serious. Kobach's voter fraud commission requested sensitive information about voters--including names, dates of birth, party registration, and voting history--from all 50 This is information that could lay the groundwork for disenfranchising scores of eligible voters, which is why more than 40 States refused to comply with that request. At the same time, the Trump-Sessions Justice Department quickly dropped legal challenges to discriminatory voting practices in States, further signaling that protecting the right to vote will no longer be a priority of the Justice It is all based on a lie--and not a lie President Trump came up with. Rightwing conservatives have been raising a false alarm about so-called voter fraud for years despite the fact that no credible evidence has ever been produced to demonstrate that it is a real problem.  Or take the Trump administration's attacks on LGBT rights. Again and again, lurking behind these polices are lies--the lie that advocates of LGBT rights want to trample on people's religious freedom, the lie that families led by a gay or a lesbian couple don't provide safe environments for children, the lie that allowing transgender people to use the appropriate bathroom opens the door to sexual assault. President Trump didn't invent these lies, but he and his administration proudly repeat them.  Or take the attacks on science, especially climate science. We now have enough evidence to conclude that climate change is real, and it is manmade. It is a threat to our Nation's security and is an existential threat to the planet. Defense Secretary Mattis knows this; yet, for years, so-called scientists who have been funded by industry have been hard at work in casting doubt on the well-established scientific consensus. Heck, a recent Washington Post report revealed that Trump administration officials have prohibited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--our Nation's premier public health and research institute--from using the terms ``evidence-based'' and ``science-based'' in budget planning documents. President Trump didn't launch the war on science, but now he is leading the charge.  Or take healthcare. President Trump promised that everyone would have insurance, but an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office revealed that under the House Republican healthcare bill, 23 million fewer people would have had health insurance than are currently covered today--23 million people. To add insult to injury, the House bill would have hit the most vulnerable among us, and it would have hit them the hardest.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 14 million of the 23 million people who would have lost coverage[[Page S8199]]under the House Republicans' plan would have been Medicaid beneficiaries.  That is right. Despite candidate Trump's assurances that ``everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now,'' the Republican bill would have cut funding to Medicaid--a vital safety net program that ensures that our seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant women, and families with children have access to the healthcare they need. On top of that, the Republican plan would have driven up the costs of premiums, with older and sicker people having experienced the deepest increases.  Indeed, the healthcare debate has long been predicated on lies--lies that ``well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does'' is provide abortion services, the lie that women rely on birth control only because they are sexually promiscuous, the lie that the Affordable Care Act is collapsing under its own weight when, in fact, the Trump administration and the Republicans here in Congress have been doing everything they can do to sabotage it.  Then there is the tax debate. Over the last year, Republicans have repeatedly claimed that they would advance policies that are designed to benefit middle-class families, not the wealthy. President Trump pledged not to forget the ``forgotten men and women of our country.'' Steve Mnuchin, the Secretary of the Treasury, promised that the Republican tax plan would help the middle class. He vowed that any tax cuts for upper income earners would be offset by getting rid of deductions that benefit the wealthy. That is what he said, that ``there will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' Again, 83 percent of the benefits in the Republican tax bill go to the richest 1 percent. What he said is not true.  Just the other day, the White House Press Secretary claimed that President Trump, himself, will pay more because of this bill. We don't know exactly what the effect will be on his personal finances because the White House has refused to release his tax returns. They have claimed in another lie that he cannot release them because they are under audit. You can release tax returns while you are under audit. What we do know is that tax breaks in the Republican bill for real estate developers like President Trump and his family will save him millions upon millions of dollars.  I could go on and on.  Before I came to the Senate, I was known as something of an obsessive on the subject of honesty in public discourse, but as I leave the Senate, I have to admit that it feels as though we are losing the war on truth. Maybe it is already lost. If that is the case, if that is what happens, then we have lost the ability to have the kinds of arguments that have helped to build consensus--I see Lamar Alexander here; we have done that on the HELP Committee; I thank the chairman for when we have done that--or at least to have helped the American people make informed choices about the issues that affect their lives.  So what is to be done? Who will stand up and fight for a more honest debate--to insist that even though we have a different set of opinions, we cannot honorably advance our competing agendas unless we use the same set of facts? I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will stand up for truth. The thing is, I have spent enough time with my Republican friends over the last 8\1/2\ years to know that they are motivated by values just like I just hope that they will fight for those values forthrightly.  At the end of the day, it is going to be up to the American people just as it has always been. We will always have the democracy we deserve, if not the government we want. It is going to take ordinary Americans deciding to become more informed consumers of political news and opinion and deciding that they are willing to be a part of the argument themselves instead of, simply, tuning out all of the noise. If they do, I know that we will get this country back on track.  In October, 15 years after we lost Paul, I took to the Senate floor to remember him and to celebrate his life. Paul understood better than anyone I know the meaning and the power of politics, and I think he would have a lot to say about where we find ourselves today.  Paul said:       Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money.      Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning.      Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.  Even in the face of everything that is happening today, I still believe in Paul's words: ``Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.'' I know those words to be true because I know that the American people still believe in justice and equality and opportunity, and I see evidence of that every day.  I saw it in January when more than 4 million people across the United States joined in the Women's They stood in solidarity with their mothers and sisters and daughters and wives.  I saw it later that same month after President Trump issued an Executive order that sought to ban travelers from Muslim-majority countries from entering our country. Hundreds of lawyers responded to the call to help. They rushed to airports and offered their services in support of affected families.  I saw it in May when a transgender boy in Wisconsin who was discriminated against by his school had the courage to take them to court, and he won.  I saw it in September when tens of thousands of Americans mobilized in opposition to attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and succeeded in killing the bill.  I also saw it at the ballot box when voters in Virginia and Alabama resisted the temptation to give in to anger and cynicism and, instead, exercised their right to vote.  ``Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.'' The American people know that to be true, and they fill me with hope for our country.  Thank you.

410,topic-id,503,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present H.4667, a bill making emergency appropriations for hurricane and wildfire recovery.  Parts of our Nation have been devastated by multiple back-to-back hurricanes and wildfires that have caused tremendous loss of life, livelihoods, and property.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are three of the top five most expensive hurricanes in the last 25 years. Combined with the horrific wildfires that continue to rage in California, the toll that these disasters have taken is unprecedented.  We must stand by our fellow Americans to get them the help and resources they need to recover. To this end, this legislation provides a total of $81 billion for crucial Federal programs that support ongoing relief, recovery, and rebuilding.  This includes $27.5 billion for FEMA to provide relief and recovery assistance; $26.1 billion for Community Development Block Grants for shelter and housing and infrastructure improvements, and the means to help large and small businesses recover; and $12.1 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to repair and rebuild infrastructure projects that help protect against future disasters, building in resiliency.  The bill also includes $3.8 billion for the Department of Agriculture, which will support critical agriculture disaster assistance for massive crop and livestock loss.  Funding is also included to repair Federal highways and local transit systems, to help children displaced by the storms of Puerto Rico get back to school, and for small business disaster loans, which will allow businesses to reopen their doors as quickly as possible.  Our Committee on Appropriations will continue to monitor these recovery efforts to ensure accountability, transparency, and that every dollar is spent wisely. From Florida and Texas, to Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Islands, to California, and all areas dealing with major disaster declarations, this Congress is committed to helping you.  Congress has already provided $51.75 billion in two separate supplemental bills for these ongoing efforts. With this third tranche of emergency funding, it will bring the total funding for fiscal year 2018 emergency response to $132 billion. This funding is desperately needed by thousands of American families, individuals, and communities to rebuild their homes and businesses, restore electric power and critical infrastructure, and to protect against further damage. It is the duty of Congress to provide this help to our fellow Americans in their times of need.  Mr.Speaker, before I close, I would like to thank everyone who came to leadership and to the Appropriations Committee to make sure that Congress is getting the assistance to those hurricane and wildfire victims that they urgently need.  I would also like to thank the clerks and professional staff and the chairs of the 12 Appropriations Subcommittees for their working tirelessly to bring this bill to the floor and, may I say, nearly 30 others this year.  It is time to get this emergency aid to those who need it. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

446,topic-id,1216,"Mr.Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.McCarthy), the majority leader.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me and for his work.  Mr.Speaker, it is only 4 days until I look forward to going home and being with my family. I know every single Member in this body looks forward to that, too. I count my blessings that my family is safe and that I have a community and home to head back to.  There are people in this country who don't have that. Their homes were destroyed by wind, flood, and fires. Their communities were torn apart by hurricanes and flames.  Mr.Speaker, I had the somber privilege of traveling to these places. I went to Texas and spent time with Members from both sides of the aisle, seeing the flooded homes and streets filled with water. We visited NRG Stadium to meet the people forced to evacuate their homes.  I stood with Representatives like Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Randy Weber, and Brian These folks don't often agree on much in politics. But you know what we did that day? We all promised to help the people of  I flew to the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, and I would like to thank Delegate Stacey Plaskett and Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon for welcoming us and opening the eyes of the Nation to what was happening.  In the Virgin Islands, we visited a hospital. The storm left half of it unusable. No dialysis machines. They had to come to the mainland. Nurses and doctors were working, doing the best they could to help people in the most difficult of circumstances.  In Puerto Rico, we were the first congressional delegation to visit the interior after the storm. We were with Members like Jeff Denham, Anthony Brown, and Norma We met people without power for weeks, low on food, low on medicine. We saw schools and homes destroyed and completely washed away.  We then went to Florida to see the other towns hit by Hurricane Irma, places that face storms year after year.  I returned to my home State of California with Congressmen Mike Thompson and Jared Huffman during the worst wildfire season our State has ever seen. We saw the fires rage up north, where it destroyed entire communities. Forty-six people have lost their lives in the fires in California this year.  You could see the devastation, block after block. Ash heaps of homes and trees, standing like barren pillars.  I met with firefighters down south, still battling what may become the largest wildfire in California's history. As it looks right now, they will still be standing on the front lines of those fires come Christmas day.  Every single place I went, Democrats and Republicans stood together. We saw the devastation together. We spoke to the suffering that the people were having together, and together we made a promise that we would return here to Washington and work hand-in-hand to help them as soon as possible.  That is why you heard Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, on September 26, say that he would ``work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure Congress provides all funding necessary to ensure that all Americans affected by these storms can recover and rebuild.''  That is why he said on November 2 that he believes ``we can work together in a bipartisan way to ensure that the affected areas receive the resources they need from Congress.''[[Page H10392]]  That is why I appreciated joining him in an op-ed piece that was in The Washington Post on November 8, where we wrote: ``We are determined to ensure that there is strong bipartisan support for the next supplemental emergency funding package so that affected areas, such as those we visited, have the resources they need.''  Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi spoke similarly. She signed a letter with Members across California saying to President Trump that: We look forward to working with you to ensure that all Americans who have been severely impacted by recent natural disasters across the United States receive the Federal support they need and deserve.  She told the Appropriations Committee that: Congress has an urgent responsibility to the California families, whose lives have been upended by disastrous wildfires.  I couldn't agree more with these statements. In the past few weeks and months, we did--we worked together. We analyzed the damage. We studied the requests from Governors and legislators. We even made significant reforms to respond to disaster in the most effective and responsible way possible.  The legislation today is the result. It provides funding for every single State and territory affected by natural disasters.  I remind all my friends from California that this legislation accommodates exactly what our entire delegation requested.  In all this work, we did it together in a bipartisan way; the way the American people expect this body to work.  Now, I know it is the habit of this town to play politics. Mr.Speaker, I do want to tell my friends on the other side: If they feel like they have to, play politics on tax cuts. Call it whatever you want to call it. Play politics on all the other legislation that comes to this floor.  But if I can request one thing: Please don't do it here. Don't play politics on a vote to give aid to the people of Texas; to the people of Puerto Rico; to the people of the Virgin Islands; to the people of Florida, and to the people of California, who are still fighting the fires.  Don't play politics on a bill that you are going to hope to maybe stop another. That would be the worst of any politics I have seen played here.  Mr.Speaker, I beg my friends on the other side: Please don't do what they did 2 weeks ago when they whipped against the funding bill to shut the government down. If they don't like tax cuts, I understand; vot against them. If they don't want to vote for the funding of the government and they want to shut it down, fine, take that vote.  But here and now, right before Christmas, don't vote against aid for Americans who just lost everything. They don't understand the politics in it. Don't vote against aid we promised to deliver. Don't vote against aid we worked so hard together to put on this floor.  Washington, D.C., can be far from our homes. We may all be dreaming of being home with our kids, eating Christmas dinner, opening presents, and enjoying time with our family and friends; but what we do here and now has consequences. What we do here and now will either give tens of thousands of people something to hope for this Christmas, or take that hope away.  We can deliver that hope if those who stood with me on the flood plains of Texas and on the burnt hills of California keep the promise they made. We can deliver that hope if those who worked with us for so long continue to work with us today.  People need our help. Vote to give them the help they need, the help we all promised.

454,topic-id,1590,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, this bill--put together after eight public hearings, input from all Governors, all Members of Congress, and all Delegates, especially those who represent Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and California--represents a fair and a compassionate treatment of all hurricane and fire victims.  Like the first two emergency supplementals put together by our leadership, our committee, and Congress, we acted within days to help. I ask that we do it again this afternoon without delay. Get this $81 billion disaster package into the hands of the States, the territories, and the communities that continue to suffer.  Let me associate myself with the remarks of our majority leader. Let's get the money into those communities that have been suffering. That money is going to the Virgin Islands, it is going to Puerto Rico, and it is going to Florida, Texas, and There has been no discrimination at all.  This bill has been put together with the cooperation of all the chairs and ranking members, and it deserves to be acted on promptly. People are suffering. Let's get the money out the door to help them as we have done in the past on the first two supplementals.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of Division B of this bill, which has bipartisan, bicameral support of the leadership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the It includes H.4460, the ``Disaster Recovery Reform Act'', and several other Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) bills that passed the House earlier this year.  While there are many good provisions in Division B, I will focus my comments on a few provisions that I believe will have the most impact in making the United States a leader in disaster recovery. Under Division B, the Nation will be on the right track to build stronger and more resilient communities and it will encourage better behavior before and after disaster strikes.  We know that for every dollar invested in mitigation to make our communities stronger before disaster strikes, the taxpayer saves $3 to $4 in future disaster costs. Section 2036 of this bill furthers the goal of investing in mitigation before disaster strikes by establishing a steady funding stream for FEMA's Predisaster Mitigation (PDM) program.  Under Section 2036, the President must provide a specific amount of additional funding from the Disaster Relief Fund for the PDM program. The specific amount of additional funding is equal to six percent of the estimated amount of disaster assistance provided for each major disaster. The President will then distribute these funds in accordance with existing law, with a certain amount provided to each State and the remainder made available through a competitive grant process.  Section 2036 uses language similar to language in the Robert Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) authorizing FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), which is mandatory funding provided post-disaster with each disaster declaration. Although Section 2036 uses the term ``may'', the intent is that FEMA will set aside funds for the PDM program, just as they do for We have had several bipartisan conversations with FEMA confirming that FEMA understands the intent of this section and will interpret the ``may set-aside'' language included in section 2036 as mandatory. The mandatory funding for the PDM program from the Disaster Relief Fund required under this section will provide consistency to a program with a proven record of saving taxpayers money.  In addition, section 2036 authorizes FEMA to withdraw and redistribute funds that remain unobligated three fiscal years after FEMA awarded the funds to the grantee. The intent of this provision is to provide FEMA with discretionary authority to move funding that is not being used to States and projects that will use it. However, FEMA is not required to withdraw these funds from grantees and shall make these decisions on a case-by-case basis. For instance, a grantee may have commenced work on a project or is actively working on a project but the project is not at the point where funds need to be obligated. In this instance, we would not expect FEMA to withdraw the funds.  In addition, while this section will apply to PDM funds awarded prior to enactment of this Division, the intent is to give grantees three fiscal years from the date of enactment of this Act to obligate these funds. Grantees with existing PDM funds are now on notice that they have three years to obligate these funds or at least be actively working on projects that will allow those funds to be obligated shortly thereafter.  I have noted time and time again how nonsensical it is that the Federal Government pays to rebuild communities after a disaster to inadequate standards only to have those facilities destroyed again by a later disaster, with the Federal Government once again on the hook for the cost of rebuilding. Under this legislation, this nonsense will finally stop. Section 2037 requires communities to rebuild to the latest consensus-based, design standards and in a more resilient manner, thereby ensuring stronger, smarter facilities going forward. The cycle of repeatedly rebuilding and repairing disaster-damaged public infrastructure will end under this measure.  Although FEMA must define ``resilient'' and ``resiliency'' pursuant to regulations within two years of the date of enactment of this Act, FEMA is required to adopt guidance to immediately implement the ``resiliency'' requirements of this legislation. The need for resilient construction has become even more apparent after the 2017 disaster season. FEMA must use this opportunity to invest taxpayer funds wisely while saving lives and reducing injuries. FEMA has the ability to ensure that the United[[Page H10394]]States leads the way in disaster recovery and I urge FEMA to seize this moment.  Accordingly, as FEMA works to develop the definition of ``resilient'' and ``resiliency'', the agency needs to ensure that it takes into account the extent to which the improved facilities:  reduce deaths and injuries during and after a major disaster;  sustain minimal damage allowing the facility to continue to provide the primary function and services of the facility during and after a natural hazard;  prepare for and withstand all hazards that could result in a major disaster; and  reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruption to the facility's primary function and services to a facility.  In addition, any ``resilient'' facility should be constructed:  in consideration of current and future environmental conditions based upon the best-available science, changes in demand, and extreme weather events;  to reduce potential disruptions to the facility, including by building in operational redundancies, and increasing the ability of the facility to recover more rapidly; using techniques and materials that have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event;  to the maximum extent practicable, using durable and sustainable material; and  to incorporate, to the maximum extent practicable, natural and nature-based measures and energy efficiency improvements.  Currently, FEMA provides HMGP funds when a State receives a disaster declaration, but HMGP funds are not provided when a State receives a Fire Management Assistance Grant to respond to wildfires on non-Federal lands. Unfortunately, wildfires destroy the landscape often causing mudslides and flooding that then result in a disaster declaration. Under Division B, States will receive HMGP funds if they have received Fire Management Assistance Grants to respond to wildfires. With HMGP funds, States will be able to restore landscapes and vegetation destroyed by wildfires and make the land less susceptible to future mudslides and floods. This legislation also clarifies that wildfire-related mitigation activities are eligible under both the PDM and HMGP programs. Together, these provisions will help prevent wildfires and related disasters and I commend our colleague from California (Mr.Ruiz) for his leadership on these issues.  Division B also clarifies that earthquake-related activities are eligible for mitigation assistance. The West Coast faces the most risk from multiple and extreme earthquakes, and Oregon is long overdue for an earthquake and tsunami on the Cascadia Subduction Yet, the United States' earthquake early warning system lags behind those of other nations. Clarifying for grantees that mitigation funds are available for earthquake-related activities will save lives and reduce injuries in a future disaster.  Finally, important to the State of Oregon, section 2029 clarifies that for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), FEMA is not responsible for privately funded actions taken by private parties on private land. Under actions proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the entire State of Oregon would become a critical habitat, seriously impeding economic development. The proposed requirements, are so onerous, the State of Oregon, which already has strict land use regulations, would have difficulty implementing them, as they violate federal and state property rights. This provision will help ensure that FEMA implements the NFIP in a manner that is consistent from state-to-state and does not become a land use regulatory agency.  I support all of these important provisions and urge their adoption.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

1170,topic-id,392,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to present the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.1370.  This legislation keeps the government fully open, funds important national security priorities, and temporarily extends critical government programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Our duty to the American people is to keep them secure and to ensure they have access to the government programs and services they depend on.  The House must pass this bill now, today.  Without acting on this bill, existing government funding will expire tomorrow, and the government will shut down. This legislation provides a simple, clean extension of current funding levels through January of 2018.  This additional time will allow House and Senate leadership to complete their negotiations on overall spending levels. Once that is determined, my committee will complete negotiations with the Senate on all 12 appropriations bills for the rest of fiscal year 2018.  In the meantime, it is essential that Congress maintain government programs and services--for our Nation's stability, the stability of our economy, and for the security and well-being of the American people.  This bill also supports national security by providing an additional $4.7 billion in emergency funding to bolster missile defense, to protect against growing threats, and to repair damaged Navy ships.  In addition, the bill also includes $2.1 billion in mandatory funding for the VA Choice This funding will guarantee that our veterans continue to have access to the medical care they need and deserve.  Along with important funding for our Armed Forces and veterans, this bill contains temporary extensions of several critical programs that millions of Americans rely on. These include the Children's Health Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, and section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Mr.Speaker, before I close, again, I would like to thank the 12 Appropriations chairs, our 12 clerks, and the very professional staff of the Appropriations Committee for working overtime to bring this bill and others before the House today.

1218,topic-id,150,"Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that the American people need and want real tax reform, but rather than passing a strong, inclusive bipartisan bill focused on helping hardworking middle class families, today Republicans passed a bill filled with massive corporate giveaways and loopholes for the ultrawealthy.  For example, the top 1 percent in our country will receive over 82 percent of the entire tax benefit in the bill they passed today.  As long as Congress continues to pass legislation for partisan political reasons that seriously serve special corporate interests instead of the families that are struggling just to get by every day, where lobbyists have more input in the writing of this legislation than many Members of Congress, the American people lose.[[Page H10233]]  Mr.Speaker, I oppose this legislation today.

1135,topic-id,1363,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair for this time to talk about something that is rather important. Something we did today was to pass a horrendous tax cut that doesn't meet this fundamental goal.  Really, whenever we legislate here, we really ought to keep in mind our values: What is the purpose? What are we trying to accomplish? What is the goal? What is the human value that we are trying to put in place?  I often use this because it is here in Washington at the FDR It is on the marble there: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much.''  Let me read that again, Franklin Delano Roosevelt: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  I want to use this as my compass, my guiding light on where we need to go. So this afternoon, this House of Representatives, by a vote of, I think, just over 200 voted to enact a tax law that goes in exactly the opposite direction of what FDR would say is our value, our goal.  Here it is. The Speaker of the House came here to bring down the gavel to announce the vote that he was so proud to have.  Eighty percent of the individual tax cuts don't go to the poor, don't go to the middle class. They go to the top 1 percent.  How does that fit with what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said to the American Nation during the height of the Great Depression?  You may as well take Franklin Delano Roosevelt's words, turn them on their head, because this House didn't follow the edict, didn't follow the value, but did exactly the opposite: gave away, to the top 1 percent, even greater wealth.  How could that be? Why would they do that? Why would they do that?  Well, I don't know why they would do it, but they surely did it. And in addition to that, not just the wealthy 1 percent, the wealthy 10 percent, why don't you add American corporations to that who are awash in cash? $2.5 trillion in the bank accounts of American corporations, and they don't know how to spend it to create jobs in the United  Instead, the Republicans, today, decided they needed $1.43 billion additional cash as a result of the tax cut that no Democrats, not a one, but every Republican voted for, $1.43 billion--the number is from the Joint Committee on Taxation--of new after-tax revenue to American corporations.  And what do you suppose they are going to do with that? Create jobs in the United States? Expand their manufacturing? Or higher wages for their workers?  I will tell you what they intend to do with it. This is it. The corporate tax giveaway will give Wells Fargo an 18 percent earnings increase.  How do they intend to spend it? Hint: Not on jobs.  In his own words, Tim Sloan, CEO of Wells Fargo, December 2017--I think that is this month--said: ``Is it our goal to increase return to shareholders and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer . . . is yes. So our expectation should be that we will continue to increase our dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and the year after that.''  All right, Mr.You can thank the Republicans, because when you buy back your shares, when you increase your dividends, guess what. The stock price goes up, and we know that your compensation is based on stock price. Are you going to use that extra money for loans to small businesses? to farmers? No, you are not. You are not going to make more loans.  This is replicated across the American corporate culture. This is not unique. This new after-tax bonus that the Republicans are giving to American corporations is going to be used for the benefit of the wealthy. So you can add, if you will, to the tax cuts that are coming as a result of the reduction in the top income tax bracket for individuals from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, you can add to it, but, by the way, their investment portfolio is going to go up also.  This tax program is an abomination, and it is going to hurt every American over time.  I am joined here tonight by my colleagues who are probably as riled up about this as I am. I am not sure which one of them came in first.  I yield to the gentleman from the State of Oregon, Peter DeFazio, my colleague.[[Page H10235]]    Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for explaining in some detail what the impacts of this legislation are and who is going to benefit. The gentleman is a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on which I am the ranking member.  I just want to say, we have been waiting for the trillion-dollar Trump infrastructure plan for a year now, and what we are hearing is, well, they just can't afford it. We can't afford to rebuild America's infrastructure.  So let's compare the impact of a few of these tax cuts to what we could have done or could do with that money. Every tax cut means the government forgoes revenue.  So let's just take the estate tax. Doubling the exemption from an $11 million to $22 million estate, that costs $100 billion. If we invested that $100 billion in infrastructure, we would create 1.5 million working family wage jobs for Americans--1.5 million jobs. Now, I suppose those people with the cuts in the estate tax, they are going to trickle something on working people, probably not jobs, though.  And let's look at one of my favorites, the passthrough. We are going to help small business. Well, no, we are not really going to help small business. If you work in your small business, you are not going to get a tax break. If you are a passive investor in a so-called small business or passthrough entity, you get a big tax break.  Now, the President says he won't benefit. He owns 500 passthrough businesses according to his financial disclosure. Each one of those will give him a massive tax break.  Well, that little beauty costs $600 billion. For $600 billion, if we invested it in infrastructure, we could create 9 million jobs. These passive investors in oil and gas and real estate, how many jobs are they going to create? Again, they might hire another manservant or someone to cut the lawn or someone to wax the yacht, but it's not going to be 9 million jobs, and it isn't going to be at family wages--Davis-Bacon wages, I might say, really good wages.  Let's just look at one item, the top rate. That only goes to people who earn over $500,000 a year. They are going to get a substantial break. About $130 billion it is going to cost us to give a tax break to people who earn over $500,000 a year, more of the trickle class, and that would have created 2 million family wage jobs rebuilding America's infrastructure, and not just benefiting the people who do the work.  And it isn't just construction. It is design. It is engineering. It is small business. And just think of all the benefits in terms of the movement of goods and people and how it makes America more competitive.  What a sad day it is when, as you pointed out very well, we are giving this money--three-quarters of it goes to corporate tax breaks, three-quarters. The last time we gave corporations a big tax cut under Bush when they repatriated almost $1 trillion, 93 percent of the money was spent on stock buybacks, dividends, and executive bonuses. I don't know what they did with the other 7 percent because those same corporations actually reduced employment.  So what a false promise this is. A very, very sad day. I thank the gentleman for bringing this to the attention of the American people.

1136,topic-id,445,"I thank the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for making a very clear case on how we might better spend our money.

Mr.Speaker, today is a sad day in America, as the House passed an unholy tax scam of a tax bill. This bill was rushed through Congress with no hearings, no Democratic votes, and no Democratic amendments. This Republican tax scam is being deceptively sold as a benefit for the middle class, but the real winners will be the big corporations and those on the cover of Forbes 400 richest  The Republican tax scam will increase the national debt by almost $2 trillion, burdening our children or giving a Christmas bonus to the wealthiest  The Republican tax scam permanently lowers the corporate tax rate while the child tax credit increase expires in 2025. In other words, big corporations get a permanent tax cut while the middle class receives a temporary tax cut.  This tax scam places a cap on State and local taxes for individuals, targeting punishment for Democratic This is a new low for our democracy. The Republican tax scam also repeals the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. This will cause 13 million Americans to lose their health insurance. Taking healthcare away from those who elected us is shameful.  Earlier today, we heard from Ady Barkan, who was recently diagnosed with Many will recognize Ady from the video of him confronting Senator Flake in an airplane.  Ady spoke passionately this morning about the dangers of this tax scam. As he was finishing, he talked about the opportunity we have to come back and do a real tax reform, in 2018, and do so in a bipartisan way. His hope for what a good tax bill should look like struck me. He said that we should come back and negotiate a tax bill that elevates human dignity, instead of promoting human misery.  This Republican tax scam will hurt millions of Americans, many who are already struggling. We need a bipartisan solution to tax reform, not a special interest scam that benefits the wealthiest.  Mr.Speaker, Americans should have no doubt this tax scam will hurt them and the economy. Forget about investing in infrastructure. Forget about investing in education. Forget about investing in research. You better start worrying about Medicare and Social This tax scam will make America a Third World nation.  Mr.Speaker, this tax scam is a disgrace.

1146,topic-id,516,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Mr.Price of North Carolina so very much. His thoughtful discussion of this is much appreciated.  He mentioned the deficit issue. $1.5 trillion does not include the interest on the $1.5 trillion. So if you were to add the interest to the $1.5 trillion, it would actually probably be over $2 trillion to $2.3 trillion that this will cost. The actual reduction in revenues, $1.5 trillion, interest on top of that another $600 billion or so, so we are looking at something really serious here.  I would like to go through some of the numbers.  I looked at this. This is not something that is off 10 years from now. This is now.  In 2019, the structural deficit that is already in place, without even talking about this additional burden of increased deficit, the underlying structural deficit in 2019 is right around $600 billion. This tax bill will add maybe $250 billion to $300 billion of additional debt in 2019. So we are going to get very close to $1 trillion of deficit in 2019.  And, by the way, the military budget is increased by about, I think it is over $50 billion. That is not paid for, so that is additional debt. That is going to be here on the floor tomorrow or the next day.  In addition to that, there is this ongoing effort to deal with the hurricanes, fires, and so forth. That is another $120 billion that is not paid for.  So if you take $120 billion, you take $50 billion, and you take the $250 billion to $300 billion in the tax bill and you add that to the $600 billion that exists to begin with, in 2019, it will be over $1 trillion of new debt. And I will guarantee that the exodus, the migration of the deficit hawks from Washington, D.C., during December of 2017 will reverse in the warmer weather, coming back next year. And those deficit hawks will come back, they will come back to Congress, and they will go right after the programs that FDR talked about: those who have the least.  Our colleague, Mr.DeFazio, from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee talked about what we could do if we had the money in infrastructure or if we had that billion dollars; 15,000 people would be employed. But we won't--we won't--have an infrastructure program, and they will be back here.                              {time}  1815  They will be back here to make cuts in the social safety net, as the Speaker has already said he intends to do. Medicaid, $800 billion to $1 trillion reduction in Medicaid over the next decade.  Who are the beneficiaries of Medicaid?  We think they are the people on welfare. Well, yes, but some 60 percent of Medicaid recipients are seniors, seniors in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.  I thank Mr.Price very much for joining us.  I think I am going to stop for just a moment and turn to my colleague from the great State of If the gentleman would care to join us, I yield to Mr.Raskin for his remarks.

1154,topic-id,416,"Well, if their tax bill is for their donors, we have a pretty good idea who the beneficiaries of the tax bill are. So the donors are the plutocrats, the superwealthy. It is Wall Very much it is Wall Street because this is really about raising the stock price.  I think Mr.Raskin may not have been here when I put this up, but I am going to do it one more time. It has been clear that before the 1980s, 50 percent, maybe 55 percent, 60 percent of the after-tax income of corporations went into creating a bigger corporation, into manufacturing jobs, plant equipment, hiring more people, paying better wages.  Beginning in the mid-1980s or so, that began to shift so that, today, exactly the opposite occurs. Maybe 70, 80 percent of the after-tax profits now go into buying back stock, increasing the stock price, higher dividends.  Case in point: the corporate tax giveaway in this bill, which is actually--I said earlier it was $1.4 trillion reduction in corporate taxes over the next decade. It is actually $1.3 trillion. My apologies for being incorrect.  $1.3 trillion reduction in corporate taxes. For a company like Wells Fargo, a rather major bank, the corporate tax giveaway will give Wells Fargo an 18 percent earnings increase.  How does Wells Fargo intend to spend it?  Not on jobs.  Here is what the CEO of Wells Fargo, Mr.Tim Sloan, said in December of 2017. That is this month. He said: ``Is it our goal to increase return to shareholders, and do we have an excess amount of capital? The answer to both is `yes.' So our expectation should be that we will continue to increase our[[Page H10240]]dividend and our share buybacks next year and the year after that and the year after that.''  So where are the jobs?  May I cite one other example. Lowering the corporate tax rate was said to be an incentive for corporations to invest. Well, here is one of the great American corporations.  Are they investing?  I think not. They are buying back stock.  AT&T, another major American corporation, effectively reduced its tax rate to 8 percent over the last decade. So they are paying not 21 percent, as this bill would require. They are paying 8 percent.  Did they create jobs?  During that same period of time, they laid off 80,000 workers.

1158,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, from their own mouth comes from the truth of what Mr.Raskin said. They have said it very clearly, they need to do this for their contributors.  Who are their contributors? Well, the wealthy, the superwealthy, and the rest.  Mr.Speaker, I think we are going to wrap it up here. I want to thank Mr.Raskin for his participation. I want to thank my colleagues who came to the floor tonight to express their dismay at what has happened.  Now, because the bill was rushed through without any public hearings, there were errors in the bill that require that the Senate take the approved conference committee report and modify it, which I suppose means there has to be yet another conference committee, modify it, remove the errors that are in conflict with the Senate rules, and send it back here. Presumably, that will be done tomorrow.  Maybe now, as we bring to the attention of the American public the way in which this tax bill is harmful to the economy, harmful to the American middle class, and will result in 83 million Americans immediately paying higher taxes, and over the period of time, everybody that is less than $100,000, maybe $150,000, will be paying higher taxes, but the wealthy and the corporations will go on and have their lower taxes for many, many years to come, all of that hopefully will begin to sink in on the American public, and they will rise up in indignation and call a halt to what is a major rip-off of the American Treasury and America's future.  So we will continue to talk about this in the days ahead, and those who have voted for this are going to be held responsible and accountable as the days and the months go by.  Keep in mind that the Texas Two-Step is very much in play, and that, in the days ahead, in the next year, as the weather warms, the returned migration of the deficit hawks will take place, and they will go after Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, education, children's health, and other programs that men and women of America rely upon, and perhaps many, many more.

740,topic-id,1784,"Mr.President, I rise today to note this Congress's historic achievement in reforming the Nation's tax system for the first time in 30 years. I congratulate the hard-working teams, the staffers, and others from the Budget, Finance, and Energy Committees and their colleagues in the House for the work they have done.  It is not easy to modernize a Tax Code that has languished for over 30 years. Many groups have worked for a long time to solidify their special benefits, and they don't want to see those perks or special benefits go away. Many others just don't know how to work things under the status quo and think that must be the only way to do things, is to find a new status quo that represents the old status quo.  Reforming the Tax Code is not easy, but it is important. It is important to America's economy. It is important to America's working families. It is important to It is important for a lot of reasons. For instance, right now, we waste 6 billion hours and $263 billion just to file our taxes every year. After this reform, 92 percent of taxpayers will take the standard deduction. That simplifies the code, cuts those hours, and eliminates wasted dollars.  Perhaps most importantly, it will shake our economy out of its slow-walking recovery. While there are booming areas in our country--and undoubtedly Colorado's Front Range represents some of the best examples of booming areas in our Nation--there are many areas of the country that haven't seen the growth and have, quite frankly, been left behind. They haven't seen their wages go up for a long time. In fact, yesterday the Denver Post published two stories about wages. Those stories point out that median wages in Colorado in 2016 were still below the levels of 2007 and even 2000. While I appreciate these reports, the fact is, we knew it wasn't anything unheard of. It certainly isn't new to those Coloradans who live outside of the Front Range and who they haven't seen their wages grow. It is a reality they have been dealing with for far too long.  Over the years, wages have become detached from corporate profits, and this chart is a good example of what has occurred. Prior to 1990, a 1 percent increase in corporate profits led to a greater than 1 percent increase in worker wages. But from 2008 to 2016, a 1 percent increase in corporate profits led to only a 0.3 percent increase in wages.  What you can see right here is the corporate rate over time. You can see that in 1990, 1986, the U.rate remained at 35 percent, what is today, for at least a little bit longer, the highest statutory tax rate in the world when it comes to business rates. You can see OECD nations have dramatically dropped theirs beginning in 1990 and going down through today. That is what has happened. Over that same period, our once-competitive corporate tax system has gotten more and more out of date. Our corporate rate today, as I said, is about the same as it was 30 years ago--35 percent. Meanwhile, foreign countries, such as Germany, France, Italy, and even Socialist Greece, have lowered their tax rates. Now America has the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, and Europe has an average statutory rate of around 18.5 percent. So American businesses have shifted their work overseas. New factories were built in Poland, not New offices opened in Dublin, not With fewer opportunities, American wages stagnated.  The empirical data on this is clear. We have another chart to talk about this. High-tax countries see anemic wage growth--well under 1 percent a year--but low-tax countries see much stronger growth--between 1 and 4 percent.  You can see right here on the red line--this line represents the highest statutory corporate rates in the world, the 10 countries with the highest statutory corporate rates. They have less than 1 percent wage growth. You can see the lowest statutory corporate rates--the countries that represent the bottom 10 statutory rates in the world have wage growth at 4 percent a year. That is clear data--growth between 1 and 4 percent in low-tax countries.  Make no mistake, America is on the red line because we have an out-of-date corporate Tax Code--an out-of-date Tax Code that we have begun to address.  Lowering the corporate tax rate has historically had support on both sides of the aisle, including something President Obama said back in 2011 in his State of the Union Address at a joint session of But suddenly, over the last couple of months, that is not the case anymore, and sadly I suspect that opposition to tax cuts has more to do with partisan politics than the merits of the proposal.[[Page S8168]]  Whatever the reason, instead of reaching out and working together, we have heard a parade of horrors: It will run up deficits. It only benefits the wealthy. Instead of investing in workers to make more profits, businesses will just hoard their money. We have even heard that provision after provision will literally kill people.  As we heard objections get more and more outlandish, including the Biblical end of time, we heard the critiques get even more petty. We even heard the other side use procedural rules to complain about the title of the bill. What we haven't heard is how those opposed to this bill would solve the wage problem. They don't have a theory about why wages have stagnated or a vision for how to get them moving again, but we do. We passed it last night, and this reform will start to move wages again. This reform makes our corporate tax rates competitive again. It removes the incentive to invest abroad rather than right here at home.  It is no surprise that the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business--the organization that represents small businesses across this country--the National Retail Federation, the National Association of Home Builders, and the American Farm Bureau Federation support this bill.  In fact, you can see this small portion of a stack of letters I received from hundreds of farmers from across the State of Colorado who wrote to my office and said: I would like to join Colorado Farm Bureau to support tax reform that works for Colorado's farmers and ranchers. There are hundreds of people saying: Please help reform our Tax Code; cut our taxes. These letters came from real Coloradans, people from all four corners of the State who know how important real reform is to them. These groups know that this reform--these individuals know that this reform translates into more growth for the American economy, higher wages for American workers.  The Tax Foundation has estimated that this reform will bring 339,000 new, full-time equivalent jobs, increase GDP, and raise workers' wages. I have heard a lot of doubt about that part. I have heard a lot of people say that no wage growth is going to occur, that no money will come from these greedy corporations. But look at the news today, because today companies across America have already started to respond to this pro-growth tax reform.  Just hours ago, AT&T announced that it will invest an additional $1 billion in the United States in 2018 and that it will give more than 200,000 of its U.employees a bonus of $1,000--all because of the tax relief bill that we have been working on that we passed today. Similarly, today Boeing announced that it will make a $300 million investment in charitable giving, worker training and education, and infrastructure and facility enhancements. Both of these companies made it very clear that these investments--over $1 billion of investment and $1,000 to 200,000 employees in the United States--are because of the tax bill that the House passed today and that we passed early this morning.  There is more on the way, but the business side isn't the only way it brings relief to American families and it is certainly not the most important. The reforms we have made on the personal side will deliver relief to Americans across the  A family of four earning the median American income of $73,000 will see their tax bill go down by $2,000, and that is nearly 60 percent next year from what it was this year. A single parent with two children and an income of $52,000 will see a tax cut of nearly $1,900. In a nation where too many people can't pull together $100 in 24 hours, these tax reductions alone are an enormous benefit. These are real benefits to the American people.  Although there may be some naysayers in Washington who apparently have plenty of money, to people in Colorado, people in the West, people across this country, that is a big deal. These are benefits to real people, and I am glad to be a part and honored to be a part of delivering this real relief.  I am also proud to have done this in a way that creates many provisions that are especially important to We have made it easier to take advantage of the medical expense deduction. We have expanded the child tax credit and the 529 programs. We have protected other education provisions, such as the student loan interest deduction and tax breaks for America's teachers. We have made sure our farming co-ops are treated fairly, and we have made sure our growing brewing and distilling industry is treated fairly as well. We have made a dent in the unfair death tax, and that is a big deal for the hundreds of farmers and ranchers who have contacted my office. We have ended the ObamaCare individual mandate, so no longer will the people in Colorado who earn less than $50,000 be subjected to a tax fine, a penalty by the IRS, simply because they can't afford an unaffordable ObamaCare policy. We have helped ensure America's energy security by opening up new resource opportunities in a responsible manner, making sure that we simultaneously ensure that Colorado's renewable energy industry continues to flourish by making sure that today's credits for wind, solar, and refined coal are still available. That is what we did in this legislation.  Mr.President, this is historic reform. I am proud to be a part of it. I am proud to have voted for it. We can already see today that as a result of the work we have done, Americans are seeing the benefit.  Mr.President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

If the President will not lead, then Congress must lead, and we need to lead now.

It is about people's lives, and I am not going to compromise on that.  Mr.President, are you willing to compromise on that?  We need to fix this problem, and we don't have a lot of time to do it.

133,topic-id,644,"Mr.Speaker, it has been quite a week: ups and downs and not knowing whether bills would be passed or the government would be funded, whether we would be able to help America with a much-improving economy in the new year by passing the tax cut bill. But we got it done, and it ended up being a good week, and here we are.  This will be the last opportunity to speak before we are out for Christmas, and I heard some good news today about We have the annual Presidential Prayer Breakfast the first Thursday of February each year, except when the first Thursday is on the 1st, and then it is on the 8th, which it will be this  We had representatives from the Ukraine Government come to our National Prayer Breakfast here, and they started one there and began to grow. Now, for the first time, Ukraine legislature has passed a bill recognizing a celebration of Christmas, the day of Jesus' birth. We celebrate Jesus' birth on that day, December 25.  Apparently, from what we are told, it emanates from them coming over, being part of our Prayer Breakfast, where the President comes, and then starting one. And then now we are going to be celebrating the birth of Jesus in America--all those who care to--at the same time the Ukrainian Government will do so. So that is a big bit of news there.  I was listening to the Delegate from the District of Columbia and it took me back to when I first got here as a Member of Congress and I saw the license plate saying, ``Taxation Without Representation.'' I know from studying history--never ceasing to study history that that was one of the war cries for the Revolution: Taxation without representation is tyranny.  And as Benjamin Franklin once said: If we do not get to select even one of the people in Parliament, then that Parliament has no right to place any tax on us.  And then upon hearing that, Puerto Rico, Guam, Mariana Islands, U.Virgin Islands, all of the territories where they have a Delegate or Commissioner but they don't have a full voting member, those are areas that are not required to pay any Federal income tax. In fact, when I found out, the more I looked into it, there is only one place in America where people do not elect a full voting Member of Congress, yet they have to pay Federal income tax, and that is here in the District of  For that reason, I filed a bill--because they had tried to get a full voting Member of But to do that, you have to have a constitutional amendment. Everybody knew that and agreed to that back in the late 1970s. The proponents of having a full voting Representative got it through the House, got it through the Senate, but they never did get the requisite number of States to sign on, so it failed without ever being ratified by enough  I feel sure that would be the case if that were attempted again, but it does require an amendment. And since that doesn't appear it is going to happen anytime soon, then I believe in each of the sessions of Congress I have been, I have filed a bill that would correct that injustice, because it truly is an injustice for the people who live in the District of Columbia, and it is very simple. It just says, basically, that until when and if the District of Columbia has a full voting Representative, they are like any other U.territory, they will not have to pay Federal income tax.  I felt like that would certainly make people appreciate that, that they were treated like those in other places that don't elect a full voting Member of the So far I haven't been able to get ",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10411.txt,1801,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
136,topic-id,2707,"Mr.Speaker, I am always happy to share time with my friend from west We are on opposite sides of the State but same sides of the heart caring for this country.  We have got a lot to be thankful for in this country, and I am thankful that we are going to have 11 months for people to realize that all the gloom and doom that was preached in this room about what the tax bill was going to do. The tax cuts, the reforms, it wasn't made as simple as I would hope, just a flat tax across the board. But there will be more people who don't pay tax, and most everybody should pay less tax.  It is just amazing the things that have been said. One person even said this is the worst bill ever, the tax bill, when--wow, I would have thought those bills that were really punishing slaves and allowing the continuance of slavery, those might have been, well, in my opinion, just nowhere near the same category. But according to at least one source here across the aisle, this tax bill was worse than all of those, the worst bill ever.  But people are going to have 11 months to see that, even though the stock market was doing better, people weren't really doing better. Incomes had been pretty well flat-lined.  I think there is going to be a great deal to be grateful for. Now it is not just going to be the stock market going up, it is going to be Americans having more money in their own pockets. There are going to be more jobs. There are going to be people making more than they have in the past.  There will be a chance for many in the upcoming generation to experience what many of us did coming out of school, but most of them haven't, and that is having multiple firms, companies, employers, wanting them. It is just going to be a new experience for so many. And I hope when it happens, they will do as our Founders did and know where to give the proper credit.  John Adams, in the fall of 1798, to the officers of the First Brigade--he was President at the time, having succeeded President Adams said: ``We have no government armed with power, capable of contending with human passions, unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.''                              {time}  1900  It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.  John Adams, on December 25, 1813, what we call Christmas Day, wrote to his new friend. They had been friends, then when Jefferson had been greatly unfair in the election, defeated Adams, they had nothing to do with each other for many years. Then at Benjamin Rush's recommendation, Adams wrote Thomas Jefferson, and they rekindled a great friendship.  December 25 of 1813, former President John Adams wrote to former President Thomas Jefferson, and said:  ``I have examined all religions as well as my narrow sphere, my straightened means, and my busy life would allow; and the result is that the Bible is the best Book in the world. It contains more philosophy than all the libraries I have seen.''  Thomas This is inscribed in his monument.  Mr.Speaker, I share this as we leave session the last time before Christmas, because I find that so many people get upset when we mention God or mention the Bible here in Congress, when actually that is the most oft-cited thing in our whole history of  People have been mis-educated, and this is the one chance to thank God, Mr.Speaker, and help people realize how we came to be as we are.  Thomas Jefferson said:  ``God who gave us life gave us liberty.''  ``And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That they are not to be violated, but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that His justice cannot sleep forever.''  Mr.Speaker, this was a time when people had turned from God, and it was scaring Jefferson because he knew, as Adams did, if we were not a religious and moral people, the Constitution would cease to serve the needed purpose.  Madison has such great pronouncements. As Madison himself said in 1815:  ``No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of the Great Disposer of events and of the Destiny of nations than the people of the United To the same divine author of every good and perfect gift, we are indebted for all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.''  He also referred to our Heavenly  Monroe, same type of messages.  John Quincy Adams, he wrote his son, 1811:  `` . . . so great is my veneration for the Bible, and so strong my belief, that when duly read and meditated on, it is of all books in the world, that which contributes most to make men wise and happy--that the earlier my children begin to read it, the more steadily they pursue the practice of reading it throughout their lives, the more lively and confident will be my hopes that they will prove useful citizens to their country, respectable members of society. . . . `'  Abraham Lincoln said this, and it was official. This was his proclamation. Those that think it is inappropriate for government to say these things, this was Abraham Lincoln, who knew wherein our hopes lie.  Lincoln said in his official proclamation:  `` . . . it is the duty of nations, as well as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope, that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon, and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations are only blessed whose God is the Lord.''  In his second inaugural, just 45 days before he was struck down by an assassin's bullet, Abraham Lincoln was trying to make sense of such a bloody, horrific war between the North and South, and it is inscribed on the inside wall of the Lincoln Memorial on the north side. Thank God, literally, thank God no one has required that those beautiful words be removed.  But he was trying to reconcile how there could be something so bloody and[[Page H10415]]awful if there were a good and just Obviously, he had done a lot of theological wrestling with that issue, and in talking about the North and South, Abraham Lincoln said:  ``Both''--North and South--``read the same Bible and pray to the same God.''  ``The prayers of both could not be answered. The prayers of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has his own purpose.''  But then he quotes Scripture: ``Whoa unto the world because of offenses.''  Lincoln continues on:  ``Yet, if God will that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with a sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so it must be said.''  And again quoting the Bible: ``The judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.''  All Presidents have had these types of proclamations.  I like the proclamation Grover Cleveland had in November 1885. Official U.Government proclamation. He said:  ``The American people have always abundant cause to be thankful to Almighty God, whose watchful care and guiding hand have been manifested in every stage of their national life, guarding and protecting them in time of peril and safely leading them in the hour of darkness and of danger.  ``It is fitting and proper that a nation thus favored should on one day every year, for that purpose especially appointed, publicly acknowledge the goodness of God and return thanks to Him for all His gracious gifts.''  Moving to Franklin Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt delivered this Christmas Eve message just weeks after we were attacked at Pearl  Franklin Roosevelt said:  ``Sincere and faithful men and women are asking themselves this Christmas: How can we light our trees? How can we give our gifts? How can we meet and worship with love and with uplifted spirit and heart in a world at war, a world of fighting and suffering and death? How can we pause, even for a day, even for Christmas Day, in our urgent labor of arming a decent humanity against the enemies which beset it? How can we put the world aside, as men and women put the world aside in peaceful years, to rejoice in the birth of Christ?''  Franklin Roosevelt went on to say:  ``Looking into the days to come, I have set aside a day of prayer, and in that proclamation, I have said: The year 1941 has brought upon our Nation a war of aggression by powers dominated by arrogant rulers whose selfish purpose is to destroy free institutions. They would thereby take from the freedom-loving peoples of the Earth the hard-won liberties gained over many centuries. The new year of 1942 calls for the courage. Our strength, as the strength of all men everywhere, is of greater avail as God upholds us.  ``Therefore, I''--this is Franklin Roosevelt--``do hereby appoint the first day of the year 1942 as a day of prayer, of asking forgiveness for our shortcomings of the past, of consecration to the task of the present, of asking God's help in days to come. We need His guidance that this people may be humbled in spirit, but strong in the conviction of the right. Steadfast to endure sacrifice, and brave to achieve a victory of liberty and peace. Our strongest weapon in this war is that conviction of the dignity and brotherhood of man, which Christmas Day signifies. Against enemies who preach the principles of hate and practice them, we set our faith in human love and in God's care for us and all men everywhere.''  He had so many beautiful, beautiful messages.  One ended like this:  ``It is significant that tomorrow, Christmas Day, our plants and factories will be stilled. That is not true of the other holidays we have long been accustomed to celebrate. On all other holidays, work goes on, gladly, for the winning of the war. So Christmas becomes the only holiday in all the year. I like to think this is because Christmas is a holy day. May all it stands for live and grow throughout the years.''  Harry Truman, who succeeded him after his death, finished one of his Christmas proclamations this way:  ``Our thoughts and aspirations and the hopes of future years turn to a little town in the hills of Judea where, on a winter's night 2,000 years ago, the prophecy of Isaiah was fulfilled.  ``Shepherds keeping the watch by night over their flock heard the glad tidings of great joy from the angels of the Lord singing: `Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth, peace, good will toward men.' ''  It is not just from the This is the President of the United States' official proclamation, government proclamation.  Truman said:  ``The message of Bethlehem best sums up our hopes tonight. If we as a nation, and the other nations of the world, will accept it, the star of faith will guide us into the place of peace as it did the shepherds on that day of Christ's birth long ago.  ``We shall find strength and courage at this Christmastime because so brave a beginning has been made. So with faith and courage we shall work to hasten the day when the sword is replaced by the plowshare and nations do not `learn war anymore.'  ``Selfishness and greed, individual or national, cause most of our troubles.''                              {time}  1915  ``He whose birth we celebrate tonight was the world's greatest teacher. He said: `Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men would do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.' Through all the centuries since He spoke, history has vindicated His teaching.  ``In this great country of ours has been demonstrated the fundamental unity of Christianity and democracy. Under our heritage of freedom for everyone on equal terms, we also share the responsibilities of government. Our support of individual freedom--free speech, free schools, free press, and a free conscience--transcends all our differences. Although we may not hope for a New Heaven and a New Earth in our day and generation; we may strive with undaunted faith and courage to achieve in the present some measure of that unity with which the Nation's sons and the sons of our allies went forth to win the war.  ``We have this glorious land not because of a particular religious faith, not because our ancestors sailed from a particular foreign port. We have our unique national heritage because of a common aspiration to be free and because of our purpose to achieve for ourselves and for our children the good things of life which the Christ declared He came to give to all mankind.  ``We have made a good start toward peace in the world. Ahead of us lies the larger task of making the peace secure. The progress we made gives hope that in the coming year we shall reach our goal. May 1947 entitle us to the benediction of the Master.''  ``Master'' is capitalized. He is talking about  He quotes Jesus saying: `` `Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.' Because of what we have achieved for peace, because of all the promise our future holds, I say to all my countrymen: Merry Merry Christmas, and may God bless you all.''  I just want to conclude, Mr.Speaker, with this best message, Ronald Reagan's 1988 official Christmas message. He said: ``The themes of Christmas and of coming home for the holidays have long been intertwined in song and story. There is a profound irony and a lesson in this because Christmas celebrates the coming of a Savior who was born without a home.  ``There was no room at the inn for the Holy Weary of travel, a young Mary, close to childbirth, and her carpenter husband, Joseph, found but the rude shelter of a stable. There born the King of Kings, the Prince of Peace--an event on which all history would turn.  ``Jesus would again be without home, and more than once; on the flight to Egypt and during His public ministry when He said: `The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath nowhere to lay his head.'  ``From His very infancy, on, our Redeemer was reminding us that, from then on we would never lack a home in Like the shepherds to whom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, we could always say: `Let us now go even unto Bethlehem[[Page H10416]]and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.'  ``As we come home with gladness to family and friends this Christmas, let us also remember our neighbors who cannot go home themselves. Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all year long will mean much to the hospitalized, the homeless, the convalescent, the orphaned--and will surely lead us on our way to the joy and peace of Bethlehem and the Christ Child who bids us come. For it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning of the Nativity that we can be truly happy, truly at peace, truly home.  ``Merry Christmas, and God bless you.''  Official proclamation of the United States Government by the President of the United States, words well to remember.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10411.txt,1801,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

523,topic-id,717,"Mr.President, as in many other industries, the insurance sector, both property/casualty and life, have become more globalized than any time in history. Disasters such as 9/11 transformed the property and casualty industry. The life insurance industry has followed, with an increasing amount of insurance risk transferred to affiliates and nonaffiliates around the globe.  This business model is impacted directly by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which moves the United States from a mostly global international system, where we tax American companies and individuals on their worldwide income, toward a territorial system. Under the new system, companies are to be taxed in the United States on the income derived here and are to be taxed on their foreign earnings by the nations in which that income is derived.  What we are seeking to do here is to encourage enterprises to start in the United States, to expand in the United States, and to bring as many foreign operations home as they can while remaining not only competitive, but innovative leaders in creating new products and services. The new 21-percent corporate rate will help do just that. However, this bill does not take us fully to a territorial system. The bill applies a minimum tax on certain payments to foreign affiliates. At 21 percent, the U.can compete with virtually any nation in the world, but if some nations have a corporate rate of, say, 5 percent or less, then the new system will incentivize companies to move their operations overseas, so the bill includes a minimum tax. It is called the base erosion antiabuse tax.  The first year, the base erosion tax is essentially a minimum tax of 5-percent tax without deduction for certain payments made by a U.company to its foreign affiliates. Starting in 2019, that minimum tax increases to 10 percent.  We do not want companies moving mobile assets around the world to find the lowest corporate tax rate. However,[[Page S8108]]I do not think we should be taxing enterprises on payments that never actually leave the U.S., but instead are obligations that are combined with obligations from the foreign affiliate to the U.parent. That is where clarification is needed as to how this base erosion tax will work in the context of U.insurance policies that are reinsured overseas.  Under current law, reinsurance is already subject to a gross premium excise that serves as an antibase erosion tax of sorts. Adding the base erosion tax on top of that could be detrimental to these U.insurance companies. However, how the base erosion tax is computed may be determinative of whether the tax is tolerable. I believe that, with respect to reinsurance, the base erosion tax was intended to apply only on net payments actually made.  Under certain forms of reinsurance that are commonly used in the life insurance industry, called modified coinsurance or funds withheld coinsurance, underlying investments are retained by the U.insurer, which is subject to tax on the earnings from the investments. Under these arrangements, the reinsurance payments are taken into account for purposes of the base erosion tax only when the U.insurance company actually makes payments to its foreign affiliate.  My understanding of the conference report is that it intended to limit the base erosion payment to the net amount paid to the foreign reinsurer, taking into account the amounts owed by the reinsurer to the U.party. That result is consistent with one of the fundamental principles underlying the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017: Assets generating income should be taxed where those assets are sited. In determining the amount of base erosion payments, the amount of premium paid to the reinsurer must be offset by any return premium, ceding commission, reinsurance recovered, or other amount received the insurance company with respect to the reinsurance for which such premium is paid to the reinsurer. Moreover, this treatment is consistent with the regulatory accounting regime imposed by the National Association of Insurance  Consistent with those principles, base erosion payments do not include amounts paid to a foreign affiliate that are subject to U.income tax. For example, payments to a foreign partnership by a U.taxpayer that the foreign partnership certifies are effectively connected income are not base erosion payments. The income has not been shifted offshore, and there has been no erosion of the tax base.

521,topic-id,926,"Mr.President, today we have the opportunity to pass the most sweeping changes to our Tax Code in more than 30 years. This historic moment is long overdue, and my constituents in Iowa will benefit from it.  Since the last tax reform effort in 1986, the Tax Code has grown out of control in both length and complexity. All told, taxpayers spend over 6 billion hours annually just complying with the dictates of the Internal Revenue Moreover, our outdated corporate tax system puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage as they try to compete in the 21st century global economy.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will make good on our commitment to provide significant tax relief to middle-income taxpayers both in my State of Iowa and in the entire United States, while making the Tax Code simpler, fairer, and, obviously, more pro-growth.  The bill provides significant tax simplification for the vast majority of tax filers. Most taxpayers will find that they are better off simply by taking the standard deduction. No longer will they have to spend hours sifting through receipts and forms to determine what they can and cannot deduct.  Middle-income taxpayers can also expect to see significant tax cuts. A median income family of four could see their tax bill reduced by over $2,000. This is relief that families will see almost immediately, as less tax is withheld from their paychecks. This tax relief stems from many pro-family and pro-middle-class income tax provisions in the legislation.  First, there is the nearly doubling of the standard deduction. For families, this means the first $24,000 of their income will be exempt from tax altogether. As a result, a significant number of lower income Americans will be removed from the tax rolls entirely.  Second, the middle-income tax brackets are significantly lowered and expanded to include more taxpayers. This includes reducing the current 15 percent bracket to 12 percent, and the 25 percent bracket to 22 percent.  Third, the tax bill specifically recognizes the costs associated with raising a child by doubling the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. Furthermore, to ensure that lower income families with children are able to benefit from this expansion, the refundable portion of the tax credit is increased from $1,000 to $1,400.  While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attempted to claim that this tax bill is all out to help the wealthy, I want to make very clear that this is simply not true. This is evidenced from the features of the bill that I just discussed, but, also, if you need more evidence, look no further than the distribution analysis of the bill by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation of the Congress of the United According to the analysis of the Joint Committee on Taxation, on average, every income group will experience a tax cut, with the largest percentage tax cuts going to the middle-income groups. Moreover, the tax bill would make the Tax Code more progressive, with taxpayers earning more than $1 million shouldering a larger share of the tax burden than they do under current law.  The bill also enacts much needed tax relief for job creators. It provides a significant deduction on business income for small businesses, effectively lowering the top tax rate to under 30 percent. All small businesses down to the smallest family-owned corner store and the family farmer stand to benefit from this provision. As small businesses are responsible for creating the majority of new jobs, this is a key provision promoting economic growth and job creation.  Additionally, the bill lowers the statutory corporate rate down from the highest in the developed world to 21 percent. The highest rate in the developed world at 35 percent makes our current corporate tax rate on American companies the highest of those industrialized nations and puts us at a[[Page S8107]]competitive disadvantage globally, costing American jobs.  Moreover--and this is important for the John Deere workers in Waterloo, IA, or in any other corporation--economists generally agree that a significant portion of the corporate tax falls on workers in the form of reduced wages. Estimates of this burden of the corporate tax on workers ranges from a low of 25 percent to a high of 70 percent. While the exact amount may be debated by economists, one thing is very clear. A corporate rate reduction will result in bigger paychecks for hard-working  These business tax reforms are crucial to getting our economy growing. We can't continue to settle for the anemic growth of less than 2 percent that we have experienced since 2010. Lower tax rates, coupled with greater expensing of depreciated equipment under the bill, will encourage new capital investments that are necessary to increase productivity, generating both higher wages and higher growth.  The bill before us signals the faith we have in the ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit of the American people, rather than putting our faith in government to grow the economy. We do this to get our economy on the right track, and this legislation will put us on the right track. In all, tax reform will put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans, make U.industry and workers more competitive, and get the economy growing again after 8 years of stagnation--the most stagnation in any decade since World War  This is a historic opportunity to help Americans from every walk of life. I look forward to joining my colleagues to pass this once-in-a-generation tax bill and have it signed into law before the new year.  I yield the floor.

1132,topic-id,398,"Madam President, in the 114th Congress, we came very close to passing Kevin and Avonte's Law, a bill named in honor of two boys with autism who wandered away from their caregivers and drowned.  I reintroduced this legislation last month with Senators Klobuchar, Tillis, Schumer, and others to equip communities with important tools to help locate individuals who wander away from their families or caregivers due to dementia or a developmental disability. The bill we crafted adds new protections for children with developmental disabilities, like autism, which are linked to wandering.  The original version of this bill, which I authored with Senator Schumer, passed both Chambers of Congress late last year. It passed this Chamber by voice vote over a year ago, while a similar House companion garnered over 90 cosponsors before passing the other Chamber, 346-66, last Unfortunately, we ran out of time to resolve the differences between the two Chamber's versions before the 114th Congress adjourned.  This year, the Judiciary Committee approved Kevin and Avonte's Law by voice vote, and, before reporting the bill to the full Senate last month, we reached bipartisan consensus on an offset. Our offset consists of the Federal Register Printing Savings Act, which Senator Portman introduced earlier this year. Senator Portman's office agreed to work with us and incorporate 1195 into Kevin and Avonte's We currently are seeking unanimous consent to pass both bills in one legislative package.  Meanwhile, the House has passed its own version of the Federal Register Printing Savings Act, introduced by Congressman Russell of The House-passed version of that bill won the approval of the Homeland Security Committee earlier this year, and that panel is seeking unanimous consent to pass it. I support this legislation, which is virtually identical to Senator Portman's bill, but I placed a temporary hold on the House companion yesterday, so that we can find a way to pass that legislation and Kevin and Avonte's Law simultaneously.  By ensuring that both measures pass as one package, we can make additional resources available to equip first responders, law enforcement officials, and other community leaders with the training and tools necessary to better prevent and respond to missing person cases. By doing so, we also can make grants available to educate and train caregivers as well as other members of the community on how to prevent wandering by those with dementia or developmental disabilities.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8145-2.txt,457,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

726,topic-id,309,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  1766, the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act of 2017, also known as the SAFER Act, will strengthen State and local law enforcement's ability to reduce the number of untested rape kits and help take more offenders off our streets.  Congress provides significant resources annually to the Department of Justice to help reduce backlogs of untested forensic evidence. This legislation will reauthorize the Attorney General's authority to allocate 5 to 7 percent of funds made available to carry out the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program to help communities audit their backlogs, which is an important first step in any effort to eliminate a backlog.  Despite the cases analyzed and improvements made with our Federal resources, backlogs persist due to the ever-increasing demand for evidence testing. According to the National Institute of Justice, as the value of DNA evidence is increasingly recognized, more evidence gets collected and submitted to laboratories for analysis.  Delays in analysis of forensic evidence often result in delays of justice: serial offenders can continue victimizing, and innocent individuals may be incarcerated. The SAFER Act helps address this common impediment to the response to rape and sexual assault at the State, local, and Tribal levels.  Importantly, the SAFER Act also would clarify that pediatric forensic nurses are eligible for training and employment grants. This provision underscores the critical role that pediatric sexual assault nurse examiners can play in a community's response to children who are victims of abuse.  1766 can help ensure that resources provided for DNA analysis are focused on grant recipients making a good faith effort to estimate and manage their backlog of untested samples and improve efforts to get sex offenders off of our streets.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Close to 2 million children across this country are in      danger of losing CHIP coverage in January, with another 1      million set to lose coverage in A short term      approach to providing these children and their families with      certainty is absolutely irresponsible. Without swift      reauthorization and fully funded coverage, young lives hang      in the balance. Congress' failure to act will set off a chain      of dire-consequences for children, as well as their families,      communities, and states. A family without insurance is a      family more likely to fall victim to financial crisis related      to medical costs, such as bankruptcy.       Similarly, Community Health Centers play an essential role      in low-income communities as they protect and expand access      to critical and affordable care. The Community Health Centers      Fund (CHCF) provides mandatory funding for federal health      centers, which provide primary, dental, and other supportive      care in medically underserved areas. Robust and reliable      support for Community Health Centers results in more health      centers, an increased number of patient visit, and more      available services. These services save lives, especially in      communities struggling to provide affordable care to poor,      largely minority communities.       The CHCF is even more essential to the more than 27 million      people it helps support in light of recent efforts to the      dismantle our nation's health insurance market. As you well      know, the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's individual      mandate will add 13 million uninsured Americans, increase      premiums by 10 percent, and make it harder for sick people to      get insurance.       The Congressional Black Caucus has been the conscience of      this Congress since its inception in 1971. We have provided      moral leadership and courageous advocacy for our constituents      and for all Americans that have felt disenfranchised or left      behind. At the time of year when we are supposed to be most      charitable, it is urgent that Congress act to reauthorize      CHIP and Community Health Centers and provide robust funding      for both. Children and families do not need to spend the      holidays worrying about their health. It is time for Congress      to do what it is responsible and moral. Accordingly, the CBC      will not support any legislation to prevent a shutdown unless      these critical programs are addressed.

But let's talk about the things that we are leaving on the table:  We are doing nothing about long-term flood insurance.  We are doing nothing about Perkins loans that have expired.  We are not funding or addressing the opioid epidemic.  We are not offering legislation to help save failing pensions in this country.  I talked with some teamsters from Michigan the other day with tears in their eyes concerned about their pensions.  We are doing nothing with reference to long-term, bipartisan reauthorizing for CHIP and community health centers.  We are doing nothing about the FISA reauthorization.  We are not raising the defense and non-defense spending caps.  We are leaving Medicare extension on the table.  And that is just a to-do list that is partial that we are not addressing.  But let me get in the weeds on something that the public doesn't quite understand.  196 people appeared right over here and signed what is called a discharge petition to bring DACA to the floor; 34 Members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to the If you combine those numbers, you have 218.

I have said, as have many of my colleagues, that what we witnessed is the beginning of what ultimately will allow for us to address the entitlements in this country.

126,topic-id,387,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to discuss the Children's Health Insurance Program, or  As we all know, the authorization for CHIP expired at the end of Since that time, States have been utilizing their reserve funds in order to cover the healthcare needs of kids. For a number of States, those funds are due to run out in the near future.  There have been a number of claims from our friends on the other side and some of their allies in the media that Republicans have ignored the CHIP program; that we don't intend to reauthorize it; or that we supposedly placed a higher priority on tax cuts for the rich than on providing health insurance for needy children. Those claims are absolutely ridiculous, and they know it. It gets a little old sometimes--some of the stupid politics that are being played by the other side.  I come at this issue from two angles. I am both the original author of CHIP, and I currently chair the committee with jurisdiction over the program. Nobody should doubt my commitment to[[Page S8214]]continuing the CHIP program. For two decades now, I have been a supporter of CHIP, and I worked with Members of both parties to keep it moving forward and functioning properly--even in times when my Democratic colleagues have pursued a more divisive approach with the program. That commitment continues to this day.  On October 4, the Senate Finance Committee unanimously reported a bipartisan bill that would reauthorize CHIP for 5 years. In my view, a long-term reauthorization is essential so that States, including my home State of Utah, can plan well into the future and the families who benefit from CHIP can be sure that coverage for their needy children won't just disappear.  It appears that the year-end continuing resolution could include a short-term reauthorization for That is far from ideal, and as the leading advocate for this program, I have no desire to see it become subject to repeated short-term fixes and constantly looming deadlines.  I intend to continue working with Senator Wyden and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both the Senate and the House to enact the KIDS Act in a fiscally responsible manner as soon as possible.

464,topic-id,1856,"Mr.President, with this week's passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, many throughout the country are rightly celebrating the first substantive reform of our Nation's Tax Code in more than three decades.  While the popular narrative surrounding this bill has been that Congress has moved quickly to pass this legislation, I don't think anyone who has worked on tax reform over the last several years would agree with that assessment. This week's success is made possible by years of hard work and the efforts of countless policymakers, experts, advocates, and public servants.  Over the last several years, I have come to the floor on many occasions to advocate for tax reform. I am glad today to be able to rise and acknowledge the efforts of many people whose work made the historic occasion possible.  First, I would like to thank those Members who went before us. Former Chairmen Camp, Grassley, and Baucus spent the better part of the decade laying the groundwork for this effort.  I also want to thank Senator Wyden, who, along with Chairman Baucus, worked with me on the Finance Committee over the last several years as we produced reports and options papers, convened bipartisan working groups, and held more than 70 hearings to discuss tax policy.  While I have been disappointed that my Democratic colleagues have opted not to participate in this year's efforts to produce this particular bill, they definitely contributed to this knowledge and policy base we worked from to put our legislation together.  For years, I have reiterated the importance of Presidential leadership when it comes to tax reform. I am grateful that President Trump has been willing to engage with Congress on this issue and to put some political skin in the game in order to move us forward.  From the outset of this administration, Secretary Mnuchin and Director Cohn have been actively working to make this success a reality. I thank them for their engagement in this effort and the work they and their staffs have put in.  From the Treasury staff, I would like to thank Justin Muzinich, Dan Kowalski, and Jay  From Director Cohn's staff at the National Economic Council, I need to thank Jeremy Katz and Shahira  From the White House, thanks to Mark Short, Amy Swonger, Andy Koenig, Joseph Lai, and Jim  These staffers from the administration have worked for the better part of the year with leaders from both Chambers to produce this bill and get it over the finish line. Their success is shared with our colleagues over in the House, led by Chairman Brady and Speaker I thank my colleagues for their hard work and their willingness to find common ground when many believed that it was impossible to do so.  From the Ways and Means staff, I want to thank David Stewart, Matt Weidinger, Allison Halataei, Rick Limardo, and Paul Special thanks is owed to the committee tax staff: Barbara Angus, Aharon Friedman, John Sandell, Victoria Glover, John Schoenecker, Randy Gartin, Aaron Junge, Donald Scheider, Danielle Dubose, Kathryn Chakmak, and Loren  From the Speaker's office, I want to thank Jonathan Burks, Austin Smythe, George Callas, Derrick Dockery, and Josh  From the House majority whip's office, I need to thank both Marty Reiser and Kelly  Of course, here in the Senate, we have been ably led by the majority leader. I want to thank Senator McConnell for his commitment to get this done and for his leadership throughout this entire endeavor.  From the leader's staff, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Brendan Dunn, Antonia Ferrier, Hazen Marshall, Erica Suares, Terry Van Doren, Don Stewart, and Jane  Joining Senator McConnell, as always, has been our distinguished majority whip. I thank Senator Cornyn for his efforts in shoring up support and addressing our Members' concerns from the beginning of this process until final passage of the conference report.  From the whip's staff, I want to thank Monica Popp and Sam  Of course, when it came time to draft the Senate's tax reform legislation, most of the real work was done in the Finance The committee bill was truly a shared product that included the input and addressed the interests of every majority member on our dais. Without their work, we wouldn't have had a bill, and without their commitment to seeing this through, we wouldn't have gotten to where we are.  I want to thank Senators Grassley, Crapo, Roberts, Enzi, Cornyn, Thune, Burr, Isakson, Portman, Toomey, Heller, Scott, and Cassidy for the months of work they put into producing and passing this legislation. I also need to thank their staffs who, until this week, haven't slept in months.  My thanks also go to the tax staffers on the committee, namely, Chris Allen, Joseph Boddicker, Chris Conlin, Shay Hawkins, Randy Herndon, Bart Massey, Monica McGuire, Mike Quickel, Zachary Rudisill, Andrew Siracuse, Robert Sneeden, Derek Theurer, and Mark  My thanks go, as well, to the committee's legislative directors: Charles Cogar, Ken Flanz, Chris Gillott, Brad Grantz, Amber Kirchhoefer, Kurt Kovarik, Jessica McBride, Sarah Paul, Landon Stropko, Jay Sulzmann, Stephen Tausend, Pam Thiessen, and Christopher  Of course, when the Democrats signaled their refusal to even meet on tax reform, we knew we would need a well-crafted budget resolution with the right instruction to get tax reform passed. So I need to thank my good friend, Chairman Enzi, and the Budget Committee for their work, which made a seemingly mundane and tedious process look easy.  From the Budget Committee staff, I want to thank Joe Brenckle, Jim Neill, Betsy McDonnell, Matt Giroux, Paul Vinovich, Becky Cole, Eric Ueland, Steve Townsend, Jeremy Dalrymple, and Thomas  Once we had a resolution, we had to hold a markup. In the Finance Committee, that can be a challenging process, particularly on a bill this big and complex.  Thankfully, we have been ably served by a professional staff who helped us through that whole process, namely, Joshua Levasseur, Jewel Harper, Joe Carnucci, Mark Blair, Athena Schritz, Susanna Segal, Eliza Smith, Tim Corley, and Michael  The Joint Committee on Taxation was also critical throughout the committee process, as well as when we moved the bill onto the floor. They worked countless hours doing the work that often just made everybody mad at one point or another. Theirs is an often thankless but really critical job, and I am grateful for their dedication and earnestness.  Specifically, I need to thank Tom Barthold and his team for making sure both parties in the House and the Senate were getting all the information that was needed, at times under challenging time constraints. Tom does a[[Page S8215]]terrific job for the Senate, and I personally appreciate him and value him as a friend.  After moving a mark through the committee, we relied on assistance from the Senate Legislative Counsel's office to put together the legislative text. That was a critical step, and we could not have done it without Mark McGunagle, Jim Fransen, and their team.  Then as we began to prep the bill for the floor, we spent countless hours debating different provisions before the This process can be difficult, and I would like to offer my thanks to our Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team for the hours and days they put into helping us comply with the rules of the  As the bill neared its final phase, we were grateful to be able to work with Senator Murkowski on the second title of the bill, and as we moved to conference committee, Senator Murkowski's counterparts in the House also played an instrumental role in helping to finalize this legislation.  Of course, there are those who work hard to make sure things go smoothly here on the floor. I thank the majority floor staff for their assistance, particularly, Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and Megan  As I said, this has been a long process, and throughout this entire venture, I have had the benefit of working with a skilled and committed staff. My staff have sacrificed time, energy, sleep, and, in some cases, likely their physical and mental health for the passage of this bill. It has been an incredible effort, and I need to thank all of them.  I want to single out my chief tax counsel, Mark I think everyone in this Chamber and everyone in Washington would agree that we could not have done any of this without  I also need to thank my staff director, Jay Khosla, who has been the tip of the spear, managing the incoming and outgoing issues with apparent ease. I also want to thank his assistant, Jason Stegmaier, for helping to keep Jay from forgetting the important details, like remembering to eat lunch.  I want to thank my entire tax staff: Jennifer Acuna, Tony Coughlan, Christopher Hanna, Alex Monie, Eric Oman, Marty Pippins, Preston Rutledge, and Nick  I need to thank the members of my senior team as well: Matt Hoffmann, Jeff Wrase, Julia Lawless, Jennifer Kuskowski, Chris Armstrong, Bryan Hickman, and Shane  I want to thank my communications staff on the committee: Katie Niederee, Nicole Hager, and Joshua  I also want to thank a couple of former Finance Committee staff members, specifically, Chris Campbell, my former staff director, who helped to set the stage for this entire effort, and Jim Lyons, my tax counsel who passed away last year, much to the sorrow of us. He spent years working on tax reform, and I know we all wish he could have been here to celebrate with us this week.  From my personal office staff, I want to thank my legislative assistant, James Williams, and Matt Sandgren, my chief of staff.  There are many more people who deserve thanks this week--far too many to mention at this time. They are not forgotten, though, believe me.  We have done a good thing here this week. This is truly a historic success.  Some of our colleagues on the other side last night said that the American people will remember what happened here this week. To that, all I can say is that I hope they do. This new tax law will do a lot of good for a great number of people throughout our country, and I am humbled to have been a part of the efforts of so many people who were willing to get this thing done for the American people.  I am grateful to my staff. I am grateful to the staffs of our Senators on the committee. I am grateful for everyone involved in the Finance Committee and for the good efforts that they put forward. But I am really grateful that I serve in the U.Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, and this is a perfect illustration of why.  I am very grateful to be able to stand on this floor and show my complete devotion to this wonderful government. To both sides of the floor--Democrats and Republicans alike--I am grateful. I am grateful that we have this Constitution to guide us, and I am grateful that for the most part, we have abided by it.  With that, I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

497,topic-id,2635,"Mr.President, this fellow has a very interesting way of trying to get his point of view across. It shouldn't be done here in this august body.  Let me just start again.  The Senate will soon vote on the conference report for H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs I have waited a long time to be able to give this final statement in support of tax reform legislation.  I have been in the Senate for a little while. I have been party to a number of major legislative achievements, like the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the creation of the CHIP program, the Child Health Insurance Program, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, to name just a few. These are landmark bills, and I have had a lot to do with them.  The legislation before us is as important and as far-reaching as anything I have been privileged to work on. It is beyond gratifying to see the Senate reach this point, and I look forward to finally seeing real tax legislation signed into law.  I apologize for this type of intemperate action and mouthing off inside of this august People feel very deeply about these things on both sides of the issues.  Passage of this important bill will be historic. It is the combination of years of work by people in both parties, in both Chambers, and on both sides of Pennsylvania Many of us in this body have been waiting for years for this opportunity, and millions of Americans outside of this body have been waiting even longer.  It is no secret that our Tax Code is broken. Members of both parties have acknowledged this. If you walked across the country and asked Americans of all backgrounds and ideologies, you wouldn't find many who would be willing to defend the status quo. I don't think you would find anybody.[[Page S8092]]  There is one apt phrase my good friend Senator Wyden uses to describe our Tax He calls it ``a dying carcass.'' Indeed, our Tax Code is dying and rotting. It has hampered job creation, wage growth, investment in the United States, and it has chased American companies to foreign shores. I don't know how it could be more harmful than it has been. It has also given foreign companies a leg up on U.businesses in the global marketplace, leading to a record number of foreign takeovers and inversions. The bill before us will address these problems and help us turn the ship around.  Our legislation will reduce the corporate tax rate to 21 percent--something that is long overdue--the lowest level in the modern history of the United States, placing our country slightly below the average of industrialized countries. These changes will once again give American companies a competitive edge and bring more businesses back home instead of losing them the way we have been.  Hundreds of economists have said that our bill will boost economic growth, and numerous companies have indicated that once our bill becomes law, they will invest heavily in expansion and job creation right here in the United States of  In addition, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has made clear, reducing the corporate tax rate has distributional effects that go beyond the companies themselves, their high-ranking officers, or even their richest shareholders. In fact, JCT--the Joint Committee on Taxation--estimates that workers bear 25 percent of the corporate tax rate and other economists have found that this number can reach as high as 75 percent. This means that no matter how you slice it, Americans will see their wages go up when corporate tax rates go down.  Further, over the last few decades, we have seen a massive expansion of pension and retirement assets, much of which are invested in corporate stocks. While many of my colleagues like to decry any business from merely earning a profit, the truth is that the continued rise in corporate profits has significantly expanded the wealth of middle-class workers and taxpayers who have continually set aside funds for the future.  A representative from the Tax Policy Center testified before the Finance Committee in the spring of last year. At that hearing he stated that 37 percent of corporate stock ownership was held in retirement plan accounts--37 percent. That was the largest share of overall stock ownership, and that statistic syncs up with the distribution tables put out by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on  For all of these reasons, lowering the corporate tax rate has been a bipartisan goal for over a decade now. I have said it before: Presidents Clinton and Obama, Senators Wyden and Schumer, and most of the other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee have at some point in the recent past endorsed a significant reduction in the U.corporate tax rate.  Our bill will achieve this bipartisan goal and place our country well within the mainstream among our international competitors. This is a good thing--not just for businesses and rich stockholders but for working, middle-class families as well.  Let's be clear. This bill's chief focus is about helping the middle class. I know there is a tendency among some in this Chamber to act and speak as though all money in this country inherently belongs to the government. I won't speak for everyone, but those of us who have worked on this bill tend to think differently.  Aside from business reforms that will grow our economy, increase wages, and create jobs, our bill will lower individual tax rates across the board, allowing hard-working Americans to keep more of their money. In our bill, we also nearly double the standard deduction for individuals and married couples. This feature will significantly reduce the burden of tax filing for millions of middle-class families and decrease even further the overall tax liability of millions more. For the first time in more than 30 years, nearly every American will get more money back by just filing out an EZ form. This, without a doubt, fulfills our goal of simplifying the Tax  For individuals who are concerned about being able to itemize--again, we believe the number of people with this concern will decrease dramatically under our bill--we retain a number of key provisions that benefit many in the middle class. For example, this historic legislation will allow individuals and families to continue to claim deductions for State and local taxes, up to $10,000 a year. It will keep in place, with relatively minor adjustments, the deduction for mortgage interest. And Americans who itemize and want to deduct their charitable deductions will be free to do so. This has made America great, and it has helped us at the same time to be more charitable. We are also expanding the child tax credit with this bill, doubling it from $1,000 to $2,000 per child and making the credit far more refundable than ever before. The adoption credit will stay in place. The deduction for medical expenses will still be available. Credits and assistance for students and their families will be untouched. We have made all of these changes and, when necessary, preserved current law, with an eye toward helping the middle class.  I know a number of my colleagues like to argue that this bill will have different results. Let's look at the numbers.  Under this bill, a typical family of four, earning the median family income of $73,000, will see their taxes go down by more than half--about 58 percent. That number means something more than just a simple percentage; it means that an average American family will be able to keep $2,058 more of their own earnings next year. That is a mortgage payment, a downpayment for a car, or several months' worth of groceries.  What about a single parent? Under our plan, a single parent with one child, making $41,000, will see their taxes slashed by nearly 73 percent. That is almost a three-quarter reduction in tax liability. That means a savings of more than $1,300 over the course of a year. That could be a month of daycare expenses, multiple car payments, or a family vacation.  These are things that matter to American families, and they well should. But our friends on the other side have been so caught up in partisan politics that they decided to ignore the Americans who will benefit from this legislation. I think it started with the election of President Trump and the retention of Senate control by Their base protested, occupied, and disrupted the transfer of power from President Obama to President Here on the Hill, the ``resistance'' was in full effect right off the bat, with a coordinated effort to stall nominations in committee, which included unprecedented boycotts and refusals to meet with nominees. It has only gone downhill from there.  While we heard words from our friends on the other side about participating in tax reform, their actions showed otherwise. I don't know how they can stand here and make some of the arguments they do. Unprecedented process demands were made. Resistance was the plan, and that plan was carried out. Now we hear about massive tax cuts for the very rich and huge breaks for corporations, but these claims fall apart when you look at the facts.  Again, this isn't unchartered territory for my friends on the other side. Accusing Republicans of hating the poor and loving the rich is one of their go-to moves. I have seen it for over 40 years. Every time you turn around, there is one of their go-to moves, and it has nothing to do with reality. I do think they are getting more desperate and vicious in their attacks because they regret their own decisions to sit out of this endeavor. That is precisely how it happened. Our colleagues were apparently so preoccupied with denying President Trump and congressional Republicans any success, they chose not to engage and instead to sit in the peanut gallery throwing out baseless attacks.  As I have said literally dozens of times over the past few years, I wish the Democrats had joined us in this process, put aside their ultimatums and preconditions, and helped to advance policies that they have claimed to support for years now. But we are where we are, and while the bill before us includes a number of ideas and proposals Democrats have supported, we are prepared to pass it without their[[Page S8093]]votes, if that is what it takes. There have been some Democrats who have worked with us, but they have been few and far between.  Once again, this is a historic bill. I am proud of the work we have done in the Finance Committee, here on the floor, and in conference to get us to this point. I again invite our friends on the other side to also support the bill. I am proud of our colleagues who have put in so much effort to get us here. I am proud of the staff on Capitol Hill who have labored day and night to assist in this endeavor.  As I said, this legislation has been years in the making. I urge all of my colleagues to support the conference report and help us send it to the President's desk. You will not regret it. Those who support this will not regret it.  I think we ought to get rid of this hatred for Donald Trump that currently exists in this country and in this body. I think we should give the man a chance. He hasn't even been President for a year yet. Give him a chance. Even though he hasn't been President for a year yet, we have had some amazing changes in this country for the better, and I think we could have many more.  What really interests me is that Donald Trump, 6 or 7 years ago, was working with Democrats as well as He offered to work with the Democrats on these matters, and they have not taken up the offer. Instead, it is as though they are still bitter because he beat their candidate for  I would like to have us get over that type of petty politics and see what we can do to work together. Heaven knows, on the Finance Committee, I believe we have good Democrats on that committee, as well as good Republicans, and I think we can work together. I have to say, I don't think we have as well as we should, but I think we can, and I am hopeful that we will.  This is an important bill. It is a bill that really does need to pass. It is a bill that will help this country. It is a bill that will help the middle class. In fact, it is going to help everybody, but it will certainly help the middle class most of all.  I hope our colleagues put aside their petty politics on both sides and come together to support this bill, which literally can help save this country an awful lot of pain over the next number of years and give the government the kinds of resources that it needs to be able to do what the Federal Government needs to do for its people. I think we can.  People in this body know that I have spent years here. I am the most senior I have been here longer than any other Republican that I know of, and I have the legislative record to back it up--a record that has included working with Democrats almost every step of the way. I am offering to make sure we work together, but I haven't seen it on the other side. Can they get over the bitterness they have?  We heard this loudmouth in the Gallery who has no good sense and a total lack of etiquette and a total lack of respect for this government and this If I were on his side, I would be humiliated because he was just a big loudmouth who didn't mean a doggone thing. Unfortunately, I think there are more people like that who are so bitter that they will raise these types of issues without really trying to work together.  I am one who has a reputation for working together. I am chairman of the Finance I have enjoyed my work with the distinguished Democratic leader on the Finance Committee, Senator I care for him. I care for the other Democrats on the committee, as well as all of our We work pretty well together. It is getting harder and harder to work together when all we see are screaming and shouting because they can't get their way because they are no longer in the majority. I hope they get over that, and I hope they start working with us. If they will, we can do an awful lot of good things for this country, and we can bring people together across this whole country--people who right now are divided because they don't know what to do. They see us screaming and shouting around here and a total lack of willingness to get together. I would like to change it. I am open to changing it.  This bill that we have is a very, very important bill, and we need to pass it. My friends on the other side need to realize that, and I hope we will get some of them to vote for it. They know it is right. Deep down, they know it is right. It might not be everything they like themselves. It is not everything I myself would like. But it is a doggone good bill, and it is something that could really help this country pull out of the mess that it is in.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

525,topic-id,313,"Mr.President, I have listened to the comments of my friends on the other side for several hours. Frankly, it has tried my patience.  If you boil down the inaccurate assertions, you come up with two basic points. One, that the bill before us cuts taxes for wealthy taxpayers proportionately more than it does for middle-income taxpayers. Two, this bill raises taxes on middle-income taxpayers.  Nothing like some old-fashioned nonpartisan light to cut through the partisan fog created by my friends on the other side.  I refer to a set of tables developed by the nonpartisan official congressional tax scorekeeper, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which I will ask consent to have printed in the  The tables show significant tax cut for middle-income taxpayers.  Let's take a look at taxpayers in which the median U.income reside. I am talking about taxpayers at income levels between $50,000 and $75,000. In 2019, two-thirds of taxpayers receive a tax cut of greater than $500. In 2021, 61.7 percent receive a tax cut of greater than $500. In 2023, 54.8 percent of taxpayers will receive a tax cut of greater than $500. In 2021, 53 percent of taxpayers receive a tax cut of greater than $500. The individual income tax cuts sunset in 2026.  Let's take a look at another middle-income group, those in the $75,000 to $100,000 cohort. In 2019, 77.8 percent of those taxpayers receive a tax cut of greater than $500. In 2021, that figure is 72.2 percent. In 2023, that figure is 63.1 percent. In 2025, that figure is 61.4 percent. The individual tax cuts expire in 2026.  I ask my friends on the other side to shut down their rhetorical fog machine. Stop the phony characterization of this bill as a tax cut for the wealthy. Recognize it for what it is, a tax cut for Americans that is focused on middle-income families.

539,topic-id,1493,"Mr.President, I, personally, congratulate the distinguished Senator from He is one of the most intelligent people in this body. He has had all kinds of experience outside of the He is a person whom everybody should listen to. He makes a lot of sense. He is one of the most valued members of a very strong committee, with all kinds of valued members on it, but he is one of those valued members on the Senate Finance Committee, and I have nothing but respect for him.  Everything he has said here this evening is true. It is mind-boggling to me that we even have arguments from the other side. We are talking about pulling this country out of the mess it is in, and it is going to take this.  I just want to compliment the distinguished Senator from He is a terrific human being, with a tremendous ability, who has had a lot of experience outside of the U.Senate, and who has been successful everywhere he has gone. He is one of the most distinguished members of the Senate Finance He is not talking politically; he is talking factually. I just wish everybody in this body were on the floor to listen to him. I have tremendous respect for him. That is one reason I am getting up here right now.  We can turn this mess around, but if we don't do it soon, it may be impossible to turn it around. We have been spending this government into bankruptcy. That is where we are. We keep making excuses so we can go back and beat our breasts and claim we are doing so much for the people when we are just spending them right into bankruptcy. It is making it more difficult for the committees to do their work. I just wish we could get both sides together once in a while instead of having all of this inner conflict on everything that comes up.  It is almost like, if a Republican says something, it has to be contradicted, and I might add, if a Democrat says something, he has to be contradicted. I don't mind good arguments. I don't mind people having different points of view. That is what makes this place a great place. That is what helps the United States of America to be a great country and a great government, but we don't even listen to each other anymore.  Where is this bipartisanship that this country really, drastically needs?  We happen to be in the majority right now. It seems to me that a decent minority would want to find ways to work with the, hopefully, decent majority. I think we can be very decent on our side, and I believe my colleagues on the other side can be very decent. Let's get rid of the politics, and let's do what is best for Let's get this country out of the mess it is in. The distinguished Senator from Ohio has shown us some ways here.  Our tax policy is for the birds. We know what we need to do, but every time you raise a solution, you have somebody saying: Well, that is not the answer. Then we have the conflicts between the two That is good because that is what helps us to refine some of this legislation.  All I can say is, I just wish all of us would put the country first, put politics second, be politically astute but at least be open to rational reasoning, whether it comes from the other side or our side. I am just amazed at how we can sit and belabor these things day in and day out and never really get together. We are hurting the country because we are unwilling to get together. We are hurting the Congress of the United States because we are unwilling to get together.  I could go on and on as to our unwillingness to get together. I think it is time for us to wake up and start saying: Look, let's find common ground. Let's find ways of getting together instead of constantly fighting each other on every stinking issue that comes up. There are reasons for differences in politics and reasons for differences in tax policy, but we ought to be able to at least discuss these differences without there being total partisanship, which is what we are, unfortunately, suffering from. I believe we can turn this mess around. If we do, it will be a banner for everybody to march behind, and it seems to me it will be an example for the whole world. I would like to see us do it.  I know there are people on the other side who cannot stand the Yes, he won an election they didn't think he should have won, but he did win. He has thrown his hands open to the other side and, I believe, would do more. It was only 7 or 8 years ago when he was much more moderate than he is now. I think all they need to do is to reach out and grab his hands and say: Look, we will find some common ground here in the best interests of our country and in the best interests of everybody.  It is not bad to fight things out. I don't have any problem with that.[[Page S8121]]That is part of this body, part of what we do. But we actually have to come to some conclusions that will push the country forward, and we are not doing that, except on a limited basis that really doesn't amount to all that much.  We are coming to the end of a very difficult year. The Democrats thought they were going to win the Presidency, and they didn't. They especially feel badly about losing to somebody like Donald Trump, who, I think, has held out his hands and his arms to them and would do so if they would just embrace a little bit more of what he is trying to do. I would like to see us do this. I believe he would throw his arms out to whomever in this body would work with him, and by working with him, we may be able to get some of our ideas on both sides actually put into law that may help this country.  I really particularly enjoyed and appreciated the comments from the distinguished Senator from I think he is one of the most distinguished people in this body. Earlier, I heard the distinguished Senator from He is a brilliant guy who works his butt off to try to get us into good places. We ought to listen more to these folks. There are folks on the other side who are brilliant, too, who, I think, make a real difference.  I particularly enjoy my counterpart on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden from We are different. We have different philosophies, but I have never seen a day when he wasn't willing to sit down and work out our problems, and that to me is pretty important.  Our leaders are good people. I have watched Chuck Schumer for all the years he has been in the Senate and before, and he is a better leader than what we are getting here lately. I have watched Mitch Mitch is one of the shrewdest people I have seen in this body since I have been a Member, and he is open. I would like to see our leaders get together a little bit more. I would like to see a little less fighting and a little more constructive work together. I don't expect miracles because I have been here only 41 years, but I do expect that we can do much better than what we are doing, and it is going to take both sides getting together to do it.  We happen to be in the majority right now, and the Democrats should give us an edge. We should give them the edge when they are in the majority. I think that I, for one, have done that.  I hope we can put aside our differences and start working together in the best interest of the country. I believe in this country. It is the greatest country in the world. People all over the world are praying that the United States will get it together. They know that we can lead. They know that we have leadership in the Congress of the United We can get it together if we will.  I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I appreciate that we have differences. I appreciate that sometimes those differences put us into pitched battles. That is not all bad, either. But it is bad if we don't work things out and if we don't look for the good on the other side in both ways.  I yield the floor.

551,topic-id,201,"Mr.President, I have been listening to this debate for a long time, and I have to admit it has been interesting, but it has been prolonged way beyond where it should have been.  My friends on the other side make much about this process, demeaning the Members and staff who really put it together.  This bill was marked up in the Finance It is the first reconciliation bill to be processed in committee in the Senate in over 12 years. During that period, Democrats held power for 8 of those years; Republicans, 4 of those years.  The reconciliation bill that made up part of the Affordable Care Act never went through the Finance That reconciliation bill never went through any real Senate process. To be fair, the Affordable Care Act repeal bill that my side proposed didn't go[[Page S8134]]through the Finance Committee either. As difficult as it was, as chairman, I put out a chairman's mark, modified it, permitted debate and amendments, and put it to a vote, all in conformity with committee rules. We had a full Senate debate, amendments, and votes. So I don't want to hear tonight or at any time that the process deteriorated. It didn't deteriorate.

During that time, he dedicated himself to our country, ensuring Congress received impartial, data-driven, and sound policy advice to transform the Medicare Program while protecting our Nation's seniors and the disabled.  MedPAC was established by Congress in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget It is a nonpartisan agency that provides analysis and policy recommendations regarding the Medicare Program, including payment, beneficiary access to care, and quality of care for traditional fee-for-service Medicare and Medicare As all of us know, the analysis we get from MedPAC is critical in how we, as Members of Congress, debate, address changes, and ultimately make improvements to the Medicare  Throughout his service, Mr.Miller ensured that MedPAC consistently fulfilled its mission of providing objective, empirically driven policy analysis and advice to  Mr.Miller himself also testified, answered calls, and otherwise provided invaluable advice on complicated Medicare payment issues to both majority and minority leaders, Finance Committee chairmen and ranking members, as well as other committee members, and other Member offices regarding all things healthcare. Throughout his years of service, Mr.Miller has proven himself a trusted source of objective information.  Mr.Miller gave years of his life, including countless long nights, weekends, and early mornings to make sure Congress has the best and most reliable information it can get. In turn, that analysis has guided many ideas and recommendations into legislation that made its way to a President's desk for signature. Mr.Miller's professionalism, expertise, energy, patience, humor, and dedication make him an example to all of us as we work the process of designing and ultimately enacting legislation. Mark has been there from the beginning, watching an idea being born, helping to develop policy to achieve that idea, and providing valuable policy counsel as it works its way through the legislative process to ultimately becoming law.  Thanks to his sense of purpose, dedication, and love for this country, Mr.Miller should be seen as just as much an influence on our current Medicare policy as most Members in this body. Mark is a consummate professional, and he will be missed. I wish him all the very best as he takes the next steps in his successful career.  May we ever remember Mark's service, and may MedPAC ever be guided by the same sense of duty and purpose Mr.Miller instilled in his 15 years leading that organization.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8176.txt,1351,PASSAGE OF THE TAX CUT AND WHAT IT MEANS,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1098,topic-id,1084,"Mr.President, often here in Washington, it can be difficult to focus on what counts.  We live in an information environment which is increasingly atomized and persistently polarized. Almost all will inevitably focus on who is up and who is down in the endless cycle of partisan gamesmanship. News cycles come and news cycles go. Poll numbers jump, then fall, then jump again, and fall again, but nobody should forget that what really matters around here, at the end of the day, is policy, and the first year of unified Republican government has delivered plenty of that.  In 2016, the American people faced a stark choice. The Republicans promised a new era of deregulation and limited government--a new policy approach that would entrust free markets and free citizens to drive us forward. The Democrats, on the other hand, renewed and restated their faith in the effectiveness of government, centered here in Washington, to direct and command the national welfare. The American people spoke loudly, and they spoke decisively. The Republicans were given the reins and were instructed to sort all of this out.  Nobody needs to remind me that elections are the beginning of the challenge, not the end. The Republicans may have prevailed in the campaign, but an election won is nothing more than an opportunity seized. It is nothing more than a charge to carry out the promises offered on the trail, and that is precisely what we are doing.  Here in the Senate, despite fits and starts, we are moving the ball forward. Notwithstanding often vicious treatment by the media and the constant obstruction of the Democrats here in Congress, we are getting work done. Promises made in 2016 have become promises kept in 2017. The American people were promised the removal of redtape and infuriating bureaucratic encumbrances on economic growth. As soon as we took office in early 2017, we moved to do just that.  We confirmed Neomi Rao as the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Under her stewardship, the Executive has cut over a dozen old rules for every single new rule created. Regulation has been subjected to actual cost-savings analysis, and, likely, billions have been saved in the process.  Here in Congress we passed a dozen CRAs to cut down on costly and ineffective rules passed in the twilight hours of the Obama administration. The list of deregulatory items speaks for itself: restoration of free markets and free competition on internet, done; new environmental policy to unleash the potential of American energy production, done; reform of public lands designation and renewal of State and local control over western territories, done; Labor Department reform that restores bargaining power to employees and employers rather than unions and bureaucrats, done. On nearly every front, from education to justice issues and everything in between, there has been substantial progress.  Personnel are often the catalyst to policy, and we still have nominations in several agencies to come. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in good hands with Mick Mulvaney and will eventually be handed off to a capable permanent Federal Trade Commission nominations should be arriving shortly, and just recently the[[Page S8190]]Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the next Director of the USPTO, Andrei As a longtime champion of intellectual property rights, and head of the High-Tech Task Force, I encourage my colleagues to swiftly confirm him to this post.  Overall, this President has delivered on his nominations, and his nominees have delivered on his promises. While I am on the topic of nominations, I want to talk about the judiciary. Controversy seems to be swirling, due to a few recent--and I would say unfortunate--bumps in the road, but we must not miss the forest no matter how much the press would like to harken on a few of the trees. The accomplishments of this administration and Senate in addressing the judiciary have been historic.  Neil Gorsuch was a superb choice for the Supreme At a critical juncture for our courts, he stands poised to seize the mantle left by Justice Antonin Scalia and carry the cause of originalism and textualism forward for a new generation, but Justice Gorsuch was only the beginning. From the circuit courts to the district courts, judicial nominations across the board have really been outstanding. We have confirmed more circuit court nominees this year than in any President's first year in American history.  We accomplished this despite Democrats using their time-tested obstruction tactics and even coming up with some new ones. They forced us to take 18 cloture votes on judicial nominees alone this year, compared to just one cloture vote during the first year of all previous Presidents combined. Nevertheless, we got the job done. The results will be felt for decades to come.  Whatever our differences on other issues, conservatives across the board heartily approve of the way this administration has handled judicial nominations.  I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as Leader McConnell, to confirm these judges. As the rest of our agenda gains steam, judicial selection will remain the vanguard. There are more judges to come this new year, and we are going to keep on confirming them. Each and every week, a new trial or appellate court judge will add to the ranks of a rapidly improving judiciary.  Finally, on the legislative front, this administration and Republican Congress have just delivered the most consequential and far-reaching tax reform package in 30 years. When other administrations and other sessions of Congress couldn't get it done, we did. Individuals will see their tax rates drop. Businesses, from large corporations that employ thousands to small businesses paying passthrough rates, will enjoy new capital for investment, expansion, and more. In fact, seemingly to the dismay of our Democratic colleagues, businesses are already responding to the good news with announcements of bonuses and new ventures, and that is just the beginning.  On top of it all, the individual mandate has been repealed and ObamaCare is now firmly on its way out, thank goodness. Despite earlier difficulties, we are well on our way toward repeal. As we move toward 2018, we can look forward to additional policy success on everything from entitlements to infrastructure to immigration.  In conclusion, I don't want to hear anyone claim that this President and this Congress have not gotten things done. Promises were made and promises were kept. Only a year into things, we are making good on our pledge for historic change in                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8189-3.txt,1351,PASSAGE OF THE TAX CUT AND WHAT IT MEANS,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,topic-id,1603,"Mr.President, we are nearing the finish line this week on providing Nevadans and all Americans the real tax relief that they deserve and that they have been promised. As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have been fighting every day for the Senate to stay in Washington--even 24/7--until the job gets done. Today, we are getting the job done. That is because I know just how critical middle-class tax relief is for the people in my home State of Let me tell you why.  The majority of Americans are not only struggling to get ahead, they are struggling to just get by. It has been reported that nearly 8 in 10 Americans who work full time are living paycheck to paycheck. That is a slight increase from previous years.  If you live in Nevada, you are more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck than if you were to live in most other To put that into perspective, housing costs are reported to consume nearly a quarter of Nevadans'[[Page S8104]]paychecks. One report suggests that after the cost-of-living expenses are taken out of their paychecks, the average Nevadan has a little more than $700 left. During a recent telephone townhall, I heard from a teacher in Las Vegas who spoke about her stagnant wages. This teacher, like most Americans, has not seen a meaningful pay raise in years.  But right now, for many Americans, it is not so much about getting a raise as it is getting back to where they once were. In Nevada, the real median household income is $7,000 lower today than it was in 2007. Let me repeat that. In Nevada, the real median household income is $7,000 lower today than it was 10 years ago. At the same time, childcare expenses have skyrocketed. In this country, the average cost for an infant in center-based care can be as high as $17,082 per year. By the way, that is more than a semester at the University of Nevada, Las It is more than a semester at the University of Nevada, In Nevada, that means that the average single parent could spend as much as 36 percent of his or her annual income to send an infant to center-based care.  Given rising housing and childcare expenses alone, middle-class families in Nevada and around this country are having a hard time covering day-to-day expenses and planning for their futures. Nearly one in five Americans has nothing set aside to cover an unexpected emergency, while nearly one in three Americans doesn't have at least $500 to cover an unexpected emergency expense. So it is fair to say, in Nevada at least, that the recession has never really ended.  Under the failed economic policies of the Obama administration, Nevadans suffered through 8 years of historically low economic growth. Think about that. In those 8 years, the average economic growth was less than 2 percent. As a result, wages and workers suffered, job creation suffered, and middle-class Americans suffered.  We are now at a crossroads. We have a chance to change course. We have the opportunity to pass meaningful tax cuts that will lift middle-class families, our communities, and our economy.  If you are against this bill, you are satisfied with the anemic 2-percent economic growth that was ushered in by the Obama administration. You accept this dismal growth as the new normal, but I will never accept this as the new normal. I think we can do better. In fact, I know we can do better. We have already seen improvement since President Trump has taken office.  If you are against this bill, you are against giving small businesses the chance to actually get off the ground and hire workers. You are against giving them better opportunities to expand, to invest, to increase wages, and to hire more workers. I know that our small businesses employ nearly half of all U.workers, and I know that this bill will make it easier for them to continue doing what they do best, and that is creating jobs.  Lastly, if you are against this bill, you are against tax cuts for the middle class because that is what this bill is all about, and if you know that nearly one-third of Americans don't have $500 to cover an emergency expense, then you know just how important a few extra dollars per month are to them. I do, and that is why I have been fighting to get this bill to the President's desk.  Earlier today, I was pleased to see the House pass the conference report that reconciles our two tax reform bills, and I look forward to soon having the opportunity to vote in support of this pro-growth package that delivers critically important tax relief to America's middle class and small businesses--a pro-growth package that will help boost jobs, a pro-growth package that will increase wages, a pro-growth package that will drive growth in our local communities, and a pro-growth package that will give a Nevada family of four, making $85,000 per year, a tax cut of $2,254 or, roughly, a relief of 20 percent of its tax liability, according to the nonpartisan Tax  Today, our small businesses and middle class suffer under an outdated and unfair Tax Code that crushes job creation and makes it harder for Nevadans and people all across this country to get ahead.  The fact is simple: After 30 years of disrepair and neglect, our current tax system needs to be fixed. Everybody knows that it doesn't work, that it is rigged against our job creators, and that it should be overhauled. These are the very problems our tax relief package helps to address.  I also recently spoke with an ambitious and hard-working Nevadan, an entrepreneur who started his own business while going to school full time. This young job creator brought up the enormous amount of money that he is paying in taxes, as well as how complicated it is to navigate the current system. He also spoke of an uneven playing field that tipped the system in favor of his foreign competitors. He wanted to know when Congress would deliver on reforms to boost the competitiveness of all American job creators.  Lastly, just this past weekend, I ran into a small business owner who said that he paid $160,000 in taxes last year. He said that $160,000 amounted to two pieces of machinery that he could have installed at his small manufacturing facility--machines that would have necessitated the creation of two highly paid jobs--jobs that would have been created but for our unfair tax system.  From their perspectives and from mine, Nevada has been waiting too long for a fairer, simpler Tax Code that they can enjoy. Nevadans, like most Americans, know how important passing this tax relief package is to our country's economy. Nevadans have seen the increased levels of economic growth under the new administration and know that this tax relief bill will add to it.  Let's talk about what this tax bill does and does not do.  This tax bill lowers individual tax rates across the board and let's taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money.  This tax bill roughly doubles the standard deduction that is used by most taxpayers, which gives a massive tax cut to the roughly 90 percent of Nevadans who are expected to use it.  This tax bill includes my amendment to double the child tax credit--an increase of $1,000 per child over current law--which will go a long way toward addressing the skyrocketing costs of childcare in my State and across the country.  This tax bill also includes my amendment to make it easier for startups and businesses to give lower level employees ownership stakes in their companies' successes by awarding stock options.  This tax bill protects and expands the medical expense deduction for our Nation's most vulnerable, as well as preserves popular retirement savings options, such as 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts.  This bill does not change the tax treatment of the student loan interest. It does not change graduate tuition waivers. It does not change the tax treatment of employer-paid tuition or the teacher deduction.  It preserves the tax exemption for private activity bonds that are used to finance private projects with a public benefit. These bonds benefit a wide array of individuals and organizations, such as charter schools, and are of great importance to the homeschool community.  Overall, this tax bill accomplishes my three major goals of, one, creating jobs; two, increasing wages; and three, boosting American competitiveness.  Regardless of the tales that my friends from across the aisle want to tell you, this bill not only cuts taxes, but it also increases wages.  We have a prime opportunity today to provide real tax relief to Nevadans and other Americans who have been waiting for a fairer, simpler Tax Code, real relief that lets the middle class keep more of its hard-earned money and makes our Tax Code easier to understand. There is less paperwork and more money in people's back pockets. There is real relief that also produces more quality jobs, higher wages, and growth in our communities.  This tax relief bill is a positive step toward restoring Nevadans' faith in the American dream by providing tax cuts for middle-class families and jump-starting job creation, higher wages, and economic growth.  I will continue to work with my colleagues in both Chambers to ensure that this desperately needed legislation makes it across the finish line to the[[Page S8105]]President's desk before the end of this week.

366,topic-id,1076,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I thank the sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of our committee, for offering this bill.  Each year, Mr.Speaker, public companies hold shareholder meetings wherein shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval.  Mr.Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that, before these annual shareholder meetings take place, public companies must provide shareholders with proxy statements that include all important facts about matters to be voted on at a shareholder meeting. Many shareholders and investment advisers rely on information provided by proxy advisory firms to guide their votes on these matters.  H.4015 would enhance transparency in the shareholder proxy system by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make their methodologies public.  Mr.Speaker, this is a pure disclosure bill, nothing more, nothing less. Proxy firms play an outsized role in the U.economy in shaping corporate governance. They counsel pension plans, mutual funds, and other institutional investors about how to vote the shares of corporations that they own.  With respect to institutional investors, Mr.Speaker, the share of institutional investor ownership was roughly 46 percent as recently as 1987, but today, that figure is more than 75 percent; in other words, the volume of proxy votes for which investors are responsible has grown into the billions.  In 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act that requires an investment adviser to vote in[[Page H10316]]the best interest of their clients' own proxies. A series of SEC no-action letters give the investment adviser a fundamental safe harbor from liability if they use a proxy adviser.  As a result, institutional investors have increasingly relied on proxy advisory firms to help them decide how to vote their shares. However, regulators, market participants, and academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of interest that are inherent in the business models and activities of proxy advisory firms.  The committee, for example, is aware of numerous instances whereby the two largest proxy advisory firms have issued vote recommendations to shareholders that include errors, misstatements of facts, and incomplete analysis.  For example, in one instance, a company reported that, even though the total shareholder return the company actually had generated for its shareholders was 64 percent, a proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, erroneously reported this calculation to be 26 percent.  Another company reported that ISS erroneously reported that the company's long-term cash awards will vest and pay out their maximum opportunity in the event of a change in control. Well, this was reported even though the company's plan had been amended and approved by the shareholders years earlier in a manner that would pay out at target upon change in control, and there are many other examples.  Some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been made without any contact to the public company at all, and then these same proxy advisory firms encourage companies to join their service in order to have the privilege to ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations. I suspect, for many people, this simply does not pass the smell test.  An industrial company told its shareholders, Mr.Speaker: ``ISS' negative recommendation was based on flawed analysis of our compensation programs that did not appropriately take into account the significant declines in our CEO's pay in 2015 or the performance-based nature of our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs.''  A pharmaceutical company responded to a proxy advisory firm's recommendations with this statement: ``For the second year in a row, Glass Lewis did not include its full pay for performance analysis in this report. For shareholders who rely only on Glass Lewis materials to make voting decisions, there is no discussion of the company's industry-leading performance over this time period.''  Again, Mr.Speaker, there are many, many more examples like these.  So another concern that many people have, Mr.Speaker, is that the two largest proxy advisory firms collectively--collectively--make up 97 percent of the proxy advisory industry--97 percent. This monopolization and the lack of transparency regarding proxy advisory firms means that the writings, analysis, reports, and voting recommendations of these two firms have a disproportionate effect on fundamental corporate transactions like mergers or acquisitions, the approval of corporate directors, and shareholder proposals. In other words, these two firms have a huge impact on our economy.  The bill of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.Duffy) helps address these concerns by setting up a new regulatory regime for proxy advisory firms that looks out for the interest of investors, shareholders, by ensuring they receive complete information through the proxy process and can better vote in a manner consistent with shareholder interest as opposed to the potential conflicted interest of a proxy firm.  Mr.Duffy's bill also helps ensure that shareholders and their proxies have access to accurate information regarding companies by allowing companies to provide input on proxy recommendations. This is especially important for emerging growth companies that rely heavily on investors.  A bad proxy recommendation in which emerging growth companies cannot refute the recommendation can be devastating to those emerging growth companies and, thus, have a harmful impact on our economy.  In a letter to our committee, the Biotechnology Innovation Organization wrote: ``Small business innovators operate in a unique industry that values a strong relationship with investors. Yet they are often held to standards that are not applicable to their company and forced to engage in proxy fights over issues that do not add value to shareholders.''  H.4015 would provide for SEC oversight of proxy advisory firms, ensuring that they operate within appropriate boundaries and can be held accountable to regulators and the public.  To be clear, Mr.Speaker, nothing in this bill permits companies to rewrite a proxy firm's report or forces a proxy firm to change its recommendation based on feedback received from the company.  In summary, H.4015 will improve transparency in the proxy system and enhance shareholder access to information by ensuring that proxy advisory firms are registered with the SEC, disclose potential conflicts of interest and codes of ethics, and make publicly available their methodologies for forming proxy recommendations and analysis. For every Member who believes in investor protection and supports a healthier economy, they should support H.4015.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1315  ",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgH10313.txt,1749,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

389,topic-id,341,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, while I was fascinated to hear so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle exclaim how much they care about working Americans, it just makes we wonder why now twice--twice--in the last 24 hours they have voted against giving the average working American a $2,059 tax cut. Twice now they have voted to deny working Americans tax relief in order to bolster their paychecks. I wonder about that.  I also wonder, as I listened to this litany of groups whose letters were entered into the Record, how often I heard labor union; government pension; Washington, D.C.; and special interest group.  What I didn't hear about is average working Americans who have their investment in trying to save to buy a home, trying to perhaps fund a small business, or send a kid to college. It is their interest that we are trying to stand up for.  So what we know is that the SEC--the Securities and Exchange Commission--have, for all intents and purposes, required investment advisers to use one of two proxy advisory firms, one of which, as my colleague, the author of the bill pointed out, is owned by a foreign labor union. Yet the SEC requires us to use them.  So here is the radical nature of the bill: the bill, H.4015, simply says that we ought to have transparency--something apparently my friends across the other side of the aisle are against.  We say they have to register with the SEC--something my friends on the other side of the aisle are against.  They have to disclose potential conflicts of interest. Apparently my friends on the other side are against that.  They have to disclose codes of ethics.

688,topic-id,775,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.3312, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017.  This very important piece of legislation was introduced by my friend, Mr.Luetkemeyer, who serves as chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee, and is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Members of the In fact, Mr.Speaker, the bill was approved in October by the Financial Services Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 47-12, so strong, Mr.Speaker, that even a majority of Democrats on the committee voted to support the bill.  This bill reforms what Republicans and now many Democrats acknowledge is a flawed and arbitrary framework under the Dodd-Frank Act to designate so-called systemically important financial institutions, also known as In fact, one of those Democrats who acknowledges that it is a flawed and arbitrary framework is none other than former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, the very Frank of Dodd-Frank, the coauthor of the Dodd-Frank He, himself, has said that this provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that many of us are trying to reform today is ``arbitrary'' and ``a mistake.'' Those are his words, Mr.Speaker, not mine.  That arbitrary and mistaken provision is Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all standard that subjects banks with $50 billion or more in assets to the same costly and cumbersome SIFI regulatory standards as trillion-dollar global systemically important institutions.  We should take note that this flawed standard has now been criticized by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve Board Governor Dan Tarullo, former Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry, and many other Obama appointees. In other words, Mr.Speaker, it is that bad.  Mr.Luetkemeyer's bipartisan bill--again, very strong bipartisan bill--replaces this inflexible, flawed, $50 billion threshold that has been criticized by so many with a series of well-established, critical standards that more accurately measure systemic importance.                              {time}  1515  Specifically, his legislation requires the Federal Reserve to review a financial institution's size, interconnectedness, global cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity, before determining whether the institution should be subject to heightened SIFI regulatory standards.  In other words, this bipartisan bill tailors regulations based on a bank's[[Page H10222]]actual level of risk, instead of Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all system that ensnares smaller regional and midsize banks that, essentially, have simple community bank lending models. These banks are not globally complex Wall Street banks and shouldn't be treated the same.  It simply doesn't make sense to subject small regional and midsize banks with only $50 billion in assets to the same expensive and cumbersome SIFI regulatory regime as a bank like JPMorgan Chase, which has $2.5 trillion in assets. Based on size alone, the $50 billion bank is just 2 percent, 2 percent of JPMorgan Chase's size.  What does make sense, Mr.Speaker, is to base the regulation of these financial institutions on their actual risk profile rather than their asset size alone, which is exactly what Mr.Luetkemeyer's strongly bipartisan bill will do.  Now, while I personally do not support the SIFI architecture at all and do not believe any financial institution in America should be designated too big to fail, it is important that we always continue to work to find bipartisan reforms where we can find them and improve current law, and the legislation before us today represents a good faith effort to do exactly that.  Let's keep in mind, Mr.Speaker, this is simply not a debate over an arcane definition in law. It is about the real world effect these regulations have on the U.economy and the working men and women whom we represent.  Let me share with my colleagues what the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council has to say about the importance of the bill that we are debating today: ``Access to working and growth capital remains a challenge for many entrepreneurs and small businesses. H.3312 would improve the lending environment and unleash capital by alleviating inappropriate requirements imposed on regional and midsize banks under Dodd-Midsize and regional banks, which many startups and small businesses have counted on for lending, have been negatively affected by this Dodd-Frank arbitrary trigger.''  Mr.Speaker, the American people deserve better. They deserve a healthy economy with growing paychecks, better jobs, and a brighter future. It is time to restore economic growth fueled by capital flowing from America's banks to American communities across our  So I urge my colleagues to correct this widely acknowledged mistake in Dodd-Frank, even acknowledged by former Congressman Barney Frank himself, and put into place real, discernible, critical standards, and help our struggling small businesses on Main Let's pass H.3312.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

719,topic-id,525,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for coming to the floor. I know how busy he is with his impeachment activities, so we are glad he has had an opportunity to come and share his views on this particular bill.  He spent a lot of time telling us who wasn't for the bill, but he didn't tell us who was for it. And I would, once again, inform my friend, my colleague from Texas, that not only is every single Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee for this bill, but a majority of the Democrats on the committee are for this bill. Perhaps that is why he could find so few Democrats to speak out against it.  So what we have heard, Mr.Speaker, is my colleague and the ranking member vociferously defend the whole idea that there should be institutions that are too big to fail. As they defend the Dodd-Frank Act, Mr.Speaker, I would like to point out that, yet again, the big banks have gotten bigger. Under their regulatory scheme, the big banks have gotten bigger and the communities banks have become fewer.  And now what they are telling us is: Oh, no, we have got to protect this regime.  Well, I don't believe in it. But what I do believe in, Mr.Speaker, and what Mr.Luetkemeyer believes in, is that we need to try to find some bipartisan solutions, some common ground, to try to make some common sense out of some of these regulations.  What is fascinating to me is so many of the Obama-era regulators have said this $50 billion threshold makes no sense. Usually, my Democratic colleagues will quote Mr.Tarullo, they[[Page H10229]]will quote Janet Yellen, or they will quote Mr.Well, all of them have said that the $50 billion threshold is essentially arbitrary and does not work.  So, at the end of the day, what it is doing, Mr.Speaker, is putting in an additional regulatory burden on banks that pose no systemic risk to our economy, making it more difficult to extend credit to hardworking Americans who need it. But for people who just voted against tax relief for hardworking Americans, I guess that is what I would expect.  Now they want to make sure that they don't have tax relief, they don't have mortgages, and they don't have credit cards. That is what they are defending, Mr.Speaker, and it is wrong.  On a bipartisan basis, today, I believe we are going to vote for H.3312 and make some sense out of this SIFI rule, and we will have a better America tomorrow.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.

372,topic-id,416,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support today of the Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, and I appreciate my good friend, Sean Duffy's work on it.  Over the past 3 decades, I have advocated for responsible shareholder activism and urged for corporate boards of directors to perform their responsibility of careful stewardship, particularly in their essential functions in evaluating corporate strategy, hiring able hardworking executive management, and, critically, capital allocation.  For example, as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, Warren Buffett, recommends, corporate compensation committees must be composed of ``saber-toothed tigers,'' not ``house cats,'' in their work.  Likewise, investors must take their responsibility to hold boards accountable for their irreplaceable role in maximizing returns for shareholders, while executing a corporate strategy that balances shareholder returns with employees and customers.  So the question is: How can investors effectively lower agency costs and actively meet this accountability mission?  For 20 years, this has been a much-discussed area by thoughtful experts like Warren Buffett, ISS founder Robert Monks, Marty Lipton, and Lawrence Grad schools at UCLA, Stanford, Harvard, Yale all researched this challenge. Organizations of institutional investors and corporate directors all proffer best practices.  And how do we best align these interests for this mission, but make conflicts of interest readily apparent?  The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.economy has grown over the last 2 decades and is a major shaper of corporate governance, and it is of national importance. These firms counsel our pension plans, our mutual funds, other institutional investors, which are more and more in the market; 75 percent of the market, compared to when Robert Monks started thinking about the idea in the late 1980s.  Under the current system, two proxy advisory firms now have 97 percent of the market, Mr.Speaker, and this monopolization and the lack of transparency regarding their work means that the writings, analyses, reports, and vote recommendations of just these two firms have a disproportionate effect on the fundamental corporate transactions, like mergers and acquisitions, the approval of corporate directors, and other shareholder proposals.  Also, this has created more of a checklist mentality in the boardroom. Directors today need information, yes, but, more importantly, they need wisdom. And the proxy advisory firms are driving people in boardrooms, in my view, to more of a checklist mentality, regulatory mentality, and less using their business judgment and wisdom to guide our public companies.  Proxy advisory firms aren't immune to conflicts of interest.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

707,topic-id,313,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.  I rise in strong support of H.3312, a bipartisan bill. A majority of the majority party and a majority of the minority party on our committee reported this bill to the House floor. It is sponsored by my friend, Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer, who has spent years studying Dodd-Frank, seven long years of studying the impact of Dodd-Frank, and how to improve it.  This bill removes a requirement that uses $50 billion as an asset test to designate whether a banking company in this country is systemically important and, if they are, subject them to higher regulatory standards.  But instead of ending too-big-to-fail, Dodd-Frank's misguided designation regime just entrenches it, Mr. Authorizing the government to designate large financial institutions as systemically important creates a new class of firms that markets will interpret and assume are too big to fail.  The SIFI designation, as noted by many Members on this side of the aisle, is, in fact, arbitrary, and I respect my friend that other numbers in statute may be arbitrary as well. But this one doesn't have any economic basis on why the participants in designing Dodd-Frank picked $50 billion.  But over the past 7 years, we have had witness after witness tell us that we should look a different direction and not have an arbitrary number of $50 billion.  Several Federal Reserve officials have expressed that similar view. Mr.Frank, as noted, has expressed that view. So here comes Mr.Luetkemeyer with an excellent idea, an idea of an activities-based designation that the Fed has designed itself, Mr. The Federal Reserve has designed the metric we are using to say that an institution is systemically important. It is activities-based so that we can distinguish between levels of risk that might be systemically important to our country.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

They will remember that President Trump promised that the middle class would get a tax cut and wealthy individuals like him would not, before turning his back on that promise.  They will remember those who cast their vote to kick 13 million Americans off their health insurance coverage.  They will remember those who acted with the full knowledge that their votes would trigger a $25 billion cut to I know you said you are going to waive it, which would simply add $25 billion more to the deficit.  Posterity will also remember those who stood up in the face of this dangerous and partisan bill and said ``no.'' Those of us who vote against it are doing so not because we oppose tax reform. On the contrary. We recognize, as most Americans do, that this bill is not tax reform. It is a tax giveaway to those who don't need our help, paid for by those who need it the most. This is reckless and dangerous deficit spending at its worst.

Not a single dime.  This has not been an open process. This has not been bipartisan. This has not been transparent or through regular order.

368,topic-id,673,"Mr.Speaker, as has been pointed out each year, public companies convene these shareholder meetings at which the companies' shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other significant corporate actions that require shareholder approval.  As part of this annual process, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to provide their shareholders with a proxy statement before those meetings.  A proxy statement includes all important facts about the matters to be voted on at the meeting, including, for example, information on board of directors candidates, director compensation, executive compensation, related party transactions, securities ownership by management, and eligible shareholder proposals.  The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of directors and the approval of these other corporate actions. Solicitations, whether by management or shareholders, must disclose all important facts about the issues on which the shareholders are being asked to vote.  Institutional investors, including investment advisers to mutual funds and pension funds, typically hold shares in a large number of public companies. Each year, the investment advisers to these funds vote billions of shares on behalf of their clients on thousands of proxy ballot items.  What you have heard about, really, was the theoretical way this is supposed to run. Unfortunately, that is not reality, and that is not what you are hearing from the other side, because in 2003, the SEC adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, requiring an investment adviser that exercises voting authority over its clients' proxies to adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that the investment adviser votes those proxies in the best interests of their clients. That is exactly what they should be doing.  The SEC's release adopting the rule clarified that ``an adviser could demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest if it voted client securities, in accordance with a predetermined policy, based upon the recommendations of an independent third party.''  Okay so far, but here is where we see the problem. As a result, institutional investors increase their reliance on these proxy adviser firms to help them decide how to vote their shares.  In 2004, the SEC staff, without a Commission vote, just the staff, issued two ``no action'' letters ``effectively blessing the practice of investment advisers simply voting the recommendations provided by a proxy adviser,'' according to SEC Commissioner Dan  Largely, as a result of the SEC's regulation, proxy adviser firms now wield tremendous outside influence on the U.proxy system. Studies have shown that the two largest proxy adviser firms are comprised of approximately 97 percent of all the proxy advisory industry and can control a significant percentage of share votes in corporate elections, which is sometimes as high as 40 percent. There have been numerous instances where these two firms have issued vote recommendations on publicly traded companies that include errors, misstatements of fact, and incomplete analysis.  Additionally, some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been made without any sort of communication or contact with the public company that they are actually reviewing. In fact, these same proxy advisory firms even encourage companies to join their service on the other side of the ledger in order to have the privilege to ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations.  Members heard from the ranking member about a teacher having to check with a student about what their grades are going to be as a student.  Well, what this is, Mr.Speaker, this is the teacher shaking down the student for their lunch money and milk[[Page H10318]]money to make sure that they are behaving.  So let's talk about reality here.  Regulators, market participants, and academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of interest inherent to this business model and activities of these proxy firms. For example, proxy advisory firms may feel pressured by their largest clients, who may be activist investors, to issue voting recommendations that reflect those clients' specific agendas, not the boards' or the corporations'.

370,topic-id,187,"Mr.Speaker, additionally, proxy advisory firms often provide voting recommendations to investment advisers on matters for which they also provide consulting services to public companies. Talk about, again, a conflict of interest.  Some proxy advisory firms also rate or score these public companies on their governance structures, policies, practices, and they are trying to actually influence the corporate governance practices of these companies.  Essentially, these proxy advisory firms have hijacked the proxy system by aligning themselves with activist shareholders, who also might be their clients, to push social and political initiatives rather than using shareholder votes to maximize shareholder value and increasing shareholder returns.                              {time}  1330  Well, H.4015 is to the rescue on this.

697,topic-id,424,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his continued work on this, and I also want to thank my colleague and friend from Missouri, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for his important work on this issue.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor on this legislation because it is an important bill for regional banks in Illinois, but also around the country.  The Financial Services Committee has spent a significant amount of time debating which banks should qualify as so-called community banks and regional banks when determining how to legislate regulatory relief.  I have to agree that, as a bank starts getting larger, it starts looking less and less like a community bank. But both Republicans and Democrats have agreed that asset size should not be the sole characteristic for determining a bank's riskiness to the financial system.  There are a number of banks that have successfully made use of the traditional community bank business[[Page H10224]]model of deposit taking and lending that have grown in size. Some have grown substantially, and now they are able to serve more than one community.  Congress should not punish these financial institutions with an asset threshold that even Congressman Barney Frank described as arbitrary. Our policies should encourage low-risk relationship lending so communities can benefit from institutions of different sizes. At a minimum, we should provide the banking regulators some flexibility to determine which institutions with assets over $50 billion pose higher risk to the financial system.  In addition to the outstanding community banks in my district, my constituents also look to regional banks like BMO and Discover when they are trying to find best rates on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, or their student loans.  Discover Financial Services, which has its headquarters just outside my district in Riverwoods, Illinois, has a simple business model that includes credit cards, student loans, home equity lending, and a number of deposit products that you would expect from a Main Street financial institution. This is the only business Discover is in. Nothing they do is comparable to what you might see in one of the big money center banks.  So why did Congress mandate that this bank be automatically designated as systemically important? The current law is arbitrary and subjects banks to the same standards as trillion-dollar global systemically important institutions.  Automatically designating these institutions as systemically important unnecessarily increases the cost of lending and makes it more difficult for my constituents to achieve their financial goals.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017.

They were not getting the help they need, and they were not getting the treatment to the highest standards that were available.  This isn't how we take care of veterans in Senator Lankford and I and two of the House Members worked on this and talked to regional Veterans' Administration leadership. We talked to the veterans. We talked to whistleblowers. And we identified three key problems that we needed to fix. This is interesting because these are three problems in my State of Oklahoma, but they would be the same thing in Nebraska or any other State because it is not just in our State of  The first one was that the VA couldn't fire bad employees.  This is always a problem. You go into an organization and you find that things are not going very well because there are one or two bad employees. Yet it takes you a year before you are able to get rid of these people. Despite having been identified, it takes forever to terminate an employee.  Well, we fixed that this past summer when President Trump signed the VA Accountability Act that included our language to allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to immediately fire employees for misconduct or poor performance. That was successful. We did it. That is history.  I have to say that during President Trump's administration so far, he has used this firing authority on over 500 bad actors from the VA, and we are finally creating a culture of accountability in the VA, which is having positive results. That is the first reform.  The second one: Too many veterans were forced to receive care from VA facilities that were hours away or didn't provide specialized care.  This is a problem. A lot of these veterans don't have the capability to move around and get the care they need, and they didn't have the choices. So we actually had to make a change, and we did. We worked with the President and reauthorized the bipartisan VA Choice  The VA Choice Program is great because it allowed our veterans to actually, in those hard-to-reach areas, get high-quality healthcare, regardless of where they had to travel to get it done. That was a success.  Finally, after the USA TODAY article, we requested an accredited third-party look at the problem at our VA facilities because previous reports from the Obama Veterans Affairs inspector general failed to identify and correct these problems. Well, my request was denied. It is just like any bureaucracy. They don't want someone looking over their shoulder, so they said: No, we are not going to allow you to have a third party accompany the VA to look into the problem that you have.  Some are not aware of this, but in the Senate, when someone is nominated, we can put a hold on them and not allow them to go through confirmation--at least for a long period of time. At that time, the President--our current President--had nominated a person to be the inspector general of the Veterans' We put a hold on him until they allowed someone to come in and monitor the evaluation that the VA was doing of their own bureaucracy in That worked, except the problem with that is it was a one-time authorization. We needed to make that a permanent part of our structure. I am pleased to say we did that.  When we signed the Enhancing Veteran Care Act, it permanently granted the VISN directors--that is one of the director levels of the VA--and gave the medical center directors the authority to request, at their request, an outside oversight in order to evaluate what they had done. It has been very successful.  It is important for the regional directors to have the authority because[[Page S8205]]they have the best idea of the reality of care at their facilities.  I appreciate the work of my colleagues, Senator James Lankford, Congressman Markwayne Mullin, and Congressman Steve It turned out to be a real good team, and we are able to get these things done. We are already starting to see real progress in improving the veterans' care in Oklahoma and across the country because as we are improving the system we had in Oklahoma, that same system can be improved in Nebraska or any other  We need to get our VA facilities from their current ratings to the highest standard. The highest standard rating is five stars. We are now up to three stars in We were at one star when we first discovered this problem on that fateful day 2 years ago today in an article in USA  President Trump will continue to be an important partner for Oklahoma as we continue to improve our veterans' care.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8204.txt,583,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT--MOTION TO PROCEED,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
84,topic-id,1033,"Mr.President, President Trump's commitment to our veterans is only matched by his commitment to our servicemembers and our national security. You can't really segregate it out and say, well, we are going to take care of our veterans' activities and then still say we are not going to allow our country to have the national security they fought so hard for.  We saw that earlier this week when the President outlined his national security strategy, charting a new course for American foreign policy, leaving behind the failed policies of the Obama administration. With his national security strategy, President Trump has been clear that he is committed to protecting the homeland, promoting American prosperity, and advancing peace through strength. Have you ever heard that before, peace through strength? I am one of the few who is old enough around here who remember our great President we had who talked about peace through strength when he had to rebuild the military after the Carter administration. It was actually as bad--or as downgraded as our military has become from the last administration.  Now he is asserting America's leadership in the free world. We saw how under President Obama the military was forced to divert resources for priorities that weren't even about defending He used the military to advance his liberal agenda, which led to the wasteful spending on what they call the green Navy and the green bullets. The idea that climate change was the largest threat to our national security, all of that has changed and not a moment too soon.  President Trump is focused on what matters, rightfully taking out things like just worrying about climate change as opposed to rebuilding our military, and he is building it at a very rapid rate right now.  We passed the bill, the Defense authorization bill, and we have made a great start on this.  Now, when the President came into office, our military was facing a readiness crisis, and Americans didn't really understand this. They didn't know. They had not been told this. We had a biased media that didn't allow this information to get out. As an example, our Air Force today, right now, is short 1,500 pilots, and 1,300 of those are actually fighter pilots. Only 50 percent of the Air Force squadrons are trained and ready to conduct all of their assigned missions. I have to repeat that. Only 50 percent of our Air Force squadrons are trained and ready to defend  The Navy is the smallest and least ready it has been in years. It currently can only meet 40 percent of the demand for regional combat. The commanders in the field include only enough personnel to man six and a half of our nine carrier air wing.  A carrier air wing is something a lot of people are not familiar with. A carrier air wing has approximately 75 combat aircraft. Currently, we have manned only 6\1/2\ wings and are 8,000 sailors short.  This is an air wing. They have F-18s, they have EA-18s, they have F-35s, they have C-2Again, just a little over half of ours are actually ready. Well, that is the problem we are faced with right now. More than half of the Navy's F-18s are grounded because they are awaiting maintenance or lack of necessary parts. If you look at our Marines, our Marines are using F-18s, and 62 percent of F-18s will not fly. People are just shocked when they find out about it. It is because we don't have the spare parts. Well, we are getting busy on that. We are going to make sure we correct those problems.  The Army has said that only about one-third of their brigade combat teams, one-fourth of their air aviation brigades, and one-half of their division headquarters are currently ready.  A brigade combat team consists of 7 battalions, approximately 4,500 students. I wish I had time to come up with a chart on this, but the carrier wing is one that is absolutely necessary to get folks straight, and we plan on doing that.  Faced with the most dangerous threats I have seen in my lifetime, these are critical gaps in our military we simply cannot accept.  I often say, when I look back at the good old days of the Cold War, where we had two superpowers--and the superpowers, we knew what they had, they knew what we had. It is totally different now.  You have a country like North Korea, which has demonstrated that they have the capacity now to reach an American city. We learned that on November 28, when they actually demonstrated a range that would reach one of our continental U.cities.  They tried to give us a little bit of comfort in saying, well, we don't know that they would be able to carry a warhead. We don't think they would have the capacity to do that. Well, we don't know that. That is not much comfort.  When they say: We don't have the capacity to be accurate on a reentry because of what a missile has to go through on a reentry, well, that is not very comforting that this would happen.  Anyway, the NDAA--the bill we passed, that the President signed into law--would be a good step in correcting the readiness shortfalls. I look forward to continuing to work with him on this critical process.  We have a committee that already is having hearings about the problems we are having. We had one, actually, in the subcommittee hearing I chaired just this week. We are busy correcting these problems.  Meanwhile, back to our VA problems in Oklahoma, we put two new great directors in the VA clinics. We have a level of veterans' care Oklahomans are proud of. Only yesterday, President Trump signed the Enhancing Veteran Care Act to ensure that we continue to give our veterans the best care. They deserve it, and they are going to get it.  At the same time, we are going to restore and rebuild the military as our Nation's 1 priority. Our troops deserve it, and they are going to get it.  I yield the floor.

233,topic-id,97,"Madam President, let me make a comment to the Senator from West One of the problems we have right now is that during the last administration, there was a war on fossil fuel--which includes coal and nuclear also--and some of the damage has already been done.

682,topic-id,2668,"Mr.President, that is not what I am here to talk about today. I would like to speak about someone who--I will put it this way: Way back in the 1950s, back when Eisenhower was President, three giants came to Washington, Two of the three giants people know about and they have heard of and they are well known. One was Billy Oh, we remember Billy Graham still, right now, and the things he has done. He has done more for Jesus and for Every time I get a chance to see something on TV that is from one of his past rallies, I do so.  Another one who came, of the three giants who came, was Bill Some may not remember who Bill Bright was. He was the founder of the Campus Crusade for He was the guy who actually started--people are not aware of this in the general public, but we actually have events two times a week; one is a Prayer Breakfast and one is a Bible study. Bill Bright was the one who started that. So everyone has heard of Bill Bright and the Campus Crusade for  The third giant who came in no one has heard of, and his name was Doug This is Doug Doug Coe came with the other two giants, and he really changed He died last February 21. I purposely, for an obvious reason my colleagues will find out in a minute, waited until now to talk very much about him.  You see, people think of Doug Coe as having been someone who was a great diplomat, he had political influence and all that. There is an article written not long ago, and I will read this to you because he did things like that. He did it second only to his real mission in life.  The article goes like this:       The extent of Coe's influence in American politics is      [real]. . . . important figures have acknowledged his role on      the national and international stage. For instance, speaking      at the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast, President George H.     Bush praised Coe for his quiet diplomacy.  I don't ever remember in the years I have known him that he ever raised his voice. He was always a quiet diplomat.       [Doug Coe] was a behind-the-scenes player at the Camp David      Accords in 1978, working with President Jimmy Carter to issue      a worldwide call to prayer with Israeli Prime Minister      Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar In 2000,      Coe met with the top economic officials of Pakistan as a      ``special envoy.'' Coe met with President George H.Bush as      he hosted a luncheon with Iraq's ambassador to the United      States in the mid-1980s. In 2001, Coe helped arrange a      private meeting between two warring leaders.  By the way, I was there so I remember this firsthand. That was the President of Congo, Joe Kabila, and the President of Rwanda, Paul I was there during the National Prayer Breakfast, and he had these two Presidents of warring countries in there to talk to them in the spirit of That is when everything broke down, they became friends, and they signed a peace accord. That was Doug       Coe was a member of the large United States Congressional      and ministerial delegation which accompanied then First Lady      Hillary Clinton to the 1997 funeral of the founder of the      Sisters of Charity, Mother He is mentioned by John      Ortberg in his book, ``If You Want to Walk on Water, You've      Got to Get Out of the Boat.''  He talked about how the book was partly about Doug He was the guy who had a great influence in bringing medicine and releasing political prisoners in We all remember that episode.  So here we have a guy who was bringing warring powers together. He was solving serious problems with the country. Yet that wasn't even his mission.  I know I will lose credibility when I say this because people will think it is impossible. A few people here know it is not impossible because they heard it once before; that is, Doug Coe has actually taken his mission, which is the Jesus mission--by the way, Time magazine listed him among the 25 most influential evangelicals in America, but, anyway, I will lose credibility when I say that, in effect, Doug Coe has been to every country in the world. The reason I know this--I thought we had him one time because Zanzibar is actually--people think it is a separate country next to He never was in Zanzibar, and I was. Then we found out he was right, and I was wrong; that was not a separate country.  Anyway, he has had this Jesus mission since actually the late 1940s.  I want to just mention that I hope and pray my kids and grandkids, when it comes time for me to cash out, will be as respectful and as loving as his kids and grandkids were at his funeral. We called it a celebration, not a funeral. One of his grandkids, Sam Wagner, talked about a trip he and his[[Page S8086]]grandpa took to Sam recalled how Doug not only met with dignitaries, but he also met with the young kids carrying machine guns who had shut the city down.  Justin is a grandson. He recited the story of Jesus feeding the 5,000 and said that Doug reminds him of the little boy in that story. Just as the boy brought his loaves and fish to Jesus, Doug brought all he had to  Doug used to ask his grandson the question: If you give Jesus all of your love, what will happen? You will not run out of love for other people. Rather, Jesus will make your love enough for the whole world.  That is a grandson. Gosh, I would like to have my grandsons feel that way.  Melissa, a granddaughter, at the very last of the celebration I am referring to, stood up and said: I want you to leave this service talking about Jesus because Doug would certainly have been disappointed if you left talking about him.  So, anyway, we have people like that. We had famous people at that meeting, by the way. One was Barbara Williams-The first time she met Doug, he talked like he already knew her well and like she already knew Jesus well, even though she had only recently accepted Jesus into her life, but Barbara Skinner is a very liberal Democrat, a wonderful person, and she jokingly said that Doug didn't understand gender issues because most of his fellowship members were men, and he would say to her: We brothers have to stick together.  Doug made Barbara pray for Ronald Reagan at the National Prayer Breakfast when Ronald Reagan was Even after she told him she didn't know enough Scripture to pray for Republicans, Doug challenged her to confront her skepticism of people of different beliefs, and she did.  You know, he had a way of getting things done that other people didn't. One of the well-known people who was there at the celebration was Sam We remember Sam He was a very well-known U.He is one who really concentrated on rebuilding our national defense when it needed to be rebuilt. He would talk about Doug He said Doug formed small fellowships and prayer groups in the House, in the Senate, at the Pentagon, at the executive branch, the judicial branch, and he also formed groups globally all over the world. He started many diverse fellowship groups throughout Japan and injected them all with Jesus was it with  Sam told a story about playing golf with Doug was a good golfer. He was talented. He made bets with the people he played golf with, and if they lost, they would have to--it wasn't a money deal--they would have to memorize a Bible verse or go on mission trips. Doug always wins.  I always will remember what Sam said. Very quietly, in a quiet voice, he said: Doug Coe was a sermon we saw. If we looked closely, we also saw a glimpse of  Another guy who is very well known to all of us here--known worldwide--is this guy named Ward Ward Brehm enjoys talking about Doug He is the one who repeated something that George H.Bush said a long time ago. He said: Doug Coe has more friends who are heads of State than I do. This is the President of the United States talking.  President Bush also said--one of his favorite quotes: ``Doug Coe was the most famous person that nobody has ever heard of.''  Well, anyway, Ward Brehm was telling a story, and he said: In an early conversation about Africa, Doug once asked me: If you were God, how would you help all of those poor people in Africa?  My mind went totally blank, and I stammered: I don't know.  Doug said: We are not in a hurry. Just think about it for a while.  Ward Brehm said: So I did. I thought about it for a while, and my mind was still a blank. So, finally, in frustration, I said: I am not God so I don't know what I would do, but you seem to know so you tell me, if you were God, how would you help the poor people in Africa?  Doug Coe said very quietly: I would change the hearts of their leaders.  This is what Doug did. He didn't just change the hearts of leaders, he changed the hearts of leaders around the world--every country in the world. One man did that. I don't know how that is even possible.  Another person who was--had a different kind of expression is Lee Not many people remember Lee He was well known in Republican circles. He actually was the chairman of the Republican Party a number of years ago. He was a talented, charismatic guy. He played guitar. He sang. Everybody loved him. He was arguably one of the best political mechanics around at that time.  Something bad happened to him. He got leukemia. He knew he was going to die, but he wasn't sure--he said: I am going to die. I have to be rational about this thing. I don't know who God or Jesus is.  So, on Friday, March 16, after a White House breakfast, Lee struck up a conversation with the President's secretary. I remember her, Patty She suggested that he call Doug She was suggesting that Lee Atwater call Doug At that time, he was working with Members of Congress on the National Prayer  Eleven days later, Lee arrived at the Cedars in Virginia overlooking the Potomac, which served as the headquarters for Doug Coe's Fellowship Now, using a cane, Lee Atwater, nearing his death, walked into the main house and sized up his 60-year-old host. He said: I have been in this city for many years now, and I never heard of you. Who are you, anyhow? He said that to  Doug said: Well, we have many mutual friends all over the city. I have heard about you for a long time.  Lee Atwater said: What have you heard?  Doug replied: I have heard that you are a real S-O- He didn't say S-O-B, he said the real words, and their dialogue began at that time.  So from then until August, Lee was deteriorating, and one August day, Lee asked Coe to come to his hospital bed in an emergency. He was dying, and he wanted to find out, What is this deal about Jesus? What is this deal about God? He said that when he arrived, Lee looked at him with his best piercing glare, and he said: This Jesus business, is he God or isn't he God? Tell me. Some say he is God, some say he is man.  Doug replied: This is something you have to decide for yourself, but let me just tell you a little story.  Lee gave Coe his full command and focus.  Doug Coe said: You are big on the Golden Now, let's just say that you are the most powerful figure in the universe.  This is Doug Coe talking to Lee  You are the most powerful person in the universe, and you could say, let there be a star or a planet and, boom, it exists; or you wanted to create elephants and, boom, there are elephants or cows or human beings. Anything you wanted, you had all the power, right? You understand that? So you are sitting up on a cloud somewhere, looking down on Earth, and you see these cows grazing in a field, and you decide that you want to be a real companion to those cows. Now, what would you do?  All of a sudden, that picture of God becoming man had a clarity of an index card summary. He said: I got it. I got it, he shouted. Don't tell me any more. Don't tell me any more. It is very clear. And he died.  Doug had a way of saying things that nobody else did.  The last one I will mention--this is significant to me because I happened to be with Doug at the time the statement was made.  President Museveni is the President of Like many of the Presidents in Africa, he is one who came through the bush and fought his way up, and he has been, I think, an excellent  Doug has told him Jesus said: ``I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father but by me.''  This always bothered President  The President said to Doug Coe: Look, we can go out into the bush. We have villages. They have never heard of They have never heard of Are you saying that there is no way they are going to get to Heaven?  Doug told President Museveni a story--that he had actually experienced this revelation. When he was in[[Page S8087]]the Gobi Desert several years ago to visit Mongolian sheepherders, he told them that he had a friend who was a shepherd. In fact, he told them that his friend is the greatest shepherd who ever lived. His friend knows all of the flock, even the names of each sheep. If one of the sheep gets lost, the shepherd leaves the flock to search for the one lost sheep. The Mongolian sheepherders were amazed as Doug told him about this shepherd.  The next day the Mongolian sheepherders told Doug that during the night they had decided to follow this shepherd, but they wanted to know his name. Doug said that his name was They told Doug that they had always known about him, but they never knew his name, and President Museveni understood what he was talking about.  Doug Coe had a way of explaining things that other people didn't. I was particularly blessed because for 20 years I met with Doug every Tuesday for an hour at 5 o'clock. I was a recipient of all the grace he had in the political philosophy of I call it that; Doug didn't call it that. It is all scripturally based. Acts 9:15 says: What did Jesus say to Paul on the road to Damascus?  He said: Take my name. Take my name to the  Doug spent all those years in every country in the world, taking his name to the Acts 2:42--that is the genesis of the small meetings we have. Not many people are aware of them. We are here in the U.Senate every Wednesday morning, and we meet in the Spirit of We have been doing it ever since Doug started this many years ago. It is all scripturally based. It is Acts 2:42.

1311,topic-id,614,"First of all, Mr.President, as to my very good friend from Virginia--and he is a very good friend--I think he needs to reread this bill.  Now, I am older than he is and most of the people around here, but I do remember the Reagan tax cuts. This is a Reagan tax cut.  I listened to the other side and a lot of the liberals on the other side, because there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans, and we understand that. But they come out and say: Oh, it is always class warfare. It is always that they are doing this for the rich. The rich are going to get richer. Well, that is not the way this worked out.  There is a group called the National Tax The National Tax Foundation did an analysis of this, and they did it State by In my State of Oklahoma, the average family of four will get an increase in their take-home pay of $2,000. Now, where does it come from? There is the standard deduction, for example. The Senator talked about this being for the rich. This isn't for the rich. The standard deduction actually goes from $6,000 to $12,000. If you are married, it is from $12,000 to $24,000.  There is the child tax credit. We are all concerned about the child tax credit. Several Republicans wanted to do even more than that. Right now, as the law is, it is $1,000, but it is going to be increased after this is over, after we vote. After we have a major tax reduction, that child tax credit will go from $1,000 to $2,000 per child. That is a huge thing. That is not for the wealthy.  I listen sometimes when they talk about how this is going to increase the deficit. I have to tell you, though, that I remember very well. In fact, I remember so well. I have given speeches over time. Reagan reduced taxes twice. One was in 1981 and one in 1986. In 1986 and 1981, the total amount of revenue that came into the Federal Government was $469 billion. He had a huge reduction in rates. Yes, the top rate went down from 70 percent to 50 percent, then the others went down in accordance with a similar percentage.  Now, what happened to that was that, while the total amount that came in before the tax cuts was $469 billion, afterward, it was $750 billion. The same thing happened in 1986. In 1986, the total revenue that came into the Federal Government was $569 billion. At the end of that period of 10 years that they were measuring, it was $1 trillion.  Now, the problem is, the other side is always saying that our deficits increased during that time period. Yes, they did, but I have to say this: It was not because of Ronald Reagan, it was because the House and the Senate were run by liberal Democrats, and as fast as the increase in revenue came in, they were spending not just the increase but even more.  So that is one of the differences now. I anticipate that we are going to have a conservative House and Senate for the years to come, and we will just have to wait and see what is right.  I do agree with my friend from Virginia, though, in one respect; that is, he and I both had the hardest job in the world. You never know what a hard job is until you are mayor of a major city. There is no hiding place, and if they don't like the trash, it ends up in your front yard.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8083-6.txt,583,PROTECT BOB MUELLER,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

499,topic-id,1450,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to commend Senator Orrin I listened to the debate over this bill not just today but for the better part of 3 years I have been a member of the Finance I have never heard a more dignified, deliberate, intelligent delivery on any subject than we all just heard from Orrin Hatch on the tax bill. Regardless of your politics, regardless of where you are from, it is good to know that America has dignified statesmen like Orrin Hatch to take the tougher issues, simplify them, get people to join hands, work together, and pass what is right for the American people. I am glad the American people are going to get to see that over the next couple of days.  I publicly want to thank Senator Hatch for all he has done and all I know he has done in Washington during the last 3 years. In the 3 years on this committee, I have seen us--Republican and Democratic committee and subcommittee alike--work on every facet of the Tax Code to try to simplify changes down to doable amounts and doable jobs. I have seen everybody have input. I have seen everybody work together. Sure, we have had differences. Senator Hatch has always kept the mainstream there, kept his hand on the tiller, and saw to it that we never lost sight of doing what we need to do, which is to reform our Tax  I want to commend Senator Hatch and Senator Enzi, as well, for the work they have done on the Budget Committee to get us to this point and the unsung heroes that all of us know about, our staffs, whom we cannot do without. Jay Khosla and Mark Prater on the Finance Committee have been outstanding and have made this thing work, and I commend them for their work. On my staff, I could not have done what I have done without Amanda Maddox, Trey Kilpatrick, Monica McGuire, and Jay Sulzmann, who have all worked hard to see to it that we made the right decisions for the right reasons for the people of  I am very proud to be a part of this Senate today and of what is going to prove to be a historic day in the future. There are a lot of naysayers saying that this is not going to work. There are a lot of people who have come up to me today and have asked questions that have bad connotations to them. Yet I want, for just a minute, to talk about what I think this tax bill really means for the American people--for the folks who voted for me to represent them--and for what is going to happen in the years ahead.  I had a reporter stop me today while I was coming up to the floor.  He asked: Senator Isakson, where are you going to find the $1.478 trillion that you all are costing us by passing this tax cut?  I said: First of all, we have not lost the money. Second of all, that is a static score. Third of all, I will be willing to bet you that we will take in a lot more money because of our having a dynamic economy than we will ever lose with a single tax cut.  There are some people whose thought process is one of tunnel vision. They can't see outside the blinders. They don't understand that tax policy drives economic decisions.  There are companies that in the last few years had been thinking about leaving America because of our tax rate that are now deciding to stay because of the new change. Don't underestimate the power of the territorial tax change that this makes for American business.  A lot of CEOs who go to their annual stockholder meetings for C corporations in America have to go with a[[Page S8094]]game plan to raise the return on their stocks in order to have people invest in their companies. Unfortunately, the easiest way to raise the return on their stock today would be for a domestic American company to move their headquarters out of the United States to Ireland or to some other place that had a lower tax rate. If you put more money on the table for the stockholders, it will be bad for the country, bad for your company, and bad for the American people as jobs leave  Now that we have a territorial system that we are going to, there is an incentive to stay in America if you are located there and to come to America if you are not. We are not going to have any more fast food companies that are buying doughnut makers in Canada and then moving their headquarters to Canada to get a lower tax rate. We are going to have a lot of new companies that will think about becoming doughnut makers and will do it right here in the United States because the new tax system we will have will be fair and equitable for economic development and building growth.  On the personal side, you really cannot argue with doubling the standard deduction. You can't argue with doubling of the child tax credit. You can't argue with simplifying the tax process itself and the filing of taxes. You can't argue with lowering rates--having seven different rate categories that are all lowered. You can't really argue with all of that because you know that is better for the American people and their pocketbooks in the short run, but in the long run, it will be better for them and their children and their grandchildren in terms of employment.  I have eight grandchildren. My oldest just graduated from college, and the youngest is 9. In the years ahead--and I hope that I will get to see a lot of them--they are going to get jobs, and they are going to work. They are going to raise their families.  What we have done today is going to make it easier for them to find employment for their kids, opportunity to develop businesses, and peace of mind because they will live in a country that will be vibrant and true.  For those who want to ask what we are going to do about the money that we are giving up, I don't deal with static scoring; I deal with dynamic scoring.  When I ran a company for 25 years, I made investments where I knew I had a place to grow. I made business decisions where there was positive growth ahead if I made the right decision. This Tax Code--this change in the Tax Code, this opportunity that we have--does all of those things.  Do I know exactly what is going to happen? No, but I am willing to bet--and I have bet my vote already in committee and will later on tonight on the floor of the Senate--on the American people and the American worker and the American entrepreneur. I will bet on their taking advantage of a tax code that is fair to them and that gives them a chance to expand their personal opportunities. I will bet on them that they are willing to move forward with a better tax code for all of the country. I will make my bet on them that they will want to see to it that their children and their grandchildren will have the opportunities that they have had as well.  I thank Chairman Hatch for what he has done in the last 3 years to make this opportunity come about.  I thank the distinguished Senator from Washington and the Senator from Alabama, whom, unfortunately, we are losing in the next few weeks, for what they have put in this legislation. I thank them for what they have done in their looking out for their people.  Did we make any mistakes? Maybe, but you never make mistakes when you are trying to do the right thing. You never make mistakes when you are trying to do a good thing. You never make mistakes when you take a risk because when you take a risk, at the end of that rainbow is a reward. When you take a risk in lowering taxes, the greater reward is more jobs, more opportunity, and a better America for our children and our grandchildren.  I thank Senator Hatch for his work and for all that he has done to make America a better country and, in particular, for giving us the chance today to make our tax system fairer for all of the American people.  May God bless him.  I yield the floor.

He always offered to give me the information that I needed to make the decision myself. That is not a rarity in that profession, but it is certainly something that the average person doesn't think of when you hear of a lobbyist or a professional advocate.  Jim McCool is, has been, and, for me, always will be very special. He takes his job seriously, his company seriously, and his country seriously. Jim and his wife, Kathy, raised three great sons. They are proud of their dad, and he is proud of them. I have seen him in enough situations with his family to know that his family comes first for Jim Golf, unlike what most people think, is not first. It is only second. The Southern Company is third. I have played a lot of golf with Jim McCool, and that is why I put that in there.  Over the years, I have worked with Jim on many, many projects. Right now, we are working on a nuclear production tax credit, in addition to the tax extenders bill, which, hopefully, will pass the Congress within the next 2 weeks, after January 1, to continue the construction and the completion of units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle in For me, ironically, this was such a special moment because I had worked on Vogtle units 1 and 2 when they were built in the early 1980s and when Jim was an advocate, at that time, for Mississippi He later joined the Southern Company team.  Jim and I have watched Plant Vogtle go from a dream and an aspiration for the Southern Company to a reality in terms of units 1 and 2. If we get our work done here soon, units 3 and 4 will be online. For a long time after Jim McCool is gone and I am gone and all of you are gone, Georgia will have reliable, safe energy from a renewable source called nuclear, and we will continue to be a pioneer and a leader in the southern United  When I heard that Jim was retiring, obviously, I knew it was a special moment for him and his family. I wish him all the best, and I know that he is going to do great. I started thinking back over all of those times that we had worked on all of those issues that had such an impact on his job and his employer and, for me, on my State and his Jim never wavered in his commitment to doing the best job he could possibly do in always representing the best interests of his company while never losing the best interests of those who were served by his company--the customers.  On this day today, when the President of the United States signs major, sweeping tax reform and as we approach Christmas--a special holiday for all families--I rise on the floor of the Senate to take note of Jim McCool from the State of Mississippi, employee of the Southern Company, professional advocate, father of three, and husband to a great lady. Jim McCool has gone the long way down the long road, and he has done it with style, with class, and he has delivered every single time.  Washington doesn't have a better advocate working in this town than Jim We are going to miss him, but I am going to get to play a lot more golf with him in the years ahead because he is going to have more free time than he has right now. So I wish Jim and his family the best. I thank him for all he has done for us as  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1304,topic-id,1787,"Mr.President, I am glad to join my colleague Senator Tester from Montana on the floor for a discussion of our Veterans' Affairs, our accomplishments over the last 3 years and our challenges for the future.  I want to start out my part of the conversation by saying this. Three years ago, the Veterans' Administration was making big headlines. Those headlines were that they weren't working well, our veterans were waiting too long for care, there were failures in our system throughout, and people were looking for an alternative to the VA system because it was in such a quagmire. Thanks to the work of our committee, which the Presiding Officer today is one of those members, we set out to fix a lot of the problems. 1 was the hospital in Denver, which is 40 percent finished. It was 3 years behind, and we closed in. That hospital is open today and operating because the Veterans' Affairs Committee of the Senate buckled its shoes, got to work, got the VA fixed, and got the hospital finished.  The most challenging thing we faced were long wait times for appointments for our veterans and veterans' services for healthcare. It was longer than 30 days just for a routine appointment, sometimes being as long as 6 months to wait, and sometimes they were dying before they got called up from the waiting list, which happened in the Arizona case in  We had some tragic stories that came through. Our committee came together and said: We are going to fix this. We are going to put our shoulders to the grindstone, we are going to work out hard, and we are going to make it happen. Like always, fixing anything requires one element, and that is hard work.  This Committee has worked hard--Democrats and Republicans alike. They have been willing to get the new Secretary, Secretary Shulkin, confirmed. To all of his aides--Tom Bowman, who has been a great aide to our committee for a long time, and now is a direct aide to the The committee has asked: What is it we need to do to get it fixed?  We started out this year with 11 bills introduced for the Veterans' Administration improvements in terms of healthcare. Ten of those eleven have passed. There is one left. We are going to have a perfect 11-for-11 year, if we get the votes before the end of this year, we get the CARE bill passed for our veterans, but even if that doesn't make it, we have dealt with long waiting lines for determination of benefits for the Those long waiting lines are beginning to dissipate.  We don't have hospitals being shut down because they can't be finished. We have CBOCs being opened because they are being finished. We don't have near as many cases of horror stories in a VA health facility because the facilities are being run better.  Do we have problems? Sure, we have problems. Anytime you have the second largest agency of the Federal Government--which the VA health system is--you are going to have problems, but we are meeting them head-on. We are not running away from them. We have a Secretary who is really willing to work to make it happen.  I cannot say enough about Secretary He has been fantastic. He has been a great worker. He has given President Trump the message, in terms of what our veterans need, the challenge that we need from the White House to join us, and the White House has substantially done so, to help make a lot of improvements.  Working with our ranking member, we decided we would do a number of things: We would end the long wait times for determination of disability, and we have done that. That is in process. We wanted to see to it that the modern access to healthcare was available to all of our veterans, one way or another. We wanted to make sure we came up with creative ideas by using telemedicine and other techniques to deliver healthcare to our veterans.  Most importantly, we knew the Choice Act we passed 3 years ago, led by Senator McCain--who is in our prayers and thoughts every day. I might add from the floor of the Senate today, we wish him the very best if he is listening. Senator McCain went to work and came up with the first aspect of Choice, which passed 3 years ago. I was on the conference committee. We had this crazy idea that we were going to let veterans choose where they want to go for their healthcare. We set up the system to do that. The system worked pretty well in some cases. Senator Tester will say in rural America it didn't work all that well, in some cases, but it was a good effort of ours to take the private sector in America and make it a force multiplier for the healthcare services delivered to our veterans and expand the access of healthcare to our vets.  Well, now we have before the Senate what we call the Care It is the finishing touches of what was originally in the Choice We are taking the things we learned and repealing what was wrong. We are taking things we learned are right, and we are enhancing them. I hope every Member of the Senate who can hear my voice today will join me sometime in the next few weeks ahead to finish the job and pass the Care Our committee passed it out 14 to 1, with Democrats and Republicans alike, shoulder to shoulder, voting for it. It is the right thing to do for our vets. We are hopefully going to do the same thing on the floor.  The Care Act does a lot of amazing things, but it takes what we have learned in 3 years and applies it to the real world for our veterans. It says a veteran has a choice for his healthcare, public or private, VA or private sector. The veteran and his or her doctor may determine where they want to go. The physician providing the services who is outside the system will cooperate with the VA, so we have good medical records for that veteran, and they will work together to choose doctors who have the quality, the reputation, and the ability to deliver the service, whether they are in the VA or outside the  The veteran comes first in Veterans In the Caring for Our Veterans Act, the veteran comes first, not Members of the Senate, not employees of the The veteran comes first, which is what we need to do.  I hope everyone will join Senator Tester and me in seeing to it, when we get this to the floor--and we are trying every day--that they join us in helping pass the Care  One last thing I want to mention about the Care Act is it also contains the funding necessary to complete the year for the Veterans' Administration in terms of health services. More importantly, it consolidates the stovepipes of funding in the VA so we no longer have this Mickey Mouse game, which we have all experienced for the last 5 or 6 years, where the VA is always running out of money.  The Congress has never cut off the When we had the biggest shutdown 5 or 6 years ago--or potential shutdown for the government that we had, we passed bills that exempted the VA to demonstrate long and hard that we would never leave our veterans in need of healthcare coverage waiting because we couldn't act in the Congress, and that would happen today if that was threatening us.  I want to underline, this is not a matter of anybody threatening anybody. This is a matter of finishing the job for our veterans and seeing to it that the Veterans' Administration has the resources necessary to deliver the services to our veterans.  For those who can hear this plea--and it is a plea--understand I am coming before us today to say three things: One is thank you. Thank you to every Member of the Senate who voted with us to get us where we are today. We have passed 10 of the 11 bills we brought in this year for veterans' healthcare services. Thank you very much.[[Page S8195]]  I say to Senator Tester, as the ranking member, thank you for your cooperation. We have worked together to find a solution to every impasse we confronted throughout the year.  To the Senator from Alaska, who is presiding today and is a member of the committee, thank you for what you did for those veterans in need in our States that have limited access to healthcare, like We need to make sure the Alaskan veteran has the same access and the same benefits they signed up for as one does in Georgia or in any other  Senator Tester from Montana has worked so hard to see to it that rural America has the same type of access. There may not be as many doctors, there may not be as many VA facilities, but we can design a system that gives them the very best access and the very best care for that region where they choose to live.  That is our challenge. Our challenge in the VA is not to say: Well, you should have lived somewhere else. Our challenge is to say we should have concentrated more in the VA to see to it that where you live is the right place to be in terms of veterans' services, and we are going to do that.  Lastly, I thank Secretary He was approved 100 to nothing by the I believe I am right that he is the only Cabinet member who was confirmed by the Senate 100 to nothing. As everybody knows from watching us the last 8 or 9 months, we haven't agreed on much of anything. We haven't had any unanimous consent votes on hardly anything. We did with David Shulkin, and he has delivered, in response to that 100-to-nothing vote, time and time again, working for our veterans, helping to direct problems, helping to work with us together.  I look forward to next year, as we bring a close to the Care Act and pass it, moving forward with those new things we need to pay attention to.  I look forward to working with Senator Tester from Montana and the members of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in our committee.  Remember, we are veterans first. We are Americans first. God bless our veterans.

940,topic-id,221,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Yesterday, my home State and my home district suffered a great tragedy. Amtrak Cascades 501, traveling from Seattle to Portland, Oregon, carrying 80 passengers and seven crewmembers, derailed near Olympia,  Early reports are that at least three passengers have died and nearly 100 people needed hospital care. My heart and prayers go out to all those families as they deal with this tragedy.  Our office stands ready to help any constituents in any way that we can. For up-to-date information, friends and family on Amtrak Cascades 501 can also call 1-800-523-9101.  I also want to thank our first responders for their skill and their courage. This could have been far worse without them.  But as Amtrak, the National Transportation Safety Board, and State and local officials help on the scene, there are still so many questions, like: Why was the train going 50 miles over the speed limit as it rounded the curve? Why was the train not using positive train control technology to slow the train down? How, Mr.Speaker, can we be sure that this never happens again?  Mr.Speaker, I will do everything I can to ensure that the investigation and our affected families have the resources and the support necessary to get the facts in the coming days and months.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgH10233-2.txt,1E+14,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This bill gives more riches to the richest Republican donors, at the expense of middle class families and the poorest. This bill does what the American people already said no to, which is, it dismantles the Affordable Care It throws 13 million Americans off of their healthcare and increases premiums for millions more.  This tax bill eliminates most of the State and local tax deduction and shortchanges so many communities across the Nation, slashing education funding by as much as $152 billion over the next decade.  This tax heist runs up the deficit by $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion and triggers automatic spending cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and services that children and seniors depend on.  This tax scam gives 80 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. That is a war on any idea of opportunity and income equality in this country.

349,topic-id,348,"Mr.Speaker, Yogi Berra once said: ``It is like deja vu all over again.''  So today we are back on the House floor after this big, dramatic celebration of this supposedly historic bill, a Republican tax bill that really is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It is the classic bait and switch. It is a Ponzi scheme. The tax cuts aren't going to be meaningful for working families and everyday Americans, and the jobs will never materialize.  It is a Republican tax bill that is simply designed to benefit millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and the well-off, special interests, corporations, and big donors. It is a shameful abdication of responsibility, a dereliction of duty, and an incredible malicious act of legislative malpractice. It is all based on this phony, fraudulent, and fake theory of trickle-down economics.  Where is there any evidence that trickle-down economics has ever worked for the American people?  Ronald Reagan cut taxes for millionaires in 1981. We didn't get strong economic growth. We got a deficit that exploded.  George Bush cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires in 2001 and 2003. We didn't get strong economic growth. We got the worst economy since the Great  And, in Kansas, when you had this great Republican experiment and you were going to cut taxes for the wealthy and the well-off and for companies, what happened?

You may get a trickle, but you are guaranteed to stay down.  This bill is shameful in your attack on middle class Millions of homes will get a tax increase. You will undermine Medicare and explode the deficit.  Don't ask me. Paul Ryan himself made that point.

273,topic-id,1635,"Mr.President, I also rise to advocate the passage of a clean Dream Act now.  I had a youngster say to me--and I am going to tell the stories of a few of the youngsters--at an event in November, a Dreamer in Northern Virginia: ``You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.'' It is a beautiful line, as we know, from the song ``Imagine'' by John ``You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.''  There are 800,000 Dreamers in this country--more than 800,000. More than 13,000 of the Dreamers live in Virginia, and they are from all corners of the world. I have met with Dreamers in Virginia who were originally born in Sweden, Nigeria, Latin America, many countries in They are a rainbow but also a source of strength for our country, and we need to act on their behalf.  I also stand here in the Christmas spirit. We will all, so many of us, hear the retelling of the Christmas story. In the aftermath of the birth of the poor child in a manger, the story goes that he was taken by his parents to another country essentially as a refugee. There were threats of violence against the firstborn children of the land, and so he was spirited across a border into Egypt to be protected.  I know many of these Dreamers, and I know so many like them. I worked as a missionary in Honduras in 1980 and 1981, and I had the opportunity to work with youngsters in a country that was then and still is beset with violence and poverty and where so many parents have to make an agonizing choice. In some instances, they make the choice to try to find a better land for their children, just as Jesus and Mary did as they fled to Egypt at the Christmas season more than 2,000 years ago.  So I stand here in that moment, in that spirit, knowing that hundreds of thousands of Dreamers need our protection and, frankly, deserve it. Are we less compassionate than those societies of old that have found refuge for those who have come fleeing hardship? I[[Page S8223]]don't believe we are. I know the American public isn't, and I know the Virginia public isn't. The question is, Is Congress as compassionate as we need to be?  We tell the story of some of the Dreamers in Virginia, and I have made many speeches on this floor and told many of their stories.  Juan de la Rosa is a DACA recipient--one of our 13,500. He is a I first came to know Juan when I was the mayor of He arrived at age 5. In a comment to me, he said: In one way or another, you have always been an active part of teaching me how being involved in the political process is the key toward positive change.  He started when he arrived here at 5 years old, and he excelled immediately. He went to Manchester High School in Chesterfield County and graduated in 2014. He was a drum major in the marching band, class representative, and a president of several honor societies.  After graduating at the top of his class at this very competitive suburban high school, he continued at Virginia At Virginia Tech, he started Tech DREAMers, which is a student organization there trying to create a more inclusive environment for the Dreamers on the campus. Through Tech DREAMers, he hosted dialogues around immigration reform and other issues--not just with Hokies but with students all around Virginia and around the country.  This past May, Juan de la Rosa graduated magna cum laude from Virginia Tech, and he continues to be active. He works in the admissions office as a Dreamer, traveling the country and telling students all over this country about the opportunity that was offered by this great university in the He says: ``All of this would not have been possible, had it not been for the opportunities afforded me because of DACA.''  Juan, like so many other undocumented young people, is the very embodiment of the Virginia Tech motto. The motto of Virginia Tech University is ``Ut Prosim,'' Latin for ``That I May Serve.'' That is what Juan is doing. He wants Congress to pass a clean Dream Act now so there is a permanent solution for him and so many others.  Alejandro Zuniga is the internal president of DREAMers Empowered at Northern Virginia Community I sat down with him a few weeks ago at a roundtable I held with these He was from He lived there until he was 7. His parents brought him here. He was not fully aware of what it was to be undocumented until he was ready to go to college, and his parents explained it to him. His favorite thing as a kid growing up in the DC area was to go to the Air and Space Now he is at Northern Virginia Community College making honor grades, studying to be an aerospace engineer.  Monday, I sat down at the Richmond Public Library with a group of Dreamers from the Richmond area. A few stopped by my office on a day I wasn't there and asked for a meeting. We sat down together. Let me tell you about some of them and some of their parents.  Mateo is a Dreamer and sophomore at He went to the same high school my daughter went to. My daughter Annella graduated from the Governor's School in Petersburg in 2013. Mateo was a freshman, and he graduated in 2016. He is part of a group called UndocuRams, a student organization whose mission is to foster inclusion for Dreamers on the VCU campus.  Mateo's mom came with him to the meeting to show her support for her son. She is heartbroken seeing him work so hard and so afraid of what might happen to him and so afraid of what might happen to her. She prays that this system may find a just result for her child and for herself.  Finally, at the same meeting, I had Bertha is both a Dreamer and a mom. She is a young mother. Her parents brought her here in 1998 from Mexico as a young child. She is an exceptional member of her community. She works in a local Catholic Church, volunteers with the PTA at her children's school, and coaches her children's and other children's soccer teams. Bertha told me she has learned the values of volunteering and helping others from being here in the United This is an interesting one. I hadn't heard this before. Bertha told me that where she came from in Mexico, there wasn't a great tradition of volunteer organizations. There was sort of the government, and there were churches. She said, coming to the United States, she has become aware of a whole sector of society that was not familiar to her: volunteer organizations--groups of people who get together to try to tutor other kids to be Big Brothers or Big  She said what she has learned from the United States, more than anything else, is this amazing power of volunteerism and the network of social service groups that are run by volunteers. She said: I want to be just like that--and that is what she is doing.  Why would we want to lose a mother, a Dreamer like Bertha from our community? She has explained, as so many have--folks here on the Hill engaged in rallies have explained with tears in their eyes the fear they feel. They had a President, who, though he said some tough things about immigrants during the campaign, he always said about Dreamers: Dreamers will have nothing to worry about in me. These Dreamers are good kids. They were taken by complete surprise when, in September, the President announced he would terminate the DACA Program in 6 months. From that moment, it has been unremitting fear for these young people and for their families.  The only thing in the President's announcement that I think we could probably all agree to is--even though I was a strong supporter of President Obama's Executive action; firmly believed it was within his legal power--a statutory fix is better than an Executive action because an Executive action depends upon the temperament of the particular President; whereas, a statutory fix provides people with some permanence, some confidence, and some security, and that is what we are called to do.  Again, in the spirit of the Christmas season--and because I am seeing this particular Presiding Officer--I am reminded of a beautiful phrase of Pope Francis whom the Presiding Officer and I have talked about before. In a letter he issued on Ash Wednesday in 2015, he called on us to be ``islas de misericordia en el medio de un mar de indiferencia''--islands of mercy in the middle of a sea of indifference. That is a powerful phrase. Let's be islands of mercy in the middle of a sea of indifference. It was interesting. He didn't say: In the middle of a sea of hatred, in the middle of a sea of prejudice. He could have said all of those things. What he said was: ``in a sea of indifference.''  Surely, as we hear of the virtues and the dreams, the achievements and the accomplishments of these beautiful young people, we can call on our inner spirit to be merciful, rather than indifferent. That is my hope; that this body will do that by passing a clean Dream Act and accepting with open arms the wonderful gifts these young people bring to our communities.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1310,topic-id,1840,"Mr.President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from  I rise to talk about the tax debate that the Senate is currently having. I wish to highlight some of the reasons why I think this bill is bad and, frankly, focus on the missed opportunity that we are about to embark on when we could have found a much better project.  Let me tell you a story from when I was mayor. I was mayor of I know my colleague from Oklahoma was mayor as well. I had a city council colleague who introduced a seemingly benign bill. It was a bill to limit the number of dogs and cats that anybody could have at their residence.  Now, pursuant to the city rules, we had to post this resolution in the newspaper for a couple of weeks so that citizens could read it, and we had a public hearing where any citizen who wanted to speak for or against the resolution had the opportunity to do so. Then, the city council members debated, and then we had a vote. It turned out to be a little more controversial than the council member originally contemplated.  When I was mayor, the minor little debate in the Richmond City Council about the number of pets you could have at your residence received more openness and transparency and discussion and debate than the vote that we[[Page S8084]]will have within a few hours or days about the entire Tax Code of the United  Instead of doing a bill openly and deliberately, with a lot of public input, and ultimately reaching for a bipartisan result, we have moved hastily, in secret, and in a partisan way. In my view, that is the reason why the end product is going to be so discouraging.  We had a vote in the Budget Committee to move this tax bill forward. It was interesting. We actually voted before we discussed it. The bill was on everybody's desk. The chair decided that we would vote, and only later would we talk about it. That would never have been done at a Richmond City Council meeting.  We had a full audience of citizens who wanted to be heard, and they were not given an opportunity. That would not be done at a Richmond City Council meeting. Some of the citizens started to sort of protest and get angry, get mad, and shout. When that happens in a committee meeting, I cringe because it is a violation of the decorum I expect. But what choice do they have? This is only a tax reform that affects the entire American economy, every American family, and every American business, and they feel shut out of the process.  The first version of this bill that was live was released to the public in the Senate on Thursday, November 9. The current version, which is the fifth version of the bill, was only released last Friday night, 4 days ago. So this bill to completely rework the U.economy moves from introduction to passage over just 41 days with multiple versions, often with handwriting in them and handed out at the last minute before votes.  The last time this body did comprehensive tax reform in 1986, the Senate had 36 days of public hearings over 10 months. This plan has had zero--zero public hearings. When the Finance Committee refuses to allow a hearing, when the Budget Committee forces a vote before the members even have a chance to express their opinions, is this really what the Senate wants to be known for? The stakes couldn't be higher.  I think in the end it is highly unlikely, but I still hope at the end we might decide to do this the right way and not the wrong way, because when you approach the process the wrong way--quickly, secretively, in a partisan way, without public input or hearings--you get a bad bill. This bill, in my view, is a bad bill.  The benefits in this bill overwhelmingly accrue to folks who are at the top end, who frankly don't need your help. Eighty-three percent of the tax plan's benefits go to the top 1 percent earners in this country because of giveaways like increasing the estate tax threshold and altering the alternative minimum tax.  If you make over $1 million, you will get a collective tax cut of $36.9 billion just in 2019. Those who make over $1 million will see their taxes go down by that much.  Massive tax cuts go to foreign individuals who own stock in American companies. Just in the first year, about $48 billion go to foreign individuals because of their ownership of stock in American companies. To the contrary, millions of middle-class people are hurt.  By 2027, on average, every income group below $75,000 will face a tax increase, and 92 million households--the combined population of probably 20 States--earning under $200,000 will face net tax increases in this bill. That is over half of all households in the country.  The working poor get hurt especially. The working poor who have the most to lose and the least margin will get hurt. By 2025, this bill would reduce the after-tax incomes of households with incomes below $40,000, while it would boost the after-tax incomes of households with incomes over $1 million.  I want to assume in charity that the hurting of the working poor and the helping of folks at the top is a result of haste rather than design. We could take the time and get this right.  These analyses that I just indicated are done by the nonpartisan CBO, whose director is from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, which is widely known as a very conservative economics department, and also by the Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Tax Policy All of the analyses come to virtually the same conclusion: The bill dramatically increases the deficit to the tune of $1.4 trillion over of the next 10 years. It will lead to millions of people falling into the ranks of the uninsured. The CBO says 13 million.  For my own Commonwealth, there are a number of provisions that are particularly harmful. We are one of the top five recipients, or claimants, of the deductibility for State and local income taxation. Virginians are going to be hurt because of the reduction of the historic tax credit.  Why couldn't we work together? Why couldn't we work together to try to do something that would be right, as President Reagan and Congress did in 1986?  Now, 16 Democrats and 1 Independent stood up a few weeks ago, and we said: We are ready to work with Republicans on tax reform. You have former Governors who have done bipartisan tax reform. You have former tax commissioners who have worked on tax issues. We said: We are ready to work with you to make this better.  Every one of us in that group has worked on bipartisan tax reform. I have done it as a mayor, and I have done it as a I know how to do it, and I have ideas, but nobody was interested in a single one.  The late Friday night that we voted here, I put an amendment on the table to show my Republican colleagues our good faith and saying: We will work with you. I stood up, and, of course, I was only given a minute to make an amendment. The process said that even though it is the entire American economy, you only get 1 minute. I stood up, and I said: I can't fix the bill in 1 minute, but I can do a couple of things. I can reduce the deficit impact by $1 trillion, and I can make every middle-class tax cut that is temporary in this bill permanent. I can do those two things--permanent middle-class tax cut and reducing the deficit by $1 trillion--if you will agree with me to do the following: Don't touch the AMT or top individual rates and reduce the corporate tax rate, not to 20 percent but to 25 percent--from 35 to 25.  Thirty-four Democrats voted for tax reform for the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25, making middle-class tax cuts permanent, and reducing the deficit by $1 trillion, but not a single Republican--not a single one--would vote to make the middle-class tax cuts permanent and reduce the deficit. We still want to work on it. We could still make it better.  As I conclude, I will just note, again, that it was notable that when President Reagan did tax reform as President in 1986, this didn't get 50 votes or 50 votes plus a tie-breaker--51 votes. In this body, the greatest deliberative body in the world, the Reagan-era tax reform got 97 votes because they took the time to have the hearings and hear from the public, and they took the time to incorporate great ideas no matter the party of those who offered it.  President Reagan said, as he was embarking on that: ``It should not be a partisan debate, for the authors of tax reform come from both parties, and all of us want greater fairness, incentives, and simplicity in taxation.'' He was right then, and that remains true, and yet this is a process that is not incorporated--either the thoughts of the public or the thoughts of the Democratic minority.  I will say this, as I close. The GOP is not measured by who it says its hero is. Most of my GOP friends have posters of President Reagan or pictures of President They talk about him as a personal hero, but you really are not measured by who you say your hero is. You are measured by whom you act like. This is not a President Reagan-era tax reform. This is not the way President Reagan would have done tax reform.  This is a President Trump bill. A last-minute change in this bill--a very important last-minute change that only came in at the very end--would directly benefit President Trump and his family by further exploiting a loophole to give real estate developers more money. This was on top of giving him relief on the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. At the last minute, there was one last change made that was specifically designed to help President Trump make even more. No, this is not a Reagan-era tax reform[[Page S8085]]bill. This is purely a product of President  It follows what he does: Say one thing and do another. Claim to help the middle class but actually hurt them. Say it is not going to help me or wealthy people when it actually does. I am not surprised by the President, but I am surprised at many of my colleagues here because we could have worked on something and not have missed an opportunity that would have been far better for the American economy. It is still my hope that we will.  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I am proud to rise in favor of 1532, the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads This bipartisan, bicameral bill strengthens our Nation's efforts to combat human trafficking.  As a former organized crime prosecutor for two decades both on the Northern border and on the Southern border, I have seen firsthand the horrors of human trafficking. Too often, human traffickers take advantage of our Nation's transportation network to transport their victims from one location to the next.  The U.Department of Transportation and the transportation industry play a critical role in preventing and stopping these heinous exploitations. I want to commend the trucking industry for their commitment in training drivers to identify instances of human trafficking through organizations like Truckers Against  Truck drivers are often a critical asset in helping law enforcement identify victims who otherwise might go unseen. However, an isolated few individuals have taken advantage of their position to illegally traffic innocent people. We must stop this from occurring.  Earlier this year, alongside my good friend, Congresswoman Esty, I introduced H.3814, the identical House companion to this bill. While the vast majority of our Nation's truck drivers are hardworking, honest men and women, our bill is necessary to ensure that the select few who commit these crimes are brought to justice.

97,topic-id,199,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, I guess for the second day in a row, this House voted for massive tax cuts for people at the very top and left behind a lot of working In fact, it gave permanent tax cuts to corporations and only temporary help for some American families. They said that the marketplace and corporations needed certainty. That is why those tax cuts were permanent.  Now, we have a continuing resolution for 28 days of funding after 11 months of not doing anything about it.  What about the certainty for veterans that they are going to get the healthcare that they deserve?  It is not a priority.  What about the certainty for children who depend on CHIP?  It is not a priority.  What about the certainty for those families who are struggling with a family member fighting opioid abuse?  All the promises ring hollow because they are not a priority. Corporations are the top priority. With this tax bill, and now the continuing resolution, the American people, who struggle every single day, are just not a priority. After 11 months of complete Republican control and false promises, American families get left behind again.

678,topic-id,224,"Mr.Speaker, yesterday, on the floor of this House and, I guess, again today, there will be a vote on this massive tax cut targeted to people at the very top, targeting big cuts for corporations.  Like many Members on this side of the aisle, I welcome the opportunity to do comprehensive, real tax reform. And for a long time, the discussion in this body and around the country was about the need to lower the rates and broaden the base and eliminate some of those loopholes that allow some corporations to get away with paying literally no taxes at all. But instead of doing that, what we saw was a massive shift of the responsibility to fund the government away from people at the top to people who work hard every day.  There are many examples of how we could have done this better. There was a lot of discussion on the Senate side about the child tax credit. But why did we end up with a child tax credit that rewards a minimum wage family with about $75 a year, when somebody making $400,000 would get $4,000? I mean, is the life of a child of a family making a half a million dollars worth that much more?  This is the wrong direction. This is the wrong bill.

And lavishing huge tax breaks to multinational corporations and to the most wealthy amongst us is not a good reason.

On December 3, 2017, John Anderson passed away at the age of 95. In mourning his death, I send my condolences to his wife, Keke, and the entire Anderson family.  A native of Rockford, Illinois, John Anderson attended Rockford Central High School and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1939. Before representing Illinois' 16th District in the House of Representatives, the district that I now proudly represent, John Anderson answered the call to serve as a staff sergeant in the United States  He left law school in 1943 to enlist, and bravely served his country through the end of World War A decorated war veteran, John Anderson was honored with four battle stars for valor in combat.  Upon returning home to Rockford, John finished his law degree at the University of Illinois, and then went to Harvard to earn his master of laws degree. A few years later, he joined the Foreign Service and worked in Germany for the United States High  After returning home to Rockford, he was elected as Winnebago County State's Attorney in 1956. Shortly after, he joined the primary race for Congress and went on to win the House seat in 1960.  For 10 terms, John Anderson represented the 16th Congressional District of He was on the powerful Rules Committee and held firm to his fiscally conservative values. He believed in a smaller and more accountable government, and he wasn't afraid to speak up for it.  His servant leadership and love of country earned him the chairmanship of the House Republican Conference, ranking third in House leadership. This esteemed position eventually led to his run for  John Anderson believed that his job was worth giving up in order to set a better example of realism in politics.

To this day, John's pragmatic approach and self-awareness continue to inspire many and greatly impact my service here in  Mr.Speaker, John Anderson dedicated his life to serving our Rockford community and this great Nation, and he served us proudly. After his political career, he continued to serve by becoming a visiting professor at several universities across the country.  On behalf of the 16th Congressional District of Illinois, we salute the service of our fallen leader, friend, neighbor, and dedicated civil servant. It is my hope that his legacy will continue to inspire generations to come and that his impact will never be forgotten.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgH10249-4.txt,2014,INTERDICT ACT,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,topic-id,665,"Madam President, you heard in Senator Franken's closing words the passion he has for all of the work that he has done in this Chamber and for the people of our You saw the love that he has for his family--for Franni--and the love that he has for his staff. They are not good staff; they are wonderful staff.  I think about all of the legacies that Al will leave. One of them is his staff, to whom he has been so devoted. Another is all of the work he has done for veterans, the work he has done for healthcare with the medical loss ratio--one of the major achievements in the Affordable Care One is the work he has done, way ahead of his time, for the LGBTQ community, and another is the work he has done for our Tribal communities. That was his 1 ask when he arrived in the Senate--to be on the Indian Affairs That is not what other people ask for. He did that. Another is the work he did on bullying in schools. For the kids who had no voice, he gave them a voice. Another is the work he did in carrying on Paul Wellstone's work for those with mental illness.  When I think about what I will miss about Al, I will miss, first of all, how he defied expectations when he got elected. I think about all of those headlines that he mentions in his book. No matter what he did in the first few years he was in office, they would read with things like: Al Franken passes a bill. That's no joke. Al Franken gets reelected. That's no joke. Yet he still carried on and defied expectations every single day that he was here.  Another thing I will miss is all of the Senators approaching him in his first few weeks in office with their bad jokes, which he would smile at, and then he would later tell me they were not good jokes.  Another thing I will always miss about Al is the passion he had for his work. I think many people were captivated by the pointed questioning of witnesses and nominees in the last year, but it was that kind of focus that he took to all of his work when he would examine policies he thought were good or bad. He never gave up on that.[[Page S8200]]  The other thing I will greatly miss is sitting next to Al in the Judiciary While he would do the serious work, he would never miss an opportunity to show me or Senator Durbin or Senator Whitehouse or anyone near him the latest pictures of his grandchildren and his family or, maybe, the doodles that he did of Senator  The other thing I will miss greatly is the way he would talk about Paul Today, he managed to do it without crying, but so many times, whenever he would talk about Paul, he would start to cry. He would do it in private, and he would do it in public because he understood the legacy that Paul left behind and the burden that we all have to carry it on.  One thing I know, as you heard in his last speech, is that when Al leaves here, he will not be quieted in any way. His work will live on, and his voice will be stronger than ever. I think the last call of action that he left us with of the war for truth--for truth in what we do and for truth in our politics--is something that no one should forget in this It is one way that Al's work will live on because I know he will keep calling people on the truth.  While I will no longer be sitting next to him in Judiciary, I know we will stay friends forever. I thank Senator Franken so much for his work.  I yield the floor.

275,topic-id,671,"Mr.President, I rise, once again today, to express my strong support for taking action on the Dream I thank all the Dreamers who, in recent weeks, traveled from all across the country to Washington to make their voices heard.  Last month, I met with 50 Minnesotans, who traveled here by bus to show their support for the Dream They took time away from their jobs, from their education, and from their families because this issue is so critical to them and to their loved ones.  I want to get this bill passed, and while I remain hopeful we will reach an agreement soon, I know this has real consequences with each and every day, as over 100 Dreamers lose their status per day.  We have already seen the harmful effects of the administration's decision to end DACA, and the situation will continue to get worse until we take action. For the eligible DACA recipients with statuses set to expire over the upcoming weeks, the uncertainty is unbelievably difficult.[[Page S8224]]  These are people who were told previously by our government that they could stay. They registered with our government, and now, with each and every day, more and more of them are losing their status. Just since I spoke about this issue on the Senate floor last week, an estimated 800 additional Dreamers have lost their DACA status. In March, the number of Dreamers with expiring protections will increase to 1,000 a day if we have not found a solution by that time.  This is an issue where we should be able to find bipartisan consensus. Americans want us to protect In fact, one recent poll found that 86 percent of Americans support action to allow Dreamers to stay in the United The Dream Act, which my colleague Senator Durbin has led in the Senate for 16 years now, is based on a simple principle: Dreamers who are brought to the United States as children, and only know this country as their home, should be given the opportunity to contribute to our Nation and become citizens.  These young people were brought here through no fault of their own. On average, when they came over, they were only about 6\1/2\ years old. Imagine being told that you have to go back to a country you have not stepped foot in since you were 6, where you may not know anyone or even speak the language.  To receive DACA status, all Dreamers have already passed background checks, paid fees, and met educational requirements. They already did this so they could stay in the United States and contribute to our communities across the country.  Dreamers are already contributing. More than 97 percent of these Dreamers, of the DACA recipients, are now in school or in the workforce. In fact, 72 percent of them currently in school are pursuing a bachelor's degree or higher. The American Medical Association has urged us to take action on this issue, noting our current shortage of physicians in the United States--something the Presiding Officer is aware of--and estimating that passing the Dream Act could add 5,400 physicians to the U.healthcare system in the coming decades. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, more than 100 students with DACA status applied to medical school last year, and about 70 Dreamers are currently enrolled in medical school.  In Minnesota, our large refugee and immigrant community has contributed so much to the cultural and economic vitality of our We are proud to have big communities of Somali, Liberian, and Oromo populations, as well as the second largest Hmong population. In fact, we have the biggest population of Somalis in the country, the biggest population of Liberians, the biggest population of Oromos, and we are also proud to be the home of more than 6,000  Ending DACA in my State, where the unemployment rate is hovering in the 3-percent range, would cost Minnesota more than $376 million in annual revenue, let alone the immeasurable impact to families who may be ripped apart.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8217.txt,1826,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
524,topic-id,511,"Mr.President, today we are voting on the motion to adopt the conference report on H.1, the Tax Reconciliation I will be voting against adoption of the conference report.  I have long called for tax reform. We should bring down the business income tax rate. We should bring back the money being held overseas to fund the infrastructure improvements we need across the country. We should simplify the code and help middle-class Americans pay their bills.  But I have been disappointed by the most recent effort, which has not been bipartisan at all and has resulted in a bill that will add to the debt, create huge new loopholes that will encourage companies to move money around and move jobs overseas to avoid taxes, and will have huge unintended consequences for our economy.  One of the most troubling developments of this bill was the inclusion of a provision to repeal a key part of the Affordable Care Act that would kick 13 million people off their insurance by 2027 and increase premiums by 10 percent in the individual market. That means less money in the pockets of American middle-class families. The American people want us to work together to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act, not move backwards with a partisan approach to healthcare added into a tax bill.  This bill also hurts middle-class families by doing a bait and switch. Under the bill, millions of middle-class Americans would end up paying more in taxes in the long run. Many of the tax cuts they receive, if they receive a tax cut at all, would only be temporary.  This bill would allow a one-time opportunity to bring back some of the trillions of dollars of earnings held overseas by U.companies. I have long supported this, but I also would like to see at least part of any of the billions in taxes raised by this provision to be used to fund infrastructure.  The American Society of Civil Engineers' 2017 report card gave our Nation's infrastructure an overall D-plus grade. There is an economic imperative to fixing our infrastructure: Businesses rely on our transportation network to move goods to market. If our deteriorating infrastructure goes unaddressed, it will cost our economy nearly $4 trillion by 2025, leading to the loss of 2.5 million jobs. That is a crisis that we have an opportunity to address through a tax bill, but we aren't. It is a missed opportunity.  If done right, we can close loopholes, bring back money U.companies are holding overseas to fund infrastructure projects here at home, give local businesses the ability to compete against out-of-State Internet retailers, support our rural communities, and provide incentives to keep jobs in  I have always said we could bring down the corporate tax rate, but not by adding $1.5 trillion to the debt.

799,topic-id,1685,"Mr.President, early this morning, the Senate voted on the tax bill. I voted against the measure, and as I have said many times, I don't think this is a bill that is going to work for my State or for The House now has one more opportunity. I don't think many people think they are going to change their vote, but I just hope, instead of celebrating what happens today, they are going to step back and look at what this really means.  I am in a group of people who have long called for tax reform. In fact, 2 weeks before this bill passed, we stood before the public and said we would like to work with the Republicans on a bill to bring the business rate down and to bring the money in from overseas but a bill that didn't add this kind of weight to the debt and a bill that actually was good for all Americans, not just some  We also could have done so much more. We are adding $1.5 trillion to the debt. Yet we are doing nothing for infrastructure. We didn't change the carried interest loophole. We did nothing to fix so many things that even the President had identified as things that needed to be fixed in the Tax  I have been concerned by this latest effort, which has not been bipartisan at[[Page S8156]]all. It has resulted in a bill that will, as I said, add to the debt, create huge, new loopholes, and will encourage companies to move money around and move jobs overseas to avoid taxes. It will have huge, unintended consequences on the economy. Why? We didn't even have a hearing over this bill, a bill that will affect every single  Over the next 10 years--and this is not disputed--this bill will add $1.5 trillion to our national debt, and even the most generous estimate says it may add $500 billion in economic gain. If that is true, this bill would still be adding $1 trillion to the debt. By the way, it is not the wealthiest Americans who are going to have to worry about that debt; it is the kids of middle-class Americans, of people who go to work every single day. What do they go to work to do now? To have a big chunk of their money that is going to pay for the interest on this debt. Almost all economists agree that a deficit-financed tax cut at this point in the business cycle makes no sense at all. If anything, at this time of low unemployment and strong market performance, it gives us a rare opportunity to try to, one, do something about our debt and, two, while we are doing something about our debt, figure out what our priorities are for investment. I would say one of those top priorities is infrastructure, including broadband, including rural broadband. That wasn't in this bill. We accumulated $1.5 trillion in debt.  Adding to the debt will, of course, put pressure on programs that everyday Americans rely on. This means Social Security, Medicare, and One of the most troubling developments in this bill was the inclusion of a provision to repeal a key part of the Affordable Care Act that would kick 13 million people off their insurance by 2027 and increase premiums by 10 percent in the individual market, and that means less money in the pockets of American middle-class families. The American people want us to move forward together to make fixes to the Affordable Care Act like the Murray-Alexander bill, but instead this bill moves us backward with a partisan approach that kicks people off their healthcare.  This bill, in the end, is really a bait and switch. Millions of middle-class Americans will end up paying more in taxes in the long run since many of the tax cuts they receive, if they receive a tax cut at all, would only be temporary. In 10 years, most Americans earning $75,000 or less will pay more in taxes while people earning more than $100,000 a year will continue to pay less. According to the analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 644,000 people in my State with incomes below $153,800 would see a tax hike in 2027. Meanwhile, a huge majority of the tax cuts in 2027 and after will benefit only the top 1 percent of  The bill creates a new and complicated system of taxing the income of companies, especially with regard to their international income. The practical effect of this systemic change is entirely untested. While the bill seeks to impose a minimum tax on overseas earnings, it allows companies to blend the tax rate for income overseas. This seemingly minor detail opens a big loophole that can give companies incentives to move jobs to foreign countries and may create a whole new tax avoidance scheme. While I heard celebration in this Chamber last night, I can tell you who are really celebrating--the tax accountants, the lawyers, as people are going to pay them millions and millions of dollars to look for new loopholes in a scheme that, again, didn't even get a hearing. I support bringing down the rate on foreign earnings held overseas and to make sure the money, though, is invested here and invested in infrastructure.  Bob Pozen, the former chairman of the oldest mutual fund company in the United States, has said the new system in this bill, which includes a new minimum U.``tax is like Swiss cheese. It has so many holes that it would rarely be paid by U.firms.'' He goes on to say that, in fact, this proposal would encourage U.companies to ``relocate to foreign countries more of their U.factories and U.intellectual property such as patents and trademarks. A minimum tax would be effective only if it applied to the foreign taxes paid by U.multinationals on a country by country basis, rather than on an aggregate basis across all foreign countries.''  Again, we haven't had one hearing to understand the impact of this bill.  This bill would allow a one-time opportunity to bring back some of the trillions of dollars of earnings overseas. Again, I have long supported this, but I would also like to see at least part of this money be used on infrastructure. That was our original plan. Our original plan was that we were going to create incentives to bring the money in from overseas--a bipartisan plan--and then put a chunk of it, if the money was voluntarily brought back, into infrastructure.  Why? Well, the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2017 report card gave our Nation's infrastructure an overall D-plus grade. There is an economic imperative to fixing our infrastructure. The future of our markets is exporting to the 90 percent of those who live outside of our shores. Yet this bill, with the accumulation of $1.5 trillion in debt, doesn't put the money into the infrastructure that will allow us to have that kind of an export economy.  True comprehensive tax reform requires closing loopholes, yet this bill does almost nothing to close the worst loopholes in our current Tax The carried interest loophole, which President Trump promised over and over again that he would close, is still there. The loopholes that benefit big oil are still there. The Buffet rule that would make sure the wealthiest Americans pay the same tax as their employees is nowhere to be found. I have already mentioned the new opportunities for tax avoidance created by the new system of international taxation. That is just one of them.  This bill contains vast new loopholes for hedge fund managers, real estate investment companies, and anyone who can take a few minutes to reorganize as a passthrough business to take advantage of a lower rate, if they have the money to pay for a lawyer or pay for an accountant to do it. By taxing wage and salary income at a higher rate than so-called passthrough income, this bill creates opportunities for tax avoidance that are virtually unprecedented.  Given the speed with which this bill was rushed through, enterprising attorneys and accountants are going to find dozens of new loopholes in the coming years. If done right, we could have closed loopholes. We could have brought back money U.companies are holding overseas to fund infrastructure projects here at home.  We could have given local businesses the ability to compete against out-of-State internet retailers, support our rural communities, and provide incentives to keep jobs in  I have always wanted to bring the corporate tax rate down--I have so many successful businesses in my State--but not like this, not with adding $1.5 trillion in debt that is going to be put on the people whom I represent in my State, who just go to work every day. They don't have holdings overseas. They don't have a hedge fund manager. They don't have people who are investing money in all kinds of ventures all over the world. They just go to work and get an hourly wage or maybe they get a salary, and they just get enough money so that they hope they can have a house and send their kids to college. This bill doesn't make it easier on them.  It does not simplify the Tax If anything, it makes it more complicated. It does not close loopholes. It is a huge missed opportunity.  A few weeks ago, I joined 17 of my Democratic colleagues in calling on our Republican colleagues to join us in a bipartisan approach to tax reform. Unfortunately, the bill that we voted on early this morning--and the bill that the House still has an opportunity to look at once more--involved negotiations only on one side of the aisle. When that happens, bad things happen.  We can do better. I will continue to work across the aisle on bipartisan solutions. We have to make changes to this bill going forward. We know that, and the American people will depend on it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1088,topic-id,647,"Mr.President, last week on the Senate floor, I talked about how I have always tried to find examples of Dreamers so that the citizens in my State can understand what we are talking about when we talk about the fact that someone could be brought over to our country and not even realize it and have this Dreamer status.  I talked about Joseph He was a decorated Army veteran. He served in World War He lived in I am sad to say that he passed away last July at the ripe old age of 103 years old. There was a story about Joe in today's edition of our largest newspaper in Minnesota, honoring his contributions to our Nation during World War II and through his nearly a century as a proud and hard-working  Joe lost both of his parents before he was 1 year old. He was brought to the United States from Mexico by his aunt when he was just 5, and he didn't find out that he was undocumented during his whole time growing up. When did he find out? When he tried to join the Army in World War  So what he did then, because he wasn't a citizen--back then, it was pretty simple; what they would do is have people go to Canada, especially if they lived in Minnesota, and that is how they would become citizens. So they sent Joe Medina to Canada for 1 day. I remember his telling me this story--that this is what they did during World War II when they wanted people to sign up and serve. He stayed in a hotel for 1 night, and he came back, and with the help of our military, he became a citizen.  He then served under General MacArthur in the Then he came home, got married, had a son, and that son served in the Vietnam war.  Joe came to Washington, DC, with his son for the first and last time to see the World War II Memorial at age 99. I stood there by his side as he looked at the Minnesota part of that Memorial and thought of the people he knew who were no longer with us and thought of his service and how much he loved serving our country in World War  At his side, along with his own son who had served in Vietnam, were two Dreamers--two high school students who were in high school in the suburban part of the Twin Cities, and they also wanted to join the military. If I remember right, they wanted to join the Air Do you know what? The way the rules were a few years ago, they weren't allowed to do that. Joseph Medina couldn't understand that because the proudest part of his life was serving in our military, serving despite the fact that he was born in another country but lived almost his entire life--98 years of his 103 years--in  So I join with all those in my State in remembering Joseph Medina and honoring his service to our country as we continue to work toward finding a solution for the Dreamers in the  I note that we should also take action here at the end of the year, and we should be staying to get a number of priorities done, including a long-term reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, dealing with the medical device tax, renewing funding for community health centers. There are so many things we need to do.

1040,topic-id,276,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, today we are debating the final version of the Republican tax bill, which I cannot support.  This bill was flawed from the start. First of all, it was never deficit neutral and there was never a bipartisan negotiation. This is a Republican-only bill, and it was developed without any input at all from Democrats because they never sought our input at all.  My Republican colleagues say they would like to jump-start the economy. Well, we can do just that by providing more tax cuts to working class families whose paychecks are already stretched far too thin and who would reinvest that money in the local economy.  Instead, this bill provides them with crumbs, and temporary crumbs at that.  Under this plan, corporate cuts, though, will be permanent. With this bill, we will see an entirely different, more expensive, individual Tax Code in 2025, when the middle class tax cuts expire.  This bill also balloons the national debt, make no mistake about it. It repeals a critical healthcare provision that will result in 13 million Americans becoming uninsured.  Now, these days, I hear a lot about accountability and encouraging competitiveness for the American worker, which I support. But this bill, with its novel loopholes and flawed trickle-down philosophy, does neither. It is a wasted opportunity.  I believe that it is not too late, but the way this bill is written, I cannot support it. This was written for corporations and the wealthy 1 percent in this country.

304,topic-id,2017,"Mr.President, maybe my colleagues have heard through public and private conversations over the past year that I believe the Senate is moving gridlock from here on Capitol Hill to all across the city and across the The reason for that is how we do nominations and the length of time on nominations. It is time for the Senate to fix the Senate's rules.  Here is how it works. As this body knows extremely well, we have over 1,000 nominees who come from the In the first year of a new Presidency, a vast amount of time is spent in getting those 1,000 people through the nomination process. Each one of those is selected by the White They do their own vetting, and then they send them over to the  The Senate has the constitutional responsibility for advice and consent. When they come through the Senate, they will go through background checks, evaluations, and conversations with staff on both sides of the aisle.  They then come to the committee, go through a committee process and a hearing, they are voted on in that time period, and then they move to the floor.  When they move to the floor for debate, typically, for most of the years of the Senate, they have already gone through the committee process. Every Member of the Senate has the opportunity to be able to take a look at their information. And then they move through with a simple-majority vote. That is the way nominations have moved for most of the history of the  A few years ago--20 or so--some individual Senators started asking for cloture votes. Those cloture votes started to slow down the process on about 3 or 4 nominations a year; then it became 9 or so nominations a year; then it moved to as crazy of a number as 13 or so a year, of the 1,000 or so moving through.  That became such a nuisance that in 2013, my Democratic colleagues called for something they called the nuclear option, to say we will just take nominations not from 60 required to be able to get to cloture but just to 51. There was debate and internal conversation about that because Republicans, quite frankly, were holding up 15 or so nominations a year with the cloture process. So there was a big debate about that.  In the beginning of President Obama's second term, Republicans and Democrats came together and they changed the rules of the Senate for 2 years and said: OK, truce. The simple rule of the Senate was for any cloture vote, if there was one called for--again, typically, you would never call for one, but if there was one called for, there would be 2 hours of debate for a district court judge, 8 hours of debate for most nominees, and 30 hours of debate for Supreme Court, circuit court, or a Cabinet-level appointment. But even Harry Reid, when he stood on the floor, said this would be only--his words--``extraordinary circumstances'' if you should ask for a cloture vote at all. But if they were asked for, it would be 2 hours, 8 hours, or 30 hours. Prior to that, all nominations were 30 hours of debate, literally taking up an entire day to move one person, knowing that you have to move 1,000.  A few months after that, still in 2013, Democrats still frustrated that Republicans were calling for some cloture votes still, moved to have the nuclear option entirely and just transition all nominations, except for the Supreme Court, to just 51 votes. So now they had the rule of expediting 2 hours, 8 hours, and 30 hours, and the new ability to move them all with just 51 votes.  Quite frankly, if you are going to change the rule to 51 votes, you probably need to change the cloture rule as well. They just did it in reverse. They changed the rule for how many hours it would take and then later changed the rule for how many people it takes to go through the process.[[Page S8216]]  Now what has happened? Remember I argued that we had 13, 14, 15 people held up in cloture in a year? This year, so far, there have been 64 nominations held up in cloture votes. That is 64 days in the Senate we could do nothing else but sit here waiting. Now, it wasn't for debate. It may sound as if it is being held for 30 hours of debate for that time period. Debate normally didn't happen. Most of the time, this Chamber was empty. It was just that 30 hours was demanded to shut down the body as a whole, 64 of those in this year.  What has it brought us? It has brought us more animosity, more division, and more frustration. My Democratic colleagues a few years ago were screaming that we should have the nuclear option because Republicans were so irrational with 15 cloture votes. Yet we have watched 64 occur this year.  Earlier this week, I sat down with the Rules Committee and brought a very simple option to everyone, Democrats and Republicans alike, and we had a great turnout to be able to just talk through the process. My simple presentation was, let's take the rule that was agreed to in 2013, that Harry Reid and the Democrats brought at the beginning of the second term of President Obama, and let's have the rule for each nomination be 2 hours, 8 hours, and 30 hours. Let's move back to the tradition that Harry Reid had, which is to say let's make cloture votes only extraordinary on a nomination, if needed at all, but if they are, 2 hours, 8 hours, or 30 hours. To do the exact same thing now is what was agreed on in 2013 and 2014.  By the way, Republicans joined with Democrats during that time period and passed that new rule, which would put us at disadvantage with 78 votes.  I don't think it is too much to ask to say that if we are going to get the Senate back to work again, then let's actually get back to work again. Let's put us in a process that actually gets there.  What happens in the meantime when that does not occur? I will tell you what happens. In the meantime, we have agencies all over this town that can't answer a question because the bureaucrats are waiting on a Senate-confirmed individual to be able to lead that agency--to be the Secretary, Under Secretary, Deputy Secretary, whatever the task may be, the counsel for that particular agency--so they sit and wait. So our constituents who are trying to get a permit in certain places or trying to get an answer or trying to get disaster relief--all they can say in the office is, we can't do that until we get a Senate-confirmed position in place. But we can't get Senate-confirmed positions in place until my Democratic colleagues will actually allow individuals to actually come up and be debated.  What else happens? The other thing that happens is, we can't do legislation in this body; we can only do nominations. With 1,000 different positions that are open, typically they move through rather quickly and they move through the process. But when 64 days are held up just for that, during that time period, you can't do anything else but sit and go through what is called the cloture 30 hours. You can't bring up other legislation.  Then what happens? Well, then my Democratic colleagues come to the floor and say: We haven't had a single debate in this body on We haven't had a debate on infrastructure. We haven't had debate on any of these things. Why won't we move a bill on all of these things?  At the same time, they know it is because they blocked the floor from being able to move legislation because of continual cloture votes over and over and over. It is a bizarre game that doesn't lead to solutions; it leads to greater animosity. It is the same frustration that has existed for a while; it is just getting louder.  At some point, we have to put in a process and say: How do we get out of this? How do we fix this? I think the best way to fix this is to take a bipartisan solution that was agreed to before when Democrats were in the lead, to agree to it now and say that is going to be the permanent rule, just to be able to move a set of ideas.  For what is historically called the greatest deliberative body in the world, wouldn't it be nice to actually get back to deliberating again, spending more time on legislation rather than more time arguing about why aren't debating it when everyone secretly knows the reason, which is because we can't get it to the floor?  I do grow tired. I grow tired of hearing all the political statements and accusations.  Republicans hate children.  They want to throw them out.  They don't want them to have health care.  They hate people of color.  They are trying to exclude people from voting.  They are trying to keep people from having tax reform.  They only care about the wealthy.  Just over and over, when at the same time, the undercurrent is out there to keep anything from being discussed on the floor. It is an interesting strategy to paint your ``enemy,'' but it doesn't help the country--intentionally divisive without a solution.  In 2001, the first year of a new President, there were 51 nominations pending that first year.  There is an interesting thing in the Senate rules. It is the wonderful rule XXXI that no one has heard of. It states that at the end of a year, any nominations that are still out there can be automatically thrown back to the White House and they have to start all over again. They have to renominate them. They have to go through the whole process. They have to go through committees.  At the end of the first year of President Bush, there were 51 nominations still sitting there at the end of that year. On 49 of them, this body, by unanimous consent, said: No, we will just hold them over. We are fine. We don't have to send them all back to the  In 2009, in President Obama's first term, there were 72 folks. For 64 of those, this body--every Republican and Democrat--agreed to just leave them here and not make them go through the whole process again, which would have been absurd.  As of now, we have 122 pending at the end of President Trump's first year. I am interested to know, when Republicans gave Democrats unanimous consent to be able to maintain their nominations in the past, what happens now. Will this be yet another sign of pure politics rather than actually helping the country get stuff done?  I look forward to the day when we can work toward solutions, not just argue and banter back and forth with political statements. If we are going to get stuff solved, let's not pretend and play games and put each other down; let's actually sit down in a room and get stuff solved. Let's fix the rules of the Senate, whether they be the budget rules that keep us from actually having real budget debates or the rules of the Senate that keep us from actually working rather than allowing us to actually do work.  The rules of the Senate and the process in the Senate are determined by the Senators, so we alone are to blame when the Senate is not working. There is no finger-pointing. There is no ``it is that party.'' There is no ``it is that person.'' It is all of us.  So my recommendation is simple. Let's fix it. Let's resolve the issue. Let's do the right thing in the right way.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Cassidy).

We would like to ask for confirmation on a question that will be of considerable importance to millions of seniors housing residents, including those living in assisted living and memory care residences and in continuing care retirement communities,  As you know, capital for seniors housing, including assisted living and memory care residences and CCRCs, essentially comes from the same lending sources that fund other types of real estate. HUD, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and commercial banks finance seniors housing through their respective housing related programs. Seniors housing competes with other real estate based investments for both equity and debt and it is critical that our tax law treat these seniors housing units in a manner that is comparable to other housing.  Provisions relating to the deduction for business interest and to the deduction for depreciation in the bill include rules governing a ``real property trade or business,'' as that term is currently defined in the tax law.

459,topic-id,282,"Mr.President, I want to speak briefly about the unfolding political crisis, which is also a crisis for justice, in  Peru transitioned to democracy in 2000, after two decades of internal armed conflict and authoritarian rule. The country has made important strides in rebuilding its democratic institutions, consolidating the rule of law, and combating impunity, but today, efforts by a majority in the Peruvian Congress to arbitrarily remove judges from the country's highest court, the Constitutional Tribunal, and to oust the attorney general for courageously doing his job, threaten to undermine those gains and reverse Peru's democratic progress.  As a former prosecutor and the senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am especially concerned about the attempt by the majority in[[Page S8245]]Peru's Congress to impeach Attorney General Pablo Sanchez in the midst of his office's investigation into allegations that the Presidential campaign of Keiko Fujimori received illegal contributions in 2011. The effort to remove Attorney General Sanchez strongly suggests a deliberate strategy to obstruct justice and to undermine the autonomy of the attorney general's office. This would represent a grave setback for hard-fought gains to reestablish an independent judiciary and the rule of law in It would have serious ramifications for U.S.-Peruvian relations.  Credible allegations of corruption must be thoroughly investigated, without prejudice to party or power, and with due process for the accused. I urge members of Peru's Congress to support those who are acting on behalf of the Peruvian people in the pursuit of truth and justice. Key to this is respect for the autonomy of the office of the attorney general and of the Constitutional Tribunal, institutions that are guarantors of human rights and the rule of law.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8244-2.txt,1383,DACA,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
522,topic-id,832,"Mr.President, little more than a month ago, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was unveiled in the Just a few short weeks later, we are on the verge of passing a colossal bill, publicly available for just 4 days, that makes sweeping changes to every aspect of our economy. We are moving so fast that the American people would be forgiven for thinking we were addressing a national emergency; yet fires are still blazing in California, power in Puerto Rico is still not fully restored, and victims around the gulf of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria are still struggling to pick up the pieces and rebuild. There are indeed national emergencies we should be addressing, but instead of doing so, Republicans in Congress are focused first on passing tax cuts for corporations and billionaires--tax cuts that will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the deficit.  The process that led to the bill we are voting on today has been fundamentally flawed from the outset. From the beginning, this bill has been written behind closed doors by Senate No hearings were ever held on this bill, denying the American people an opportunity to add their voices to the debate. When the Senate voted on its version of this bill in the dead of night, Senators only received the text a few hours before the vote, and even then, the text was hastily put together, with scribbles written into the margins. We discovered that lobbyists knew more about what was in it than those of us who had the responsibility to vote on it. No wonder that it was loaded with last-minute special interest giveaways.  There is serious doubt this bill will benefit the middle class, as Republicans claim. What we do know is that it will result in millions of fewer insured Americans and higher healthcare premiums for millions more. At the same time, corporations will receive a windfall in permanent tax cuts that will bust our budget for decades to come. Even more appallingly, it includes special provisions that will directly benefit the President and some Members of It doesn't end there. Republicans have yet to address the $1 trillion in cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and other programs vital to the American people, which will be spurred by the passage of this bill. This bill cynically and surreptitiously sets the stage for those slashing cuts.  This is a bill that cheats our future for the sake of a tax-cut windfall for the 1 percent. It does absolutely wonderful things for the wealthiest taxpayers, like the President, his cronies, and his family. If he wants to dispute that, he should finally release his tax returns and prove to the American people that the ``Christmas present'' the President talks about will not, in fact, benefit his bottom line.  What we do know is this bill does not advance the common good. It offers little but crumbs on the table and coal in the stockings of hard-working Americans, while the wealthiest individuals and corporations reap the rewards of this bill, with the false promise of trickle-down benefits to everyone else. The wealthiest are doing just fine, and big corporations already are pulling in record profits, which they are not investing but salting away. More than 400 millionaires have urgently told Congress that they don't need more tax cuts.  Republicans will continue to claim that their bill represents serious tax reform, but the public isn't fooled. Poll after poll shows that the American people see this bill for what it is: a betrayal of the middle class and a betrayal of American values. They have seen enough of trickle-down economics to know that the benefits never flow to them. At the end of the day, it is clear that this bill was never really about the middle class; it was about the Republican donor class.  I wish we had gone down a different path, one where both parties worked together to provide real relief to the working families we all represent. It belies the storied history of this institution to rush through such a sweeping bill, through an arcane process of reconciliation intended to secure the lowest possible number of votes to succeed, without the benefit of public opinion, or even public review.  After one of the least productive sessions of Congress that I can recall, Republicans are so desperate for a win that they will mortgage away our future. This bill is not tax reform. This is a cartoonish caricature of what real tax reform should look like. It is dishonest to its core. It is cynical, and it can only breed more cynicism by the public. It is bad policy, it is indefensible policy, and it is wrong.  It is said that every generation has a responsibility to leave our Nation better, brighter, and stronger for the generations that follow. This tax bill accomplishes none of those goals.  I strongly oppose--I reject--this conference report, and the crass, partisan path that brought us here.

595,topic-id,1282,"Mr.President, on Monday, the head of the Honduras Supreme Electoral Tribunal declared Juan Orlando Hernandez the next President of Shortly thereafter, the Secretariat of the Organization of American States, one of the principal international observers, announced that it could not certify the election as free and fair and called for a new election. Yesterday, after his top advisers rebuked the OAS for infringing on Honduras's sovereignty, President Hernandez, stating that ``the Honduran people have spoken,'' declared himself President-elect.  On December 5, I spoke at length about the Honduran election, and I have made several statements since then. I will not repeat what I and many others have already said about the troubling process orchestrated by President Hernandez and his associates over the past several years to lay the groundwork for his reelection for an unprecedented second Presidential term, nor about the many irregularities that have caused masses of people to take to the streets in protest since the vote on November 26. As of today, at least 12 protesters, and perhaps as many as 20, have been killed and many more injured, mostly from military police firing live ammunition. I was disappointed that, in his speech yesterday, President Hernandez made no mention of those tragic deaths.  As we await the Trump administration's decision on whether to support the OAS's call for a new election or accept President Hernandez' claim to a second term, I want to make three points.  First, if this flawed election had been held in a country not led by a President whose consolidation of power and reliance on the military and police have had the strong backing of the White House and the State Department, it is doubtful that it would be accepted as free and fair. Instead, the White House, which has been willing to excuse the Hernandez government's corruption scandals and crackdown on the press and civil society, would likely be calling for a recount or, if the integrity of the ballots could not be assured, a new election.  Second, the OAS deserves the thanks of people throughout this hemisphere for the role it has played as an impartial observer and for standing up for a free and fair election in Honduras at a time when democratic processes, freedom of expression and association, and independent judiciaries are threatened not only in Honduras but in many parts of Latin Next year, Presidential and Parliamentary elections are scheduled in many countries in Central and South America, and the OAS, which has been a strong defender of democracy and human rights in Venezuela, has a vital role to play in seeking to ensure that those elections meet international standards of fairness and transparency. It is therefore particularly important and reassuring that the OAS Secretariat has insisted on such standards in Honduras by calling for a new election, and it is just as important that the United States stands with the OAS at this time.  Third, it is ultimately for the people of Honduras to decide what kind of a government they want and whether to accept the result declared by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which has little credibility outside of President Hernandez's National It is clear that the country is sharply divided politically, socially, and economically. Absent an electoral process that is widely accepted as free and fair, that divisiveness will imperil the progress that is urgently needed in combating poverty, violence, organized crime, corruption, and impunity that pose immense challenges for the future.  But the international community and particularly the people of this hemisphere also have a stake in this election and in Honduras's future. In the past decade alone, the United States has provided many hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Honduras, much of which I supported, but that aid has not achieved the results that the Honduran people and we wanted, and the reason for that, I believe, is primarily because successive Honduran Governments were not serious about addressing many of the key problems I have mentioned, yet the aid kept flowing. Unfortunately, I am not convinced that the current government is sufficiently serious about this, either.  Honduras today desperately needs a freely and fairly elected leader who can unite the country. Unfortunately, this election lacked the conditions of fairness and transparency necessary to produce that result. If a new election is[[Page S8178]]held under such conditions, it is entirely possible that President Hernandez may win--or he may not. But for him, or any candidate, to obtain the mandate required to unite the country and make a credible case that his government is a deserving partner of the United States, it will need to be by rejecting the serious flaws of this election and demonstrating to all the people of Honduras and this hemisphere what real democracy looks like.  I ask unanimous consent that today's Bloomberg View editorial calling for a new democratic election in Honduras be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             The U.Should Back New Elections in Honduras                  (By James Gibney and Michael Newman)  Latin America needs to start its big election year on the right foot       There is only one way out of Honduras's deepening political      crisis, and that is a new presidential election. It's a      solution the U.S., with its long history in Latin America,      should help bring about--although it would help if it had an      ambassador there.       The certification this week of incumbent President Juan      Orlando Hernandez's contested victory in last month's      election has brought Hondurans into the streets, continuing a      wave of violent demonstrations that have claimed at least 24      lives. It comes after a deeply flawed ballot-counting process      that included long delays, after which Hernandez's early      deficit mysteriously disappeared. (The final tally put him      ahead by about 1.5 percent.) The vote was denounced by      numerous observers--including the Organization of American      States, which has called for new elections.       Yet the U.S., which has no ambassador in Tegucigalpa or an      assistant secretary of State for the hemisphere, has been      only mildly critical. When Hernandez's victory was certified,      it urged opposing political parties to ``raise any concerns      they may have.'' And just after the disputed election, the      State Department renewed aid to Honduras--a move widely      interpreted as tacit support for       Hernandez has won friends in Washington with his      willingness to crack down on crime and illegal migration to      the U.S., and his investor-friendly policies. At the same      time, his administration has been responsible for ugly human      rights abuses and been implicated in several high-profile      corruption scandals. Moreover, he has extended his tenure      only by packing Honduras's Supreme Court to lift the      country's one-term limit for presidents. The head of the      court responsible for certifying election results is one of      Hernandez's close allies.       Even before last month's flawed vote, Honduras was notable      for the lack of popular confidence in its electoral      mechanisms. And if it's stability that Washington seeks,      these disputed results don't promise to achieve it.      Protracted unrest will only make fighting drugs and illegal      migration harder.       The contrast between the OAS and the U.could also hurt      U.influence and credibility. The U.has rightly      supported the OAS in its efforts to hold Venezuela      accountable for its electoral crimes. If it fails to do the      same in Honduras, it risks setting a dangerous double      standard. This would be especially damaging in a year when      nearly two out of three Latin Americans are scheduled to go      to the polls.       As the administration's just-released National Security      Strategy says, ``Stable, friendly, and prosperous states in      the Western Hemisphere enhance our security and benefit our      economy.'' The best way to ensure that Honduras becomes one      is to support free, transparent and fair elections.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8177.txt,1383,TAX CUTS AND JOBS BILL,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
748,topic-id,689,"Mr.President, 2018 marks the 100-year anniversary of the influenza pandemic that killed an estimated 50 million people, including 670,000 I suspect most people assume that, given the remarkable advances in modern medicine since 1918, nothing so disastrous could happen again, but in fact, it could, and next time, it could be even worse. The spread of infectious diseases and drug resistance, and the accompanying threats to global security, are on the rise, and the international community is woefully underprepared to fight back.  The several large-scale infectious disease outbreaks of the last two decades, including SARS, H1N1, and Ebola, have revealed the extent to which individual countries and the international community at large need to dramatically improve their preparedness to respond to such potentially catastrophic health crises.  The stark reality is that the threat is increasing. An ever-growing, increasingly mobile global population will provide the breeding ground for the emergence and contagion of existing and new infectious diseases.  The potential threats from infectious disease outbreaks include not only catastrophic loss of life, but severe economic harm and social and political instability. The 2014-15 Ebola outbreak, for example, which began with the death of a 2-year-old boy in a remote Guinean village, ultimately killed more than 11,000 people across six countries, left thousands of children orphaned, caused an estimated economic loss to those countries of nearly $3 billion, and resulted in many people losing confidence in their country's public health system.  It is important to note that Ebola, which is spread through direct contact and terrified millions of people including in this country, is hardly the most infectious known disease. Several other disease agents, such as measles and influenza, can be spread through the air and can develop into epidemics or pandemics much more rapidly.  That is one of the reasons why many global health experts fear that an infectious disease outbreak far worse than Ebola will occur sometime in the next 20 years and that the number of outbreaks will become more frequent.  Despite improvements in access to safe water and sanitation, vaccine development, and other public health advances to combat infectious diseases, an enormous amount of work remains.  One of the most important lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak is that time is of the essence. The lack of a rapid, coordinated global response resulted in many preventable deaths. Disease surveillance systems were poor or nonexistent in the severely impacted countries, there was a lack of trained personnel to rapidly deploy, and no effective public communication system was in place to inform and update local communities.  An additional problem was the inability to quickly mobilize resources. Countries and NGOs around the globe lacked a reserve of available funds. The Congress took a step toward addressing this issue in the fiscal year 2017 State and foreign operations appropriations bill, which included a $70 million emergency reserve fund to address infectious disease outbreaks around the globe. In the fiscal year 2018 Senate version of the State and foreign operations bill, Chairman Graham and I included $130 million for programs to prevent and respond to such emerging health threats.  However, as I have said before and I will say again, far more needs to be done to build the public health infrastructure to prevent and respond to disease pandemics. As the international community works to be more prepared for infectious disease outbreaks, the U.should continue to play a leading role in preparedness planning. Unfortunately, President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget would cut funding for these very programs, including for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which played an indispensable role in responding to the Ebola and Zika outbreaks, as it has to many other international health crises.  It is time we invest and prepare for pandemics in a similar way as we invest and prepare for war, nuclear disasters, or other large-scale threats to global security. The potential consequences are no less serious. I urge[[Page S8246]]the White House to face up to this reality and dramatically increase funding for these programs at CDC, the U.Agency for International Development, and other Federal agencies that play a role in global health security.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8245-2.txt,1383,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
807,topic-id,2327,"Mr.President, I want to take a moment to recognize the achievements and contributions of a renowned political scholar, remarkable educator, and a personal friend. This year, Garrison Nelson will conclude five decades of teaching at the University of Vermont, where he is recognized as a legend in the department of political science.  Garrison, the inaugural Elliott Brown Green and Gold Professor of Law, Politics, and Political Behavior, is known by some Members of this body, as well as legislators throughout the country who rely on him to offer political insight. Widely considered a leading expert on congressional history, Garrison has authored more than 150 articles and professional papers on national politics with a major focus on the U.Congress and elections in His works have educated students worldwide and can be found in close to 500 libraries in the United States and 13 countries around the world.  An Irish native of Boston, Garrison has resided in the Green Mountain State for most of his adult life, adding much richness to the State's political landscape. I have known Garrison since he served as an aide in my office shortly after my first election to the Garrison is as revered as he is brilliant. His skill and affinity for the esoteric is evident in both his teaching style and his storytelling, perhaps most notably his magnum opus, ``John William McCormack: A Political Biography.'' Works like this one have made significant contributions to our Nation's historical library, offering profiles and untold stories of the political icons of our time. In today's political environment, such citations of success and failure can offer us precious insight into improving our own oath to serve.  As Garrison departs the Old Mill at the University of Vermont at the end of this year, he will leave a legacy that has reached more than 13,000 students. With them and many others, he has shared his appreciation of and reverence for the American political system and the need for participation to ensure the success of our democracy. I am grateful for his commitment to inspire the next generation of political leaders.  In recognition of Garrison's timeless contributions, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Terri appearing in Vermont's own Seven Days, about Garrison's achievements be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From Seven Days, October 18, 2017]   Fifty Years, 13,450 Students and 5;000 Interviews: UVM's Garrison                         Nelson Calls It a Career                         (By Terri Hallenback)       When former Vermont governor Howard Dean ran for president      in 2004, national media turned to University of Vermont      political science professor Garrison Nelson for insight.       ``I think he is an arrogant, ill-tempered schmo who does      not play well with others,'' Nelson told the Houston            Many of the same political reporters came back 12 years      later, when Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wanted the job. They      called on Nelson to capture the politics and personality of      the quirky democratic socialist who'd once been mayor of            ``Bernie's the last person you'd want to be stuck on a      desert island with,'' Nelson told the New Yorker in 2015.      ``Two weeks of lectures about health care, and you'd look for      a shark and dive in.''       In his day job, the bearded professor with a booming,      Boston-accented voice has spent nearly 50 years bringing dry      political facts to life for thousands of students while      churning out a steady flow of academic research.       To the broader public, though, Nelson is known as the man      to whom journalists both local and national regularly turned      for well-informed analysis--and no-holds-barred skewering--of      Vermont politicians and their ambitions.       Now, after 13,450 students (including this reporter), 11      books and more than 5,000 media interviews (yes, he keeps      track), UVM's most quoted professor is retiring. The 146      students in his two political science classes this semester      will be his last.       Nelson is calling an end to a career that has made him one      of UVM's most public figures. On campus and off, he has      chafed and informed generations of students, politicians and      voters. ``With full classrooms and multiple book demands at      age 75, the pace has become grueling,'' said Nelson, whose      walk has slowed to a shuffle on the well-worn route between      his Old Mill office and Lafayette Hall classroom.       Looking back, it's hard to believe that Nelson lasted a      full year, let alone five decades, at He's poked at not      just politicians, but university brass. In 1971, as a      relatively new, untenured teacher, he protested the      politically motivated ouster of a left-wing professor,      Michael Parenti; 30 years later, then-tenured Nelson feuded      publicly with his university bosses over pay and college      leadership.       For a while, Nelson considered leaving From 1996 to      2002, he worked part-time at Boston area colleges and had      designs on landing a full-time job at one of them. But he      held on to his tenure and continued to teach in Burlington      during that time. He's now one of the university's longest-     serving professors.       As he completes his employment, Nelson said he has      mellowed. He claims to admire the full slate of university      leaders above him. The twice-divorced Nelson remarried this      year. He literally beams over the positive reviews of his      newly released book, a 910-page tome on the little-remembered      1960s-era U.House speaker John Nelson refers to      the book's publication as the ``crowning moment'' of his      career.       At an official gathering last week to honor his upcoming      retirement, Nelson told colleagues that a friend asked him      why he wanted to retire now, when things are going so well.      ``My answer was, 'It won't get any better than this,'' ' he      said.       In the classroom, Nelson is known for turning large numbers      of students--including apolitical ones--on to political      history through the stories behind it. He's a natural      raconteur, whether the topic is the rise of Woodrow Wilson,      the Austin-Boston dominance of the U.House or his own      Massachusetts roots. Nelson's single mom raised him and his      younger half-sister in working-class Lynn after his Communist      father left.       ``Super paper. Star of the day,'' Nelson told one young      woman as he handed back papers to the 39 students in his      Electing the President class last week.       ``More sources, More sources next time,'' he told      another, also loud enough to be heard by everyone in the      room.       Former student Jade Harberg said she liked the way Nelson      challenged students with candor and humor. ``I appreciated      teachers who were willing to shame their students to work      harder,'' the 2013 UVM grad said.       Harberg, who now works for Nelson as a researcher in      Washington, D.C., recalled that the professor sent her class      an email listing the students who had turned their papers in      early and those who had been late. He included a statistical      analysis that concluded men were more likely to be tardy than      women and told the class, ``This is why women are ruling the      world.''       Nelson gets high marks on the website Rate My      Former students graded him 4 out of 5 in quality, and 89      percent say they would take his course again. But the      comments reflect a range of reactions to the professor's      personality.       Some called him a ``genius,'' ``hilarious'' and ``extremely      helpful.'' A typical dissenter, on the other hand, concluded:      ``Pompous, has a weird inferiority complex about not having      gone to Harvard.''       Clark Bensen, a 1974 UVM grad, said Nelson's intensity      helped push him into political science from his math-     economics major. ``For me, he was a breath of fresh air, or      more like a gale-force wind,'' Bensen said. Today, Bensen      still uses the skills Nelson taught him to run Polidata, a      Virginia-based firm that analyzes political data.       Nelson made an impression on his colleagues, too. Anthony      ``Jack'' Gierzynski, chair of the UVM political science      department, said that when he arrived at the university in      1992, he saw Nelson's students were enthralled by his      storytelling.       ``At first, I tried to imitate that,'' Gierzynski said, but      he quickly found it didn't work for him. Noting the 2013      retirement of equally charismatic political science professor      Frank Bryan, Gierzynski said Nelson is ``the last of that      breed.''       Despite his outsize personality, Nelson has spent a      considerable part of his professorial career toiling quietly      on detailed research on esoteric subjects. He has produced      thick volumes on the membership of congressional committees      that may be valuable reference books--albeit not best      sellers.       At least one student appreciated that. ``The guy has an      encyclopedic mind and has done granular research on New      England politics,'' said journalist Scott MacKay, a 1974 grad      who has long relied on Nelson's insights--and quotability--as      a political reporter in Vermont and Rhode       Nelson had wanted to write a book about McCormack since he      met the former House speaker in 1968, just before he started      working at Eleven publishers turned him down--McCormack      was a key player in his time but a relatively obscure      historical figure--before Bloomsbury Publishing finally      offered him a deal. John William McCormack: A Political      Biography came out in       Such work earns an author academic credibility, but Nelson      is more likely to be remembered for his outspoken political      commentary. Insisting it ``was not a central feature of my      UVM life,'' he explained, ``I fell[[Page S8247]]     into it because, apart from my buddy Frank Bryan, others at      UVM were reluctant to do it.''       Nelson has been analyzing Vermont politics for print and      television journalists since Democrat Phil Hoff sat in the      governor's office in the 1960s. He's provided plenty of      straight, factual observations but over time became known for      a spicier variety of analysis.       He admits that he's dished it out unevenly.       Nelson thinks highly of Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), for      whom he worked for two years, so Leahy has largely been      spared his barbs. He has also generally spoken favorably of      the political skills of former U.S senator Jim Jeffords (I-     Vt.) and former Republican governors Jim Douglas and Richard            For Sanders, whose political career he's followed since      1981, Nelson has both criticism and affection. ``The      difference between Bernie and most of the lefties is, Bernie      wants to win,'' Nelson said in the October 2015 New Yorker      article. ``Most lefties don't want to win, because if you      win, you sell out your purity.''       His analysis was acceptable to his daughter, Shyla Nelson      Stewart, a Sanders devotee who seconded the senator's      nomination at the Democratic National       ``The most important thing he said was, Bernie has been on      the same agenda his entire career,'' she said of her dad's      comments, ``and that that agenda has caught up with the      times.''       Nelson has been harder on Dean and Congressman Peter Welch      (D-Vt.).       ``I never understood why Howard was running for president      other than the fact that Howard wanted to be president,'' he      said before class one day last month. ``It was just Howard's      ego.'' Dean did not respond to a message from Seven Days      seeking his point of view.       Nelson is slightly less dismissive of Nelson said      their feud started when he made a comment to a reporter      during Welch's 1988 campaign for the Democratic U.House      nomination, saying Welch's strategy of concentrating his      campaign in southern Vermont was a mistake. ``Peter took      offense,'' Nelson said. When Welch confronted him, Nelson      said, he responded with choice words.       Welch insisted last week that he doesn't remember the      incident or Nelson's specific comments, though he did say the      professor was always critical.       ``He showed no mercy,'' Welch said. ``He was extremely good      at cutting folks down to a size that was smaller than they      thought they deserved.''       Daughter Stewart provides some insight. ``What my father      has most railed against is anyone who has even the slightest      sense of entitlement,'' she said of Nelson, who often talks      about growing up poor.       Nelson saw that attitude in Dean, who grew up on New York      City's Park       ``His born-again liberalism has caught a lot of us by      surprise--it's a case of `Howard, we hardly knew ye,' ''      Nelson told the Associated Press in 2003. ``He's really a      classic Rockefeller Republican: a fiscal conservative and      social liberal.''       His disapproval of Welch, a lawyer from Springfield, Mass.,      is more complicated. Nelson viewed Welch and his late wife,      Joan Smith, as a couple in search of power--his in politics      and hers at UVM, where she was dean of the College of Arts      and Science and Nelson's boss.       In a 2001 column, the late Seven Days columnist Peter      Freyne wrote, ``Nelson told Seven Days that Smith and her      husband, former gubernatorial candidate Peter Welch, `wanted      to be the Democratic Snellings, with Peter holding the      governor's office and Joan holding high office at the      university'--a reference to the late Governor Richard      Snelling and wife Barbara Snelling, who served as a UVM vice      president for many years.''       Nelson does not let go of such opinions easily, nor does he      like being on the receiving end of the kind of criticism he      so readily doles out to others.       Nelson recalled comments Freyne made about him during      Dean's 2004 presidential campaign. ``Peter bashed me in four      separate columns,'' Nelson said, alleging that Freyne was      courting Dean's campaign in hopes of landing a job.       In one of those columns, Freyne said, ``Garrison despises      Howard Dean, always has and always will. We suggest it's all      about ego--Nelson's, not Dean's.''       Asked why this still roiled him 13 years after Dean's      campaign ended and eight years after Freyne's death, Nelson      said, ``I'm Irish, for Chrissakes; I don't forget anything.      Irish Alzheimer's--you never forget a grudge.''       Nelson doesn't get as much ink in the newspapers as he once      did--which is his choice, he said, because answering      questions from reporters takes away from his research time.      He didn't have a lot to say about former governor Peter      Shumlin and has been just as quiet on Phil Scott and      President Donald But he makes no apologies for      comments made over the years about politicians, students or      his bosses.       ``When you're an outspoken person, you're going to piss      people off. I've pissed people off,'' Nelson said. ``But I'm      still here--50 years.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8246.txt,1383,SYSTEMIC RISK DESIGNATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
858,topic-id,462,"Mr.President, we are all too familiar with President Trump's ``fake news'' mantra, which he has repeatedly used to discredit unfavorable news reports and undermine the credibility of the media in our country.  This mantra and the accompanying threats to freedoms of speech and of the press have now spread far beyond our borders. Autocrats and dictators around the world are enthusiastically using the concept of fake news and the legitimacy granted to it by the President of the United States to further undermine and restrict press freedom and fact-based reporting on corruption, human rights, and other abuses in their own countries.  For example, in response to an Amnesty International report on thousands of military prison deaths in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad remarked, ``You can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.'' Similarly, in response to news reports on persecution of the Rohingya ethnic minority group in Myanmar, an officer in Myanmar's Rakhine state security ministry stated, ``There is no such thing as It is fake news.''  The list goes on and includes comments from autocratic leaders in the Philippines, Venezuela, Russia, China, and Turkey, among others, who have used the fake news mantra to legitimize harassment, arrests, and prosecutions of journalists.  Last week, the Committee to Protect Journalists, CPJ, released its annual census of imprisoned journalists worldwide, which has hit an historical high of 262. The total does not include the many more journalists who were imprisoned for a period of time during the year before being released prior to the December 1 census. A CPJ statement published with the report noted that: ``Far from isolating repressive countries for their authoritarian behavior, the United States, in particular, has cozied up to strongmen such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Chinese President Xi At the same time, President Donald Trump's nationalistic rhetoric, fixation on Islamic extremism, and insistence on labeling critical media `fake news' serves to reinforce the framework of accusations and legal charges that allow such leaders to preside over the jailing of journalists.''  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution has inspired people around the world for over 200 years. It was reaffirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and versions of it have been included in the constitutions of many countries; yet while the United States has long been a global leader for freedom of expression, the White House is now actively working to undermine press freedom. President Trump's reckless rhetoric has not only harmed our credibility and our reputation, it has emboldened foreign dictators who fear nothing more than for their misdeeds to be exposed by the media. The consequence is journalists threatened and imprisoned, journalists assassinated with impunity, publishers who are intimidated, and the ultimate casualty is the truth.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8245.txt,1383,ISSUES OF THE DAY,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1254,topic-id,1102,"Mr.President, I will speak very briefly.  While I voted to keep the government going, this is not the way to govern. We should not be doing stopgap measures. We will be back here soon. We will have a relatively short time--a couple of weeks--to finally do our work, the work we should have done for the last 6 months. We will have to address sequestration on both sides of the ledger--on defense and nondefense--and raise the caps for both. We have to speak on one of the greatest issues in our country today, and that is the Dreamers, and we have to address that and have votes up or down on the Senate floor. I intend to vote to protect We have to vote on the Children's Health Insurance There are so many others.  I want Senators on both sides of the aisle to know--and I have talked to both Republicans and Democrats--Senator Cochran and I and others have tried to keep the appropriations process going. We will continue to do that. We will do that when we come back. There will not be another continuing resolution without a bipartisan budget agreement.  Mr.President, this is not how we should govern in the U.We have once again found ourselves on the edge of a manufactured, made-in-Washington crisis. Once again, we are forced into political games at the eleventh hour by the imminent threat of a Republican shutdown. This time that threat has fallen right before Christmas and the holidays.  There is no reason we should find ourselves in this situation. There has always been a proven path forward to avoid this crisis, and that path is to reach a bipartisan budget deal that is based on parity. Sequestration has had devastating consequences on our country that will impact a generation, and we must raise the budget caps on both sides of the ledger--defense and nondefense.  This is not an academic exercise. Our decisions are having real and devastating consequences. We are letting our infrastructure crumble. We are letting down our veterans. We are allowing our education programs to fall behind, and we are harming our military's readiness.  Regrettably, our Republican Colleagues took the path of delay, no compromise, government by crisis. Here we are, 3 months into the fiscal year without a budget. The continuing resolution that is before us provides a 1-month extension to fund the government, but we are no closer to a bipartisan budget deal. I intend to vote for this continuing resolution because a government shutdown helps no one, but I implore my fellow Senators to use the next month wisely. We owe it to the American people.  Those on the other side of the aisle need to come to the table to negotiate an agreement that will provide funding for healthcare to our veterans, build infrastructure for a growing economy, and make us more secure.  But this is not the only thing we must accomplish in the coming month. Our list of unfinished business is long. We also need to pass the Dream President Trump's decision to end the DACA program was as cruel as it was senseless. Dreamers are American in every way except on paper, having been brought here as children through no fault of their own. By definition, Dreamers are law-abiding strivers, serving our communities as doctors and teachers and defending our homeland as brave men and women in uniform.  Instead of working with Congress to find a permanent legislative solution while keeping DACA protections in place, the President yielded to xenophobic nativists in his administration and terminated protections for our Nation's  I am greatly disappointed that Republicans would not consider including the Dream Act on this continuing resolution. We simply cannot fail to pass the Dream Act, and we must do so, and we must do so soon. The future of Dreamers--and I believe the fate of the American Dream itself--lies in our hands.  We also need a permanent reauthorization for the Children's Health Insurance It has been 3 months since Congress let funds expire for the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, putting at risk the 9 million children nationwide who depend on the program for health insurance coverage.  Vermont's CHIP program, known as Dynasaur, covers over 5,000 children whose families are now worried whether their kids will be covered next year. Instead of moving forward with a bipartisan reauthorization for 5 years, as has been proposed in the Senate, this continuing resolution extends the program only temporarily.  What is worse, the majority is insisting on offsetting this extension by cutting funding for prevention and public health programs. This is robbing Peter to pay If we can pass a tax cut that benefits the wealthiest Americans and which will add, at a minimum, $1.5 trillion to our deficit, we should be able to reauthorize CHIP--for longer than 3 months--without undermining public health. We should not have to make this choice, but here we are, being forced to choose between a misguided short-term patch or a wholesale government shutdown.  Again, I call on our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to use the next month to negotiate solutions to these real problems. That includes having a debate about American's privacy rights. Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act was intended to be a powerful foreign intelligence surveillance tool, and it is, but it also sweeps up massive amounts of Americans' communications, which can then be accessed without a warrant. That has long been a concern of mine, and I have stated that we should reauthorize 702, but we should not do so at the expense of our own civil liberties.  A 1-month extension gives Congress an opportunity--and I believe, an obligation--to debate this program on the floor, just like we did in 2012. All Members deserve an opportunity to weigh in on this critical surveillance tool, and this short, clean reauthorization of Section 702 allows for just that.  To be clear, the Republicans are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White It is clear that they bear the burden of bringing us to this crisis point, and they need to answer to the American people for the unfinished business before us. We should never have gotten to this point.  We can still reach a bipartisan budget deal. I remain ready to work with Chairman Cochran, the Appropriations Committee, and Members from both sides of the aisle to secure the funding agreements we need to complete our appropriations, keep the lights on, and resolve the other pressing matters before us.[[Page S8237]]  I yield the floor.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying bill, which really is the greatest tax scam in America's history. It is cruel and it is coldhearted.  It steals from the hard-earned paychecks of low- and middle-income families; lines the pockets of millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations; and, yes, it makes it easier for corporations to ship jobs overseas.  Now, for weeks, Republicans have been selling the pipe dream that tax cuts for the rich will somehow trickle down and benefit the majority of That is so far from the truth.  Just yesterday, the Tax Policy Center revealed that 83 percent of the tax breaks in this bill go to the top 1 percent.  What is worse, 86 million middle-income households will face tax hikes and 13 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage.  Mr.Speaker, constituents in my congressional district are afraid of their futures because this tax scam is going to severely devastate families in Nearly 2 million Californians stand to lose their State and local deductions if Republicans succeed.

It makes clear that Republicans only value the lives of the wealthy and their donors. That is whose side they are on.  Well, Democrats are on the side of middle- and low-income families who are working hard just to make ends meet, to take care of their children, to make better wages, and who are fighting for a better future.

When Congress received the paltry and insufficient disaster request from the administration, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an emergency assistance package that would come closer to meeting the massive scale of need resulting from hurricanes and wildfires in the summer and fall 2017.  I sincerely regret that the majority leadership abandoned that process, choosing, instead, to disregard input from Democrats and even from Senate Republicans, and developed their own partisan supplemental. The results of that decision is a poor product that will not be enacted into law.  Despite some robust funding levels, this bill fails to fix a potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin Without help from Congress, these programs will exhaust available funding within months. This bill also fails to waive unworkable and unjustifiable cost share requirements for FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers' projects, which could put Federal funding out of reach.  These and other serious shortcomings must be fixed before an emergency supplemental is enacted into law.

I include in the Record a letter from Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, which requests Medicaid assistance and 100 percent Federal costs for FEMA and Army Corps projects which are not included in the bill.

Regarding any federal funding for Medicaid in Puerto Rico,      it is imperative that disaster supplemental legislation      provide that for not less than two years Puerto Rico will      receive 100% federal funding (FMAP). This funding is      necessary because there is no question about Puerto Rico's      looming Medicaid crisis: within the first months of 2018,      absent emergency funding, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program will      exhaust its current funds and the island's Medicaid system      will collapse, which will bring to a halt Puerto Rico's      entire healthcare system.       The disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to      statutorily waive for two years Puerto Rico's state cost      share for FEMA Public Moreover, the disaster      supplemental legislation must be revised so to include a two      year waiver of the cost-sharing requirements for all Army      Corps of Engineers projects in Puerto       As you know, the recent hurricanes have destroyed Puerto      The lives of millions of U.citizens are now in the      federal government's hands. I look forward to continuing to      work with you to move forward the proposals I have outlined      in this letter. Together we can rebuild Puerto Rico better      than ever and make the island anew. At this moment, the      federal government has an opportunity to demonstrate      America's commitment to all its citizens, including those who      reside in Puerto           Sincerely,                                         Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon,                                  Member of Congress, PR-At  ",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10364.txt,709,TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT--CONFERENCE REPORT,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1171,topic-id,356,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this epic failure of governing.  Nearly 3 months into the fiscal year, the Republican majority is advancing[[Page H10398]]its third temporary continuing resolution with no foreseeable path forward on enacting full-year appropriations and no evident urgency to address priorities that are critical to American families and communities.  Completely preoccupied with showering tax breaks on corporations and the wealthiest Americans, the majority has failed to clear the extremely low bar of charting a course to keep the government open and meet deadlines they have set for themselves.  In short, the Republican majority has made a complete mess of the very basics of governing. Now they want Democrats to bail them out by carrying a bill that neglects our priorities.  This continuing resolution should include the bipartisan Dream Act, protecting from deportation young people who were brought to this country as small children and only know the United States as home. But this bill tells those facing deportation that their plight is not our concern.  It should include a bipartisan reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, providing long-term certainty for 9 million children and families who depend on the program. Instead, this bill tells children and families their medical needs are not our priority.  It should include an agreement to raise caps for defense and nondefense spending with parity so that appropriators can get to work on a full-year spending package that keeps America secure and prosperous. Instead, the bill tries to make an end run around solely the defense cap by slipping in nearly $5 billion in new spending for the  It should not clean up the mess the majority made triggering automatic reductions to Medicare because of their deficit-busting tax bill.  The majority wants to pass this bill and go home for the holidays, somehow content with its performance on behalf of the Americans they represent.

It is long past time that the majority work with Democrats to increase the budget caps and write full-year spending bills. The Appropriations Committee stands ready to do our job.

690,topic-id,661,"Mr.Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman Hensarling for his support of this legislation and his dedication to a more reasonable regulatory regime.  I would also like to thank my good friend, Representative David Scott from Georgia, for being a cosponsor on the Democrat side and for all the hard work and support he has given us throughout this labor of love here on trying to get this thing done. He has been a champion for us, and we thank him sincerely.  Today, the House will consider H.3312, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017, a bipartisan piece of legislation to address an inefficient regulatory structure by accounting for actual risk, rather than the size alone in the designation of systemically important financial institutions, or  Under the current regulatory framework for SIFI designations, any bank holding company with more than $50 billion in assets is subject to enhanced regulatory supervision and special assessments. This approach fails to take into account differences in business models or risks posed to the financial system. It has real world implications, too, stunting economic growth and limiting access to credit.  The risk of a traditional bank is not the same as an internationally active complex firm. In fact, the Fed has produced data showing the risk of every single midsize and regional bank which pales in comparison to risks posed by many and almost all global systemically important banks.  H.3312 will remove the completely arbitrary approach taken today and replace it with analysis of actual risk posed to the financial system. The bill would require regulators to examine not just size, but also interconnectedness, the extent of readily available substitutes, global cross-jurisdictional activity, and the complexity of each bank holding company.  Today's method isn't a reasonable basis for supervision, a fact that has been recognized by Fed Chair Yellen, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and former Treasury Secretary Lew, and many Members of this body. Even Barney Frank, as Chairman Hensarling just noted, the former Democratic chairman of the Financial Services Committee and author of the Dodd-Frank Act, has said the $50 billion threshold is completely arbitrary and has had negative implications on our economy.  It is important to note that this bill will not impact the authority of the Federal Reserve to oversee institutions. The focused standards set forth in the bill don't guarantee that any institution will be permanently freed from the rigors that are associated with SIFI designation. If the Fed so feels that a bank needs to have continuous oversight, they will do so.  I want to take a moment to discuss the score issued by the Congressional Budget CBO opined that this bill would result in direct spending. I disagree with the CBO interpretation of what this legislation will do, and I believe that my bill will actually create a safer financial system.  At the same time, it is important to me and my colleagues that the bill comes to the taxpayers at no cost. The offset included in the Rules Committee Print will more than cover any potential hit to the Deposit Insurance Fund and makes this legislation budget-neutral.  The bottom line is this: an inefficient regulatory structure that does not reflect the reality of the U.banking system can have real economic consequences. We should no longer let the SIFI process lead to marketplace disruption or penalize companies for size alone.  I have worked on this legislation surrounding the SIFI designation process for the last 4 years, but I have not done it alone. H.3312 was drafted in good faith with--and with considerable input from--many of my friends on the other side of the aisle as well.  Because we worked together, this legislation received broad bipartisan support when it was reported by the Financial Services Committee with a vote of 47-12. That means nearly 80 percent of the committee members voted in favor of this legislation.

I also want to commend Chairman Brady and the House leadership for their incredible work on this issue.  Secondly, Mr.Speaker, believe it or not, there is another bill slated to be considered today by this body, H.3312, my Systemic Risk Designation Improvement It will remove the ill-conceived approach taken in Dodd-Frank to designate bank holding companies as systemically important financial institutions, or  Under the current regulatory framework, the designation of SIFIs is based solely on size. Any bank holding company with more than $50 billion in assets is subject to enhanced regulatory supervision and a variety of special assessments.  This approach fails to take into account differences in business models or risks posed to the financial system. As a former bank regulator, I can tell you this isn't a responsible basis for supervision, a fact that has been recognized by Federal Reserve Chair Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin, former Treasury Secretary Lew, and many Members of Even Barney Frank, the former Democratic chairman of the Financial Services Committee and author of Dodd-Frank, has said the $50 billion threshold is completely arbitrary and has negative implications on our economy.                              {time}  1045  This legislation closely ties the safeguards intended in the designation of a bank holding company with real risk to the system.  My legislation would require the Federal Reserve to examine not just size, but also interconnectedness, the extent of readily available substitutes, global cross-jurisdictional activity, and complexity, criteria they already use in their own risk calculation analysis.  An inefficient regulatory structure that does not reflect the reality of the U.banking system can have real economic consequences. We should no longer let the SIFI process lead to marketplace disruption or penalize companies based on size alone.  It is time to take a more pragmatic approach to the SIFI designation process and, more generally, the punitive regulatory regime hitting financial institutions and their customers. It is time to actually manage risk and limit real threats to our financial system.  This legislation received broad bipartisan support when it was reported by the Financial Services Committee with a vote of 47-12. That means nearly 80 percent of our committee members voted in favor of this legislation. I hope our House colleagues will join us in supporting H.3312 later today.

502,topic-id,1623,"Mr.President, thank you, and I thank the great Senator from Washington State for her leadership on this incredibly important issue.  If this tax bill weren't terrible enough, it goes after one of the most beautiful places on Earth, the Arctic National Wildlife Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is nothing more than a Big Oil polar payout. This isn't about drilling oil; it is about drilling for votes. This isn't about crude oil; it is the crudest of politics.  We now have 41 cosponsors of my legislation with Senator Bennet to permanently protect the Arctic Refuge by designating it as a wilderness. That is enough to sustain a filibuster, and that is precisely why they are circumventing the normal legislative process by including it as a rider on a tax bill.  In reality, drilling turns this pristine wilderness into an industrialized wasteland. The Coastal Plain is the biological heart of the Arctic Refuge, and allowing oil and gas drilling would drive a stake right through the heart of it.  We are currently sending nearly 1 million barrels a day of American crude oil overseas, but Republicans and the their oil industry allies are saying we need to allow drilling in the wildest place left in America so we can export even more oil to China and other foreign nations. It is an abomination. It is a disgrace. Drilling in a wilderness area in order to send oil to China--it is a disgrace. If the Republicans persist in passing this monstrosity of a tax bill and pass this Big Oil polar payout, they are the ones who are going to be left out in the cold in 2018.  If the Republicans want to see what real wilderness looks like, they don't need to travel to the Arctic Refuge, the wilderness is about to come to them. They are about to be sent deep into the political wilderness if they pass this tax scam legislation.  If the Republicans are successful in ramming through the Arctic drilling rider in the dead of night, we will never give up. We will keep fighting because the Arctic Refuge should forever be the home for caribou, not crude; bears, not barrels of oil; sandpipers, not pipelines. We will never stop fighting.  They may win tonight in the dark of night, but this fight is not over. This is a crime against the environment which is being committed here tonight. We do not have to sacrifice this wilderness. We are exporting oil out of our country--exporting it. We don't have to go here. Export more oil, and that is where it is going? It is just wrong.  Just remember that this is all a part of the so-called Republican reconciliation process. Now that we have the final product, that process is being exposed as the giant con game it truly is. The key phrase in reconciliation is ``con.'' It is a con job. The whole thing is nothing more than a masquerade, a Trojan horse in order to get a tax cut for the upper first percentile. It is a con job.  The polling in our country says the American people are not buying it. They are seeing right through it--through all the political noise, all of the incredible distractions, all the red herrings. The American public knows this is a tax break for the wealthiest people in our country and not for the middle class. Republicans are not even trying to hide what they are doing anymore. They are moving ahead with reckless speed to pass this disaster of a bill in the middle of the night, so that is why we will all be back here in a few hours, yet again, voting in the dead of night on a 500-page bill that has no hearings, no amendments, no real debate because that is the only way you can get a tax break for the upper first percentile and the wealthiest corporations in the country while trying to market it as a tax break for the middle class, when they know it is not. They know it, by the way. They know what they are doing.  It is the height of irony that we will be here tonight ramming through legislation before the Senator-elect from the State of Alabama can be seated. Just 8 years ago, Republicans called on Democrats to stop progress on the Affordable Care Act until Senator Scott Brown was sworn in. They said at the time: Stop progress. Don't do anything. We need to wait for Scott Brown to show up. Back then, Democrats listened to those calls, but when Doug Jones gets elected, it is just put your foot to the accelerator, move as fast as you can, no hearings, no anything, and Alabama will not be represented with their new Senator out here. Back then, Democrats actually listened to those calls, and today our concerns are completely ignored by the Republicans, all so they can continue playing their con game on the American people.  The American people are waking up to the fact that they have been sold a bill of goods. They are seeing that this plan is simply a Trojan horse of giveaways to the wealthy corporations and Republican political donors.  What are some of those giveaways? Front and center is the massive cut in tax rates for megacorporations. We know this will not create jobs or trickle down to their employees because we have tried it before. In 2004, we gave a massive tax holiday for huge corporations on the money they held overseas, but the 15 companies that benefited the most from those giveaways cut more than 20,000 jobs and decreased their research spending.  Mark Twain said: ``History doesn't repeat itself, but it does tend to rhyme.'' This tends to rhyme. The tax cuts in this bill are even more egregious. Corporate tax cuts flow to CEOs and stockholders. Those stockholders are not all American taxpayers. Foreigners hold 35 percent of U.corporate stock. That means the Republican tax bill is a giveaway of $48 billion to foreigners in 2019 alone.  Think about this. The Republicans can find $48 billion to give away to foreign shareholders but in the same bill raise taxes on millions of middle-class[[Page S8097]]families. By 2027, this bill will raise taxes on over 53 percent of American households. At the same time, a full 83 percent of the tax cuts will flow to the top 1 percent of So the more the American people see what is in this bill, the more they realize they will have to foot the bill, and the American people are saying ``No way.''  New polls today show that over half of the American public opposes this bill; two-thirds of the people recognize that the bill will benefit the wealthy over the middle class; and, according to the polls, the only thing more unpopular than this tax plan is President Trump himself. But the Republicans will push ahead anyway since this is all part of the bigger con game. When these tax giveaways pass, the deficit will explode by over $2 trillion.  Republicans aren't even waiting for those deficits to become reality before using them as an excuse to move to the next phase of the con game. They are already using future deficits to justify a brutal, vicious cut to programs for the poorest, for the sickest, for the neediest people in our country. Earlier this month, Speaker Ryan said, ``We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.'' We know exactly what Republicans mean when they talk about entitlement reform. They mean taking a machete to the programs that working and middle-class families in America rely upon. Republicans want nothing more than an excuse to slash Medicare and make it harder for Grandma to buy her medicine. They want the ability to gut Medicaid because, in their opinion, healthcare is only a right for the wealthy. They want to cover their historical enmity toward Social Security so that they can steal benefits from every American who has paid into that system, and they are doing this because the modern Republican Party has a sacred obligation to their donors--to the Koch brothers, to the massive corporations that help fund their campaigns. They promised them tax breaks, and it will be average working families who will end up footing the bill. When the bill becomes due, the American people will not forget who sent it to them.  Here we are at the end of the year. We have truly important issues to address. We need to fund healthcare for 9 million children, ensure that community health centers can keep the lights on, secure the dreams of 800,000 young Dreamers, and combat the crises that American communities face from opioids and natural disasters. Sadly, we are doing none of those things. Instead, we are looting America's middle class to give away massive amounts of money to the rich, which will then create deficits, which will then have them going after Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--Grandma and Grandpa, who built this country. That has always been their plan. They have an ancient animosity toward all of these programs, and now they believe they can leave them as debt-soaked relics of what they are today by creating this huge debt in this tax bill and then turning on the very programs for the very people who made this country what it is today.  I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. It will go down in history as one of the worst single pieces of legislation ever to be considered by the U.

Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids.  Senator Brown represents Ohio; I represent The fentanyl epidemic has a bull's-eye on Ohio and a bull's-eye on The deaths from fentanyl are skyrocketing. In 2016, upwards of 70 to 75 percent of all of the opioid deaths in Massachusetts were because of fentanyl. Fentanyl was found in the blood system of those people who died. Last year, 2,000 people in Massachusetts died of overdoses. Three-quarters of them had fentanyl. If the epidemic had been hitting the rest of the country at the same rate that it has been hitting Massachusetts, last year 75,000 people would have died with fentanyl in their blood systems.  Last night, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released shocking new numbers on drug overdose deaths in the United These numbers show the spike in deaths caused by fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.  Here are the new numbers nationwide. More than 42,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose last year. That is a 27-percent increase over the number of Americans who died from an opioid overdose in 2015. It went up 27 percent from 2015 to 2016.

The number is a much higher percentage in  Fentanyl is overrunning our communities, laying waste to them. There is no easy solution, but we know that we must staunch the flow of this drug before we lose an entire generation to this terrible killer. That is why I introduced legislation with Senator Brown and Senator Rubio to help those on the frontlines stop this deadly drug from ever getting into our communities. The bill is called the INTERDICT It provides badly needed high-tech equipment and other scientific resources to U.Customs and Border Protection to catch illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United States, mainly from China and  When U.Customs and Border Protection detects a suspicious package or substance, it has had very good success identifying an illicit drug like fentanyl with the help of high-tech, hand-held chemical screening devices. Using these devices, Customs and Border Protection agents can detect, identify, and seize illicit drugs like fentanyl on the spot. Those rapid results provide vital information for border agents to continue their investigation and, if appropriate, proceed with seizure and arrest.  What is more, these devices and their ability to immediately identify fentanyl and other hazardous illicit substances also serve to safeguard the health and well-being of Customs and Border Protection agents so they are not accidentally exposed to fentanyl. That is what these devices help to make possible.  So we introduced the INTERDICT Act with Sherrod Brown of Ohio; Senator Capito, the Presiding Officer in the Senate today; Senator Rubio; and we have added another 16 Senators from both sides of the aisle.

1321,topic-id,550,"Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding.  Can I just list the names of the organizations that support this bill so the police can interdict, stop the fentanyl from coming into our country?  It is the National Fraternal Order of Police, it is the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, it is the National Border Control Council, it is the Police Assisted Recovery Initiative, it is the National Sheriffs' Association, the National Tactical Officers Association, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Narcotics Officers' Associations' Coalition, the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the American Legion, the International Union of Police Associations, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and the Massachusetts Coalition of So it is pretty much every single law enforcement agency at all levels in the country saying: Please give us this tool now so we can detect this incredible killer in our country.  Three former Commissioners of U.Customs and Border Protection, appointed by both Democratic and Republican Presidents, support the INTERDICT President Trump's nominee to head the agency, Kevin McAleenan, testified that he supports getting more of these high-tech scanners into the hands of Customs and Border  Despite working for months with Senate leadership to try and secure authorization for funding, we just can't seem to get this over the finish line so that in the new year they have these devices. The way it works is, you just put the device up next to a package, and it will tell you if it has got fentanyl or not. Right now, many law enforcement agencies will not even allow one of their police dogs to sniff for fentanyl because it will kill the police dog. That is how dangerous fentanyl is, and that is why these electronic devices are so important. It ensures that we have minimized the exposure of our officers to these substances and, at the same time, dramatically increase the likelihood that we are going to identify the fentanyl in a package and, as a result, deter these people from China or from Mexico who bring it into our country and are killing us by the thousands.  At 42,000 deaths last year, it is now approximating the total number of deaths in the war in Vietnam throughout its entire history. That is just 1 year, 42,000 people--1 year. That is a terrorist attack of a magnitude on our own streets that is unimaginable.  With these devices, we don't completely solve the problem, but we put more weapons in the hands of our law enforcement officials, detection devices that can minimize the likelihood that these terrible people from China, from Mexico, principally, can bring this stuff into our country.  So this is a huge issue. It goes right to the heart of the seriousness of dealing with this issue. My only hope is, we have an ability to be able to move this thing forward in a way that lets the American people say: We understand the issues you want us to work on, and the opioid crisis is at the top of the list. It is indiscriminate. It affects potentially every family. No one is immune to addiction. No family is immune from addiction. It could hit any family at any time, and fentanyl is the ultimate killer.

35,topic-id,861,"Madam President, back in 2007 and 2008, a group of us who had never run for Congress or for the Senate jumped into campaigns against incumbent Members of this body, hoping to fight for a vision of government of, by, and for the people. Al Franken was one of those individuals taking on an incumbent, Republican Norm Coleman, and as I heard Senator Franken on the campaign trail, I heard what we heard today in his speech: a willingness to fight for that vision so embodied in our Constitution of government that would provide a foundation for families to thrive, that would lift everyone up; not a government of, by, and for the privileged; not a government of, by, and for the powerful.  It takes a lot of guts to throw yourself into the political world, but because he did and because he won that campaign, we were able to advance a number of policies.  I shared with Al the experience not only of running against an incumbent Republican but not having results on election night. However, I only had to wait 2 days; I didn't have to wait the many months that he did to come and be part of this body.  Because he came, we were able to pass the Affordable Care My home State of Oregon went from 15 percent uninsured to 5 percent uninsured. Hundreds of thousands of people gained access to healthcare through the expansion of Medicaid and through the healthcare exchange made affordable by the tax credits provided by that bill. In that bill, we were able to provide free preventive healthcare practices. We all know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and we embodied that in the healthcare bill. In that bill, we fought for folks to be able to stay on their parents' policies until age 26. In that bill, we fought to say that if someone had a preexisting condition, they wouldn't have to pay any more than anyone else would, creating healthcare opportunities for millions of people who thought they would never have a chance to have an insurance policy again.  Al Franken threw himself into public life, and he made that happen not just for the folks back home in Minnesota but for people across this entire  Another such battle was the Dodd-Frank battle, and again I doubt we would have been able to win that battle without his coming to share in that effort. I think about the fact that we had seen so many millions of families devastated by predatory mortgages with exploding interest rates--interest rates that, upon presentation, started at 3 percent or 4 percent but 2 years later would jump to 9 or 10 percent, and a family would end up in foreclosure. The fact is we had Wall Street writing securities based on those mortgages, which then disintegrated in 2007, 2008 and caused people not to just lose their homes but to also lose their jobs, to lose their retirement, and to be incredibly devastated and see their whole lifetime's work to become financially stable evaporate, destroyed, exploded. That CFPB portion, or Consumer Financial Protection Bureau portion, has given us ongoing efforts to take on predatory mortgages and that enables financial instruments to be a foundation for families to thrive and to have home ownership be the dream of home ownership and not the nightmare of home ownership. This, again, is an example of a bill passed because Al Franken threw himself into that battle, and there are many more on this list.  I was particularly appreciative of his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Senator Kennedy, as he was in declining health, had asked me to take on and carry the torch for that bill, which was a huge honor to me as an incoming freshman. I felt he was on my shoulder every day saying: Why haven't you gotten it done yet? In 2013, we finally got it on the floor. I had been pushing hard for leadership to get it on the floor, and we got it on the floor. I thought: What if we lose this bill fighting for equality and to end discrimination in employment? But because Al was here helping in that fight, we won that bill. We did not win it in the House because the House didn't put it on the floor of the So it is unfinished business--fighting for equality of opportunity, that vision in our  As we heard today, as we heard Al in his campaign in 2008, as we heard Al on the floor today, and we have heard of this fight for a country of, by, and for the people, I know that we are going to hear his voice in that fight for many years to come.  I thank Senator Franken for being willing to put himself in the public world, for being willing to fight here on the floor of the Senate for bill after bill after bill that made life better for Americans and for the many battles he will be in in the years to come. Thank you.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

562,topic-id,1016,"Mr.President, one thing is for sure, this is not the people's business. This is the business of the powerful and privileged. Well, this is really a bank heist. How big is this bank heist? Well, it is about $3 trillion being delivered to the very richest Let's add it up. Changing the tax brackets for those who earn more than $200,000, $673 billion; changing the individual alternative minimum tax which only affects the very wealthy, $637 billion; changing the estate tax, $83 billion; changing the corporate tax rate, most of which goes to the advantage of the wealthiest Americans, $1.35 trillion; changing the corporate AMT, $40 billion; and the passthrough legislation that favors the wealthiest LLCs, $414 billion. Add it all up, and it is well over $3 trillion. There it is--$3 trillion. It is $3 trillion for the very richest  Is that the middle-class tax cut? Think about how much this is per person here in the United States of About $8,000 per person in America is being taxed so they can give $3 trillion to the very richest Is that a fair, square deal?  What if we were to spend $3 trillion on the middle class? What if we were to do that? What if we were to invest a trillion dollars of it in infrastructure? It creates a lot of jobs today, and it creates the foundation for a lot of jobs tomorrow and the year after.  What if we were to spend a trillion dollars on healthcare? We could go a long way in terms of greatly amplifying the success and quality of the work from our community health clinics--making sure, basically, that healthcare is a fundamental, affordable right for every We can do a lot on healthcare with a trillion dollars.  What could we do, I ask my Republican friends, with $1 trillion in education? How about spending $500 billion to strengthen our K-12 system and another $500 billion to strengthen and to make college affordable for every single American?  This $3 trillion this bill gives to the richest Americans is the biggest bank heist not just in American history but in the history of the world, happening here tonight and brought to us by the powerful and the privileged.  This is absolutely unacceptable. While the rich gloat over all the gold they are piling up--3 trillion dollars' worth--middle-class Americans get coal in their stocking. This tax scam so favors the wealthy that 83 percent of the benefits goes to the richest 1 percent. Is that the middle-class bill? I don't think so.  This bill sends jobs overseas, hurting middle-class Americans.[[Page S8137]]  This bill increases our national deficit and our national debt, making it much harder to have programs that provide a foundation for families to thrive.  This bill destroys healthcare for 13 million Analyst after analyst says it will also raise insurance premiums for everyone else who buys healthcare. Wow, talk about clobbering the middle class by destroying healthcare for 13 million people and raising the premiums on healthcare for everyone else buying insurance.  So over here, we have the pile of gold--$3 trillion for the richest Americans--and over here, we have the loss of jobs shipped overseas. We have the increased price of healthcare. We have 13 million American people losing their healthcare.  Then we have the second phase of the Republican plan, which was announced by the Speaker of the House last week. This week we pass $3 trillion for the wealthiest Americans, but what do we do after that? We go after Medicaid, Medicare, and Social That is the plan we heard from the Speaker of the  This is a diabolical bill. This is an abomination in a government of, by, and for the people.  How does it come to pass that we even have this bill under consideration? I will tell you how. It is a cycle of campaign corruption. Megabillionaires fund the campaigns for the Senate and then have people come in here to pass this bank heist for the billionaires. That is the cycle--Citizens United allowing unlimited funds invested by third-party campaigns. Corruption in campaigns produced this tax scam, this bank heist, this abomination against the people of the United States of  Now, Oregon has about 1 percent of the population in the United So what would be their share if we would, instead, invest that $3 trillion in infrastructure, healthcare, and education? For Oregon, that would be $30 billion. That is 30,000 $1 million grants to invest in infrastructure that is needed all over our State, to invest in more teachers all over our State, and to invest in lower cost tuition so every child can go to a public university without debt.  But that is not what we have tonight--no. My friend across the aisle says that we are going to wave the magic wand and we are going to give all this money--all of this gold, all this $3 trillion--to the richest Americans, and jobs are going to automatically appear. But it has been analyzed by the experts. They say this barely increases the growth of the economy--just a smidgeon, almost immeasurable.  Then, there are these countereffects. You have the challenge that this bill will create a lot of money for companies that are going to buy machines to replace people who work--accelerating the automation in America that destroys jobs. This bill is going to send jobs overseas, destroying the foundation for success for millions of American families. This money is going to be used for stock buybacks and dividends, enhancing the wealth of the already wealthy. That is why the experts say this is not going to create a phenomenal growth in our economy, a phenomenal number of jobs.  I would like to see us fight for middle-class Americans, fight for infrastructure and jobs, fight for healthcare, and fight for education. These are the foundations for thriving families, but that is not what we have tonight, and that is why anyone who believes in government of, by, and for the people should defeat this bill.

339,topic-id,201,"Mr.Speaker, today is an exciting day for the people of With the passage of President Trump's tax plan, working Hoosiers will see more jobs, bigger paychecks, and a fairer, simpler Tax  The scare tactics of my Democratic colleagues come from a tired playbook written decades ago. It is old-style[[Page H10257]]class warfare politics and tired arguments that are just not true.  The proof is in the paycheck. The truth is, an average Indiana family will see tax cuts of between $1,000 and $2,000 under this plan.  Let me say that again. Despite the rhetoric, working families will see a tax cut of between $1,000 and $2,000 under today's tax plan. Child tax credits will double to $2,000 per child. The standard Federal deduction will double, too.  We get rid of the unpopular and unfair Obama individual mandate tax. Now, Hoosiers will not be taxed depending on their healthcare decisions.  Job creators will see tax cuts, too, making America's small businesses and big businesses competitive in the global economy and better able to create good-paying jobs.  All of this is good news for Indiana's working families. With today's tax cut, help is on the way. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

1026,topic-id,349,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to set the record straight on tax reform.  Opponents to this plan would have Members believe that tax reform is only a benefit for the wealthy or, hearing them today, a plot by the Trump family. That is simply partisan rhetoric.  I have long said I would only vote for tax reform that helps families living paycheck to paycheck--families like the one I grew up in. My dad worked on the line at General Motors, and my mom worked for the Salvation More money in their pockets from their paycheck every week would have made a huge difference. They worked hard to support their family and raise seven children. That little bit of money would have made a difference. Undoubtedly, now, it will make a difference for the American people.  That is exactly what this plan does. It puts meaningful money back in the pockets of working families. A typical family is projected to save over $2,000 a year. That may not sound like much to some on the other side of the aisle, but, where I grew up, that is huge.  For 57 percent of Americans who don't have enough money to cover a $500 emergency, that money matters. For businesses, it means investments, hiring, and better wages. I have talked to business owners across my district, and they have had the same message: cuts taxes so they can increase wages and hiring.  Vic, a restaurant owner in my district, talked to me about tax cuts that would help his business. Vic said: We pay our taxes first, we pay our people second, we pay our bills third, and then if there's anything left over, we get paid.  Our Tax Code shouldn't be a challenge or impediment for business owners like  Currently, Americans pay more in taxes than they pay for food and clothing. It is time to fix this. This tax plan does that. This tax plan will help families and businesses across my district and across America, which is why I proudly support it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

516,topic-id,1895,"Mr.President, I was proud to be a conferee for H.1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and I am pleased to join many of my colleagues in strong support of the conference report for it.  I think, really, the title says it all. This bill will deliver tax cuts and new jobs for hard-working I think it will be good for our economy, it will be good for jobs and for growth, and it will be good for families and our businesses.  As a starting point, we have tax reform--a huge and a complicated undertaking that really happens once in a generation around here. It has been 31 years since we have successfully reformed the Tax I think we would all say it is long overdue.  This bill reduces taxes in every income bracket, letting Americans keep more of their money. It doubles the standard deduction to put even more money back in the pockets of hard-working It doubles the child tax credit, which is so important, making more of it refundable to help parents and our families. It helps our small businesses. In the State of Alaska, about 99.6 percent of the businesses in Alaska are small businesses, and it allows owners to do even more by being able to deduct 20 percent of their business income from their taxes. It also cuts our corporate rate, currently one of the highest in the world. We all recognize this is a move that is long overdue and one that will make us more competitive, help bring jobs back to this country, and increase investments in  I support tax reform, and I am also very proud to be the lead author of the second title, the energy title, in this bill, which I believe contains the single most important step that we can take to strengthen our long-term energy security and create new wealth--creating new wealth--rather than moving things around.  This has been long fight for us. It has been a fight that has been going on for about 38 years, give or take. It has been a multigenerational fight for some of us. What we are doing is authorizing a program for responsible energy development in Alaska's nonwilderness 1002 area. This is an area Congress specifically set aside for its evaluation for its potential for oil and gas.  I have put a lot of charts about Alaska up, but here is Alaska laid over the United States of America, just to kind of put in context what we are talking about here with the 1002 area. The area of ANWR itself is an area of about 19.5 million acres. It is the combined size of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New Hampshire, in this area, and in this portion of the State of Contained within ANWR is additional wilderness acreage. There are about 7 million acres of wilderness contained in the ANWR area.  I also want to remind colleagues who say we need to keep this 1002 area in a wilderness status--let me tell my colleagues, the 1002 was never in wilderness, is not in wilderness, and that is not what we are talking about here.  We have 48 wilderness areas in the State of Alaska, with a total of about 56.6 million acres of designated wilderness in the State, but the 1002 is not wilderness. This is what we are talking about opening up for oil and gas exploration.  This is an area--this small area up here--that contains an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil. We know we can produce it safely. We know we are going to need this oil in the years ahead.  Now, some of my colleagues have suggested that somehow or other we don't need any more oil; that we are exporting oil now. Well, the reality is that world oil demand is rising; it is not falling. We need to bring more supply online, and we need to open up our most prospective areas. So, again,[[Page S8102]]when we have a small area that has enormous potential, why would we continue to deny that opportunity?  The International Energy Agency believes--and they stated it this year: ``Global oil supply could struggle to keep pace with demand after 2020, risking a sharp increase in prices unless new projects are approved soon.''  So to suggest that somehow, just because we are exporting oil, we no longer need to produce it, just doesn't make sense. Exports are making our markets more efficient, but they don't mean we are suddenly more energy independent or permanently energy secure. Making sure we are doing more where we have high prospects makes sense.  Our energy title also includes a bipartisan proposal from Senators Cassidy, Strange, and King that will increase revenue sharing for the gulf coast for priorities like coastal restoration and hurricane protection. Overall, the bill--our title--is projected to raise nearly $1.1 billion over the next 10 years. Once production begins in the 1002 area, we will likely raise tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars for the Federal Again, this is new wealth and new prosperity at a time when our Nation needs both.  Those are not the only benefits this energy title will bring. We are also talking about jobs--creating thousands of jobs--in Alaska and around the country; jobs that pay high wages, put food on the table, and put the kids through college.  We are in a tough place right now in We have the highest unemployment in the country. I appreciated the fact that my colleague from Washington talked about jobs and, in fact, noted that in the ties that bind the State of Alaska and the State of Washington, we do have a lot when it comes to sharing of jobs. I will remind my colleagues that when it comes to jobs, it is an estimated 12,000 Puget Sound jobs and $780 million in labor earnings that are connected with refining Alaska oil. So our jobs--our resource benefits not just us in Alaska but those around the country as well.  What we are able to do by accessing this 1002 area also will help us keep energy affordable, effectively providing families and businesses with an energy tax cut. That, too, is important in context with this tax bill.  We also protect national security by reducing foreign oil dependency, especially in west coast Ironically, California and Washington State, as they see less oil coming from Alaska, as our throughput is declining, what is happening is that, in order to keep their refineries going and their jobs continuing, they are having to import oil. Where is California getting more of their oil from? From the Middle Tell me how that makes any sense.  I appreciate that colleagues come to the floor with a passion about our State, but know that as Alaskans and as an Alaskan who is the author of this title, none of what we are doing in this effort to open the 1002 area will come at the expense of our environment or the local people. Some of the local people are here in Washington to watch the vote today. Hearing the voices of those who live there--there is a town, there is a village, there are people, there is a school, there is an airport in the 1002 area--a town, residents, community. This is not an area that is untouched, but it is an area we care about. We care about the people, we care about the land, and we care about the wildlife, but we know how to produce energy while protecting our environment. We have been doing it for decades, and we will continue to do it going into the future.  Thanks to new technologies, the footprint of our development up north is smaller than ever before. The amount of land that development pads occupy now on our North Slope is now 80 percent smaller than in the 1970s when we first began operation in Prudhoe Bay--80 percent smaller. At the same time, the subsurface reach from those smaller pads is going to be more than 4,000 percent larger than where we were in the 1970s--more than 4,000 percent.  What we are able to do is access more resources underground directionally in an area of 125 square miles. What the technology allows us to do is almost too hard for people to believe, and so they continue the same tired rhetoric we have heard for years. The fact is, we need less land to produce more energy than ever before.  We are going to take care of our land. We are going to take care of the people who live on our North We are going to take care of the environment, and we will protect the wildlife on the Coastal The Central Arctic herd of caribou increased sevenfold in the years since we have been producing in Prudhoe That is the Alaskan way. That is what we do there. That is why we have written our language to be fully protective, and that is why we do not waive any environmental review process or consultation requirements with Alaskan Natives in any way. In fact, the only thing that we limit here in this bill is surface development. In this area of the 1002, in this 1.5 million acres, this provision, title II, says that 2,000 surface acres will be open--one ten-thousandth of all of That is all we are seeking to do, and we will do it with care and concern for the environment.  I have listened to colleagues say that we are destroying the Refuge, that we will turn it into an industrialized wasteland. I am offended, I am horrified, and it is wrong. It is wrong for those from the outside looking in, who have taken a nice trip into an area and said: This must be protected. Your jobs don't matter.  That resource that we rely on for jobs in my State doesn't matter; we will get it from somewhere else. Well, where are you going to get it from? Why not work with people who are going to care for the land, care for the people, care for the wildlife, do it with a level of commitment to a resource and to a cause that is strong and sound?  For those who come in and say they know best and their idea is to just lock it up, that is not right. For 40 years, Alaskans have stood up and said: That is not right.  We will continue in our effort to demonstrate to the rest of the country and the rest of the world how we are able to operate, how we are able to be responsible stewards of the environment, to produce jobs, to help Alaskan people, to help the country, and to help our allies. This is what we are asking for.  As I close my comments, I recognize that tomorrow is coming up on the shortest day. We have had some very short days in It is pretty dark there right now. I was home over the weekend. With the passage of this bill and the long-awaited opportunity to access our resources in the 1002 area for the benefit of Alaskans and for the benefit of our country, the days ahead look brighter for all of us.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

812,topic-id,656,"Mr.President, Suellyn Wright Novak of Eagle River, AK, retired from the Air Force with the rank of colonel in 2003 after a distinguished 32-year career in the biomedical field. She was commander of three different medical squadron, a clinical laboratory officer, and leader of the Air Force Blood Program worldwide. She returned home to begin a second career as a professional volunteer. At one time, she held 26 different volunteer positions.  Suellyn's work with the Eagle River Presbyterian Church, the Chugiak/Eagle River Chamber of Commerce, and the American Heart Association cannot go unmentioned, nor can we ignore her work as a service officer for VFW Post 9785 or the Alaska State Veterans Advisory Council, but Suellyn is best known for her work as the president and executive director of the Alaska Veterans  Suellyn officially retired from this second career in October, handing the reins over to Mike In early 2018, the Alaska Veterans Museum will host an event to commemorate her service in I want to take a few moments to express my appreciation to Suellyn for her service to our Nation and to those who have served it.  Alaska takes great pride in its standing as the State which hosts more veterans per capita than any other. About 70,000 veterans call Alaska home. It is fitting that Alaska host a museum honoring the service and sacrifice of our veterans. Suellyn is best known for taking the Alaska Veterans Museum from idea to reality. In 2005 she began collecting oral histories of veterans from all conflicts. She took on additional roles as researcher, display designer, fundraiser, grant writer, and membership chair. The museum was virtual at that point. It organized exhibits for the Anchorage Museum, the Alaska Native Heritage Center, and the Anchorage libraries, but didn't have a space of its own. It was Suellyn's vision to move the museum from a virtual space to a physical space in downtown She raised funds and worked with realtors to secure a prime affordable location. And once that location was secured, Suellyn recruited a handpicked team to get the museum open in just 11 days. The Alaska Veterans Museum opened on April 17, 2011.  Suellyn staffed the museum during nearly all the hours it was open--except when she might be in an elementary school classroom presenting as a Continental soldier during the American Revolution or speaking about how those who fought for America's independence survived the battle or when she was coordinating ``Fan Mail'' to the troops. The Alaska Veterans Museum, I am told, sends more fan mail to troops than any other small organization in the United Suellyn's impact in recognizing and supporting our veterans and Active-Duty servicemembers is remarkable.  One of the most remarkable examples of Suellyn's determination involves her efforts to place a memorial in the village of Attu in memory of those who lost their lives during the Forgotten Battle of World War Suellyn and the museum raised the necessary funds to create the replacement memorial but had no way of transporting it all the way out to Attu is the furthest of the U.Aleutian Islands, nearly 1,500 air miles from  Fortunately, the U.Coast Guard offered a flight for me to tour their Loran Station on I recognized the opportunity to offer assistance to Suellyn and the museum. I can proudly claim that the new memorial was erected at the site where the former residents of Attu lived. Our mission was a success with the collaborative efforts of Suellyn, the museum, and the Coast  I could go on and on about all that Suellyn does, but the list would undoubtedly be incomplete. I think my colleagues have by now gotten the idea that Suellyn is our ``Energizer Bunny'' extraordinaire. So on behalf of a very grateful Senate, I express appreciation to Suellyn for both of her careers: an exceptional Air Force career followed by a career of outstanding volunteer service to our community.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8252-2.txt,1694,DISASTER RELIEF,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

911,topic-id,2150,"Madam President, last night--I guess, actually, early this morning--was a pretty historic time for us. Our final vote to approve the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a historic moment for America, and it was clearly a historic moment for my State of  For the first time in 31 years, since President Reagan was in office, we passed tax reform that will make our Tax Code work better for American families and businesses.[[Page S8158]]  After 37 long years--yesterday, I said it was 38. I stand corrected. It was 37 years. That is a long time that we have been working to advance the opportunity to open a small portion of the non-wilderness 1002 area in northeast Alaska, up in our North Slope, to responsible energy development.  Many in our State believed this would happen in the early 1980s after Congress specifically set aside the 1002 area for exploration--and it is something we have been fighting for ever since. It is a long time to be working on an issue. It has been decades and, in many instances, generations.  Through this bill, we voted to let Americans keep more of their hard-earned dollars. We voted to make our businesses more competitive on a global scale. We voted to strengthen our Nation's energy security. And we voted to create new jobs, new wealth, and new prosperity for a generation to come.  One thing we know for sure is that legislation like this doesn't happen by accident. It doesn't happen quickly or with the sleight of hand. It happens with a considerable amount of work. So I wish to take a few moments this afternoon to simply say thank you--thank you to those who have worked so hard and for so long to help us reach this point.  I want to start by personally acknowledging our majority leader, Senator He was the first one I went to back in early January to ask about how we might be able to proceed to include the opening of the 1002 area. We discussed avenues and opportunities. He told me he thought we could make it work, and he committed to me that we would work to do just that. He did, and I thank him for his considered effort and his belief in the cause.  I also need to thank and recognize our Budget Committee chairman, Senator He was the second person I went to early this year. He agreed to provide an instruction in the reconciliation bill and allow us to run with this opportunity. He, too, recognized the significance of this as a policy initiative and how it dovetailed with what he was seeking to achieve through the Budget  The work of many within the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is significant, and I thank them for their efforts. An excellent group of Senators in that committee worked with me to craft our energy title and to report it out of the committee. We reported it on a bipartisan basis--not as strong as I would have liked, but we did receive support from our colleague Senator Manchin, from West Again, it was a solid effort by the committee, and it was a good and important part of the process.  Along similar lines, I would like to thank all of the Members of this Chamber who supported our work here on the Senate floor--first, to protect the instruction and then to protect our good work to meet it.  For some, ANWR has been an issue which they have had an opportunity to weigh in and vote on for many years and thus was not a new matter in which education was needed. For others, it was important to be able to update them, to let them know that many of the issues they may have heard over the years were outdated, that the arguments were stale and needed to be refreshed, thus allowing them to understand what we are doing with new technology. Today, technology is helping us to facilitate development in a way that allows us to access more resources with less of a footprint, with less land, and with less intrusion on the surface, working to ensure that we are not only protecting the wildlife that is there, whether it be caribou or polar bears, but also ensuring that the people who live there in the 1002 region--the people of Kaktovik, the children who are going to school there, those who have called this place home for decades, if not centuries--will have an opportunity there not only for the potential for jobs, but for what the resources will bring to them.  I thank my colleagues for being open to the new reality of what we have been developing in Alaska's North Slope, as we have been seeking to provide resources the country needs, jobs my State and the country need, and truly to help us from an energy security and a national security perspective. So I thank the Members of the  I thank the members of the Finance Committee, led by Chairman Hatch, for their excellent work and for letting us ride shotgun when it came to tax reform. We knew we had to make it to the finish line together, and that is exactly where we are right now.  I thank the President and Secretary Zinke, among others in this administration, who have been working with us, fighting for Alaska, as we have moved forward.  Of course, this wasn't just a Members-led effort. We could not have done it without the men and the women who work for us and whom we work for in many ways but who were at the very core of the effort.  As usual, within the Energy Committee, certainly it is always a team effort. Everyone contributed in a rock-solid way. My team was very ably led by Brian Hughes, supported by Kellie Donnelly, Lucy Murfitt, Chuck Kleeschulte, Patrick McCormick, Annie Hoefler, Brianne Miller, Nicole Daigle, Michelle Lane, Lane Dickson, Isaac Edwards, Chester Carson, Ben Reinke, Suzanne Cunningham, Melissa Enriquez, Sean Solie, John Starkey, Tonya Parish, Robert Ivanauskas, Barbara Repeta, and Diana There were so many on the committee who came together in a host of different ways, some of them working the issue new; others, like Chuck Kleeschulte--27 years working here in the U.Senate and, prior to that, working for the State of If there is anyone who has a collective history and wisdom about the background of ANWR and the battles we have endured, it is Chuck I know that, as he is approaching retirement, he is looking forward to knowing that we have successfully moved this opportunity forward for Alaskans and for the  I also thank those in my personal office who helped not only with ANWR but with the tax provisions as well. My chief of staff, Mike Pawlowski, has done an extraordinary job for me. My assistant, Kristen Daimler-Nothdurft, has done amazing things. Karina Petersen, Garrett Boyle, Madeline Lefton, and Parker Haymans, among many others--you really recognize a team when you reflect on how so many have given in so many different ways.  It is not just within my own office or the Energy Committee; it is those who run the operations here. Specifically, I want to thank Leader McConnell's staff--Sharon Soderstrom, Hazen Marshall, and Terry Van Doren--and especially the outstanding floor staff here, led by Laura I know many of them--certainly Laura and Sharon--have been around for their fair share of the ANWR debates and fights, and this is no new issue for them. I appreciate their help and their support a great deal.  From Budget, I thank Betsy McDonnell, Eric Ueland, Paul Vinovich, and Alison  From Finance, I thank and congratulate Jay Khosla, who has done a terrific job, and Mark I had the added benefit of going to law school with Mark Prater, a brilliant guy then and even more brilliant now. I greatly appreciate all they did on the tax reform bill.  I also want to give a shout-out to Tara Shaw, who is now with Senator Enzi and who has been a good friend and a help to me.  Lastly and certainly not least, I thank all of the Alaskans who have contributed to this effort over the years. We had a group of about two dozen Alaskans who traveled all the way from Alaska's North Slope--some 5,000 miles--to be here last night for this vote. These are men and women who, for decades now, have fought to open up the 1002 area for the opportunities it presents to them and to their families. For them, to see this advance is as significant and as historic as most anything they have seen in a considerable period of time.  Oliver Leavitt is an elder. He is certainly a legend in my time. To have Oliver here last night was extraordinarily significant. Matthew Rexford and Fenton Rexford, who live in Kaktovik--there were four or five different individuals from the village of Kaktovik--again, those who actually reside in the 1002 area. Crawford Patkotak and his wife, Laura, were also with us and also Richard Glenn of They were here not only to[[Page S8159]]be a part of the culmination of this effort, but they are men and women who have been part of this battle for decades, truly decades. The number of trips they have made to Washington, DC, over the years, the doors they have knocked on, and the efforts they have contributed to are considerable.  When I start to name names, I think of Tara Sweeney and the folks who have been there year in and year out, those who have been supportive by traveling here and those who call and those who write.  It is gratifying, it is heartwarming, and it is a reality that one can never say thank you enough for the efforts that you have made over the years. To know that you spoke as Alaskans, your voices have been heard, and that Congress has finally listened is, indeed, gratifying.  Of course, we would not have reached this point without two particular Alaskans--the ones I am proud to serve with here in our delegation. Don Young, the dean of the House and Congressman for all Alaska, has singlehandedly kept this issue alive in the House for a generation. He reminds me that it has been 13 times now that he has passed it out of the To be able to recognize his extraordinary work is, indeed, a pleasure and an honor. And, of course, my friend, my very able partner in the Senate, Senator Dan Sullivan, was an incredible partner in this effort, and I thank him greatly for his work.  I also recognize that it is not just the delegation present who needs to be thanked. As I have said, this has been a decades-long battle. This has been a generational battle. We are standing in the footsteps of those who have preceded us, including my father, Frank Murkowski, who was chairman of the Energy Committee and at a point in time had advanced this, only to see it fail at the very end. And, of course, my dear friend, my mentor, one who helped give me such great guidance over the years was our former Senator, Ted  Yesterday, you may have noticed I was wearing some unusual earrings. When my friend Ted, the former Senator Stevens, had a serious matter in front of him, he wanted the rest of his colleagues to know that, by gosh, he was serious that day, and this was an issue to be taken seriously, and he would don a Hulk tie. It was somewhat legendary around here. I am not one to wear ties, but after finding a nice pair of Hulk earrings, it seemed to me only appropriate to wear them on a day that would acknowledge the work of extraordinary Alaskans who went before me. I think, today, Uncle Ted is smiling and happy, and he is probably wearing his Hulk tie.  This is a big moment for There is a spirit and an optimism that I am taking home right now that I think we haven't seen in years. I think it is worth noting that today is winter solstice. This is the shortest day of the year--today and tomorrow. In Alaska, it is the darkest day of the year. I mentioned yesterday the effort we have seen from the Senate, which, hopefully, we will finalize shortly, is one that will bring a brightness and an energy to the people of For that, I thank my colleagues. I thank the many Alaskans who have supported us in this epic battle, and I thank all those who have helped to make it possible.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

619,topic-id,1472,"Mr.President, when you are the father of a 9-year-old and a 6-year-old during the holiday season, you spend an awful lot of time reading holiday stories, you spend an awful lot of time watching Christmas specials and Christmas movies on TV, and it is wonderful. I love it. I love getting to relive my childhood through the eyes of my kids.  If you remember all of these stories and specials, there is a familiar theme that runs through them, and it is a really nice theme for kids to hear. The basic idea in many of these stories is that Christmas, Hanukkah, the holidays we celebrate today, aren't about pageantry, and they aren't about pomp and circumstance or the presents or material things; it is really about celebrating each other. It is about sort of understanding what is important to us and who is important to us and using this little break we get at the end of the year to spend time with each other.  My youngest's favorite of all of these stories and specials is the iconic Doctor Seuss poem about the It ends like this:     He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming! It came!     Somehow or another it came just the same!     And the Grinch, with his Grinch-feet ice-cold in the snow,            stood puzzling and puzzling: ``How could it be so?''     ``It came without ribbons! It came without tags!''     ``It came without packages, boxes or bags!''     And he puzzled three hours, 'til his puzzler was sore.     Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before!     ``Maybe Christmas,'' he thought, ``doesn't come from a            store.''     ``Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more!''  Maybe it is the most famous of all of the passages from Christmas stories explaining that premise; that this time of the year is a time in which we think about each other.  I hope we do that in the Senate and in the House over the coming days before we wrap up for the year because as we approach the Christmas season and as creatures of good fortune--those of us who get to serve in the U.Senate--as we begin to prepare to go home and share time with our family and our loved ones, we need to think about the crisis many families are in today and will be in over the holiday season if we don't choose to do some basic things here, attached to our responsibility as U. We need to think about the position we are going to put people in because of our inability to act and to pass legislation that, prior to this holiday season, seemed relatively noncontroversial.  Christmas is about celebrating our love for one another. If we really do believe in brotherhood--if we really do believe that our role as U.Senators is to try to lift people up around us--then we need to understand that the debates around health center funding or the Children's Health Insurance Program or the status of children who were brought here by their parents at a very young age from another country aren't about politics. They are not about scoring political points. They are about people and what we will do to people as we head into the holiday season.  Adrianna Bigard is a single mom from Hamden, For her, the CHIP program has been a lifesaver. She is doing everything we would ask a young woman to do. She received her master's degree in public relations from Quinnipiac She is now working as a public relations specialist. She has a young son--a 6-year-old, Carter--and she is a single mom. She gets a paycheck every week, but it goes out as quickly as it comes in. She is one of the millions of Americans who are working, who are playing by the rules but are living paycheck to paycheck.  She gets insurance through her employer, but when she was told how much it would cost to add her son to her coverage, she simply could not afford it. She literally did not have the money in her monthly paycheck to be able to pay for gas and for groceries, for rent and for coverage for her son. So the CHIP program was a lifesaver for her.  Her son now is enrolled in what we call HUSKY B in Connecticut, which is the name we use for our CHIP program. Without it, she says, things would dramatically change. If HUSKY goes away--if CHIP goes away--once all benefits, taxes, et cetera, are paid, I will not have enough money left in my paycheck to pay my rent.  That is what is consuming her this holiday season.  She just got a notice from the State of Connecticut telling her that on January 31, her son Carter will lose healthcare insurance, meaning on January 31, Adrianna will not have enough money to pay for her rent or she will have to leave her son uninsured. That will be her choice come January 31. That is a pretty terrible, awful way for her to spend her holiday season.  In northeastern Connecticut, I heard from a woman who works in homelessness, and she was telling an inspiring story of a gentleman who had been living the last 3 months in a tent and suffering deeply from severe joint pain, fevers, and weakness, and had no access to healthcare until he was connected with the local community health center. That local community health center was able to get him in for care to stabilize him and potentially save his life. Yet that community health center--it is called Generations, and it serves thousands of people in northeastern Connecticut--will lose 70 percent of its funding next year.[[Page S8081]]  On January 1, many health centers in Connecticut will lose more than half of their funding, and they will shut their doors to thousands and thousands of people like this man who wouldn't receive healthcare but for community health centers.  In rural America, the slashing of community health center funding will be absolutely devastating because sometimes it is these health centers that are the only way for people to get care, particularly mental health care and addiction. Community health center patients are spending this holiday season trying to digest the news that they may be shut out from their psychiatrists. They may no longer be able to see their child's primary care doctor come January 1. A 70-percent cut is not something you can manage with efficiencies; it means an elimination of services.  Faye is from Norwalk, She came to this country when she was 11. She now has DACA status. She, like so many other Dreamers, has done everything we asked. Faye went to school. She got an advanced degree. She is now holding down two jobs--one of them as a radiology scheduler, working in our healthcare system. She is working two jobs because she wants to have access to the American dream of home ownership, and she is saving and saving so that she can buy a house. Now she is faced with being deported to a country that she doesn't recognize. She has been in the United States for 19 years. She lived in Connecticut for 16 years. She is spending her holiday season--as are the other 800,000 DACA recipients in this country--fearing that her life as she knows it is going to end at the beginning of next year.  Christmas, the holiday season, is not about presents. It is not about those Christmas specials. It is about people. It is about recommitting ourselves to this uniquely American notion that we are all in this together and that we are weaker as a whole if individuals who live amongst us are in crisis, especially individuals who have done everything we have asked and have played by the rules. That is Adrianna and Faye--people who are going to have something taken from them and their loved ones and are going to be put into crisis because we will not do our job.  By the end of this week, we have to protect these Dreamers, we have to provide a permanent extension for health center funding, and we have to provide a permanent extension for children's healthcare insurance funding because it is our job and also because it is cruel to send all of these millions of families into the holidays with that kind of anxiety while we all sit around our holiday tables safe and sound.  My kids remind me over and over again about what they learned from these Christmas specials. Christmas isn't about the presents. It is not about the trees. It is not about the decorations. The holidays are about our commitment to one another. We can re-up on that commitment this week by doing the right thing.  I yield the floor.

271,topic-id,1154,"Mr.President, over the years there has been a lot of debate on the Senate floor, from healthcare to tax reform. There is no doubt that some days it feels impossible to get the majority of Republicans onboard with policies that truly help the families we represent. But there is one thing that unites not only a large bipartisan contingent in Congress but also the vast majority of American people, and that is finding a path forward for the estimated 800,000 young men and women whose lives are right now in limbo--800,000 people, including 17,000 men, women, boys, and girls from my home State of Washington who shared their information, paid a large fee, and upheld their end of the bargain, only to have President Trump rip the rug out from under them 3 months ago when he and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the end of the DACA  This Congress may not be able to change the Trump administration's hateful rhetoric or shortsighted policies overnight, but we can and we should pass the Dream Act as soon as possible. That is why we need more Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle ready to roll up their sleeves and get this done. Because every single day that Republican leaders refuse to bring the Dream Act to the floor to a vote, another 122 young people lose their DACA status, they lose their ability to work legally, and they lose their protection from deportation. That means that every day, 122 of our neighbors, students, coworkers, and friends could be forced from the only country they know, despite the promise the Federal Government made to them when they signed up for DACA and despite their immensurable contributions to our schools, our hospitals, our universities, our stores, our farms, our churches, our offices, and so much more. That means small and large businesses are forced to lay off DACA recipients each day--vital employees in whom businesses have invested money to train and support, employees who help our economy and the small businesses in my State grow.  My friends on the other side of the aisle are constantly claiming they want to help our small businesses grow. I listened to weeks of their speeches on this as they tried to justify the tax bill. But instead of a giveaway to the wealthiest 1 percent, one way my friends across the aisle could actually help small businesses is to bring the Dream Act up for a vote.  This morning, I had the great honor of sitting down with Dreamers who traveled all the way here from my State across the Nation to fight for action, young people who had no control over how they came to this country but who have made conscious choices to improve their own lives and make life better for their own community. They are passionate, they are frustrated, and their stories need to be heard.  Here is just one of them. Paul was brought here to this country at the age of 7 to be reunited with his father. Paul excelled in schools in Pasco, WA, not far from where my own dad grew up. Paul and his parents worried that despite Paul's success in K-12, going to college and starting a career might be impossible. But DACA provided him and his family with stability. Paul went to Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA, as a double major in political science and economics, and he now works in our State legislature.  Now, with DACA in question, it is not just Paul who isn't sure what comes next for him but also his younger brother, Jose, who was only 2 years old when he came here, grew up seeing what Paul, his older brother, was able to achieve. He saw that DACA allowed Paul to live without that constant fear. Jose was ready to follow in Paul's footsteps and enroll in the DACA Program so he could pursue his dream of an engineering degree at the University of Now, if Congress doesn't act, we will have one less engineer in this country.  Paul and Jose are great examples of Dreamers who have worked hard. They have aimed high, and they participate in our community and our economy, making our country a better place. This country should be rolling out the welcome mat to our Dreamers, not slamming the door shut on them. And that is why I am here today with my colleagues to echo their fear and frustration on the floor of the Senate and to call on Republican leaders to work with us. Stop letting so many promising young men and women fall off the rolls of this program each and every day. Stop kicking this can down the road. Come together to do what is right for these young people.  Ending the DACA Program is not what our country is all about. It doesn't do anything to fix our immigration system, prepare for our future, or grow our economy. Ending DACA won't heal the divisions we have seen in our communities or make them any easier to fix. And ending the DACA[[Page S8222]]Program certainly doesn't reflect a country of opportunity or promise--something the United States has always aspired to be.  I urge my colleagues here in the Senate and over in the House to think about the communities you represent. Think about the young men and women who are currently studying for finals or caring for our sick or teaching our children or responding to natural disasters or opening businesses in the communities you travel to and live in. Think about the young men and women who hope to serve in our military and defend your freedom some day. Think of the Dreamers who have grown up in our country and whose children are the future of our Think about how much good we could do for these young men and women if my Republican friends brought the same commitment and zeal to this task as they did to their tax bill. Finally, work with Democrats to find a real solution to end this unnecessary uncertainty.  I want to thank Paul and all the other advocates from my State whom I met with in my office this morning and the many thousands of others who are showing up in every way they can to make their voices heard and to call on us here in Congress to act. Martin Luther King once said that justice too long delayed is justice denied, and Dreamers are not asking for anything other than what we have promised to them.  This is an incredibly difficult and uncertain time for so many people, but Dreamers need to know that many of us in Congress and so many across the country have their backs. We will get this done. We have to get this done.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

141,topic-id,485,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, what you are about to hear from our Republican friends for the next 30 minutes is the following: a mixture of theology and science fiction. And then they are going to take you to revisionist history.  This is the most regressive piece of tax legislation that has come from the Ways and Means Committee in the 25 years that I have been a member.  This is not about simplification. When you have a chance to look at the phase-ins and the phaseouts, you will be passed out by the time they get to the expiration dates.  They say it is about simplicity; it was going to be on a postcard. You are going to need to carry a billboard around with you to understand what is in this actual bill.  And here is the best part: when Secretary Mnuchin said, Mr.Speaker, that under no circumstances would people at the top get tax relief. Well, I guess if you are formerly in the 39.6 percent tax bracket, which is summarily lowered to 37 percent, that that is dressed up as no tax relief for people at the very top. But then again, to help out with their argument, then they double the exemption on the estate tax, which will go from $11 million to $22 million.  The people at the bottom in this, they are going to argue: Everybody gets a tax cut. Well, here is where we go to revised history.  In 2001, President Bush said everybody gets a tax cut. The Federal budget of $1.3 trillion included a tax cut for everybody. The people at the bottom got a hundred bucks, and the people at the top got hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is a creative replay of exactly what happened.  And then in 2003, they came back and cut taxes again for people at the very top and blew a huge hole in the Federal deficit, which had been estimated at the time, after Clinton left on January 19, 2001, to project surpluses of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Instead, the Federal deficit mounted to $6.1 trillion.  So here is the simplicity of their proposal today. They are borrowing $2.3 trillion to give a tax cut to people at the very top of American society. That is not in dispute.  In addition to borrowing the money, recall that the Federal Reserve Board said they are projecting, already, three increases next year in interest rates. We don't know what this is going to look like by the time they get done, but this, today, is more about ideology than it is about public policy[[Page H10202]]  Think of it this way as well: This was done in 1 month. In 1 single month, the entire revenue system of the United States is being transformed.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

189,topic-id,687,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  So, in 1 month, we have taken the entire revenue system of the country without one public hearing, without any witness testimony, without the solicitation of one expert. ``We,'' meaning the Republican majority. They have decided to go forward with this reckless plan.  Contrast this with Reagan and O'Neill and Rostenkowski and Packwood in 1986.  When Gephardt and Bradley first offered their bill in 1982 on tax reform, 4 years ensued before the measure came to the floor for passage, and, in that time, 450 witnesses offered testimony. Every expert from every nook and cranny in America was invited to offer their vision of what a better tax system might look like. And those individuals--and I knew them all because I went to the committee when Mr.Rostenkowski was the chairman--saw that as the fabled achievement of their time in a bipartisan manner.  Do you know what else?  Secretary Reagan and Chief of Staff Jim Baker sat through the markups on that tax reform measure.  Now, Secretary Mnuchin, instead, has said, nobody at the top will get a tax cut. And then they cut the rate from 39.6 at the top to 37. Well, nobody at the top will get a tax cut.  We are going to double the exemption on this estate tax so that you might now keep $22 million rather than $11 million, without any formalization of taxation.  My friend, Mr.Brady--and he is my friend--he spoke before about the people's money.[[Page H10211]]  Well, you know what the people's responsibility is?  A million new veterans from Iraq and That is the people's responsibility.  When we talk about responsibility and the people's money, Medicare is the people's responsibility. Social Security is the people's responsibility.  As we celebrate the extension of life expectancy in America, Medicaid today now cares for people with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. That is the people's responsibility.  They have carefully taken theology and wed it to science fiction.  Remember what we heard around here all these years?  Don't worry, tax cuts pay for themselves. That was the offering in 2001, $1.3 trillion worth of tax cuts.  Well, we get to 2003, another $1 trillion worth of tax cuts. By the way, there was time in between for a repatriation holiday, at 5\1/4\, all advertised on the basis of job creation, and layoffs ensued almost the next day.                              {time}  1345  This money is going to be used for stock buybacks and dividends. There will be little investment in this lost opportunity where we should have invested in community colleges and vocational education and apprenticeship programs.  Six million jobs in America go unanswered every single day because of a skills alignment problem and also the horror of what opiate addiction has done across the United It has sidelined 2 million people.  What they are telling us today is the following: We have got tax simplification. What happened to the postcard? As I said earlier, we are going to have to carry around a billboard for tax simplification to figure out what is in it. They keep talking about phase-ins and phaseouts. I am telling you, we will all be passed out by the time they get done with this. This is more complexity.  And wait until people have a chance over the next few weeks to sort through what is in this bill. But here is something you might give some thought to: the bottom quintile, you are going to get $60 a year. The second quintile, you are going to get $380 a year. The top 1 percent, they are going to get $51,000 a year. The top 0.1 percent, they are going to get $193,000 a year, all in the name of middle class tax relief.  As we proceed to the holiday, they are telling us this is their Christmas present. And you know what they are doing with it? It is going to be Christmas hangover debt, and they are putting it on the credit card and adding $2.3 trillion to the Federal debt.  Merry  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1292,topic-id,609,"Mr.Speaker, I am prepared to close on this side, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, so in 1 month we have taken the entire revenue system of the United States without hearing from one expert witness, without having had one public hearing, without using any precedent, and we changed the entire tax system of the country, tilting it clearly to the people at the very top.                              {time}  1230  When they say, as they certainly will, ``We have been doing hearings for 5 years,'' we never had one hearing on this legislation. Not one. We did not seek testimony from one witness in the conference committee. We got to offer opening statements and no amendments. There was no chance for any input on our side.  More than anything else, this is a missed opportunity. This was a missed chance to take a system that we all know to have fallen into competitive failure across the globe. But instead, they decided to go it alone.  So here is the way you want to think of this, for those of you who are following this debate:  They are borrowing $2.3 trillion for the purpose of cutting the top tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and calling that middle class tax relief;  They are doubling the exemption on the estate tax to $22 million and calling that middle class tax relief;  They are eliminating the alternative minimum tax for people at the very top and calling it middle class tax relief.  By the 10th year of this tax proposal, 83 percent of the benefit accrues to the people at the very top of our economic system. That is not in dispute.  They say things like: Well, in 5 years, we are going to correct this measure. Then they talked about the idea that somehow this was about simplicity. When you get into the phase-ins and the phaseouts, you are all going to pass out from trying to read this tax proposal.  The complexity they add to the system is unparalleled, all to secure a tax cut for people at the top.  So here we are in the holiday season, and they are telling us, by the way, that if we just borrow this money, everything is going to be fine.  What did they say about borrowing when Bill Clinton was President? What[[Page H10312]]did they say about borrowing when Barack Obama was President?  They lectured us, day in and day out, in an unyielding manner, even though the economic performance of Clinton and Obama outweighed the two Republican Presidents in between.  So here is the game plan for the holiday season. Do you know what the holiday hangover on your credit card is? People go out and use their credit cards, and they figure out all year how to try to pay for it.  It is going to take you more than 10 years to try to pay for this, all upon the spurious notion that they guarantee economic growth, as the President said, by the way, that is going to exceed 6 percent. That is 6 percent.  They are telling us that the stock market has gone up because of them, even though it has gone up since March of 2009. They are telling us now that this is going to spur unparalleled economic growth, even though the economy has been growing for 88 straight months, all on the credit card for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, this is the worst piece of legislation that has come from the House in the 29 years that I have served here, and I yield back the balance of my time.

154,topic-id,341,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today as a farmer, a rancher, a small-business person, but most importantly as a mom. I rise to support the conference report on H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Mr.Speaker, in my home State of South Dakota, the average household income is $54,000 per year. Out of that $54,000, our families pay double the national average in energy costs just because of where they are located. These are hardworking families and they deserve a break. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act gives them that break.  By lowering tax rates, doubling the standard deduction, and doubling the child tax credit, that family in South Dakota making $54,000 can go from an $833 tax liability to a $781 tax refund. That is a $1,600 difference in after-tax income. That is $1,600 that can go back to benefit their families and their communities, rather than into the greedy hands of those in  On top of that, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is designed to build a healthier economy--an economy in which that family making $54,000 can get a raise, an economy that actually grows jobs.  I am proud to have served on the conference committee that put this report together. I thank Chairman Brady for his leadership throughout the process. We worked literally hundreds of hours putting this together and getting the child tax credit where it is today.  We had vigorous debates about the benefits to rural I am thrilled to be able to go home and tell South Dakota farmers and ranchers they will have new expensing tools, a new small business deduction, and significantly lower individual rates.  While I am disappointed that this bill doesn't completely repeal the death tax, it does provide more relief for producers and small-business owners.  While no plan is perfect in anyone's eyes, this legislation puts more money in the pockets of hardworking taxpayers.

879,topic-id,524,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of 1393, the Jobs for Our Heroes  This bill is a step in the right direction to help the Nation tackle the longstanding commercial driver's shortage--a shortage that I must say I have been working on ever since I have been on this committee and especially since becoming ranking member of the subcommittee--and, of course, at the same time, to support veterans in a successful transition from military to civilian life.  1393 ensures that all qualified medical professionals employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs can perform commercial driver physical examinations for their veteran patients.  The medical professionals that this bill addresses are already eligible to become certified medical examiners. This bill simply allows these individuals to utilize an alternative certification process that is currently being finalized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  The most recently available data shows that, of the 54,000 medical professionals listed in FMCSA's National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners, only 25 medical professionals are employed by the The online training and testing system being developed by FMCSA and the VA should help remedy this situation. These two agencies have done a good job creating an alternative process that will eventually allow more VA doctors to become certified medical examiners, while maintaining the safety and integrity of the certification system.  Although the FAST Act provision authorizing this process referred to physicians, FMCSA should allow VA-employed nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physician assistants, and other qualified medical professionals to participate. This bill ensures that these medical professionals are eligible to use this process.  The bill also ensures that current servicemembers who have military experience operating commercial motor vehicles will be able to more easily obtain a commercial driver's license. Congress included a provision in the FAST Act to allow States to waive the written CDL knowledge test for drivers with military commercial motor vehicle driving experience, but it restricts this waiver to ``former members'' of the military.  There are a significant number of current reservists and members of the National Guard with military commercial motor vehicle experience who could benefit from the waiver. These servicemen and -women receive what the FMCSA describes as ``thorough and comprehensive training,'' including many hours of behind-the-wheel training, something that I have long sought and advocated for as a requirement for civilian drivers. These military drivers already have it.  FMCSA has already taken action to make current servicemembers eligible for the knowledge test waiver on a temporary basis. Last year, FMCSA issued an exemption that allows States to waive the CDL knowledge test for trained military truck drivers, whether they are current members of the military or our veterans; however, FMCSA's temporary exemption expires October 2018.                              {time}  1445  This bill makes permanent the ability of current members of the military to utilize the FAST Act waiver. 1393 is nearly identical to two bills the House previously passed earlier this year, H.2547 and H.2258, both of which passed by votes of 409-0, or unanimously.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children estimates that one of every six runaway children who was reported to them last year had become victims of sex trafficking.  The FMCSA currently prohibits any individual from operating a CMV for life if he or she is convicted of committing specific crimes, including negligent manslaughter and drug trafficking. This bill ensures that the FMCSA also takes action against perpetrators who use their CMV to commit ``severe''--and that is the operative word--forms of sex trafficking, as defined by the Trafficking Victims Protection  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure reported an identical bill, H.3814, to the House by a voice vote in This legislation takes important steps to reduce human trafficking in the transportation sector.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

1222,topic-id,4491,"Mr.Speaker, I come to the floor this evening to commemorate 44 years of home rule. The Home Rule Act was signed by President Richard Nixon on Christmas Eve 44 years ago after the Home Rule Act was passed by a bipartisan vote.  Although it was a Democratic Congress, I think it is worth noting what President Nixon said in his signing speech. I am going to quote a few of his sentences:  ``As a longtime supporter of self-government for the District of Columbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic significance for the citizens of our Nation's I first voted for home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and I have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my terms as President.''  Then he went on to say: ``It is particularly appropriate to assure those persons who live in our Capital City rights the privileges which have long been enjoyed by most of their countrymen.''  The bill enjoyed bipartisan support throughout those congressional deliberations.  Mr.Speaker, surely we can get back to that moment. The District of Columbia is proud and pleased that it has been steeped in American history ever since the site of the Nation's Capital was chosen by George Washington himself.  We are proud to be not only hometown D.C., but the Capital of our country.  So this evening, I want to speak about those two roles and about the role of Congress as we move past December 24, 44 years ago--1973--to today, when D.residents have every reason to believe that our country is ready and overdue for D.statehood itself.  Now, my Republican colleagues understand fully our role as the Nation's They understand it because they welcome their own constituents,[[Page H10408]]the tourists who come here. There are something upwards of almost 20 million. Many of them come to their own congressperson's offices first. But Republicans often dissolve the District's role into their role without making the appropriate distinction.  Now, I appreciate it is not easy to understand a jurisdiction that has a double identity, a hometown identity and a Capital identity.  No, we are not schizophrenic here. So let's discuss this evening what this means. I want to discuss it in part because the inevitable turnover in the Congress means that I should come to the floor and explain this dilemma of our creation periodically.  The first thing we want to do is to avoid the slander that the Framers of our Constitution, the Founders of our country, meant to create a Capital City whose residents were not the equals of residents everywhere in the country, because if that had been the case, you wouldn't have had the Capital in the first place.  The Capital was created from two jurisdictions, Maryland and Virginia, where residents had the right to vote and where they had every single right of American citizens. Those two States were convinced to give the territory that is now the District of Columbia for the Nation's They were not about to give up their votes in the Capital and did not.  Isn't it interesting, during the transition period, the Representatives from Maryland and Virginia continued to vote as they always had and continued to be recognized in their own jurisdictions, all the while, for a 10-year period, when the land was, in fact, being transferred to become what is now the District of Columbia?  The relationship that the District has to the Federal Government, to the Congress of the United States, is an accident of history. It is an anachronistic accident that you would have thought would have been put aside within a few years after the District became the Nation's Capital in 1801.  During the Revolutionary War when the Capital was Philadelphia, Revolutionary War soldiers marched on the Capitol, then in They wanted their pensions, and they wanted funding. When the Founders saw these men marching on their Capitol, confusion reigned. Whom to turn to bring order? Who was going to protect the Capitol? Was it Philadelphia? Was it Pennsylvania? There certainly weren't any Federal police as yet.  So what developed was fear that the Capital might find itself with that dilemma wherever it was located. Of course, that is not the case. The District is protected by 31 Federal police forces, and the D.National Guard and from the Capitol Police to the Park I won't even name them all, there are so many of them.  That is not to mention, and I already have said, of course, the National Guard, and if necessary, the Armed Forces of the United Remember, we are talking about a Federal Government in formation. We can understand that mistake then. What we cannot abide is that mistake being part of the denial to American citizens the same rights that others enjoy.  Protection of the Federal sector is certainly not an issue, or the Federal sector and the Capital itself, more than two centuries later, is not an issue. But what should also not be an issue is that anybody, any resident, any American, would pay taxes and not be represented on this floor and in the  As I stand here this evening, I represent almost 700,000 American citizens who have been put precisely in that position though--and this is a number to be remembered--they are number one per capita--number one--in taxes paid to support the Government of the United  Thus, one of the oldest U.jurisdictions, the District of Columbia, is the most--indeed, the only--unequal jurisdiction, that pays taxes without full representation.  To be sure, I vote in committee, and everybody knows that in the committees is where the primary work is done. But imagine the insult to the people I represent who pay huge taxes--$12,000 per person every year--that matters come up on this floor including matters affecting them, and nobody whom they have voted for can represent them on this floor.  The D.budget was just in that continuing resolution that passed. What is it doing over here? Nobody in Congress looked at the D.budget. Nobody in this body except me would know what to do with the D.budget. But it has to come here to be passed along with the Federal budget.  This is form without substance, Mr.The sole reason that the D.budget comes here is for Members to try to overturn some of D.C.'s laws that they happen to disagree with. But, in a Federal Union, you can pass your laws. I don't like your laws, but you can't do anything about my laws--except if it is the District of  So I think I ought to call the roll on what the District has to abide from Members of this body and the Senate and why, on this 44th anniversary of the Home Rule Act, the District of Columbia is seeking to become the 51st  Let's take guns. Senator Marco Rubio from Florida and Representative Tom Garrett from Virginia have a bill to eliminate all the District's gun laws.                              {time}  1745  It hasn't passed, and most of the bills I will speak of are pending but won't pass, because I have to spend a good deal of my time not only working affirmatively for what the District of Columbia wants, but for keeping bills like this from being passed.  Imagine your Nation's Capital as a city where anybody can have a gun. The most controversial figures in the world come to your Nation's They eat in our restaurants. They stroll in our streets. You sometimes see that police stop traffic to let their cars pass in the street.  We keep this City as safe as we can for ourselves, the 700,000 or so who live here, but also for the millions of people who come to do business or to have leisure or to see their iconic monuments.  Representative Tom Massie from Kentucky has introduced a bill. We were able to keep it from being passed. But imagine this bill that would say that the District of Columbia had to recognize any and every concealed carry permit as long as you had it from another  Some States have very strong concealed carry requirements. Others are very lax. Whatever your State has, just bring it into the District of  Mind you, this body, this Congress, my Republican colleagues have seen to it that you can't bring a gun into this They want to be protected here, but they don't want to protect even their own constituents in the streets of the District of Columbia and in the hotels and restaurants of the District of  Senator Ted Cruz from Texas and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina have introduced a bill that would require the District of Columbia to use its own funds to send children to private schools. All you have to do is come and ask the District for it.  There have been bills on this floor to allow private school vouchers--none of them have ever passed--but here come two Members wanting the District to give our local funds to anybody who wants to go to a private school.  Are you joking?  I am standing here to say that will never pass as long as I have anything to do with it.  Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma and Representative Brad Wenstrup from Ohio have introduced a bill to wipe out the District's death with dignity law.  That bill was actually passed in committee. It didn't get to the floor I think because there are six States that have such laws and two of them are States of our Republican leadership.  This is a controversial bill, but other States have similar laws. It allows people to take their own lives if they follow a very strict protocol.  You don't like it here?  Well, you don't live here. You don't pay taxes here.  President Trump's budget also had this provision.  Again, these are pending, and I am telling you that most of them will not pass. But that is because I have had to fight them tooth and nail to keep them from passing. That is unfair to the District and it is an unfair use of my time.  The Local Budget Autonomy Act that passed by 83 percent of the voters in the District of Columbia to keep our own local funds--we raise almost $8 billion on our own--from coming here for[[Page H10409]]no purpose except to attach amendments to overturn our laws.  The Local Budget Autonomy Act still stands, but Congress has continued to appropriate the budget. ``Appropriate'' means simply pass it without looking at it, when it comes to the District of Congress has not repealed the Local Budget Autonomy I will stand firm to keep that from happening.  We have been able to overcome attempts to overrule a D.law passed to protect private reproductive decisions. The District passed a law that prohibits discrimination within the District--it has nothing to do with the Congress--against any family because of the reproductive health choices of family members.  What am I doing, what is Congress doing, what is the District doing even knowing what your reproductive choice is?  What kind of Congress that believes in local control would so intrusively insert itself into such private matters?  Here is another that was almost laughable. It is a wipes labeling bill.  Representative Andy Harris from Maryland offered--and I thank him for withdrawing it--an amendment at markup. Representative Harris is a member of the Appropriations He would have prohibited the District from using its own funds to keep certain kinds of non-flushable products from being sold in D. Pardon me, but what is Representative Harris doing in our toilets and sewers?  To his credit, he did withdraw his proposed amendment.  It was important to the District because these non-flushable materials stop up sewers. They are our sewers. It is our town. Stay out of our business.  The marijuana matter. First, Congress tried to overturn the District's law that enables possession of a couple of ounces of marijuana. I was able to find a flaw in the proposed language. So the marijuana law still stands.  But Congress keeps D.from commercializing marijuana, as is done in several I think there are eight It keeps D.from regulating marijuana further. That is dangerous. D.ought to be able to regulate marijuana to keep it out of the hands of children, for example.  The interference of this body in the affairs of a local jurisdiction about which it knows nothing is not only outrageous on its face, but yes, it can be dangerous.  The abortion rider or amendment comes annually. It keeps the District from spending its own local funds on abortions for low-income women, although there are upwards of 17 States that use local funds for abortions because they have the autonomy that we seek.  Then, at the last minute this year, there was something that Representative Steve King decided that he had to do.  You see, I think when Members intrude in D.affairs, they must not have enough to do, and I am calling on their constituents to watch them. If you have a Member that does what--and here I am going to indicate this one shortly, but the ones I have just spoken of--if they have a Member that spends his time writing laws about someone else's jurisdiction, they ought to call him to account.  Representative Steve King is from He introduced a bill that would make it a Federal crime to commit violence within the District in connection with a legitimate labor dispute.  Well, maybe it ought to be a crime and there may be some Federal legislation that deals with this matter nationwide, but if not, and it takes place within the District of Columbia and there is a legitimate labor dispute and there is violence, we have got enough cops to take care of that, Representative We do not need this to be a Federal crime in D.alone.  So, after calling the roll on those proposed anti-home rule provisions, let me indicate most of them I have been able to keep off of the D.appropriations bill, the only way they get them passed.  It would be very difficult to get them passed by coming here, get the votes, and then go to the Senate and get the votes. So Members try the easy way: just attach it to the D.appropriations bill that should not be here in the first place.  The budget matter really does gall us. More than 7 in 10 Americans believe that the District of Columbia should control its own budget. That is what this board graph shows. More than anything else, the American people guard their own money. That is why this is so important.  Republicans pose as the champions of local control. In fact, they want the Federal Government out of much of its own Federal business and let the States and the localities handle it.  How could they then abandon their cherished principles when it comes to the Nation's Capital?  Look at these numbers, red and blue on this chart. The numbers show that Democrats and Republicans believe D.should control D.C.'s budget, slightly more in red or Republican  I think numbers like that show that what I am saying about local control and about equality in this body represents the views of the American people. I defy anyone in this body to show differently.  Ultimately, we recognize on this 44th anniversary of the signing of the Home Rule Act that there is no substitute for statehood.  I should mention that Congress experimented with home rule for some time before the Home Rule Act was finally passed in 1973. It gave D.home rule in 1820. Sometimes it would take it back, and then try again. Imagine living in a city where they can take back your local control.  To their credit, after the Civil War, the Republican Congress gave D.home rule and a I am called a Delegate and a They gave D.home rule. That version of home rule is precisely what D.has today. The 1973 Home Rule Act essentially is a replica of the home rule given to D.by the Republican Congress after the Civil  How did we lose it?  The Democrats, controlled by Southerners, took back home rule after Reconstruction and left the District for 100 years struggling to get back the self-government that the Republican Congress had given the District after the Civil  This all started with It ended with the Home Rule Act, Richard Nixon, and bipartisan support in the  There is no substitute for being equal to the You can't have some second class citizens in the United States today, not in 21st century                              {time}  1800  We are seeking the major elements of statehood, even before we get statehood.  For example, the District of Columbia government has actually shut down when the Federal Government is shut down, even though the D.budget is balanced and nobody in the Congress has even looked at it. I have now been able to get a bill every year that allows the District to stay open even if the Congress closes the Federal Government down.  We don't know what will happen over in the Senate even today. We have just passed a continuing resolution--pitiful, though it was--to keep the government open for just a few more weeks. That passed this It has to pass the I can't take the chance that the District will close down for no reason except that the Congress doesn't know how to take care of its own business.  I was finally able to convince the Congress to extricate the District from their fights to keep open, whatever you do to us--and you certainly haven't extricated us altogether because our budget still comes here. But you certainly don't mean to close down a big city like the District of Columbia, its budget, which handles vital matters like the police and keeping order.  I don't mean to say that all Republicans have failed to see this. My hat is off to Representative Darrell Issa, who headed the committee that has jurisdiction over the District of  He called witnesses from the District of Columbia--the mayor, the city council chairman, the chief financial officer--on a routine hearing since, yes, Congress can do that. It rarely does. He heard--even more important, he listened to--their testimony. And when he heard these officials from the District of Columbia testify about the financial condition of the District of Columbia, its reserves, that its growth[[Page H10410]]was among the best in the Nation, Representative Issa--listened.  Maybe you don't think Members of Congress are always listening to your testimony. He was listening to this testimony. Because after hearing that testimony, Representative Issa from California endorsed D.budget autonomy, and he has worked tirelessly with local officials and with me to secure the autonomy of the District's budget so it wouldn't come to  I haven't asked him, but he may not be for statehood, and I doubt that he is. He is a But I think he understands, perhaps better than most of his colleagues, that no one has any business, in a Federal public handling somebody's local budget in this Chamber, and I will be forever grateful.  I want to say my thanks, as well, to former Representative Tom Davis, who resigned from the Congress a few years ago, and was instrumental in helping the District get votes for a vote for D.in the House and in the That bill, the D.Voting Rights Act, actually passed the House and passed the  So why don't we have at least the vote in the House now? The reason is that the National Rifle Association convinced some Members to place an amendment that would have wiped out all of the District's gun laws; and, therefore, the residents of the District of Columbia, after helping me for years to achieve their first vote on this floor, had to leave that vote on the table.  I will be forever grateful to Representative Tom Davis for his help.  Now, what kind of jurisdiction are we talking about? It is very important for us to remember that we are talking about a city with a $14 billion budget, which is larger than the budget of 12 Why shouldn't D.C., therefore, have statehood like those States?  We are talking about a city that has a $2.5 billion surplus. That is the envy of the Ask my colleagues how many of them have a surplus that large.  The per capita income of the people I represent is higher than that of any  Now, that is an interesting figure that should be explained. There are many poor people in the District of Columbia, but there are many high earners, too; and when you put them together, that is one of the reasons you get the highest per capita taxes paid. That is why you get $12,000 per year in Federal taxes from D.residents.  The personal income of the people I represent is higher than that of seven States; the per capita of personal consumption in expenditures is higher than that of any State; and the total personal consumption expenditures are greater than those of seven This is a very productive, a very hardworking city that pays its own way and contributes, as well, mightily to our country. And Americans understand that because the District is attracting residents in large numbers.  We have had, in this city, a 15.3 percent increase in residents since the last census. That becomes, on a monthly basis, 800 new residents coming to live in your Nation's Capital every month--almost 700,000, a larger population today than Wyoming and then Vermont, but these States, they have two They have the same number of Representatives as the District of Columbia--one.  If the truth be told, the District is about the same in population as seven Those seven States have two Senators each and one Representative who votes on this floor. They and I are equivalent in every respect except, of course, for the taxes per capita D.residents pay, and yet they have the vote. Notwithstanding that the District is number one per capita in taxes District residents pay, those seven States have the congressional vote and we do not.  This week, in fact, just today, we passed a new tax bill. So imagine how the residents I represent feel about a new tax bill. They are going to end up paying more taxes because SALT, the State and local tax deduction, has been capped. It has been with us for almost 100 years. So instead of taxation without representation, my constituents will have double taxation, at least when it comes to that particular matter, the State and local taxes, double taxation without representation.  So when the bell rang for the tax vote, I did not come down because I could not vote for the citizens of the District of When there are votes on this floor for matters involving our military and life and death, I do not come down because I cannot vote.  Still, I remember the purple fingers from the citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan, where they not only were signifying that they had voted, but they were signifying who gave them the vote: members of the military from the United States, including members from the District of Columbia, who have fought and died in every war since the war that created the United States of  District residents have overpaid for the equal citizenship they seek, and this chart illustrates it tragically:  World War I, 635 District of Columbia residents lost their lives in that war. That was a figure greater than three different  World War II--that was a big one--3,573 District of Columbia residents lost their lives. That was five times greater than the District's losses in World War I, and it was greater than losses in four different  Moving on to the Korean war, 547 District residents lost their lives. That figure was greater than the loss of life by the military in eight different  And finally, the Vietnam war, 243 casualties in that war. That was a figure greater than 10 different  All told, this city, which is a relatively small city, has had almost 200,000 residents serve in the military, and that is only since World War I hasten to add that there has never been a war--and I have not counted the 19th century wars--there has never been a war where the residents of your Nation's Capital were not among those who fought and died.  Now, I must ask if there is any Member of Congress who would stand for the Federal Government dictating a local budget or her local matters coming to the House floor after showing what I have shown here this evening about the District of Maybe there will be some understanding of why we must protest and resist the treatment of the District of Columbia until the District is given the equality to States by becoming the 51st  As I have indicated, it is impossible to lay our present predicament on the Framers of our Remember, they went to war, it is they who gave us the slogan of ``taxation without representation.'' They were willing to die, to commit treason, largely because they were paying taxes to the crown and had no representation. How can we possibly lay the present predicament of the District on the Framers? It is not them. It is on us today.                              {time}  1815  In the 21st century, Congress cannot continue to ask the residents of the Nation's Capital to watch democracy in operation for everybody else except them.  If a matter involves the District of Columbia and has to come before us, then everybody gets to vote on that matter except the Representative of the District of You can't justify that alongside American principles, given how much in Federal taxes the people I represent pay, given their sons and daughters who have always gone to war for their country, all of that without a vote in the House and the Senate required by consent of the government.  Well, we have two choices, but when you think about it, we have only one. Congress can continue to exercise autocratic authority over the American citizens who live in their own Nation's Capital, treating them--if I may quote the words of the great Frederick Douglass, whose bicentennial we will be celebrating in 2018 (who was a resident of this City), and who said our country was ``Treating the District and its citizens as aliens, not citizens, but subjects.''  We are not subjects. We are American citizens. The only alternative today is to live up to the Nation's promise and ideals and pass the Washington, D.Admission Act to make the residents of your Nation's Capital equal by affording them the right to live in the 51st State of the Union of States called the United States of  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H10411]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10407-5.txt,868,DACA,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
143,topic-id,323,"Mr.Speaker, I stood here several weeks ago to speak in support of the original House-passed tax reform bill. Since then, as a member of the conference committee, I have participated in the process of strengthening this bill and making it even more transformative. That is why I continue to stand in strong support of the bill and conference report we will be voting on today.  Washington's special interests have distorted business decisions for too long, and we cannot afford to wait any longer to reform our broken Tax  Should we fail to act now, businesses will continue to leave the United States for tax purposes, taking thousands of good-paying jobs--American jobs--with them. Our small businesses will continue to suffer the damaging effects of a bewildering and punitive Tax Code that gives unfair advantages to their larger, well-connected competitors.  But all this will change if we pass this bill.  For years, I have advocated for full and immediate expensing, which will allow businesses of all sizes to write off costs immediately. This bill will provide full expensing, which is one of the many progrowth pieces to this legislation. I am confident my colleagues will soon see the tremendous effect of full expensing and make the important decision to extend it before it expires.  Mr.Speaker, I stand here with my colleagues on an historic day in support of one of the most dramatic reform bills to come before this body since I came to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act simplifies the Code, grows the economy, and allows for strong business investment.  I have said before that I will not accept the status quo of our broken Tax Code or a minimal reform that merely adjusts rates.

If they want to keep it simple, let's keep it simple. Very simple.  How about that couple that wants to send their kids to college and put a second mortgage on their house. You can't do that anymore. You cannot do that. That is not a middle class legislation. That is the stick it to the middle class.  Mr.Speaker, this is serious business. I will tell you what is simple. If you are born in a family with an estate worth more than $11 million, this Republican Congress is coming to your aid with a $3 million average windfall.

1211,topic-id,989,"Mr.President, the question is, Do deficits matter? We often say they do. You will hear Republicans say they do, and for the last week or two, you have heard from Democrats that they were against cutting taxes because it might add to the deficit. Well, if this is true, tonight we will get a chance to vote on the deficit because, you see, Congress about 6 years ago, put something forward called pay-go budget caps. What does that mean? They kept seeing the deficit explode. So they put in these budget caps, and if we were to adhere to them, we would actually get the debt under control. Guess what. Congress has evaded them 29 times.  So tonight we will have a bill, and it will be the 30th time that Congress has evaded their own rules on the debt. Is it any surprise that the debt under George Bush went from $5 trillion to $10 trillion? Is it any surprise that under President Obama it went from $10 trillion to $20 trillion? Is it any surprise that the debt continues to rise? No, because both parties are responsible for it.  Look, I was all for the tax cut. I think it is good for the country, but I am also for restraining spending. So we did the tax cut earlier in the week, and now we are going to do a spending bill. We have rules in place, and the rules in place say that there are budget caps. So they have a special little waiver that they have put in the spending bills because we are now going to exceed those caps.  So the question is, Are we serious about the debt? Are we serious about adding a million dollars a minute to the debt? That is what happens. We borrow a million dollars a minute. The deficit this year will be over $700 billion--$20 trillion in total. The total debt is bigger than our entire economy.  So both sides give lip service to it, and yet both sides want more spending. On the Republican side, this year's request is $80 billion above the caps for military. On the Democratic side, they say: Well, you don't get yours unless we get ours. Yet nobody cares about the debt. So really the debt is being driven by the GOP, who want more military money but the only way they can get it is giving the Democrats more welfare money.  So the interesting thing about this vote is--you have heard the other side of the aisle saying it--they can't vote for the tax cut because of the debt. If they care about the debt, let's cut spending. This is their chance. This will be a vote on cutting spending. These pay-go budget caps were put in place by the Democrats when they were in the majority in 2010. These are their budget caps, and yet everybody is clamoring to waive them on both sides.  We have a real problem in our country, and we must do something about it. Ultimately, there will be a day of reckoning. You cannot continue to borrow so much money. Ultimately, it bankrupts the Nation, or the currency becomes worthless, or you get to a point where the interest on the debt actually becomes the 1 spending item. Within about a decade, interest will push out all other spending, and it will be the 1 item. We will spend more on interest than national defense. We will spend more on interest than welfare and anything else. So there are those who say: Well, we have to have more money for military; we have to have more money for welfare. You are going to have none of that if you keep spending money at this rate because we are going to ruin the country through debt.  So can we have a strong military? We spend about $600 billion, but you can't necessarily spend $700 billion. That extra $100 billion is making the debt worse. But it is the same on the other side of the ledger with the  So we have a chance. There really is a chance. The media would say: Oh, you are irresponsible for voting for the tax cuts. No, you are irresponsible if you are not also willing to vote for spending cuts.  So tonight I will put forward in a few minutes a motion, and this motion will be to say that we should obey the spending caps. We have put them in place. Unless our outrage over debt is fake outrage, if we truly care about the[[Page S8234]]debt, we should vote to keep in place the rules we have put in place. These are spending caps. If we care about the next generation, we should vote for the spending caps. So I will put forward a motion that says: Let's obey our own rules.  It will be interesting to watch the vote and to see how it turns out--who truly cares about the debt on either side of the aisle, who is willing to say: You know what; I am for tax cuts but I am also for saying across the board that we need to have spending restraint. Will we obey our own rules? We have broken our own rules. This will be the 30th time we broke our own rules on budget caps since 2010. If you go back farther, it is in the hundreds of times. If you were scoring Congress on integrity and honesty about the rules we have set up, it would be a zero. We aren't adhering to our own rules.  So what I would admonish my colleagues to do is, if they care about debt, is to vote for this point of order that says that we should adhere to our budget caps and we should really truly care about the budget deficit.

So we can't wait until March to do this because it had consequences known to us but unforeseen by the White House and by the And I don't think, in his heart, that the President intended to hurt these people in the very cruel way that they are being hurt by the actions that are being taken.  We can't wait until We need action. We need it soon. We need it to be bipartisan. That is what we have been working on--not me; Members, Member-driven bipartisan cooperation in trying to find a path that addresses the concerns that some have about the border--and we all do--and also addresses the Dream  As the President said: Let's call it  We will call it  So here we are. I said at the beginning of my remarks that we have been blessed in our country by Presidents who have recognized the value of immigration; that our country would be in stagnation if we didn't have this constant reinvigoration of visitors to our country.  When President Obama acted because Congress had not acted to protect the DREAMers and their parents, that was really important for him to do because Congress had not acted. However, it is important to note that President Reagan, when he was President and President George Herbert Walker Bush was at that time Vice President, Congress did act through the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. They did act. And President Reagan's observation was they didn't go far enough.  So he took further executive action called Family Fairness to protect people in our country, immigrants in our country. Actually, President Reagan and President George Herbert Walker Bush protected a higher percentage of newcomers to our country than President Obama did with his DACA and DAPA action, a higher percentage because they understood the value to our country of newcomers.  President Clinton continued all of that. President George Bush was a champion and continues to be a champion on recognizing the value of immigration. He has spoken about it intellectually, with respect, from the heart for people coming to our country, and he has urged us to do so.  He couldn't get the cooperation of his own party when he was President to cooperate for comprehensive immigration reform, even though when we had the power as Democrats, we supported it. But he could not get the 60 votes in the But, nonetheless, he continues to be a champion, really, for immigration reform.  And here we have a new President who campaigned on the backs of newcomers to our country and who made immigrants villains. It is a complete change from the Republican Party, from a commitment to valuing newcomers and diversity in our country. It is a complete departure from President Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President George Bush, just to name the Republican  So we find ourselves in this situation, but that doesn't change the fact that we have a responsibility to all of God's children to treat them with respect, and when we can do something to be helpful, we should.                              {time}  1315  There is harm that is coming to the DREAMers every day, because they are losing status. Regardless of what some may say, some are being deported. This may be unknown to the President, but it is not unknown to us in this  I want to thank Congresswoman Lujan Grisham, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and her members. I want to thank Congresswoman Judy Chu, the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus; Congresswoman Yvette Clarke,[[Page H10355]]who, working with the Congressional Black Caucus, has been a champion in that caucus; and all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who are striving to find a path.  One path that we have open to us is to defeat this rule, to allow the Dream Act to come up, and to put that in the mix as we go forward.  Again, this isn't an issue, this isn't a bill. It is a value, and that is the conversation we had with President This isn't an issue, but it is a value. This is about who we are as a nation and how we respect who we are as a nation. That is why, I believe, that President Trump will be receptive to signing a bill. He does want--and we are all concerned for--border security. We will work with him on that, but let's start by putting on the Record the support of this House for a recognition that we are immigrants, by and large. Unless some of you are Native Americans--and how proud we are of our Native American community in our country and how blessed we are--most of us come from immigrant families.  It was interesting to me in doing some reading on some of this. I am very proud of my own Italian-American heritage. My grandmother was born in Baltimore, Her parents were from Venice and My father's family from We are very proud of all of that, which makes us respect the pride that other people take in their heritage.  What was interesting to me in recent days, because I remember--I didn't suffer this, but I know my father and others did: Italians were called ``wops.''  Do you know what wops means?  It means ``without papers.'' That is what they were called: without papers.  These people are without papers, but in every way they are  I just want to tell you a couple of stories. One is Fernando Meza Fernando lives in my district. Fernando's family came to the U.Fernando came to the U.when he was 9 years old. In high school, Fernando was an AP scholar and received the International Baccalaureate Diploma and the Achievement Award in Foreign Language for  Fernando continued to excel academically at Santa Clara University, where he graduated cum laude with a double major in biology and  Now a third-year doctoral student at UC San Francisco, Fernando also works at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he is working hard to provide new insights into many diseases and disorders.  I just want to tell you one other story. Lisette Diaz was just 6 years old when her family brought her to the U.from Growing up in Long Island, Lisette excelled in school and was involved in her community. She went on to attend Harvard, where she received numerous awards and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities. Lisette recently graduated from Harvard with honors.  Lisette and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country, but Donald Trump and other Republicans have made their agenda clear. They want to shut down DACA and DAPA and deport hundreds of thousands of DREAMers and parents of  That is what DREAMers think. We don't want them to think that. We want them to think that the President understands their value, the value of our DREAMers, and the challenges that they face.  If we don't do something soon, Lisette will be deported back to Chile, a country where she hasn't lived since she was 6 years old.  There are just thousands and thousands and thousands of stories of success, of those serving in our military, attending our schools, teaching our children, working in high-level positions, because they all have that immigrant attitude of hard work, hard work ethic, a work ethic, a faith ethic, a family ethic, a sense of community.  In the sense and spirit of community, let's defeat this rule and allow the Dream Act to come forward.

186,topic-id,1338,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I salute him for his extraordinary leadership and being a champion for America's working families. I commend him and the Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee for putting forth the facts on what is in this bill.  Mr.Speaker, today we choose what kind of country America will be: one that champions the ladders of opportunity for all or one that reinforces the power of the wealthiest and well connected.  Outside the Congress, the American people have already made their decision. Polling shows that Americans oppose the GOP tax scam by a margin of 2 to 1. Hardworking families see right through the brazen con job Republicans are trying to sell them.  So why aren't our Republican colleagues standing with their constituents? Why aren't they joining us on insisting on A Better Deal for American families? Why aren't they joining us in demanding that we write real bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first?  Because helping the middle class has never been their goal.  From day one, the donors, lobbyists, and the wealthy and well connected came first. The Frankenstein monster of giveaways and special interest loopholes we are voting on today proves it, and this monster will come back to haunt them, as Frankenstein did.  Republicans claim that their bill is a middle class tax cut. The fact is, according to the Tax Policy Center, their bill raises taxes on 86 million middle class households.  When The Washington Post asked Edward Kleinbard, former chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, if the tax package in aggregate would mean a middle class tax cut, he said: ``That is delusional or dishonest to say. It is factually untrue. The only group you can point to that wins year after year and wins in very large magnitude is the very highest incomes.''  That is from the Joint Committee on Taxation former chief of staff.  The only greater delusion in this bill is the ludicrous Republican insistence, their claim that these giveaways to the wealthiest will pay for themselves.  Bruce Bartlett is the architect of Jack Kemp's supply-side economics. As Bruce Bartlett has testified in our hearing and in public, when it comes to tax breaks for the wealthy paying for themselves, he said:       It is not true. It is nonsense. It is  He said the whole words.  In a few minutes, Republicans will vote to explode catastrophically our national debt at minimum of $1.5 trillion, likely $2.2 trillion or more.  Where are the vaunted Republican deficit hawks? Are they endangered? Are they extinct? Do they care about the deficit when we pass giveaways for the rich and big corporations?  They don't care about deficits, then. Tax breaks for the rich, corporate tax breaks: they don't care about the deficit.  Do Republicans only care about the deficit when the issue is helping children, seniors, our veterans, who are a large part of hardworking Americans?  My colleagues, my fellow Americans, remember this vote. Remember the vote, when they will cheer at the end of this vote, they will stand up and cheer, adding trillions to the national debt in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent and to big corporations. They will cheer that.  They will cheer when they say we can't afford to protect the health of our innocent children. They will cheer that.  Remember, they will cheer when they tell you we can't afford the next step, we can't afford Medicaid, Medicare, and a dignified retirement our seniors spent a lifetime earning. That is an applause line for them.  Remember this day when Republicans cheer for a bill that hands a $4,000 child tax credit to families of four earning $400,000 a year. If you earn $400,000 a year, you get $4,000 in a child tax credit.                              {time}  1330  But if you are poor, a single mom, a mother of two earning only $14,500, guess how much you get?  Seventy-five dollars. Seventy-five dollars.  Today we gather on this floor in the midst of a holy season. In this season, we celebrate the miraculous blessings of We reflect on the wondrous joy of children and our responsibility to them.  We remember our duty to live justly. For those of us blessed to serve in this Congress, we must remember our special responsibility to govern fairly, to meet the needs of all of God's children.  In this holy time, the moral obscenity and unrepentant greed of the GOP tax scam stands out even more clearly.  As the U.Conference of Catholic Bishops said early on, ``. . . this proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy. This is simply unconscionable.''  They will be cheering it. Remember what the Bishops said.  Now, here, get back to the This is in sharp contrast to the words of Senator Now, he is the chairman of the Finance Committee in the United States Senate and an author of this bill. He said: ``I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and trillions of dollars to help people who won't help themselves, won't lift a finger, and expect the Federal Government to do everything.''  How about that?  Tell that to the moms we just saw speaking out with their children, children with disabilities, who wonder how this could be so cruel.  This is an act of misery, but not according to Senator And that is in terms of getting back to our In his encyclical, God is And I have said this to my colleagues before, but with, obviously, no effect on the Republican side.  Pope Benedict quoted the urgent moral wisdom of Augustine 17 centuries ago, my colleagues. Seventeen[[Page H10210]]centuries ago, Augustine said: ``A State which is not governed according to justice is just a bunch of thieves.''  Pope Benedict went on to say: ``The State must inevitably face the question of how justice can be achieved here and now.''  In his words, he cautioned against ``the danger of certain ethical blindness caused by the dazzling effect of power and special interests.''  Mr.Speaker, is there justice in a bill that rewards corporations shipping jobs overseas? Jobs of hardworking American men and women and veterans, shipping those jobs overseas? Is there justice in that?  No, I don't think so.  Is there justice in a bill that spikes healthcare premiums and may add 13 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured?  No justice there.  Is there justice in a bill that raises taxes on 86 million middle class families?  Here we are. Raises taxes on 86 million middle class families, and they try to present the delusion that it is a middle class tax cut.  Is there justice in a bill that hands a breathtaking 83 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans? Eighty-three percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent?  Is there justice in a bill that explodes the national debt to give the wealthy and the well connected a break and sticks the debt with our children? Is that justice?  I didn't think you thought so. I wish our Republican colleagues would join us.  This GOP tax scam is simply theft, monumental, brazen theft from the American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it. The GOP tax scam is not a voice for an investment in growth or jobs. It is a vote to install a permanent plutocracy in our They will be cheering that later.  It does violence to the vision of our It disrespects the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, who are a large part of our middle class, and to whom we owe a future worthy of their sacrifice. It betrays the future and betrays the aspirations of our children.  It morally demands a ``no'' vote from every Member of this House of the people.

1276,topic-id,1637,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and, once again, I commend him for being a champion of middle class families.  I want my colleagues all to hear the esteem in which we hold our Democratic members of the Ways and Means I thank you. Thank you very much, Mr.Neal, for being our ranking member and for your extraordinary leadership on behalf of America's middle class working families, and that includes millions of veterans. Thank you.  Mr.Speaker, today is a very sad day in the history of America because we have, on the floor, probably the worst bill in recent time to come to the floor. That doesn't mean it doesn't have stiff competition from other legislation the Republicans have brought to the floor, but this is the worst because so many people are affected in such a negative way and because trillions of dollars of impact on our economy have been voted upon without any hearing, without any hearing from the people who will be most affected by it--no hearings, no experts, no listening to the American people.  Yesterday, our Republican colleagues stood on this floor and voted for a GOP tax scam that the American people oppose 2 to 1. Our Republican colleagues stood on the floor and cheered. They[[Page H10309]]cheered a bill that will raise taxes on 86 million middle class families and hand a staggering 83 percent of its tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent.  Shamefully, the Republicans were cheering against the children as they robbed from their future and ransacked the middle class to reward the rich.  Today, the Republicans take their victory lap for successfully pillaging the American middle class to benefit the powerful and the privileged.  I come to the floor with stories of men and women and children that Republicans shamefully cheered against yesterday.  Yesterday, I wish the Republicans had heard, as we did, the story of Ady Barkan, 30 years old, father of a beautiful baby son, and Ady is suddenly stricken with ALS, 30 years old.  From his wheelchair, with a strong but wavering voice, he begged Congress not to pass this bill. He pleaded with anyone who would listen not to vote for this tax scam that will raise his health benefits and condemn Medicaid to devastating cuts as the logical next step. He has been lobbying on Capitol Hill against this bill for a while. Ady said yesterday it would do so much damage.       It would deprive me of the Medicaid I need to stay alive a      little longer and see baby Carl learn to read and teach him      how to play chess and watch him go to first grade.  But Republicans didn't listen, said ``no,'' and cheered.  Yesterday, we heard the story, and I wish our Republican friends could have heard it, of Laura Hatcher, mother of sweet and kind 11-year-old Simon, one of the Little  Simon has a rare disease and cerebral palsy. His mother spoke of how their family watches the Muppet version of ``A Christmas Carol'' and how Simon sees himself in Tiny Tim, another kind boy with braces on his legs. Unfortunately, this story, as of today, does not have the same kind of happy ending as ``A Christmas Carol.''  But the story is not over, and like Tiny Tim, Simon and his family now find their future in danger because of the greed of those with power, the cruelty that is in the heart of the tax scam.  As Simon's mother, Laura, said:       Very soon I could, once again, be facing a future where I      don't know how I will be able to care for my child. This is a      thought I simply find too difficult to bear.  Since you didn't hear yesterday, I will go on to say what she said.       We parents of medically complex kids understand      consequences. We know what will happen if this tax bill      passes, if our country does not turn from this destructive      and immoral path.  But the Republicans didn't listen. They said ``no,'' and they cheered. They cheered against Simon because Republicans value the wishes of the special interest lobbyists over the Little Lobbyists, the voices of Little Lobbyists, sick children standing up for themselves and for their siblings, children standing with their siblings.  Yesterday, we heard from faith leaders, too. They implored Congress to reject this bill that punishes working families and rewards the wealthiest 1 percent.  I repeat: 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent; 86 million American working middle class families will have their taxes raised.  Sister Simone said she wept for the fact that our Representatives are not weeping over the damage they are doing to families across  They challenged us to honor our faith in this holy season, to remember that our first responsibility is to those who have the least, not to enrich those who are already privileged and powerful.  They challenged us to heed not only the message of Christmas, but to remember the words of Jesus enshrined in the Gospel of  But Republicans didn't listen. They said ``no.'' They cheered. They cheered. They cheered against little They cheered against Ady They cheered against people in need.  The GOP tax scam is a monumental con job, but who got conned? President Trump will sign the bill whenever he signs it. I know it is supposed to be today, but I hear the special interests are weighing in for him to delay it for some reason or another.  President Trump will sign a bill that betrays the promises he made in the campaign.  President Trump promised to eliminate the carried interest loophole; yet the Republicans wrote a tax scam that not only continues this outrageous loophole, but it gives even more loopholes to the wealthy and well connected.  President Trump promised to stop corporations from shipping jobs overseas, but Republicans wrote a tax scam that gives corporate America even bigger incentives to ship jobs overseas.  President Trump promised tax reform focused on middle class families, tax breaks for middle class families. Republicans wrote a tax scam that raises taxes on 86 million middle class families in our country.  President Trump promised he would protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, but Republicans wrote a tax plan to explode the deficit and use it as an excuse to cut Medicare and They have made no secret of their plans. They have even said this week, to raise the Social Security age.  So who got conned? Did the people get conned by the promises? Did the President get conned by the Republicans? Is he signing a bill that betrays his promises to the American people?  It is all about the Republicans in They have in their DNA trickle-down economics. Tax breaks for the rich, tax breaks for corporations, and the former Speaker even said: If trickle-down creates jobs, that would be good. If it doesn't, so be it. That is the free market.  As Republicans head to the White House for their victory lap, hopefully they won't trip over the wheelchair of Ady Barkan and other Americans with preexisting conditions.  I caution them not to trip over the wheelchair of Simon Hatcher and other children with severe medical needs. They will be in the path of your victory lap.  Don't trip over the sisters and brothers and mothers and fathers who tend to the health and well-being of their sick children and their siblings and who will not stop fighting to protect them.  I told you yesterday in a public forum:       I caution you not to get in the way of a mother and father      of a child with special needs and disabilities or extreme      medical conditions. They will do anything to protect that      child, and they notice what you are doing here.  As you are on this victory lap, you will probably have to put on earphones so you can block out the pleas of faith leaders speaking up for hardworking American families.  I know the Republicans want to talk so they can't hear the truth about their bill, but the American people won't forget the false representations you have made. They won't forget how loudly you cheered when you hurt their families, their children with special needs, their families struggling to attain some financial stability.  And why? These people say to me: How could they be so cruel as to put the health provision in this bill that would possibly eliminate 13 million people from the rolls of health insurance? How could they do that? Why did they do that?  Why? The answer is always the same: to give them room to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and to corporate America, unpaid for, permanently.  Our distinguished colleague from Massachusetts will show his credit card again today. They are putting this bill on a credit card that our children are going to have to pay for, robbing from their future.  This holiday they are talking about giving people a Christmas present? Well, Joe Sixpack, whom the President said he was there to help, and I hope that that is true, Joe Sixpack will be delivering the champagne to their parties. That is how this is. This isn't about anything better for working class families. This is about champagne glasses clinking and wealthy families across the country.  I don't begrudge them their success or their wealth or their achievement. I just don't want to see it at the exploitation of America's working families.  Shame on you for voting for this outrageous theft from the American middle class.  Mr.Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing in this people's House and vote ``no'' on behalf of the American people.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

547,topic-id,3037,"Mr.President, I come from a different world. I come from the real world. I have been here just a couple of years, but this sort of rhetoric that we have heard on the floor of the Senate over the last few weeks is amazing to me. The disinformation, the known misleading statements that are made--that doesn't exist for very long in the real world because there are rules and regulations out there where that is taken care of. But it seems that if you are good at it in this body and can get away with it long enough, that what Vladimir Lenin once said is true, and that is this: It doesn't matter what you say is true; it only matters that you say it and say it and say it, and pretty soon, to the common folks in your country, it becomes true.  Well, I think we have lived through a century where we have done nothing but disproved that as a free society here and as a leader of the free world.  I think what is at stake tonight in this vote is bigger than just a few changes in our Tax Good grief. We can work for the next 10 years and not clean up every detail in this Tax Code, but this is a first step to bringing sanity back to our country.  Let me put a little perspective on this. Let's talk about what President Trump inherited when he took office in January of this year.  We had 8 years of the lowest economic growth in the history of the United States--1.9 percent. We had the lowest workforce participation rate in over 40 years.  In the last 8 years, we borrowed 35 percent of every dollar that was spent by the Federal Government--this body borrowed before you and I got in the  Under the last administration, for 6 years of those 8 years, the opposing party in this body had a supermajority for 2 years and they had a majority for 4. So for 6 years, that party had the White House and they had a majority in the Senate at least. In those 8 years, they doubled our national debt from $10 trillion to $20 trillion this year, even though last year--or the last year of the last administration, 2016--our Federal Government collected more Federal tax than any other year in our history, and the last few years have been the same.  With all that borrowing, even when the last administration said: OK, we need to fix infrastructure, we need to get the economy going--they put $1 trillion into fake infrastructure investments, and none of these parameters moved. We still had no economic growth.  This is the same party that liberalized Social Security and Medicare to the point where they are not sustainable. And in just 14 years--14 years--both those trust funds go to zero. This is not about going to Medicare and Social Security and finding money to give to the rich; this is trying to figure out how to get the economy going so we can save Social Security and It is no more complicated than that.  But what we are hearing here are words like ``shameful'' and ``ridiculous.'' I think what President Trump walked into was shameful and ridiculous. For the United States--the wealthiest country in the history of the world--to have those sorts of performance parameters is ridiculous. It is shameful. There will be a day of reckoning, and it is today. Our President took that seriously, and he said that job 1 is growing the economy.  Let's put that in perspective. He said, in the first year of his administration, he wanted to focus on three things that would grow the economy. One is he wanted to pull back on regulations. I am here to tell my colleagues that over 860 of the most onerous regulations and rules have been reversed so far this year.  The second thing President Trump said was he wanted to work on energy. Well, we got the Keystone Pipeline working. He actually moved on stopping the Clean Power Plan that was thwarting the energy production in this country, and, in this bill tonight, we will open up ANWR production to give us capability on the energy side of our economy.  The third thing the President said he wanted to do was to change our archaic tax plan; not to give money to the rich but to open our companies and our workers to be more competitive with the rest of the world.  For the last decade--maybe even the last 30 years--I have lived this in my career. For 40 years, I have watched U.competitiveness decline and decline and decline. Why? Because of two reasons. Our Federal Government grew out of any proportion. In 2000, the size of our government was $2.4 trillion. Last year, it was $4 trillion. That is under one Republican administration and one Democratic administration. We have put regulation on top of regulation. We liberalized all of our social programs to the point we cannot afford it.  The other thing we did is we loaded onto this tax situation where we lost our competitiveness with the rest of the world. The rest of the world lowered their tax rates while we actually increased ours, they reduced their regulations while we increased ours, and we just simply lost our competitive edge, such that today, two out of every three acquisitions regarding a U.company are U.companies being bought by a foreign company. Now, that is a C corporation. In many cases, it is an S corporation. Why is that? It is because of the difference between our 35 percent corporate tax rate and the average of 18 percent in Asian countries and 21 percent in All we are doing is trying to reach some point of being reasonably competitive with the rest of the world.  This President walked into a disaster, and what we have seen in the first year are dramatic results: Two million new jobs have been created this year, 860 regulations reversed, and illegal crossings on the southern border are down 60 percent.  We passed a bill in this body 97 to 2 that allows a department head in the Veterans' Administration to remove people for cause, for lack of performance. Guess what. So far this year, over 500 people have been asked to leave because of performance reasons in our[[Page S8127]]Veterans' That is something both Democrats and Republicans should be proud of.  We also see a Department of Education that has removed 300 people for the same reason. CEO competence is at a 20-year high. Consumer confidence, despite what the other side wants to tell us, is at a 16-year high, and many studies are proving that today.  Tonight I want to clear up some of the absolute, unbelievable mistruths and myths about this bill that are being perpetrated. We heard several just in the last hour on this floor. The first, the great one--I love this: This tax plan is only going to help the wealthy. We are going to tax the low-income people in America, and we are going to give it to the billionaires.  Let me just give some examples here. A median-income family today--a family of four who works, with two kids, who makes a median income of $73,000 a year is going to get a $2,200 tax reduction. That is a 60-percent reduction in their Federal tax rate.  A single working mother, as an example, with one child at home--now, this is a parent who has to find childcare, has to find a way to work, gets very little help from family or friends, doesn't own a home--I know many people like this--that person is going to get a 75-percent tax cut in this bill.  Beyond that, today, 52 percent of households in America--this is before this bill--pay zero Federal income tax, but this bill goes further. Up to 6 million people will potentially be removed from the tax rolls because of this bill. I am just a simple business guy, but I just look at the facts. These are mathematical facts here. There is no projection, no opinion. This is part of this bill that belies half of the mistruths we just heard in the last hour on this floor.  The second one is a process question. Of course, this is what we always hear the minority party say. I dare say, as an outsider, I heard Republicans say this in the last 6 years. There is no transparency, no regular process, no regular order. Well, in the last few years, there have been over 70 public hearings--Senate hearings in committee--about tax reform. This particular bill has been in full regular order. Yes, it was done in reconciliation, but that is regular order. I personally would have preferred not to have done that, but it is within regular order.  It went through committee. Amendments were put up and debated and passed in committee. Then the bill was brought to the floor. We voted on amendments on this floor, and then it went to a full vote and was passed--or will be passed tonight.  The third myth: This tax plan will not generate economic growth. This is a really rich one because most of the people saying that have never written their signature on the front of a check. They just simply haven't been in business. Yet these are now the newfound experts in this body who say: Well, this is not going to grow the economy. Of course, it is not; we need bigger government to grow the economy. Haven't we proven that?  No, we have disproved that. If anything, over the last 8 years, we have proven that bigger government does not correlate with a better, growing, competitive economy. What this bill simply does is it gets government back out of the way, to some degree, helps us become competitive with the rest of the world, and ignites this economy.  Let's just look at what is being said about this. First of all, it has been estimated that nearly 1 million new jobs will be derived because of this bill. It is estimated that annual incomes of working Americans will go up somewhere between $4,000 and $9,000. That is in addition to the tax cuts. That is because the demand for labor in a growing economy will create rising wages.  The other side says: Well, to get rising wages, you need to increase minimum wage. That is the wrong way to look at this. This bill, I can tell from personal experience, will create demand for labor, and that labor will increase in price.  GDP will grow somewhere between 3 and 5 percent over the next decade. I actually believe it will be much more than that. The big one, in my mind, is by eliminating the repatriation tax, and, by the way, we are the last country in the world to still have this archaic tax, which we collect no tax on today, but eliminating that brings over $2.6 trillion back into this economy.  The other side says: Well, that is not going to go to the economy, it is going to dividends or to pay down debt. Guess what. In a capitalistic society, it is all contributory. It all adds to the benefit of growing the economy.  Capital formation is part of what created this miracle in the first place. The last 70 years in America has been, I would argue--as a 40-year experienced veteran of the business community here, as the only Fortune 500 CEO in the Senate and in all of Congress, I would argue that this economic windfall we have experienced over the last 7 years in America is based on three things: On the top of the best workforce in the history of the world, it is innovation, capital formation, and the rule of law. Quite frankly, because of regulations in this body over the last 15 years and because of our Tax Code, we have taken those for granted. Tonight we begin to reverse that.  The next claim I want to debunk is that this tax plan adds $1 trillion--I love this one--will add $1 trillion to the debt. This is from the other side that administered more than doubling our debt in the last decade. No other President in the history of our country, prior to the last administration, added $10 trillion to the debt of this  There is no bigger debt hawk in this body than I, and I can tell you this is what brought me into the political arena. This $20 trillion in debt is the beginning, it is not the end of the story. Unless we do something today about our Federal debt, it is going to grow $11 trillion, is the latest estimate, over the next decade. Most of that is on the mandatory side.  To solve this debt crisis, clearly we have to grow the economy, but we will not solve the debt crisis only by growing the economy. We will not solve it unless we start by growing the economy.  We are told by the Joint Committee on Taxation and by the Congressional Budget Office--and both of these modeling groups I have personal problems with--but even if you take their worst-case scenarios, you only have to grow the economy two-tenths of 1 percent per year. That is going from 1.9 percent, which is the average baseline of the last 8 years, growing it by two-tenths of 1 percent to 2.1 percent over the next decade. There has only been one time in one decade in the last 70 years where this economy didn't grow more than 2.5 percent, and in that decade it grew 2.3 percent. So in no decade since World War II have we grown less than 2.3 percent.  In addition, CBO says we have to grow 2.2 or 2.3 percent. The last two quarters are already over 3 percent. The fourth quarter looks like it will be as well if we pass this tax bill tonight.  It just seems to me that people who have experience in the real-world economy know that investing in our workers is the best investment we can make, and that is what this tax bill does. Don't be confused by the rhetoric.  Members of the other body in the last hour say there is going to be a day of reckoning. There is, because I believe that the other side has failed the working poor in this country. The best example is ObamaCare, perpetrated by the supermajority, 60 votes on the other side, and we know it is now collapsing under its own weight, but this is what they have done to the working poor in  In 2014--and it has been that way over the last 3 years as well--but 2014 is the last year we can get from the Under ObamaCare, the IRS fined 8 million people in America $2 billion, and the irony is, half of those people make less than $25,000. Now, that is outrageous, and for those same people to beat their chests now about this being for the rich, it is even more outrageous.  I will close with this. The biggest argument they make is that this is for the rich, and the rich are not paying their fair share. The top 1 percent today pay about 40 percent of all tax revenues that we have, and the top 10 percent pay over 70 percent. That was true before this bill, and that is going to be true after this bill.  What is going to also be true is the fact that the working men and women of America will find that their place of employment, whether it is a one-man self-proprietorship, a one-woman self-[[Page S8128]]proprietorship, or a major corporation, those companies, in a global economy, are going to find themselves more competitive because of what President Donald Trump is doing in this tax bill and what we are backing up tonight. I argue that this is a historic day, not just because of tax relief for the working men and women of America, or building competitiveness for those same people around the world, but for our kids and grandkids so we can begin to deal with this huge growing debt.  People say: Well, you are adding debt. No, this is an investment, and, by the way, it is not $1.5 trillion. They know that $500 billion of that--one-third of it--is this policy versus law. They know that, but it still makes a better story. They also know that $200 billion of that are fake costs because it says if you eliminate the way it is scored right now, if you eliminate the repatriation tax, the Joint Committee on Tax and the Congressional Budget Office, in their infinite wisdom, say that is going to cost you $200 billion. We don't collect $200 billion in repatriation tax. As an outsider, I cannot believe we sit here and talk about these fake numbers that way.  The President of the United States has a vision for our country. We need to rise up and be competitive again in order to deal with this long-term tax situation but, more importantly--or as importantly--to be able to afford to do the right things for our people. When we have hurricanes, when we have fires, we don't have the resources to do that. Every dime we are spending behind these hurricanes and behind the fires and behind all of the things we are doing is borrowed. Every time we spend on our military, it is borrowed money. The only way to eventually change that is to begin to grow our economy. This is only one of many steps that are required, but this tonight becomes historic because you can't do the others unless you make this economy competitive.  I want to praise our President tonight for having the guts to stick through this process. We are going to pass this bill tonight and make America great again because we are going to make America competitive again.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

684,topic-id,168,"Mr.Speaker, recently there has been a real flurry by the Republicans here in Congress to disparage and call names to the FBI and to the Justice Department, but it is right after Michael Flynn pled guilty, right after George Papadopoulos pled guilty in the investigation into Russia and potential collusion with the administration.

1138,topic-id,785,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.Garamendi, for allowing me the opportunity to speak about this.  You have FDR on the poster. He also said December 7 was a day that would live in infamy. This is a day that will live in infamy because of the tax bill that was passed today.  I don't like to speak in this hyperbolic way, but what was passed by the Republican House, and soon by the Republican Senate, is something none of us has ever seen before.  Let's just do some easy math so that people understand how unbelievable the numbers are on this.  Let's take Speaker Ryan's numbers. He said an average family of four making some $60,000 are going to save about $1,183. Of the four, that is about $275 per person. That is nice. I like it.  What he doesn't tell you, and what the Republicans refuse to talk about, is how much money is put on the credit card of the Nation for the current generation and future generations to have to pay. At best, it is $1.5 trillion.  That is a number that none of us can really understand how big it is. But let's say there are 300 million Divide 300 million into $1.5 trillion and that is $5,000. Let's do the math. You get to save $270, but you put $5,000 on the credit card.  Wait a second. That doesn't sound quite right. Where does that $4,730 go?  Well, it goes straight up to the wealthiest among us.  So all of us, as a country, as a nation, and as a people, have the obligation to pay this back.  And who gets it?  Just a very slim few. We get $270, but we have $5,000 on a credit card.  Mr.DeFazio talked about some of the opportunity costs that are lost from this $1.5 trillion. If the $1.5 trillion were out there to benefit all of us and just put in infrastructure, we would basically fix every road, every water work, every electric grid issue that we have; we would put broadband across the country, and all of us would benefit and make this country competitive for the next 50 years.  Instead, we say: We don't need that money. Let's just give it back to the wealthiest people in America.[[Page H10236]]   I serve on the Science We did some numbers in the Science  The entire budget for solar energy for our laboratories, in any given year, is about $207 million. We were having this testimony and the Republicans were picking on the managers of the solar budget line and said: You have really got to shrink this. This is costing too much money.  Well, do you know how many times 207 million goes into $1.5 trillion? Do you know how many years worth of budgets that is?  It is 7,480 years worth of solar energy budgets.  I have really been working on getting our astronauts to We have been advised that that is going to cost about $200 billion over the course of the next 16 years, to 2033, which is when the orbits of Mars and the Earth come close together and saves us a lot of space time, travel time, and is safer for our astronauts.  We could send our astronauts to Mars and back and start from scratch eight times for this tax cut that is going to be received by the rich.  It is not right. It is not It is the opposite of what FDR said when he said: ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.''  There has been some talk about how real estate developers and others are really going to benefit by this tax cut that nobody has seen until the last day or two. This is a giant piece of legislation.  One of the things the Democrats have asked for for a year now is that we want to see the President's tax returns. He has refused to disclose his tax returns. So we know he was a real estate developer, we know he is a very wealthy guy, and we know he is going to benefit in a large way--or, he might say in a huge way--by this tax cut. But we don't know how much it is going to be because he will never disclose his tax returns.  The ink is just barely dry as to how this is all going to work out. What has transpired today is really a shame. I really am disappointed in my Republican colleagues in how this matter has been rushed through.

We all knew, from the briefing, that they were coming from  And, of course, we thought, wearing the uniform, that our government would do everything it could to protect the servicemembers who were in harm's way and to protect our national security. That includes making sure that we got to the bottom of these EFPs, where they were coming from, and prosecuting and persecuting those who were providing them.  So imagine my surprise and my dismay just a few short days ago reading an article from a publication here in Washington, D.C., that outlined how our government, essentially, sanctioned not only the use of these EFPs from Iran in Iraq and Afghanistan, but, essentially, allowed for them to be paid for and enabled the paying for them.  There was this operation ongoing called Operation Cassandra to root out drugs coming into the United States being supplied by Hezbollah, a client of While this was ongoing, this nuclear agreement concern came into being. It was, apparently, so important that all of the work that was done in Operation Cassandra to stop these drugs from coming into the United States, that had to stop because we didn't want to irritate, we didn't want to disrespect, we didn't want to insult the Iranians when they were so close to getting a nuclear deal.  So we said, well, all these people have been working on this for years--this Operation Cassandra--to identify these people from Iran who were using this operation of selling drugs, illicitly moving stolen cars, and laundering money to then sell drugs into the United States and Europe, but also to use that money that they got from selling the drugs and the used cars to make these EFPs, to send them to Iraq, to send them to Afghanistan to kill American soldiers. That all had to stop because, heaven forbid, we can't offend We can't offend  Now, I will tell you this, Mr.Nuclear war is a grave issue and it is worth a lot. If we have to stop nuclear war and give up some things to do that, I get it, I get it completely. There are no second chances with nuclear war. Once the bomb goes off, it is over. So if you have to give a little bit to get something on that, that is something even I could understand, even though I find some of it objectionable.  Where I come into conflict is this, Mr.There is no question, at this point, whether Iran will have a nuclear weapon. There is no reason to be testing ballistic missiles except to deliver a nuclear weapon. They are not delivering leaflets, Mr.They are going to deliver a nuclear weapon with that, which is why they are testing it.  There is no reason to have centrifuges. There is no reason to enrich to the level that Iran is except to create a nuclear weapon. We don't need that to have a nuclear power plant, which is what Iran says it wants to do.  And, of course, we all know, since the Ayatollah took over and took American hostages back in the day that Iran is a known liar. That is what they do. They lie. They obfuscate. They just say one thing and do another. It is not a question of if they will have a nuclear weapon, Mr.Speaker; it is a question of when.  So what we did here was we said, look, let's not offend the Even though they are killing Americans on the battlefield, and even though they are killing Americans in your hometown by selling drugs to them--and the two are working towards each other; they are selling drugs and using that money to buy the articles of war, the implements of war that are killing Americans--it is okay. We are going to allow that to happen as long as we delay Iran from having a nuclear weapon for 15 years. That is exactly what it looks like.  Now, I didn't do the investigative reporting. It is, I think, 14,000 words, so it is pretty in-depth. But I will tell you this. It is being discredited out there. These are a couple of rogue employees who just disagreed with the policy.  Mr.Speaker, the Drug Enforcement Agency agent on the case, who has over 20 years of government experience tracking the financing of terror networks, said this of the leader of Hezbollah:       I had no clue who he was, but this guy was sending money      into Iraq to kill American soldiers.  The point is he had 20 years on the job. This wasn't some piker who just showed up on the job at Treasury and said: ``Hey, track this money and see what you can find.'' This is a guy who did this for a living for 20 years, and he ran into He ran into Hezbollah, based on his investigation.  And then they tracked him. They tracked the money. They tracked the drugs--not just a little bit, tons--tons of drugs coming into the United States, literally at a time when we have 60,000 Americans dying, annually, of drug overdose. That is more people than we lost in Vietnam, Mr.Speaker, in the whole time of A year, that is how many are dying in America based on drug overdose.  These people tracked it. They tracked the weapons on the other side, and they were told to stand down. They went to get these guys. They had one in custody in He was arrested. The United States wanted him extradited and prosecuted.  Do you know where he is right now, Mr.Speaker? He is back on the battlefield because we let him go.  So not only did Iran get to sell drugs in the United States and kill American citizens in your hometown, but they used that money to then make EFPs to kill the soldiers from your hometown who went to defend America's freedom.  And, oh, by the way, in less than 15 years now, you can expect Iran to be a nuclear armed power.  Mr.Speaker, if nothing else, if absolutely nothing else happens here from this, we need to have hearings on this in both the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to make sure that this never ever can happen again, that we don't trade the safety of the lives of American servicemembers overseas and American citizens at home for a bad deal overseas of something that we are never really going to be able to reconcile with, which is a nuclear-armed  We are going to have very few options at stopping them, like we do with North Korea right now. That is where we are headed. We will not only have North Korea to deal with, but we will also have a nuclear-armed  That circumstance can never happen again, which is why hearings are so critical, so that we get to the truth, so that we get to the bottom of this, so that there are no skeletons in the closet, Mr.Speaker, so we understand who did what for why, so we can rationalize was this worth it or was this just political expedience. We need to know that so that we learn from that, so that we never make those mistakes again.  Mr.Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Jody Hice). I appreciate his interest in this topic, as I am, and bringing it to the floor.

563,topic-id,486,"Mr.President, tonight the Senate will vote on a tax bill that will provide large corporations and wealthy individuals with a massive tax cut. The bill will result in well over $1 trillion in debt that will be passed on to our children and our grandchildren.  The bill will result in dramatically lower taxes for people who earn their living off of stocks and investments, for people who inherit millions of dollars from their parents, and for the CEOs of multinational companies. By the time the bill is fully implemented, it will lead to higher taxes and higher healthcare costs for millions of hard-working Americans who show up each and every day to do their job and to earn a living.  This bill we are voting on today was written in secret in an entirely partisan fashion, without input from nearly half of the  But it didn't have to be this way. If we wanted to give middle-class families a real tax cut, we could have. Instead, we are voting on a bill that has benefits for middle-class families that will expire just to pay for permanent tax cuts given to multinational corporations.  If we wanted to reform the Tax Code, to take away loopholes for offshoring our jobs, and to help create good-paying jobs here in the United States, we could have. Instead, we are voting on a bill that does nothing to target offshoring or job creation.  What will it do? Well, CEOs have told us directly that they are going to buy back stock, which mostly benefits the wealthiest shareholders and the CEOs with stock options.  When we know that over a third of the stocks that trade on the market are held by foreign investors--foreign investors are holding half of the value of the stock market--it is just impossible to argue that this bill is focused on Michigan families.  If we wanted to make the Tax Code simpler for small businesses, we could have. Instead, we are voting on a bill that includes some of the most complicated provisions you could possibly imagine for a small business owner.  If we really wanted to tackle our fiscal challenges in a responsible way, we could have. Instead, we are voting on the most fiscally irresponsible bill that I have ever voted on, adding $1.5 trillion to the debt that our children and grandchildren will be responsible for, all while doing next to nothing for middle-class families.  This is not the way we are supposed to make policy in this country. The bill that is on the floor tonight is here without any hearings. We didn't hear from a single expert on the specifics of the bill--not a single economist, not a single small business owner, not a single middle-class family. It is simply wrong.  I urge my colleagues to vote no and to defeat this bill.  I yield the floor.

776,topic-id,199,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to express my outrage at a detailed report by Politico which included testimony that President Obama and his administration obstructed a major DEA investigation into Hezbollah when they wanted to secure the Iran deal. These revelations are shocking and infuriating but, regrettably, not surprising. This is the same administration that sent $1.7 billion in cash ransom to  According to the DEA, Hezbollah was operating a global criminal enterprise worth over $1 billion, annually. They were selling drugs and running arms as a means of funding their terrorist activities.  A major DEA-led task force called Cassandra had procured mounting and incriminating evidence against them. Yet, according to senior Treasury and Defense officials, the Obama administration consistently obstructed and stonewalled the investigation in order to protect the Iran deal.  In essence, it seems President Obama and his administration were so focused on striking a deal with Iran that they let a major global terror group off the hook, even though the terror group was involved in global drug trafficking and sent massive amounts of cocaine and other drugs to our American communities.

This measure provides only $81 billion to be split between Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and other places.

711,topic-id,378,"Mr.Speaker, all businesses in America, large and small, should be fairly and predictably regulated, including those companies in the financial services industry.  Now, Mr.Speaker, when the real estate market collapsed in 2008, Washington did what it does often. It overreacted by imposing smothering layers of new regulations on small community banks, credit unions, and retirement advisers, when it should, Mr.Speaker, have focused its attention on eight or nine large, major money center banks that have tentacles that run throughout our economy.  Mr.Speaker, the goal of Dodd-Frank was to increase regulations on financial institutions that could bring down the economy if they got in trouble.

God forbid, Mr.Speaker, that the Bangor Savings Bank or the Maine Family Federal Credit Union in Lewiston gets into trouble. If they do, they will not bring down this economy.  Why in the world should they be imposing or have to deal with this additional layer of regulations as they are designated as a SIFI?  Mr.Luetkemeyer's bill is a terrific bill. It is common sense.

89,topic-id,2569,"Mr.President, I am standing here tonight to talk about a couple of things, and first is the tax legislation that was passed this week in This is going to help everybody I represent because it is going to help our entire country. It is going to lift up our country in ways we are already beginning to see.  There have been a lot of people to thank, and today I was at the signing ceremony where Speaker Ryan and President pro tempore Orrin Hatch signed the official legislation that is now on its way to the President for his signature. I start by thanking them--Speaker Ryan, Chairman Hatch, and also Chairman Brady of the Ways and Means Committee, with whom I worked closely on this. He was a gentleman. He was, as always, someone who was looking for ways to solve problems and to get to yes, and I commend him for that.  I also want to thank some of the colleagues on the Finance Committee whom I worked closely with. This Core 4 group includes Senator John Thune, Senator Pat Toomey, Senator Tim  Maybe, most importantly, is the staff. We had an enormous undertaking here, and it was ambitious to try to meet the goals that were set out early on of real, middle-class tax cuts, also energizing the economy through helping small businesses, and then changing the whole international system so we could level the playing field. It was a lot to do, and it took a lot of expertise and a lot of time and effort. So to Mark Prater, Jay Khosla, and Brendan Dunn, who led that effort, we all owe you our thanks. Then, of course, there are a slew of other staff, including Zach Rudisill of my staff, who just spent hours and hours and put his heart and soul into this. Thank you--all of you--for helping us get to this point.  For years, Democrats and Republicans alike have called for middle-class tax cuts. We talk about it in campaigns. I am proud to say that this week we delivered on it.  I know some of my Democratic colleagues have been critical of the legislation, and some have said: Well, these are not real, middle-class tax cuts because they expire. Yes, they expire after 8 years. We wished they didn't. Those are the budget rules here, but that is the same thing that happened with the 2001 tax cuts, the 2003 tax cuts, and Congress worked to extend those using the same budget rules for about 95 percent of those taxpayers. I am strongly hoping we will do the same thing, and I believe we will.  This is real tax relief. For families in Ohio of median income, the average will be just over $2,000 every year. That helps the family budget. That is a little money you can put aside for retirement. Maybe that is money to use for a vacation you didn't have. If you are living paycheck to paycheck, which is true with a lot of people I represent, that is a big help. It is a big help. That is from doubling the child credit, that is from doubling the standard deduction, essentially creating $14,000 of a zero income bracket.  By the way, doing those sorts of things in this bill means that about 3 million Americans or more are going to be leaving the tax rolls all together. These are people who have tax liability now and, under the new bill, starting in a couple of weeks, they will not have an income tax liability. They will be out from under the They will be able, as they move many of them from welfare to work or from a Federal program into gainful employment, to not worry about the taxman. That is really important too. I am proud of the legislation because I think it is going to really help the people I represent in an immediate way.  People will see it in their paychecks. The proof is in the paychecks because they will see it, and probably starting in February, the withholding will change. The IRS has to go through a process on that. I wrote a letter to them yesterday encouraging them to move on that quickly because people want to see that in their paychecks. So the tax relief starts in a couple of weeks, January 1. It will be in the paychecks when the withholding changes--hopefully sometime in late January, February--and people will see less money being withheld from their paycheck because of the tax cuts that enable them to have a healthier family budget.  I have to tell you I believe this is going to go well beyond that for the people I represent. As important as those middle-class tax cuts are, equally as important is what we are doing to stimulate more investment in this economy, and that is through the changes for small businesses that will now be able to put more money into the business rather than paying more taxes. Many of these businesses--so-called passthrough companies, which are most of the businesses in America--pay taxes as individuals. They don't pay the business tax rate; they pay the individual tax rate. Many of them do take a dividend. They take money out of the company every year for one purpose, and that is to pay their taxes. To the extent they are not taking the money out as much to pay those taxes because of the changes we made here for small businesses, they are going to be able to invest more in their people, more in their equipment, more in their plants--and I am hearing this from small business people around the State of  Last weekend, I was with a number of them, and they are excited about this because they want to be able to invest more in their business, they want to be able to invest more in their people, and they want to be able to give people who work for them the opportunity to have a higher wage.  Right now, wages are flat, and they really have been for the past couple of decades when you take inflation into account. This has the incredible opportunity for us not just to provide middle-class tax cuts, which are important not just to help businesses invest, but actually to help get wages up so people will see that if they work hard and play by the rules, they are going to see higher wages, the ability to get ahead, and have more hope for themselves and for their kids and their grandkids. Everyone, regardless of economic status, region, or party is going to see the benefits of this tax reform bill.  By the way, some workers are already seeing the benefit, as we talked today, because there are a bunch of companies that announced today that because of the tax reform and tax cuts legislation, they are already taking steps to increase the pay of their employees, increase benefits, or invest more money in building plants, equipment, or adding more jobs to investment or both. These companies include some big companies you have heard of like It includes other companies like Wells Fargo and Boeing and AT&They have made these announcements today.  One company that announced it today is in my hometown. It is the Fifth Third It is kind of an unusual name, Fifth Third, but that makes them distinctive, right? They said today, you know what, we are going to start paying our people a higher entry level pay--instead of 13-something an hour, it is going to be $15 an hour--and we are going to provide bonuses to other employees who are not affected by that. They are going to[[Page S8240]]do it right now, and they are doing it because of the tax relief legislation.  So to those who say: What about me? I would just say: Look at your paycheck. If you work for one of these businesses that has already made an announcement, of course, you are feeling good about it, but even if you work for another company that maybe is a little quieter about what they are doing--maybe they are not going to make a big announcement--trust me, it is going to be in their interest now, in a competitive market out there, to invest in those companies, to invest in their people, to invest in training, to invest in better equipment, better technology. Those are the sorts of things that, over time, are going to make the biggest difference, I think, in this tax bill.  If you look at what is happening in our economy today, the reason wages are flat--by the way, expenses are not flat. Expenses are up and wages are flat. That is called the middle-class squeeze, and that is very real. What is the biggest expense? For most people, it is healthcare.  The way to deal with that is to get this economy moving and, specifically, to increase the productivity. That is what the economists say; that our productivity is low right now. When you have low productivity, you have low economic growth, and that is what we have had, under 2 percent economic growth. That is not the America I grew up in, and that is not the America I want my kids to grow up in.  By making these investments in better technology, in better equipment, in better training, what happens? You get better productivity, you get higher efficiency, you get the opportunity to increase your business, and therefore hire more people. That is something, I think, over time, will play out and will create the opportunity to lift up everybody.  John Kennedy was a Democrat, but he had a lot of things to say that sounded more like what Republicans are talking about today. One thing he said was that ``a rising tide lifts all boats.'' In the 1960s, he did cut capital gains, by the way, and that tax cut actually generated more economic activity.  Ronald Reagan, in 1986, actually put in place tax reform, with a bipartisan group here in the Congress, that ended up with strong economic growth in the 1980s and the 1990s, but that was 31 years ago. That is the last time we made these kinds of substantive comprehensive changes in the Tax It is past time to do it again.  The final thing I will say about the tax reform proposal is that when you talk to businesses that are competing globally, which is more and more companies, including a lot of smaller companies now, the global economy is upon us. Some people said: Gosh, I wonder when the economy is going to affect me globally? Well, it does. It affects all of us. In your town, wherever it is, and in your business, wherever you work, you are probably competing directly or indirectly on a global basis.  I will give you an example. There is a little company in my hometown called Standard It is a great company. They make linens. It is a company that competes every day globally. In fact, a lot of the companies they compete with, as you can imagine, are companies that make these linens somewhere else--say, in Asia, where traditionally people have been able to find lower costs. Guess what they are looking at now with this tax reform bill: the ability to invest more here in America--American workers, American-made linens. They tell me, as do other companies, that this is going to give them a better competitive situation because no longer are you going to have a tax code that has the highest business rate in the entire industrialized world and an international system that says: If you keep your money overseas rather than bringing it back, when you earn money, you can save on your taxes. That is what resulted in $2.5 to $3 trillion being locked out of America and kept overseas.  This tax reform proposal unlocks that. It allows us to bring that money back. People call it repatriation. I guess that is accurate--repatriation. I wish it had never been ``unpatriated'' in the first place. If you are a patriot, you should want that money to be spent here in That is what is going to happen with this tax reform proposal.  It is about the tax cuts for working families--hard-working families who deserve it, who are now stuck in a situation where it is tough to get ahead. This will help immediately.  It is about helping small businesses and other companies here in America to be able to invest more, to be able to write off equipment right away when they buy it, and, as an example, having a lower rate.  It is also about leveling that playing field and saying that America, once again, is going to reposition itself as the leader in the world. Once again, it will be that beacon of opportunity that other countries look to and say: We would like to be like that--a free market economy where people who work hard and play by the rules can get ahead.  You can't say that now with our current Tax Code because workers literally are competing on an unlevel playing field with one hand tied behind their back because of our Tax Three times as many American companies were purchased by foreign companies last year as the other way around. Because of our Tax Code, 4,700 U.companies became foreign companies over the last decade or so. That is based on an Ernst & Young study that came out recently that said, if this tax reform proposal we have now passed had been in place, those 4,700 companies would still be American companies.  All of us are patriots here in this body. All of us should want to bring back those jobs to America, repatriate those profits here to America, and give American workers the ability to compete on a level playing field.  I know there were some differences in this legislation. We heard a lot of it from the other side of the aisle, but on this issue, it has been bipartisan in the past. I hope it will be bipartisan going forward to hold these reforms in place so we can show that we have confidence and faith in American workers and that we have confidence that if we give them the right tools--in this case, the right Tax Code to work with--they can compete and they can win. I think we are going to see that.  I think, again, with the hopeful signs we are seeing, even today, of companies providing better pay or benefits or making additional commitments on investments. Even well beyond that, we are going to see, maybe quietly, that it will spread out all over the country in ways that will not be as obvious--in decisions that are going to be made, business budgets that are going to change as a result of this tax reform bill. I am hearing it from small businesses. I am hearing it from the bigger companies that compete directly globally, and I am certainly hearing it from families who are happy to see a little tax break to be able to help them as we go into the holidays.  That is all good news, and I think passing that legislation is really going to help the people I represent.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8239.txt,924,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
538,topic-id,3699,"Mr.President, I want to talk tonight about a once-in-a-generation opportunity we have in this Senate tonight to help middle-class families, to help grow our economy. I am going to talk about the facts. I am not going to be making stuff up. I am going to talk about the real middle-class tax cuts that are in this legislation. I am going to show you charts that indicate not just what kind of tax relief is going to be there for you and your family but who is going to pay, where the burden is.  Despite what you are hearing on the floor tonight from some on the other side of the aisle, the burden of taxation actually increased in this tax bill for the wealthiest In terms of defending the status quo, which is a situation now where jobs and investment are going overseas, I think it is an outrage that this body has sat and watched company after company go overseas because of our Tax To say we shouldn't fix it, I don't get that. If we don't lower the rate on businesses and workers who are competing every day when you have the highest rate in the industrialized world and you have an international system that rewards revenues being kept overseas--$2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of earnings overseas instead of bringing that back--that status quo is not acceptable.  We can engage in all kinds of rhetoric here tonight, but if we stick to the facts, I think we might be able to see why this legislation is not only going to pass tonight but why so many Americans who are struggling because they are living paycheck to paycheck are going to be happy with this legislation. The proof is in the paycheck. People say the proof is in the pudding. The proof is in the paycheck when people see their withholding changing--less money being taken out of their paychecks for taxes--when they see they have a little more take-home pay and the family's budget is a little healthier, when they see the economy begin to take off, and when they see the end of this exodus of U.companies going overseas. In the last 13 years, 4,700 American companies have left our shores and gone overseas--being bought by foreign companies--that would not have gone if this Tax Code we are promoting tonight had been in place. That is based on an Ernst & Young study. Check it out. It is a big accounting firm. So 4,700, and when they leave our shores, guess what, they take their jobs and investments with them.  You might wonder why wages have been flat in this country for the past couple of decades. It is because people who are supporting the status quo and don't want to change this Tax Code are leaving workers in America with no opportunities to get ahead because not only are wages flat but expenses are up. That is called the middle-class squeeze. It is very real, and it is happening.  I would ask folks, when they are thinking about what you are hearing tonight on the floor, remember, one side is supporting the status quo. The status quo is not working. It isn't working for people in America and people in my State of Ohio who tell me: Rob, I am working hard. I am playing by the rules. I am not getting ahead.  The statistics bear that out. Yes, some people are getting ahead, but it is not the guy or the woman working on the shop floor in a factory in Cleveland, OH, or Columbus, Toledo, Dayton, or Cincinnati because their wages have been pretty darn flat. Again, their expenses are up, especially healthcare, which is the largest single one of those expenses. They want some help.  This legislation gives them that help in two ways: One, real middle-class tax cuts. We will talk about that in a second. Second, letting them be competitive instead of competing with one hand tied behind their backs because they are competing in a global economy, and they know that.  Give them a chance. Give them a tax code that actually is up-to-date and competitive and lets them have the opportunity to build a better life, not just for themselves but for their kids and their grandkids because that is what they really care about.  Again, I am happy to talk about that opportunity we have tonight, and it is a rare opportunity because we have not reformed this Tax Code in any substantial way in 31 years. Think about that. I celebrated my 62nd birthday today. That means we have not reformed the Tax Code in 31 years. That is half of my life. By the way, 31 years ago, Ronald Reagan was Pete Rose was still playing for the Cincinnati ``Top Gun'' was at all the box offices. It was a big hit. That is how long ago that was. During that time, I will tell you that every other country we compete with, all of them, have reformed their Tax Code, except us. We have sat back and had this debate. We have had this gridlock, partisan gridlock, in Washington because we can't get our act together.  By the way, if you are a worker trying to get ahead, you can't do it on your own because the Tax Code has you competing with that one hand tied behind your back. Only this place, Washington, Congress, a President, can propose, develop, and sign legislation that can help address this problem. This is our job. I sure hope we will do it.  In 1986, when that tax reform was passed 31 years ago, it led to two things: one, more economic growth. In the 1980s and 1990s, we did have economic growth--3, 3.5 percent, even 4.5 percent growth. Think about that. We are now living, over the last 10 years, with growth, on average, at about 1.5 to 2 percent. That is a big difference. The second thing it did is, it got wages up. Wages actually increased during that period after that tax reform.  We need to do it again. Our economy needs a shot in the arm again, not just to improve the economy but to improve take-home pay. That is what this tax reform proposal is designed to do.  We have heard, on the other side of the aisle, how this has moved too quickly, somehow there hasn't been enough thought put into this. I think it is long overdue. I think we should have done this years ago. I also know, from being involved in these issues over the past couple of decades on the House Ways and Means Committee and now in the Senate Finance Committee, there has been a lot of thought put into this issue. Just since I was elected to the Senate in 2010, there have been 70 hearings on tax reform.  Chairman Hatch is in the Chamber tonight. He will tell you, 2 years ago we had five bipartisan working groups covering every part of the Tax The bipartisan working group that I cochaired with the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, focused on the international side. Do you know what we decided? We decided we have to have a lower business rate because it has to be competitive; otherwise, we will continue to lose jobs in investment overseas, and we decided we have to have an international system that is competitive and bring back some of that $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion that is stuck overseas back to this country for more jobs and investment. Guess what. It was bipartisan then, and it is in the tax bill now.  Those are the ideas that are in this tax bill before us. They make sense. In fact, for years, there has been a bipartisan agreement that our Tax Code is broken, and it is Congress's responsibility to fix it.  I would like to commend tonight Speaker Ryan; Leader McConnell; Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, who is on the floor; Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, who has been a strong and fair negotiating partner with the I also want to thank my colleagues who have spent so many hours on this effort: Senator Toomey, whom you heard a little while ago talking about the economic benefits, as he does so well, Senators Scott, Thune, Cornyn, Enzi, and They were all on the conference committee, but many others too. Senators Collins, Johnson, Rubio, Corker, who all helped us get to this point and improve the legislation.  The bill that passed the House earlier today, and we are going to vote on tonight, is the result of years and years of research and debate. It makes good on the promise we have made to create a tax code that provides tax relief to hard-working families but also positions America for leadership in the 21st century global economy.  While we have seen some improvements in the economy recently, we have seen better economic growth[[Page S8119]]numbers. Again, a lot of people I represent are not seeing the benefit of that. That is why we have to pass this bill.  For years, colleagues on both sides of the aisle have called for middle-class tax cuts to help ease the burden. This legislation will finally actually deliver that middle-class tax relief. We have the opportunity to provide it tonight. Starting January 1--less than 2 weeks from tonight--that tax relief goes into effect. People are going to see how this tax reform helps them as soon as the IRS can adjust withholding in paychecks, which I would hope would happen before the end of Again, the proof is in the pudding. The proof is in the paycheck. People are going to see it.  People can go online now and use a tax calculator to see how it will affect them and their families. This is going to happen, and it is going happen soon if we pass this legislation tonight.  Again, the most immediate benefit is for working families and for the middle class. This bill doubles the child tax credit. It also increases the refundability of the child tax credit. For those families with kids, you have the opportunity now to save a little more money to deal with the expenses of raising a child. It doubles the standard deduction from $12,000 per family to about $24,000 per family. This, in effect, creates a $24,000 zero income tax bracket for families and simplifies the Tax Probably 90 to 95 percent of Americans are going to take that doubling of the standard deduction, I am told, and that will simplify their returns but also give them tax relief right away. It lowers tax rates for families across the board, with the largest proportional benefit going to those at the lower end of the income ladder, those who need it the most.  In fact, the combination of these tax cuts for lower income Americans means that at least 3 million Americans who have income tax liability now are going to pay nothing in taxes. They will be off the tax rolls altogether.  I have a letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation that affirms that. At our meeting last week of the conference, you can see where the Joint Committee affirmed that again. Over 3 million are going to pay no income taxes at all who pay income tax now. For those who say there is no benefit there, talk to those 3 million people. They feel the benefit. In fact, those people are going to be off the tax rolls altogether because of the tax relief we are passing tonight.  As this chart shows, every income group will receive a tax cut. This one is for the year 2019, so it is a year after the tax cuts are put in place, which starts in just a couple of weeks. We have heard a lot from opponents that the top end, those making $1 million or more, as we just heard a little while ago, get all the benefits. It is simply not true. This shows that the biggest percentage cut is among folks making between $20,000 and $30,000 a year. That is the biggest, a 16.3-percent cut.  It also shows that the smallest percentage cut is among those making $1 million or more, a 5.9-percent cut. Again, there is tax relief across the board here, but the bigger benefit is among folks at the lower end of the economic scale. In fact, when you look at who pays the income tax, you will see that those at the top are going to pay a slightly bigger share of the tax burden under this bill. Today, those making between $20,000 and $50,000 a year pay 4.37 percent of the income taxes. Under this bill, they are going to pay a little less, 4.1 percent of the income taxes.  Those who make over $100,000 will go from paying 78.7 percent of the tax burden to 79.1 percent of the tax burden. If you make over $100,000 a year, you are paying 78.7 percent of the tax burden today, and that is going to go up. Your share of the burden is going to go up. The Tax Code is pretty progressive right now, and it gets even more progressive under this tax legislation.  These are not my numbers. These are the numbers from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is the nonpartisan group that scores these things. Check out the numbers yourselves. Go on the Joint Committee on Taxation's website, jct.gov, and check it out.  When you don't consider not choosing to buy healthcare insurance to be a tax increase, which is how the Joint Committee on Taxation scores ending the individual mandate, every income group of taxpayers gets a tax cut under this plan every year, for the next 8 years, during the time this tax cut is in place. Yes, it does expire, as did the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Congress took those up, and for 95 percent of Americans, we extended that tax relief. I hope we will do that again--I expect we will--but during these next 8 years, this is real tax relief, and it is needed.  I reject the premise that choosing not to buy healthcare insurance under the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is somehow a tax hike, and I think most Americans do too. Take a look at the Rules Committee's website at rules.house.gov, and you will see how a typical family of four at the median income level will save more than $2,000 a year on its taxes as a result of this plan. The median-income family in Ohio--and in your State wherever you are--is going to be saving more than $2,000 a year on its taxes.  Some have told me, as I walk down the halls here, that is not much money. Do you know what? For families who are living paycheck to paycheck, that is a lot of money, and it does help. It can be used to pay for healthcare, to buy gas, to buy groceries, to maybe add a little more to one's retirement.  Of course, beyond the middle-class tax cuts that are in this legislation, families and workers are going to benefit from more jobs and higher wages, as we talked about earlier. This is going to be because there will be new investment and because there will be more productivity, which is the thing that is really lacking in our economy right now. Our productivity is weak. All of the economists agree on this whether they are right, left, or center. You have to do something to boost that productivity because that is going to result in higher wages, and more competition for workers is going to result in higher wages. That is going to happen because this Tax Code is focused on increasing wages through more investment.  We have talked about how companies are going overseas now and how the status quo is not working. It is crazy that Congress allows that to happen, and fixing it is long overdue. We have talked about the $2.5 trillion, $3 trillion that is stuck overseas right now. We want to bring that home. We want to add more jobs and investment in this country.  We did a study in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations--a bipartisan effort. We studied these companies that go overseas through what is called inversions or by being purchased by a foreign company. What happens? Do they just move their headquarters overseas? We found out they also move jobs and investment.  This is real. It is happening now. We can fix it. That is what this bill is intended to do, and I believe you are going to see not just middle-class tax relief to help with the take-home pay and the family budget, but you are going to see this increase, finally, not just in economic growth but in wages. That also makes the family budget a whole lot more healthy.  I see Senator Cassidy has just come to the floor. Let me address an issue that has been misrepresented on the floor this afternoon.  I heard one of my colleagues say this bill gets rid of the historic tax credit. It does not, thanks to the efforts of some of us who strongly support it, including Senator We actually retain the current 20-percent credit in the Senate-passed bill and in the final legislation. By the way, this historic tax credit has been very helpful. It has been instrumental in generating more private funds to restore historic buildings across my State of Ohio, including in my hometown of Cincinnati, as well as in Cleveland, Columbus, and elsewhere.  We also preserve the important tax credit for urban redevelopment through the new markets tax credit and the private activity bonds, which are still in this legislation just as they are in current law. In Ohio, again, these tax incentives have leveraged a lot more private sector dollars, spurred economic growth, job creation, affordable housing, and I think have ultimately increased the tax revenue because, as people are working and as you get these buildings up and going, economic growth is generated, and so is tax revenue. They pay for themselves, in my view. I have shared some[[Page S8120]]of those success stories in my home State throughout this process, and, again, we have successfully maintained those provisions in our final bill.  The result is, we have a good tax reform bill that achieves the things that Republicans and Democrats alike have long supported--tax cuts for the middle class and a more competitive Tax Code for American workers and companies.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle tonight have talked about this being bad for the deficit. I just have to tell them I respectfully disagree.  The most important thing we can do right now to get the deficit down is to get this growth back because economic growth results in more revenue. One point in economic growth alone puts $2.7 trillion more in revenue into the coffers of the Federal That is based on the numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Think about that--$2.7 trillion more with just one point of economic growth.  The budget score we were forced to use for this legislation estimates a very conservative level of economic growth--at a weak 1.9 percent over the next 10 years. That was the last 10 years. We don't want to repeat that. We don't have to repeat that. The average economic growth over the past 30 years has been more than 2.5 percent, and over the last two quarters, we have had economic growth of 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent. The Federal Reserve's and private forecasts are both above the CBO's growth projections for next year, as an example, to show you why I think the CBO's numbers are way too small, too weak.  That 1.9-percent growth is not only wrong, but I believe it is unacceptable. It cannot be the new normal. With the strength of our economy right now, paired with the pro-growth changes in this tax reform plan, I believe economic growth will surpass this relatively low projection that we are forced to use by increasing economic growth at just 0.4 percent more than this 1.9 percent, this weak projection. In growing the economy at about 2.3 percent rather than at 1.9 percent, on average, there is sufficient revenue to pay for all of the tax relief in this plan plus to begin to pay down the debt.  That is what I believe will happen if you do the right kind of tax reform. It has to be the right kind. It has to be pro-growth. I believe what we have done in this bill is exactly that. There is no question that we are going to have more economic growth and more investment in The current Tax Code is so broken that it is pretty easy to do that, honestly--to create a more efficient and effective and productive Tax I believe a more confident America, with rising wages and stronger economic growth, by the way, is much more likely to address the very real fiscal challenges we face as a country.  This tax reform bill is not just about dollar amounts and bottom lines, though; it is about the investment we are making in American families, American workers, and American businesses. We are giving families the freedom to spend more of their own money how they see fit, we are putting faith in American entrepreneurs and workers to compete and win in the global market, and we are creating a fairer tax system that levels the playing field and creates jobs and investment here in America rather than overseas.  Our constituents deserve this; they deserve better than the status quo. They deserve more than just hollow promises; they deserve a brighter future. I believe the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will reopen our economy as the best place in the world to do business and create that brighter future for all  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

861,topic-id,362,"Mr.President, I want to recognize the upcoming 90th birthday of Albert Ratner on December 26. Albert has led a distinguished life that has touched and benefited countless people in Ohio and around the world.  I consider Albert a dear friend and a wise adviser, and Jane and I have enjoyed the friendship of him and his wife, Audrey, over the years. Whether it is a discussion over dinner or catching up during a Cavs game, we treasure our time with Albert and  Albert grew up in Cleveland during the Great Depression, where his family, who were immigrants from Poland, turned a small company into a thriving business through hard work and dedication. Well known for his civic involvement in Cleveland and as a leader in the Jewish community, Albert is a life trustee of the Cleveland Jewish Community Federation and a member of the International Council of the American Jewish Joint Distribution The Ratner family was instrumental in establishing the Cleveland Jewish Archives at the Western Reserve Historical Society in 1976.  Albert is currently engaged in a series of poverty-related initiatives in his hometown of Cleveland and throughout the State in partnership with the Governor and local leaders. Beyond his influence in Ohio, he has helped those in need across the country by supporting innovative educational initiatives that have given promising youth access to an education that has opened doors for each of them.  Albert is a loving husband and father. He has been married to Audrey for 36 years. His first wife, Faye, who he met in high school, was tragically killed in an automobile accident, after which he continued raising his daughter Deborah and son Brian to follow in his footsteps as fully engaged members of their community. He has lived a life of kindness, cheerfulness, and compassion for all of our fellow citizens.  Albert's life has been guided by a love for his Jewish traditions. He often talks about the Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, to repair the world, and how even when the obligation seems too great, we must not desist from it. That is how he lives. He is truly a great  Happy birthday to Albert                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8251.txt,924,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REFORM AND TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
922,topic-id,1003,"Mr.President, I also wish to talk about something tonight that was not accomplished. It was not accomplished in this vote we just had, which was the continuing resolution that keeps the government funded until  Some of us pushed hard to include various things in this legislation. I understand that some of these items are controversial, and it was hard to get it done because you needed 60 votes tonight. You needed a bipartisan consensus on how to move forward and not shut down the government.  I am not a fan of government shutdowns. They don't work. They are inefficient. They cost the taxpayer more at the end of the day, and they cause a lot of pain in the process.  We had the opportunity to pass certain things tonight that were not controversial. I don't understand why we didn't do it. Some issues, I understand on the spending front, were more controversial. I understand some issues were more controversial in terms of how you deal with the immigration issue. The DACA issue is one that I support resolving. I think we should codify it and resolve that. There were different points of view. People wanted to add different things there.[[Page S8241]]  Let me tell you about one where I don't think there was any disagreement. If we could have passed it tonight, it would have provided a lot of certainty and predictability to families in Ohio and around the country. It is one that passed my committee, the Finance Committee, by a strong vote--not a bipartisan vote but a unanimous vote. That is the Children's Health Insurance Program, or the CHIP program. We passed it with a unanimous vote out of committee.  People say: Well, we need to find pay-fors for it. It is about $8 billion to do what we did, which is a 5-year extension of the program, providing certainty and predictability to families who tonight are wondering what is going to happen to this program. Are my kids going to have the kind of quality healthcare they can access through the Children's Health Program, or the CHIP program?  There are some pay-fors out there that are, again, bipartisan. A big one, which would cover nearly half of that cost, is one where you simply ensure that the Medicaid Program has more integrity. So if a third-party payer is paying, the Medicaid Program doesn't pay for it. It is a bipartisan issue, and there is an initiative we looked at for this program and could have used.  I don't get this notion that we couldn't pass it because we couldn't find the pay-fors. The pay-fors were there. I don't get it that this was controversial, because it is not. I believe that on both sides of the aisle, we wanted to resolve the Children's Health Insurance  Again, with all the other issues, I understand. It is tough when you have to get to 60 votes and get this passed in order to keep the government operating, which is not a situation we should be in, but we are in. I must tell you, I am very disappointed we were not able to deal with this one issue tonight that has not been controversial and that came out of the committee with a unanimous vote--not bipartisan but unanimous.  CHIP now helps 219,000 Ohio children get the health coverage they need and 9 million children nationwide. Ohio has the tenth largest program, and CHIP has been a leading cause in driving the insurance rate down for Ohio kids. In the case of my home State, we have seen our CHIP funding being questioned because the program was authorized until the end of Now it is no longer authorized. We are not sure exactly how much money we have left. We think we have enough to get into February in Some States are worried about even getting into  Tonight, there was a short-term extension that, as I understand it, will take the program into February, but again, it doesn't provide that long-term certainty that families are looking for.  I must tell you that I am disappointed from what I hear about the reasons, because I asked on both sides of the aisle, and one reason I got--- again, this was leadership on both sides of the aisle--is that we can't do it unless we do other things with it. It is called CHIP--Children's Health Insurance Program--but it shouldn't be a political chip. It should be taken out of politics. It should be something that we deal with separately.  I will just tell you that using it as leverage for other programs is not the way I am going to look at it and not the way we should look at it. We should have passed it tonight. We should have passed it to help protect some of the most vulnerable members of our society. Funding should be a top priority, regardless of your partisan position and regardless of the political climate. It should be out of the political fray.  I urge my colleagues, when we come back after the first of the year, let's make that a priority. Let's bring it to the floor. Let's have a vote. Let's keep it bipartisan. Maybe, it could even be unanimous. Let's give those families in Ohio--the 219,000 kids who depend on it--and the millions of families around this country the peace of mind to know that we are extending this program.  Let's do that 5-year extension, that 5-year authorization we already passed in committee. Let's take it out of this political process and put it where it belongs, which is an issue that every single Member of this body should want to address for the kids they represent.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight on the tax reform and tax cut legislation. I do think it will provide the opportunity for everybody I represent to have a better future and a brighter future.  I appreciate the opportunity to talk on the Children's Health Insurance                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8240.txt,924,SYSTEMIC RISK DESIGNATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

254,topic-id,3186,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that excellent and indispensable discussion about what is really at stake here, which is democracy itself. If we can't rely on the integrity of our elections and the authenticity of the results, then democracy is in danger, in deep peril. I thank the gentleman for his leadership and for his outspokenness.  Mr.Speaker, to recap, we are here in this Special Order hour to defend Robert Mueller, because, in America, we live and die by the rule of law under democracy. The rule of law is the revolutionary idea, the one that our forebears fought for in the 18th century, that the most powerful officials in the land will be governed just like everybody else: by constitutional and statutory boundaries fixed in writing in the law in order to protect democracy and the rights of the people.  Ever since he whipped up chants of ``Lock her up'' in the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump has displayed complete ignorance of the difference between a constitutional democracy and a banana republic, a complete ignorance of the role of judges and the Justice  The men and women who work at the Department of Justice for us, they inhabit a world of law, facts, and evidence. They cannot be forced to execute the President's personal vendettas[[Page H10341]]or prosecute his enemies, real or imagined, or provide support for his propaganda and delusional alternative facts.  President Trump has been on a collision course with the rule of law for a long time. Remember during the campaign, Mr.Speaker, when he attacked Judge Curiel for being Mexican American, implying that his ethnic identity somehow disqualified him from being a competent judge with integrity.  In February, he trashed Federal judges hearing arguments about his Muslim ban order. He has questioned the separation of powers, which he says is somehow obsolete. He has railed continuously against the free press and the media, which he describes as the enemy of the people.  He has continued, in direct violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause in Article I, section 9, clause 8, to collect money from foreign governments at the Trump Hotel, at the Trump Tower, at the Trump golf courses without obtaining congressional consent first, which is what the Constitution requires.  The critical flash point for President Trump's hostility to the rule of law recently has been his stubborn and baffling refusal to accept the reality of the Russian campaign to interfere in our election last year, and then his seemingly determination to undermine the investigation into what actually happened.  Most Americans have regarded this campaign of cyber espionage and cyber sabotage of our election as a frightful danger to democratic sovereignty in our country and a reason to dramatically improve election security across the land, as Congressman Schneider just argued; but Donald Trump keeps denying that the autocrat Vladimir Putin, the former director of the KGB, did anything wrong in our election.  He tried to convince then-FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation into Trump's National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and to swear a personal loyalty oath to the When Comey refused these orders, when he refused this entreaty to change the course of the criminal investigation, when he refused to override his oath to the Constitution of the United States by swearing a personal oath to the President, something that we had never heard of before, Trump fired him. This was about as naked a case of obstruction of justice as you can imagine.  Now we hear from President Trump's personal lawyer that the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice. They say, by definition, the President cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because the President is the chief law enforcement officer in the land.  This is analogous to the old monarchical dogma that the king can do no wrong, the king cannot commit a crime, the king is above the law; if the king does it, it can't be illegal.  Well, our friends seem to have forgotten this is the United States of We have got a Constitution here. We have got a Bill of Rights here. We have no kings here. We have no queens here. We have no royalty. We have just we the people, a government of laws, not of men. We have got a Bill of Rights and popular government.  Our friends across the aisle once understood that nobody was above the law. They brought impeachment charges against President Bill Clinton--two charges. One of the charges was obstruction of justice. They moved to impeach President Clinton for obstructing justice, which is now an offense that our friends say a President can't even be guilty of. They brought a case against President Clinton, Clinton v. Jones, which established that a President can even be sued while he is in office and can be deposed and so on.  They understood that at one point. They understand, when a Democrat is President, that nobody's above the law. But now, suddenly, Mr.Speaker, this President is above the law and he gets to determine the course of criminal investigations in the United States of  That is not constitutional democracy. That is a banana republic, when the President dictates to law enforcement, dictates to prosecutors what they are going to do, who they are going to investigate, and who will be prosecuted.  So now the race is on, Mr.Speaker, to smear the The race is on to smear Mr.Mueller, the very man who was praised by Senator McConnell, who was praised by Speaker Ryan, who was described by all of our colleagues as beyond reproach, unimpeachable, the former Director of the FBI, former U.Attorney for Massachusetts and California, a decorated veteran of the Vietnam war.  Now, suddenly, they cry havoc. They set loose the dogs of war on Mr. Why?  Because he is doing his job. Because we have two guilty pleas: one by the President's former National Security Advisor, Mr.Flynn; and one by Mr.Papadopoulos for lying to government agents.  We have got 12-count indictments that have been handed down against Mr.Manafort and Mr.Gates, and they are afraid that investigation might be closing in on the very highest levels of government.  So what do they do?  They attack the prosecution.  That is what we have been seeing in Washington over the last couple of weeks, a truly extraordinary display of contempt for the rule of law, for the Justice Department, and honest prosecution and law enforcement in the United States of  Now, the first effort revolved around an FBI agent who Robert Mueller removed from the investigation in the summertime. He removed him because there were text messages revealed in which he was trashing a lot of political figures, not just President He was trashing Bernie Sanders, who he called an idiot. He also called President Trump an idiot.                              {time}  2030  He had unkind words for Eric Holder, and he had very harsh words for my friend and the former Governor of Maryland, Martin O'He was an equal opportunity insulter.  But our friends, seeing the progress of the Trump-Russia investigation of this special counsel's work, now suddenly decided: We found a villain. We have got our villain. His name is Peter Strzok, and he wrote all these texts, so let's go back to a guy who was removed from the investigation in the summertime. Let's leak all these texts out in the most mysterious and suspicious way, because this was the middle of an inspector general investigation, and they leaked out thousands of texts.  When I asked Mr.Rosenstein about it, he said it had been approved by the inspector general. But the inspector general released a statement the next day which professed that they had not been contacted about it, so there is a whole mystery there.  But, clearly, somebody wanted to get these texts out there. They wanted to create a thick fog of propaganda and confusion. And all that we heard from our colleagues was: Did you see what he said in this text to his friend? Did you see what he said in this text to his friend?  Nobody claimed that the guilty pleas by Flynn or Papadopoulos were legally flawed in any way. They didn't say there were any legal problems with anything that the special counsel had done--no illegal searches, no illegal seizures. They didn't say anything was wrong with the indictment.  But they find some text messages by a guy who was removed from the investigation, and then this becomes the big propaganda smoke screen, this guy who insulted, to my count, a lot more Democrats than he insulted Regardless, he showed unprofessionalism.  He was removed quickly by Mr.Mueller--unlike, for example, what President Trump did when he learned that General Flynn, his National Security Advisor, was a serial liar, was lying to Federal agents, was lying to Federal officers, was lying to the Cabinet about his dealings with Russia and foreign governments.  It took President Trump 18 days before he removed him from office in the most begrudging way, and then, even then, after learning that he had been lying about his contacts with foreign agents, he tried to get Mr.Comey, the then-FBI Director, to cancel out the investigation of Michael Flynn, asserting that he is a good guy. Let it go. Let the whole thing go, he said.  But, no, that is not what Mr.Mueller did, the special counsel. When he learned that there were these text messages going out attacking various public figures, he said: We don't need that[[Page H10342]]kind of stuff on this investigative team. And he got rid of them, end of story.  Except this: It is an opportunity to create an irrelevant distraction from what is going on, to put up a big propaganda smoke screen.  And that wouldn't even be such a big deal in itself. Their arguments are transparently silly. We have colleagues who are saying this is a fruit of the poisonous tree, they intoned. It is all fruit of the poisonous tree.  Except it has nothing to do with fruit of the poisonous tree. That is a Fourth Amendment document which says that, if there is an illegal search or seizure by the government, the government may not use that unlawfully obtained evidence against someone in court. At that point, the exclusionary rule operates; the exclusionary rule is activated.  We asked our colleagues, and I asked Mr.Rosenstein: Was there an illegal search?   Was there an illegal seizure?   There was no illegality. You had an agent who sent some text messages trashing a bunch of politicians in the middle of a Presidential campaign, which is what millions of people were doing. It was irresponsible. He got removed, end of story.  That didn't work so well. That was the first time that they were throwing spaghetti with tomato sauce on it all over the walls. They threw it up and it slipped off. Nobody bought it.  So the next day, or a day later, they came back with another claim about asserting that the GSA had improperly released emails of the Trump Presidential transition team.  Well, there are a few problems with that. One is everybody was told from the beginning that all of those are government property. They were turned over by Trump's GSA, voluntarily. And Mr.Mueller released a one-sentence statement saying that all of the information that we have received was either voluntarily given or was lawfully obtained, end of story.  That didn't work so well either. Threw some more spaghetti against the wall in this smear campaign, and it slides off. It leaves a tomato sauce stain all over the wall, but it doesn't really stick.  Now they are going after Mr.McCabe, the number two person at the And I haven't been told exactly what their complaint is, but we are going to have a closed-door hearing about it tomorrow in the House Judiciary From published reports, all I understand is that he has committed the great sin and crime of being married to a woman who is active in Democratic Party politics.  Look, let's get something straight here. This is the United States of America, and law enforcement officers have a right to be registered as a Democrat, as an Independent, as a Republican, as a Green Party member, as a They can register however they want. And consistent with the Hatch Act, they can be involved in politics and members of their family can be involved in politics. There is nothing wrong that.  There is nothing wrong with the fact that Mr.Mueller, who is now the target of all of their venom, is a registered Republican or that he got appointed by another Republican, Mr.Rosenstein, or that he got appointed by a Republican, Attorney General Sessions, or that he got appointed by a Republican, President Trump; right? All those people are They have a right to be Republicans, but they have got to do their public duty.  The irony, of course, is that the Republicans are attacking Republicans in office for being partisan against It is completely incoherent; it is fantastical; and it shows the desperation of this smear campaign. It just doesn't make sense to anyone.  So we will see if they are able to smear another good, qualified, competent law enforcement official, which is what they want to do with the number two person at the  And what is interesting is that the people who are attacking their fellow Republicans for somehow being partisan just for doing their jobs never have anything to say about what we know was the real political corruption and contamination of the FBI back in the days of Edgar Hoover, when he used the resources of the FBI to go after Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil rights movement, or the days of COINTELPRO, where the FBI actively tried to disrupt the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement and so on. They don't say anything about that.  It would strengthen their argument, of course, that their fellow Republican partisans somehow might be capable of political bias, but they don't even have the historical context to do that, and they don't believe in it.  The fact is that the FBI used to have a real problem with being a tool of political prosecution, and it has gotten over that. It has gotten beyond it today, in 2017.  Now, suddenly, all of their fire is trained on Mr.It is trained on the special counsel: discredit and undermine him. And it wouldn't be such a big deal if they were just exercising their First Amendment rights, which they have every right to do. If they were just exercising their rights under the Speech and Debate Clause, which they have every right to do, to use their place in this body in order to denounce the FBI, to attack Mr.Mueller, to try to discredit law enforcement, they have got the right to do it. But what everyone is afraid of now is that they are trying to set the stage for the removal of Robert  Now, that is no simple thing. The President can't simply fire Mr.He would have to get Mr.Rosenstein to do it. And he can't be fired for any reason at all. He can only be fired for misconduct, for conflict of interest, or for some other good cause or incapacity. So there has got to be a reason why.  And when we asked Mr.Rosenstein whether he saw any reason to remove Mr.Mueller now, he said, no, that he is totally satisfied with the conduct of the investigation.  So what trumped-up alibi could they produce? What trumped-up justification could they find for the removal of Mr.Mueller?  It would create a serious constitutional emergency and crisis in And, of course, when we say a constitutional crisis, it is not the Constitution that is in crisis; it is us. They would be creating a political crisis that would require a resort to extraordinary constitutional mechanisms.  This would be a clearly impeachable offense for the President to use his power in order to thwart a criminal investigation that implicates the That is the very definition of obstruction of justice. It would just be an expansion and a refinement of what the President was doing when he fired Mr.Comey way back in the beginning of the administration for refusing to lay off Michael Flynn and for refusing to swear a personal loyalty oath to the President of the United States instead of to the Constitution and the people of the country.  So that is where we are. The people need to know. The people need to know what is going on, that there is an organized campaign being orchestrated at the highest levels of government to discredit Mr.Mueller and the special counsel investigation--not for not doing their job, but for doing their job. That is why they are being attacked today.  Mr.Speaker, I close with a thought just about the rule of law.  The rule of law is the idea that even the people who occupy the highest office in the land are subject to the Constitution, are subject to the laws of the people, because here the people govern. We have no kings here. That is what we rebelled against.  Our Founders believed, with Madison, that the very definition of tyranny is the collapse of all powers into one, where someone says: I have got all the power; I am the boss. Our Founders said: No, we are going to divide powers up:  Article I, we will vest the lawmaking power in the representatives of the people in the House and the Senate;  Article II, we will create a President who will take care that the laws be faithfully executed;  And then Article III, we will vest the judicial power in the Supreme Court and the Federal judiciary to sort out actual cases or controversies about what the law means.  But notice what comes first there, Article The people's representatives come first. The President works for us. The President works for a Congress,[[Page H10343]]which works for the people. The President implements the laws that we pass here.  The President is not above the law. The President is subject to the law, and the President has the honor of enforcing the laws that we adopt.  So let's get that straight. No one is above the law. Anybody can be found guilty of obstructing justice if one thing can be shown: if they obstruct justice.  And it looks like they are setting the stage for a further obstruction of justice with this outrageous smear campaign being leveled this week against Robert Mueller, against Mr.Rosenstein, against Mr.McCabe, and against the men and women of the That is what is taking place in Washington today.  Mr.Speaker, the people need to know, and we in Congress have got to do our constitutional duty, too.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.Lewis of Minnesota). Remarks in debate in the House may not engage in personalities toward the President or Members of the Senate, whether originating as the Member's own words or being reiterated from another source.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgH10338.txt,1E+14,SYSTEMIC RISK DESIGNATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1147,topic-id,1292,"Mr.Speaker, I am delighted to join this evening. I thank the gentleman for putting together a discussion, a Special Order on this critical piece of legislation, which is now hurdling through Congress today.  I was reflecting, Mr.Speaker, that I had never seen a riot before, and I wonder how many people have been to a riot. And then as I was watching this bill being rammed through Congress, I realized that we were observing up close a riot, a ruling class riot, a trickle-down riot, special interest riot, a 1 percent riot against the rest of the country, the 1 percent that will get 83 percent of the tax cuts, the 1 percent that is overseeing an explosion in our deficit, adding somewhere between $1\1/2\ trillion to $2.3 trillion to our deficit that we are passing on to our children and our grandchildren.  My constituents in Maryland are saying to me: Hey, if we are going to go into an extra $1\1/2\ trillion into deficits and debt, why don't we put that into an infrastructure plan for America? Why not rebuild our transportation system, the roads, the highways, the bridges, the Metro systems, the port authorities, the water systems, and cybersecurity? They are collapsing in front of our very eyes. So if we have got $1\1/2\ trillion that we are going to put on the Federal tab, let's direct it into infrastructure.  But what do they bring us instead?  Old-fashioned, shopworn, and historically discredited trickle-down economics. It never works. It never works to cut taxes on the wealthy and big corporations and hope that the profits will just magically, mysteriously rain down on the middle class and working people.  It has just never worked like that. The only thing that does work is bubble-up middle class economics that gives opportunity to everybody--the poor working people, the middle class--and the money will flow up. The rich will get richer. We have proven it. That when you actually invest in education and you invest in infrastructure and you invest in healthcare, everybody does better. And then, because everybody is doing better, everybody does better, including the wealthy. We don't need to have top-down class warfare, trickle-down economics in But, hey, it is hard to stop a riot once it gets going, and we are in the middle of a riot here.  They said Malcolm X could stop a riot if he wanted to. Well, Paul Ryan could stop this riot if he wanted to. The GOP could stop this riot. Maybe even President Trump could stop this riot. But the American oligarchs, the ones who are friends with the Russian oligarchs, the American oligarchs can taste victory already. They are carting off their They are checking out their gorgeous new yachts. They are measuring the drapes at Mar-a-They are polling for the Senate seats that they plan to buy with all of the new campaign contributions that come rolling in from the Mercers and the Koch brothers and the other plutocrats who are going to make out like bandits with this highway robbery.[[Page H10239]]  In a riot, there is no time for hearings, no time for facts, no time for economic analysis, no time for experts, no time for discussion or democracy. There is no time for us even to read the lousy bills that their lobbyists write for them. They are too busy looting the Treasury in the middle of the night, ransacking Medicare and Medicaid, and trashing the neighborhoods of the beleaguered American middle class by raising taxes on 86 million families over the next decade.  They are too busy trashing the State and local tax deduction, imposing double taxes on our people, something that has not occurred since we developed the tax system back in 1862, when they imposed the first revenue act. In the middle of the Civil War, they exempted State and local taxes.  Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans said then, ``That is double taxation; we won't do it in the middle of the Civil War,'' when they needed to raise money.  And here we are, in a time of record corporate profits, amazing prosperity that comes out of the Obama administration, amazing economic expansion and growth, and what do they want to do?  They want to impose double taxation on what they say is the blue States because now America has got to be divided.  It is their States and our States, so the blue States are going to just pay more. That is the way that they are pursuing their tax policy in the United States You could almost understand and appreciate this trickle-down mob mentality if it were just our own rich people who were wilding against American democracy. After all, the top 1 percent in America today owns only as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent combined. There is still the remnants of the middle class to destroy, and it is hard to keep up with the lifestyle of the rich and famous in Trump's billionaire  So they need to drive 13 million Americans off of their health insurance. They need to make tens of millions of Americans pay more in taxes. But here is the thing: one-third of the corporate windfall in their gigantic corporate tax break, which is the heart of their bill, hundreds of billions of dollars, one-third of the money will go to foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, in China, in The one-third of the American stock that is owned by foreign investors is going to just sail outside of the country immediately when we do this.  And that huge sucking sound of hundreds of billions of dollars flowing to other people's oligarchs will be followed by billions more in investments and millions more in jobs because of another little trick that got tucked into this bag of tricks on the American people and treats for our plutocrats. Their bill changes our tax policy to a territorial system.  Well, what does that mean?  It means, if you are an American businessman and you are setting up your new business, the American businessman or businesswoman, you are setting up your business on Main Street, you are going to pay 100 percent of your taxes due. Your rate is going to go way down under this bill, but you will pay 100 percent. If you ship your business and your jobs overseas to Mexico or Indonesia or Switzerland or Vietnam, you are going to pay zero percent of what you would owe.  Now, I think they put in some tiny, little fix about that saying: Well, if it gets too extreme, if you press the joke too far, you will pay something, maybe 10 percent.  Again, that was written in the middle of the night, so I haven't seen that. That is just a talking point.  But let me just close with this: like a riot, this tax scam has little to recommend it.

All that we are doing is bestowing more of a bonus on them so they can give more money away to the In the stock dividends and in the stock buybacks, it is cash gains within the corporations, so they are going to get wealthier. There is no reason to begrudge that. It is a large part of a lot of people's dreams to make a lot of money, but let's not press a good joke too far.  They are making tons of money right now, and we have got serious needs in the country. We have got an infrastructure crisis. Our roads and our highways and our metro systems and our water systems are suffering--our schools, our universities, our community colleges.  Why not invest in some common things that bring us together as a society, rather than having highway robbery from above against the rest of the country? It is just incomprehensible to me.  I have got to believe this is something to do with the corruption of our campaign finance regime. People are talking about: Well, we are waiting for the contributions to come in, and that they are telling us on the phone they don't want to give us contributions until we pass the tax bill.  So give them hundreds of billions, drive us into trillions of dollars in debt, and then they will give us back hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. It is a bad deal. That is why a lot of parts of the country are moving to public financing now, because it is remarkable how much damage you could do to the country on the cheap with a relatively small investment.

517,topic-id,1525,"Mr.President, tonight, the Republican leadership intends to force a vote on their tax bill. President Trump has called this tax bill historic. Indeed, it will make history, but not for the right reasons. It is a historic transfer of wealth from students, seniors, and working families to the wealthiest corporations and individuals in America and, indeed, throughout the world. Historians and voters will look at the way this bill was written, in a rushed and sloppy manner, without thoughtful debate--indeed, we have to send it back to the House of Representatives so they can vote again--and with a reckless and willful disregard for facts and independent analysis.  In forcing this massive restructuring of our economy through Congress, Republican leaders have permitted no real amendments and ignored every nonpartisan analysis of their bill that does not fit their worldview. As a result, this trickle-down tax bill is quite possibly the most fiscally irresponsible piece of tax legislation to have ever been railroaded through Congress over the objections of the American people.  Some will say: Wait, what about the Affordable Care Act? Let me remind you, the ACA was paid for. It had to get 60 votes. It was on the Senate floor for 25 consecutive days. There was a full committee process, and Democrats accepted many Republican amendments in the House and in the That is not the case with this historic bill.  The Trump tax will adversely affect my home State, Rhode Islanders, in so many ways. The temporary benefits will not cover the long-term damage[[Page S8103]]from this bill or offset the increased costs for things like childcare, education, healthcare, and housing. The reason the American people oppose this bill is simple--and they do oppose it--it forces the middle class to accept yet another Republican tax giveaway to corporations and the richest 1 percent with little or nothing for them.  It also gives trillions of dollars in permanent tax cuts to corporations while raising taxes on over half of American families over the next decade. In doing so, it gives $48 billion to the foreign investors who own roughly 35 percent of American company stock. That is right. Many of these tax benefits will go through corporations by either dividends or stock redemptions to foreign owners, amounting to $48 billion to foreign investors. That is not putting the American working man and woman first; that is putting them at the end of the line. It makes the Tax Code more, rather than less, complicated and very clearly incentivizes and rewards multinational corporations that send jobs and stash money overseas.  Moreover, special loopholes for passthrough entities will create a bonanza for tax lawyers and accountants and people figuring out ways to get out of paying their taxes. It will not help working men and women who come in and punch in every morning, work hard, and then go back to their families. It will not help them at all.  And there is not a single respected economist or tax scholar on the left or right who concludes that this bill simplifies the Tax Code and pays for itself--not one.  Republicans know all these facts. They have heard the public's objections, and they still plan to send this bill to President Trump for his signature. The President will try to tell the American people that his great political victory is a win for working people, but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses--real estate passthroughs. In fact, at the last moment, the conference committee put in a special provision to make sure that real estate entities could benefit from this bill. That means President Trump's organization benefits from this bill.  It is not fair. It is not wise. It is not good policy. The American people know this instinctively. They look at what is going on, and they see this as it is--a giant gift to the wealthiest corporations and individuals at the people's expense in so many different ways.  The consequences of this legislation are going to be staggering and generational. We will not quickly overcome this historic mistake. The total abdication of fiscal responsibility in this bill is stunning. Adding trillions more to the deficit will put massive budget pressure on national defense, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and other vital programs that keep our commitments at home and abroad. These are the programs that allow us to keep faith with the American people who sent us here and also to ensure that we are moving toward a more peaceful and prosperous world. For future generations facing an economic crisis, or the challenge of their time, or cyclical economic downturns that we cannot always foresee, those future generations will look back on this unnecessary tax giveaway and wonder why today's Congress was so irresponsible.  In 2001, I was here, and I opposed the Bush tax cuts. At that time, however, we had an estimated $5 trillion surplus, and we didn't anticipate the 9/11 attacks. We were at a time where Russia was turning away from its Communist past to what we thought was a democratic future. China was just emerging as an economic power in It is a totally different situation today. We all know it. My colleagues on the other side know it. We are challenged by 16 years of war, which we have made no attempt to pay for, and we are putting our national security behind benefits for the wealthiest Americans that are enshrined in this bill, adding $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts for the most wealthy in this Nation and in the world.  Many of the recipients of our largesse--Republican largesse--this evening will not be As I noted, a significant portion of American stock in our companies is held by foreigners. When stock buybacks take place--and that is what corporations have announced they will do--a huge amount of these tax cuts will go outside of the United States, and not help our economy. Maybe it will help some people buy expensive yachts overseas and expensive French Impressionist paintings, but it will not help working people in Pawtucket, RI, or Cranston, RI--not at all. This is a bill that is full of loopholes that will be exploited for years to come. Indeed, we are already hearing rumors that we can expect more legislation to ``fix the bill.''  This would be different if we were talking about real tax reform--real tax reform that benefitted the middle class, real tax reform that raised the earned-income tax credit, real tax reform that benefited people who work every day, wage workers particularly--but this bill doesn't do that. Real tax reform comes as a result of an open and bipartisan process. It is ideally revenue-neutral, like the 1986 law under President Reagan, which took a bipartisan consensus, which made major reform, and which is something that was not only procedurally but economically sound.  I hope, going forward, that we can work together to prevent and undo the damage from this bill and enact real, responsible tax reform that boosts take-home pay, spurs job growth, closes loopholes, expands opportunity, and strengthens the long-term financial stability and security of our But that is not this legislation.  One final point--this Monday, the President announced his national security strategy, his overarching vision of what will make this country safe, secure, and strong as we go forward. Part of that national security strategy is to reduce the debt through fiscal responsibility. My Republican colleagues are about to increase the debt through fiscal irresponsibility. This national security strategy isn't even 24 hours old, and it is being abandoned. It is being abandoned before literally even the pen is dry on the paper. When it comes to tax cuts, national security places far to the rear, and we know what is going to happen. As this deficit grows--and it will grow much larger than the $1.5 trillion that is projected--it will squeeze out spending. It will squeeze out defense spending, despite the efforts on both sides to try to increase support for the military. It is impossible to create a deficit of this magnitude and not see the consequences both on the defense side and the nondefense side.  In fact, I am baffled because we have heard so much--particularly from my Republican colleagues--talk about the need to support our men and women in the field after 16 years of war. Why aren't we at least saying: If we are going to borrow $1.5 trillion, let's give it to the men and women in uniform. We are here tonight saying: Let's give it to the richest people in America and in the world. There is lots of rejoicing going on throughout the world tonight because when shareholders' stock is redeemed in the companies they own, they are going to be wealthier, and they are going to use that wealth not for America but for whatever reason they want. Again, is it a new yacht or a new painting?  I just hope that in the waning few hours of this debate, we can move the consciousness of colleagues and reject this legislation.  I yield the floor.

659,topic-id,935,"Mr.President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Collins, Cochran, Gillibrand, and Murkowski in introducing legislation to renew the law that expands the reach of libraries and museums and enables them to better serve their communities. These vital institutions educate, inform, engage, and connect people from all walks of life.  In 1996, Congress passed the Museum and Library Services Act, establishing the Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS, to house our Nation's library and museum programs together for the first time. My predecessor, the late Senator Claiborne Pell, a great champion for expanding educational and cultural opportunities to all communities, was instrumental in passage of this law. The Senate Committee report for this bill noted the ``great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life, in support of research, learning, and entertainment, and in support of American culture and history.''  Over the last 21 years we have seen IMLS, with a relatively modest Federal investment, build the capacity to support and expand access to library and museum services at the State and local levels. IMLS has been the source of major Federal support for nearly 120,000 libraries, including public, academic, research, special, and tribal libraries, and 35,000 museums, including art, history, science and technology, children's, historical societies, tribal, planetariums, botanic gardens, and zoos. We have seen access to libraries and museums increase, and these institutions continue to evolve as community hubs, advancing the growth and vitality of the areas they serve.  In Rhode Island, IMLS funding for the grants to States program under the Library Services and Technology Act, LSTA, has supported improved online resources; literacy initiatives, including a summer reading program; and the provision of talking books to residents with visual impairments and disabilities. Providence Public Library was awarded a recent grant to provide underserved teens with learning opportunities, leading to digital credentials, academic credit, exposure to work, and entry into education and career pathways. IMLS has also supported and elevated the work of Rhode Island museums. For instance, the Tomaquag Museum in Exeter was one of ten recipients nationally to be recognized with a 2016 National Medal for Museum and Library The Providence Children's Museum and the Preservation Society of Newport County also received grants to support their work in recent years.  I have been proud to continue the work of Senator Pell in supporting robust funding for libraries and museums and authoring the last two renewals of the Museum and Library Services I have seen firsthand the impact libraries and museums have had on our communities in Rhode Island and the residents and visitors they serve, making our State stronger because of the services and experiences that these institutions provide.  The museum and library communities have provided invaluable input in helping us craft this bipartisan legislation. I would especially like to thank the Rhode Island library community for hosting me at libraries across the state and convening a roundtable discussion last year to delve deeper into the programs libraries are providing and ways to improve how they serve their communities.  In response to the input and insight offered by the library and museum communities, the bill we are introducing today, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2017, strengthens the use of data-driven tools to measure the impact and maximize the effectiveness of library and museum services and better tailor local services to address and meet community needs. The legislation provides for technical support and assistance to improve data collection. It also enhances IMLS's collaborative efforts with an expanded number of Federal agencies in order to fully leverage the benefits libraries and museums provide to  This legislation also amends LSTA to highlight the role of libraries as community hubs, equipped to provide services and programming in such areas as literacy, education, lifelong learning, workforce development, economic and business development, digital literacy skills, critical thinking, financial literacy skills, and new and emerging technology. The bill provides greater emphasis on recruiting and training the next generation of library and information science professionals from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. Additionally, it focuses leadership grant funds on activities that serve a range of library types and geographically diverse areas; have evaluation, analysis, and dissemination components; and involve, impact, or have future applicability in libraries. And, in the aftermath of this past year's devastating hurricanes and wildfires, the bill clarifies that grant funds can be used to help libraries get resources back online as communities face the challenge of recovering from a disaster.  The Museum and Library Services Act of 2017 also builds on the over 40-year legacy of Federal support for improving and expanding access to museum services. It addresses the critical need for professional development and recruiting and preparing the next generation of museum professionals, emphasizing diversity so that museums better reflect the communities they serve. The legislation also highlights the educational role of museums and the diverse ways that museums engage their communities, and it encourages partnerships with other agencies, professional networks, and community-based organizations to expand and enhance access to museum services.  The Museum and Library Services Act of 2017 will continue our tradition of supporting our communities through their museums and libraries, while looking ahead and providing flexibility for these vital institutions to respond to changing demands and missions. Our bill has the support of the American Library Association and the American Alliance of Museums and many of their affiliated associations. I thank my colleagues for supporting this endeavor[[Page S8263]]and look forward to more joining us as we work together to urge swift action to adopt this important legislation.

1213,topic-id,1969,"Mr.President, yesterday, we saw a very unusual celebration at the White House as Members of Congress took turns exalting the President and speaking in glowing terms about the tax bill they had passed. There appeared to be quite a contrast between the celebration at the White House and the reaction by working  Why weren't working middle-class Americans celebrating so vigorously? Why does poll after poll find that this is the most unpopular tax bill since the 1980s, in fact, including tax hikes by Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush and President Bill Clinton? This bill is even less popular than those tax increases.  Speaker Ryan seems to think the Republican tax bill is unpopular because Americans don't know what is in it. He is wrong. The American people are smart. They get it. They don't like this tax bill because they do know what is in it: lots of goodies for President Trump and his family and very little for theirs.  This tax bill isn't popular with working people because they know that if Republicans really wanted to give them a tax break, Republicans would have given it to them directly and not to corporate executives. Middle-class[[Page S8228]]Americans remember the corporate excesses that led us to the terrible losses of the great recession. They sacrificed and worked hard to help the economy recover. They remember the tough choices we had to make in order to get our economy working again, and they don't want to see that progress turned back. But the recovered economy President Trump inherited from President Obama is in danger of backsliding under this trickle-down approach, with Republicans once again breaking the Federal bank to give huge tax breaks to the wealthy.  Middle-class Americans weren't popping champagne bottles yesterday because they know that they will be on the hook again when reality sets in on the massive deficits and irresponsible excesses of the Trump economy. The real economy isn't a chart or a graph to them; it is their ability to put food on the table, send their children to college, and plan for retirement. Republican economics have not historically worked out well for them. The economy created over 11 times as many jobs under President Clinton as it did under President George Herbert Walker It created over 10 times as many jobs under President Obama as President George Today, U.job openings are nearing all-time highs and 15 million Americans have gained employment since 2010.  We have much, much more work to do to address issues like underemployment, labor force participation, and wage growth, but the economy Republicans are gambling with today is one that middle-class families worked hard and sacrificed to create. Moreover, middle-class Americans are not easily fooled when it comes to their bottom line. It will take more than focus groups and political publicity stunts to convince them that this Republican bill was written with their interests in mind.  Many Americans opened their paper this morning to read that major corporations like Wells Fargo and others were boosting U.investment or providing bonuses in the wake of the huge tax breaks provided to them by the Republican legislation. It is certainly a good thing that many of these companies are considering greater investments in their American workforce, but the relationship between these tax breaks and higher pay or bonuses seems to fall apart under scrutiny. Some companies, like Wells Fargo, have already admitted that these pay raises were preplanned and not the direct result of the tax bill. Indeed, this coordinated announcement appears more intended to appeal to the Trump administration than to prove anything about the effectiveness of the Republican tax bill for American workers.  Moreover, it appears the real problem many Americans have with the Republican bill is that they believe it will balloon the public debt in order to disproportionately benefit the rich. Based on every credible analysis of the bill to date, they are very likely correct. So, rather than watch for publicity stunts, Americans should, in the coming weeks, watch how much corporate executives take in bonuses. They should look at the more than $70 billion in share buybacks that major corporations have announced since the Senate passed the Republican tax bill. Once corporations got the clear signal that this legislation would likely pass, their reaction was not to raise wages, not to stabilize the pension funds, but to buy back their shares, which is a double benefit for the managers of these companies and for the shareholders.  First, it typically raises the price of the stock on the market, which makes the value go up and gives direct benefits to shareholders. For the managers, most or much of their pay is related to their shareholdings. By the way, they are usually incentivized to increase share price, so their other pay is increased. So it is no surprise that this is the reaction of most corporations. It is quite telling that some company executives have made it clear that their plan for the funds released by this tax bill will be devoted to share buybacks. It is, in fact, ironic because many of these companies were having to pay an effective tax rate of less than 10 percent, much less than the new statutory rate. Does that mean they are going to give even higher wages? If a company was paying an effective tax rate of 8 percent and wasn't significantly raising the wages of their workforce, what does the new statutory rate of 21 percent do to their incentive? Nothing at all.  Americans can and will also consider the fact that 35 percent of American company stock is owned by foreign nationals, who are projected to pocket a $48 billion windfall by 2019 as a result of corporate tax breaks. Yes, this tax bill will incentivize corporations to buy back stock, a significant amount of which is owned by foreign entities, individuals, and corporations. So $48 billion of these funds will go overseas; it won't be devoted to salary increases, wage increases, R&D; it won't even be devoted in some sense to the United States because it will flow overseas.  They should ask: In light of these historically huge gains for the corporate investor class, how many of these corporations will make sure their pension funds, for example, are fully funded? There is no requirement that would prevent a company from buying back stock even while its pension fund is not actuarially sound. That has happened in the past. That is likely to happen in the future. So you have to ask yourself, as working families are: If I have a company that is giving its shareholders and management huge benefits, and my pension is questionable--it is not fully funded--is that right? I think the answer is, honestly: No, that is wrong.  How many companies will ship jobs overseas because they will see a financial advantage? In fact, corporate executives will feel a fiduciary duty to the shareholders to do that. How many companies will continue to replace their workers with contractors who may have no healthcare from the company and no pension benefits? Jobs that could be filled and were filled in the past by real employees with real benefits will now be shipped away from the company to contractors.  I supported efforts by several of my Democratic colleagues to place conditions on these massive corporate tax breaks so that there would be at least some requirement that American workers share in this multitrillion dollar giveaway, but all of these proposals were rejected by our Republican colleagues. I believe they will have to explain to the working men and women of America why shareholders are getting huge benefits and they don't have a fully sound pension fund. Why are additional Americans being laid off by these corporations at the same time they are providing huge buybacks of their stocks to their shareholders? These are a series of questions I think American working families and the middle-class will continue to ask.  They are already aware this bill was not designed for them. It was designed for the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest individuals in America and, indeed, globally. When the evidence mounts, it will further confirm those views. I think they are very, very accurate.  I know Americans will continue to work hard. They will continue to try to build this economy. But with the passage of this bill, this is clearly now President Trump's economy. All of the sacrifice and effort to build jobs under President Obama, which cut the unemployment rate from double digits down to 4.5 and 5 percent--all those could be jeopardized by what has transpired here, and the President owns it.  As we go forward, I think we have to realize this legislation is not going to help working families.  I have heard my colleagues, very sincerely and very eloquently, talk about some of the challenges we face, like job training. We are facing a situation in which many experts predict that within the next 12 years--by 2030--we will lose one-third of the jobs in the United They will go away because of technology and because of artificial intelligence. What is going to happen to the 30- or 40-year-old working man or woman? What does one do when a job he or she has prepared well for, and done very well, is suddenly taken over by a machine? Will one turn to private corporations and ask, please, help me?  I know what the answer will be: Not our responsibility. We only have an obligation to our shareholders--to enrich them. That is all we do. Thank you very much.  They will turn to the government. What will we do? We will say: We are sorry. We are already $1.5 trillion in the hole. Because of the tax bill, we can't afford any job training, career[[Page S8229]]transition, long-term unemployment sustainment, which we will need to allow people to make this transition. Oh, by the way, as to those retirement benefits that are under huge pressure, we cannot help you. We have the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, but that is so underwater.  By the way, with natural phenomena--the floods that are coming--we are currently talking about a disaster relief bill. In this Chamber, we are all aware that our National Flood Insurance Program is in a deep hole. It is--no pun intended--underwater. Where are we going to get this money to pay for the obligations we have already put on our books for the National Flood Insurance Program? What are the cities and communities going to do when we say we don't have it anymore, that we gave the money away?  We are now facing very difficult situations--we know they are coming--with unavoidable costs. There is our national defense. We have to rebuild our nuclear triad, our submarines, our bomber fleets, our land-based systems. Over several years, that will be hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars. We know we have to do it.  Instead of doing that, yesterday, we decided to give $1.5 trillion or more in deficit spending to the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest corporations. I don't think it makes good sense. I think working Americans and middle-class Americans understand that very well--in fact, better than we do, collectively. What they have done, essentially, and what they are saying to anyone who would ask is, this is a terrible piece of legislation. Why did Congress pass it?  That is a question that will reverberate throughout this year and next year and, unfortunately, I think, for a long time because it will take us time and effort and sacrifice and tough votes, as we had in the nineties and again in 2009 and beyond, to get back on track for working families.

1073,topic-id,673,"Madam President, my great State of Idaho is known for excelling in many areas. We are a proud incubator of the American entrepreneurial spirit, with Idaho consistently being ranked as one of the friendliest States in the Nation for small businesses. Idaho is also renowned for our State vegetable, the potato. Millions of people around the world know that Idaho potatoes are in a class of their own. It is only natural that the innovation that Idaho is known for would lead a small business on a mission to assist potato farmers. As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize Double L as the Senate Small Business of the Month for December 2017. Double L maintains a global presence while staying true to the core values of its farming roots in order to enable potato farmers to increase production, expand their harvest, and to achieve their American  Double L was originally founded in 1976 by potato growers Leland Klinger and Lynn Johnson, who initially started the company by building equipment[[Page S8148]]that would meet their own specific needs after being disappointed with the machines currently on the market. It was this entrepreneurial spirit that drove the two to expand into other handling equipment, and the rest is history. In the years since then, Double L has never lost the original manufacturing mindset with which the company was founded, while the company and its employees have certainly expanded their horizons.  In 2004, Chris Hunsaker became CEO of Double L and immediately sought an expansion of both manufacturing and clientele, leading the company to move from its original home in American Falls to Heyburn, With the upbringing of a farmer and the training of a salesman, Chris has ensured that Double L has remained steadfast in its commitment to personalized service for each customer. For example, Double L does not maintain a standing inventory. Each order is built per the customer's specific wants and needs. Additionally, Double L has a commitment to excellence from providing a safe working environment for their employees, to catering to the unique needs of farmers and the equipment that they need. This company has proven consistently over time that, when the market sees a demand for a particular product or service, it is American entrepreneurs like those at Double L who will provide the solution.  With considerable success and trust earned from Double L's loyal clients, the company is still moving forward. Double L has shipped its equipment built in the United States to countries such as China, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, Turkey, Egypt, and This equipment has enabled farmers all across the globe who just a few years ago were harvesting their potatoes by hand to now efficiently complete their harvest using the equipment designed for their unique farms and crop yields, helping them to become sustainable farmers. That simple commitment to providing solutions for growers to be more effective with their harvesting and storage of crops is what allows Double L to be the successful business that it is today.  As a company with a global presence rooted in the growing and handling practices of the Gem State potato farmers, Double L is a prime example of the American entrepreneurial spirit that works to find innovative solutions to empower consumers. By providing quality customer service, cultivating strong working relationships, and maintaining longevity of over 10 years with many of their employees, Double L has shown that not only can they manufacture powerful machines and solutions, but that they are in fact one of the many small businesses that are driving the American economy forward. I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Chris and all of the employees at Double L for being selected as the December 2017 Small Business of the Not only do you make our great State proud, but you also allow for millions more to enjoy Idaho potatoes as well. I look forward to watching the continued success of this strong Idaho business.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8147-3.txt,1896,SYSTEMIC RISK DESIGNATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deceit is in the assumption that we can live with the status quo, Mr. The deceit is a blindness to the recognition that we have a Tax Code that is literally dissolving underneath us. It is dissolving underneath us.  And this Congress has an opportunity to do something transformational, and I propose, along with my colleagues, to be transformational and opportunistic.

It is the status quo that is so off-putting and unsettling and keeps people at arm's length.  What we are proposing is something very different.

347,topic-id,409,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Sessions for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, this is such an interesting thing to listen to. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have characterized the reason that we are here today is because of a blunder in proofreading. Well, it is simply an obtuse argument.  There are three criticisms of the bill:  One is the name change. Good grief, hardly a proofreading error. This title may be cited as the Tax Cuts and Jobs That is section 11000(a). According to the Senate Parliamentarian, it falls out. That is not a proofreading error.  The second criticism is the Cruz amendment, the language that was offered in terms of 529 plans. This was offered on the Senate floor. This was not a part of a conference committee or some late-night scheme. This was openly debated.  Our friends on the other side of the aisle, in the other body, chose not to pursue a point of order at that time. They chose to do it last night. It is their prerogative. But that is not a proofreading problem, nor is the issue as it relates to endowment language. This came out of the Senate Finance But what is interesting to me, Mr.Speaker, is how familiar our friends on the other side of the aisle are with mistakes.  Do you remember the 1099 mandate that came out as a result of ObamaCare?  A huge negative impact on small business, that they had to work with us and others and the President--then-President Obama--in order to remedy.  Do you remember the risk corridor changes that were signed into law by President Obama?  Do you remember the delays by blog posts late on Friday afternoons--to my recollection--when the administration reached the conclusion that the bill was in knots, they couldn't figure out a way to move forward, and they said, ``Let's delay it and let's announce that quietly''? Or decisions not to enforce the law itself?  But the biggest mistake of all was obviously the rollout of the website, which was a complete disaster that even friends on the other side of the aisle can't defend.  With that said, there are going to be technical corrections to this bill, just without question. But I think what we should do is recognize that, speak to that, acknowledge that, and not characterize procedural matters as proofreading errors. It is not an argument that I find persuasive.  Mr.Speaker, I urge the passage of this measure.

184,topic-id,187,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Today we move away from a trickle-down government redistribution economy to one that is bottom up, organic, and growing. While the trickle-down government of the last 8 years was great for Washington and the 1 percent, it did little for the rest of the country.  Today we turn the tide and put money back in the pockets of hardworking taxpayers and Main Street businesses. This bill gives immediate relief to moderate income and middle class families.  A single mom earning $41,000 with one kid will see a tax cut of $1,300, while a family of four making $73,000 will get more than $2,000 back.  The questions are: Will we vote together and put this money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans? Or will we keep that money here in wealthy Washington, D.C.? Will we vote together to level the global playing field for America's businesses and end the unfair status quo that sends American companies and jobs overseas?  It is an easy choice, Mr.Speaker: vote ``yes'' on this bill and let's make America prosperous again.

650,topic-id,4586,"Mr.President, as I try to do every year, if time permits--this will be my seventh year in the U.Senate; sometimes our work here finishes in a different fashion, but if possible, I try to come on the last day of the legislative year and give a speech to kind of recap the year behind us and outline the challenges of the year ahead.  For me, it was, obviously, an eventful year, a productive one, and I believe it has been one for this Chamber, as well, in what is a unique political environment in which politics today is practiced and covered in ways we have never seen before--almost like entertainment. Nevertheless, it was a year that we got a lot of good things done, and I wanted to highlight some of them in the hope that this gives us momentum into the new year.  This has been my first experience with a new President--obviously, not just a new President but a new administration that brought with it a set of individuals in different positions, so I think for all of us it was a transition in that regard. It also was the beginning of a second term, which, at one time, I didn't know I was even going to pursue.  In arriving here earlier this year and getting to work, we slowly but surely got going on a number of key priorities that we had been working on for a very long time. The first one that happened[[Page S8225]]was the VA accountability bill. This was a bill that I had been working on for a number of years. It basically gave the Secretary of the VA the power to fire people at the VA who are not doing a good job. It is that simple. It is not anything more complicated than that. It made it easier to fire people who were not doing a good job. They still have due process to defend themselves.  For the better part of 3 years, there were a lot of objections to that proposal from the previous administration and some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Then everything lined up this year. Senator Tester and Senator Isakson, who are the ranking member and chairman of that committee, came onboard and really helped to push this and to move it forward. It passed in both Chambers and was signed into law by the This was a substantial achievement.  What is interesting about it is that because it was bipartisan, because there was cooperation, and because no one was fighting with anyone on it, it didn't get a lot of press coverage. But it happened, and people need to know about it.  Does it make the VA perfect? Are there still challenges that need to be confronted? This is something that has to do with accountability and the ability to get rid of people who were not doing a good job. It is something that, for years, could not get done because someone always objected and found a way to stop it. Then it came together with people working across the aisle to make it happen. Today, it is the law. Today, there are people who were not doing a good job who are no longer employed at the VA, thanks to this. That is an important thing that people need to know.  I always remind everyone that the overwhelming majority of people who work at the VA are doing a good job. The ones who are not are the ones we need to replace.  The year went on, and I had an opportunity to interface and interact with the National Security Council and with the White House on two foreign policy issues that didn't really require legislation but that I am grateful and excited about having the opportunity to help craft.  The first was the new direction on U.policy toward The previous administration had basically changed our policies toward Cuba--opened it up to much fanfare and, quite frankly, a lot of editorial board excitement.  It was the enlightened position, apparently, to argue that doing more trade with Cuba was going to somehow help Cuba transition to a democracy. But after 2\1/2\ years, it has become apparent that this change has done nothing other than flow more dollars into the hands of that regime and help them in their efforts to normalize.  When President Trump was elected, one of the things he wanted to talk about was what we needed to do to change that relationship back to something that favored the Cuban people and not the Cuban regime. Those changes came about. They were announced earlier this year at an event in South  To cut to the chase, what it does is this: It says that people can still travel to Americans can still go to Cuba as part of a group or as an individual going to support the Cuban people. But if you go to Cuba, whether off a cruise ship, an airplane, or if you are there in support of the Cuban people, you have to spend your money at places that are owned by Cubans--by everyday Cuban people--not by the Cuban military, which is trying to create a monopoly.  For the first time in the history of that tyranny, there is a U.policy that places individuals in Cuba--private individuals in Cuba--in a favored position in comparison to the military and the Castro government. I believe this law will slowly but surely pay dividends as it becomes abundantly clear to the small, independent, private sector in Cuba that the reason they are aren't growing--the reason they aren't attracting more customers--has nothing to do with U.policy. It is because their own government does not want to allow them to be able to grow their businesses.  The Cuban Government feels threatened by private business, 1, because they are Communists and, 2, because they don't want people in Cuba to be able to support themselves. They want people to be dependent upon them; that is how they control politically.  We will see what decision the Cuban Government makes in the months and years to come, but here it is abundantly clear that there are people--Americans--who, under our law, can travel to Cuba, can spend money in Cuba, and they will have to stay at an Airbnb or in a private home or even, if the Cuban Government allows it, a hotel that is owned by a private entity. Where they cannot stay is in places controlled by the Cuban military or companies controlled by the Cuban military.  The second foreign policy issue that we were able to get involved in is another tragedy in our hemisphere; that is, what is happening in To cut to the chase, we have a tyrant who is afraid that he won't get reelected. He lost control of the National Assembly, which is their legislative body. His name is Nicolas So what does he do? He basically figures out a way to create an alternative Congress called the Constituent Assembly, basically modeled after the fraudulent Cuban constituent assembly-like model. What it basically does is it guarantees that certain sectors in society have seats of representation. Instead of seats in Congress by a district or state, they are represented by different sectors, like labor, electricians, you name it.  But here is the funny part about it: The only people who can run for it are the people they allow to run for it, and they also get to count the votes. As you can imagine, that fraudulent Constituent Assembly basically votes 100 percent in favor of whatever he wants, literally with very little dissent. It is not democratically elected. Meanwhile, the legitimate, democratically elected Congress, to use terms that we use here, has basically been intimidated and stripped of their power. Maduro doesn't allow them to be paid anymore; they don't staff anymore; all sorts of things of that nature.  We encourage the President of the United States to pursue first individual sanctions. We encourage the President to grow the list of individuals in Venezuela who are sanctioned and no longer able to benefit from ill-found gains here in the United States and ultimately to prevent them from continuing to do something they have been doing for far too long.  For far too long, they have been stealing the oil from They are selling it in global markets at a discount. Then they use those--to use rough numbers, they take $1 million worth of oil and sell it for half a million dollars. Then they will take some of that half a million dollars and use it to pay the interest on the debt they already owe. Then the rest of that cash, they use for themselves, and they sprinkle a little bit of it to some of the elites around them just to keep them loyal to the regime. Those are the midlevel or high-level military officials who decide, well, things aren't great in Venezuela, but at least my family is better off than everybody else because we are loyal to the regime.  The President moved to stop that. Today, U.entities can no longer trade in these fraudulent, illegal bonds that are stolen from the people of This is a tragic situation. This is not an embargo. This is not economic warfare, which is what Maduro calls it. This, basically, is preventing them from continuing to steal.  I would add one more point to this. I encourage every one of you, if you can, to read an article in the New York Times that appeared last weekend, a pretty extensive series on starvation. Children are literally starving to death in Venezuela is the richest country in the hemisphere, the richest country in South America, in terms of being one of the most oil-rich countries in the world. Venezuela is a nation with a long history of stable economics and even the longest democratic tradition in South There are children starving. We see images that we normally associate with other continents at other times in our history--children starving to death in Meanwhile, he looks as though he weighs more than he ever has before, and all the people who surround him in his government are heavier, fatter than they have ever been before. People are starving because of that. It is not because of U.policy. It is not because of sanctions. There is no one in[[Page S8226]]the world, other than his handful of cronies, who would argue that it has anything to do with sanctions. It is because of them, because in addition to being incompetent, they are criminals.  The Venezuelan Government, from the top down and everywhere in between, is filled with narcotraffickers, with people who allow narcotraffickers from Mexico and from Colombia to fly into and use airports in Venezuela to traffic drugs. Just imagine for a moment, in this country, if our elected officials said to certain drug dealers: If you pay us, not only will the DEA not stop you from trafficking in drugs, but they will help you move it. That is what happens in Imagine for a moment if the Department of Defense went to drug dealers and said: If you pay us, not only will we allow your planes to fly, we will tell you what time to take off and we will escort you in our airspace. That is Venezuela--state-sponsored narcotrafficking at every level.  By the way, they offer another service. If you don't pay them, they will tell you: Don't worry, we will arrest the rival drug dealer, but we will protect the ones who pay us.  There are some very wealthy people in that government. In addition to corruption and stealing from the people of Venezuela, they are narcotraffickers. The Vice President of Venezuela is a narcotrafficker, sanctioned by the United States as a drug kingpin, and it goes on from there. The Vice President of the party, who controls their intelligence services--a thug by the name of Diosdado Cabello--is a drug trafficker. The nephews of the President of Venezuela, the nephews of his wife, the First Lady, were just convicted and sentenced last week, in a court in New York, for drug trafficking. By the way, in their testimony, it is all filled with evidence.  I hope in the new year that we can find a way to continue to support the brave people of Venezuela and a better way forward. We would hope, by the way, that even in the Venezuelan Government, even in that fraudulent Constituent Assembly, we would hope that there are people there, like Hugo Chavez, who believed in the stuff he believed in--but they would have to see that this is a disaster, that this incompetent man is destroying their country and starving their children, and that there is no future in the direction they are headed. We hope this situation improves in the years to come.  Senator Cardin was on the floor yesterday discussing this, and I want to reiterate that I hope that early next year, we can move on a bill that we introduced together called the Venezuelan Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act of 2017. This helps address this problem. It puts in place a plan to help with this humanitarian crisis. We need a government that allows us to do it. But knowing that the United States, working with Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Spain, and the European Union--knowing that these countries are ready to step in and help might be an incentive for decent people still left in that government to step forward and begin a process of transition.  It was an interesting year, and one more legislative initiative that we took on was the RACE for It is a pediatric cancer initiative. There are not enough innovations in pediatric cancer when you compare it to adult cancer. This law requires pharmaceuticals to begin testing adult drugs on pediatric populations so that hopefully we can develop more pediatric medicines. I worked on that with Senator Bennet of We got it passed and signed into law. Again, it is not something that got a lot of attention because it was bipartisan and not controversial, but it is important. We are proud of the good work we accomplished this year in that regard.  We had hurricanes that impacted Florida not once but twice, first Hurricane Irma and then Hurricane Maria, which struck Puerto Rico and had an impact on Florida as well. Approximately 200,000 U.citizens from Puerto Rico have moved to Florida because there is no electricity, because the island had already been hit previously, and because it is facing a financial disaster, and now it got hit by the storm. We were very involved in helping there. In particular, we worked with Resident Commissioner Jenniffer Gonzalez, who is a true and dedicated public servant to the people of Puerto Rico, 1, in getting the right response. It took a little too long for the response to get going, but it finally started moving. But there is still so much to be done. The estimates are that it will be another 8 months before power is restored.  A disaster like that is never good news, but for the first time at least in 7 years, I feel as though my colleagues know more about Puerto Rico than ever before. They understand the challenges it faces because of its unique status. They understand the preexisting challenges it faced before the storm, and they understand what lies ahead.  I don't mean this disrespectfully, but there was a time when people sometimes would talk to me about Puerto Rico as though it were a foreign country. We have to remind them that these are U.citizens. On a per capita basis, they volunteer to serve in the Armed Forces as much as or more than anyone else in the United  I hope that in the year to come we will redouble our efforts, particularly in disaster relief, to ensure that Puerto Rico doesn't just recover but is rebuilt stronger than ever so that we don't have to continue to revisit this in the future when the inevitable happens, because they will face a storm again.  Of course, just a few days ago, we passed tax reform. Not everybody likes it, but I think more people will as they start to see its true implications. By March of this year, the overwhelming majority of Americans are going to notice that their paychecks are bigger than they were a year ago, and if they didn't get a raise, it will be solely based on tax reform. If I were king for a day, the law would look a little different. But we don't have kings in America; we have a constitutional republic in which making things better is our goal. Sometimes if you get 70 or 80 percent of what you want, that is certainly a victory. Sometimes if you get 50 percent of what you want, that is a victory. Most change in America happens incrementally through our constitutional republic. Every now and then, we can take major steps forward.  Here is the bottom line: America's Tax Code today is better than it was before this bill passed. Do I think we went a little too far in the direction of multinational corporations? Perhaps--not that it is going to hurt the economy. But I thought some of that could have been geared toward working families through a further expansion of the child tax credit. But over all, I do believe it will help grow our economy, and more importantly, I do believe it will leave more money in the hands of Americans to be able to spend it on their families. It is their money. It is not ours.  The best way to look at it is, if I came here and said that I wanted to spend $2 trillion over the next 10 years--borrowed money--to give it to the government so the government could stimulate the economy, there would be a lot of support from the other side of the aisle and from the press. They would call it genius and enlightened for a Republican to think that way. But if we say we want to leave $1.5 to $2 trillion in the hands of the American people and the private sector so they can stimulate the economy instead, it is a disaster and it is irresponsible. It is just a philosophical difference of opinion.  There is a role for government. We must fund it. We have to rebuild our military. We talked about disaster relief. There are important things for government to do. But by and large, a dollar spent by the private sector or by an individual family is going to generate more growth than a dollar spent by the government. We fund government not to grow the economy but to help sustain it and protect it and keep us safe and the food that we eat and the airplanes we travel on and certainly from threats foreign and domestic. Economic growth is a function of the private sector and of individuals, and tax reform helps to achieve it. That alone won't be enough.  One of the singular challenges in America today that we must confront in the new year, hopefully, is the skills gap. It is not just a throwaway phrase; it is the fact that the best paying jobs, the ones that actually pay enough to raise a family and save for retirement--those jobs require skills that[[Page S8227]]our schools aren't teaching. Those jobs require skills that millions of Americans do not have. We have to change that. We have to make it easier not just to graduate people at 18 years of age ready to work, we have to make it easier for people at 45 to be able to go back to some sort of school and acquire the skills they need for a better paying job. That will lead to economic growth. That will help fill the 2 million to 3 million unfilled jobs that we cannot find people in this country with the right skills to fill. That is how people get a raise as a part of economic growth, and I hope the new year provides an opportunity for that.  I would add that, in addition to that, the new year will provide us an opportunity to focus on infrastructure, which is critical. My State of Florida is particularly impacted by not just storms but sea level rise in coastal areas, and there are things we can do to mitigate against it. We need to restore the Everglades, and, of course, we need roads and bridges and to improve our infrastructure and airports. Hopefully, we can confront that as we work on infrastructure.  Mr.President, 2018 will be a year that we will deal with the farm bill. I hope action will be taken to reform crop insurance, to ensure that my State's farmers are never in the position they were put in after Hurricane Irma, with neither a reliable safety net, nor a reliable commitment from the Federal Government to step in when Federal programs fail to meet disaster needs.  Next year could be a water resources year, a water year. Again, it is an opportunity for us to do critical things for our infrastructure. In Florida, beach renourishment and intercoastal navigation projects are important not just to our way of life but to our tourism industry. There are harbor dredging projects with the expansion of the Panama It is important that these things get done next year. They won't get as much controversy or fanfare, but these are critical things that we can do.  Another opportunity next year that we have heard some talk about is the ability to reform the social safety net. On that front, I would say that is an issue that I have pushed for for a very long time. But sometimes when you talk about reform, people think you are coming at it because you want to cut. For me, it is not so much about cutting; it is about improving the way we deliver the same services. How can we use the money we are already spending in the safety net but in a better way?  I believe in the safety net. I actually don't believe free enterprise works unless we have one. People are not going to take risks, people are not going to strive if they think that if they fall, the consequences will be economic devastation. You have to have a safety net to take care of those who cannot take care of themselves--the permanently disabled, the elderly and the like--but you also have to have a safety net for people who have come upon tough times until they can get back on their feet and try again.  But I fear--in fact, I realized long ago--that our safety net programs treat the symptoms of poverty, but they do not cure it. That is why I hope that if and when we tackle the social safety net--and I hope we will in 2018--it will not be so much about cutting as it will be about reorganizing and improving. Yes, we will take care of people in their emergent and immediate needs. But we will also make it easier for you to go back to school and get a degree or a technical certification so that you can find a job and never again rely on the government. If we do that for enough people, it will save us money because fewer people will be on the social safety net. But that should not be the reason we tackle it--not as a cost-saving exercise, but as a way to lift up more  We are in a global competition, and our chief geopolitical competitor in the economic space in the 21st century will be China has over three times as many people as we do, and we have to compete against them. They have 1 billion, and we have 380 million or 400 million people. We are competing against an economy with three times as many people. We need everyone. We are not a nation that can afford economically to leave anyone behind, and we are a nation in which leaving anyone behind would be a betrayal of our founding principles. That is why I hope we will tackle it next year--if we tackle the social safety net--with job training programs.  In a few moments, the Senate will hopefully take up and vote on the continuing resolution. I know everyone is anxious to return to their States and homes for the holiday. I will say that I am disappointed we are leaving here at the end of this year not having taken on a disaster relief bill that I know the people in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and--with the wildfires--out West need. I believe we will confront it in the early part of next year, along with a permanent extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program and other matters.  Next year will bring an opportunity, as well, to deal with things like immigration security, the opportunity to deal with young people brought to this country, through no fault of their own, by their parents who now find themselves here, illegally, in the country. I believe there is a real chance next year to provide them certainty and the ability to stay in this country for the future.  All these things are there, and they will happen in the early part of the year. But, at least when it comes to disaster relief, it is disappointing that we won't be able to do that--largely for legislative strategic reasons, not for policy ones. But I am confident we will deal with it in the early part of next year.  I actually think that in 2018, despite it being an election year, if we allow the momentum that closed out this year to carry over to the new one, we will have a chance to do good things for our country.  In the end, given our differences that exist in this country today, it is hard to imagine we will ever always agree that every idea is a good one, but I hope we can all agree that our job here is to make things better. Sometimes making things better means 1 step forward, and sometimes it means 50 steps forward. But as long as we are moving forward in a pattern of perpetual improvement, I think we should be proud of the work we are doing.  I think, by and large, in 2017, despite the fits and starts, despite the controversies, despite the headlines every morning about the outrage of the day or questions in the afternoon that usually begin with ``How did you feel about the tweet on this or on that?''--despite all those distractions, I think 2017 will go down as a year of consequential improvement, where things happened in this Chamber and in this city that made America better, not worse. On that, I hope we can continue to work.  I wish all the people of Florida, all my colleagues, all the people of this great country and around the world a happy Hanukkah, a merry Christmas, and a happy New I look forward to working together and making things better in the year to come.  I yield the floor.

1006,topic-id,566,"Mr.President: I wish to pay tribute to a member of my staff, Kris Tande, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of this year. This is not the first time he has retired from public service as retired Navy Capt Ludvig Kris Tande spent a career as a naval aviator prior to working for several legislators from the State of  Captain Tande currently serves as my senior State military director, and I am the fourth Florida Senator to have had Captain Tande help me represent northwest Starting in 1998, Captain Tande served as regional director for Senator Connie Mack, later serving in the same position for Senators Mel Martinez and George Former Congressman Jeff Miller tapped Captain Tande as his district director from 2001-2005. Captain Tande has served the constituents of Northwest Florida for the past 19 years, a term that notably included the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, which saw Florida gain vital military missions such as the relocation of 7th Special Forces Group from North Carolina and the standup of multiservice F-35 Joint Strike Fighter training at Eglin Air Force During my time, when our country lost one of its brave troops, Captain Tande helped connect me with the families to whom we owed a great debt. When disaster struck, Captain Tande was instrumental in assisting Floridians adversely affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that resulted in substantial economic damage in northwest  Former Senator Mel Martinez has this to say about Kris: ``Captain Tande was one of the most valued members of my Senate staff. My service in the Senate came at the beginning of the `War on Terror'. Kris provided me valuable insight into the military issues we were confronting. He particularly helped me to understand the plight of military families impacted by long deployments, and the physical cost of war on our troops. He was much more than a regional representative. He was an integral part of my Senate life. Kris became a friend and trusted advisor and was a genuine pleasure to know. My visits to the Panhandle were always great because of good, cheerful company and a car full of snacks! Captain, enjoy a well-earned retirement and thank you for your many years of dedicated service to our country.''  For many people, this could be considered a full career. For Kris Tande, this was his second act. Captain Tande was designated a Naval aviator in 1970 and subsequently flew 4,000 hours in helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft and deployed on several aircraft carriers. He is a plankowner of the amphibious ship USS Wasp LHD-1. Tande held several commands, most notably as commanding officer Naval Air Station Whiting Field, 1993-1995, in Milton, FL, and commander Training Wing Five (1995). His flight helmet sits in the reconstructed NAS Cubi Point Officers' Club, originally in the Republic of the Philippines, now at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola,  As he leaves the service of his country and heads into retirement with his wife of 47 years, J.J., his four children, and six beloved grandsons, I wanted to thank Captain Tande for his service to his country and particularly to northwest The business, military personnel, veteran and their families who make up so much of the Florida Panhandle will miss this good public servant's steady hand.  Best wishes to Kris and J.as they embark on a well-earned retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8179.txt,2084,1015,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

505,topic-id,1758,"Mr.President, a few moments ago, my friend from South Dakota was speaking about the bill. He made one statement that I do agree with, and that is, just because you say something over and over again does not make it true. Unfortunately, much of what he said is just not accurate. The truth is that what we are seeing today, in an unprecedented way, is the looting of the Federal  Today marks a great victory for the very wealthy campaign contributors who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to the Republican These billionaires will see a huge tax break for themselves at the same time as the deficit of this country is driven up by about $1.5 trillion.  Today is also a victory for the largest, the most profitable corporations in America, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, and General Electric, which, despite recordbreaking profits, will now see hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.  At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where the people on top are becoming wealthier while the middle class shrinks and 40 million live in poverty, this legislation--according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center--will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent, while increasing taxes on 92 million middle-class households by the end of the decade. Let me repeat that. By the end of the decade, this legislation will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent and, incredibly, 60 percent of the benefits to the top one-tenth of 1 percent, while, at the end of the decade, 92 million middle-class households will be paying more in taxes.  Does anybody really believe that when we have such a massive gap in income and wealth inequality, we should be giving 60 percent of the benefits in this bill to the top one-tenth of 1 percent?  It says a lot about the priorities of the Republican Party when the tax breaks for corporations in this bill are permanent, while the tax breaks for working families expire at the end of 8 years.  Furthermore, I hope that every American is listening to what Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is saying, and other Republicans, when they talk about how they are going to offset the $1.5 trillion in deficits they just created by giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporations. What Ryan is saying and many other Republicans are saying is that they are going to come back and offset that $1.5 trillion in deficits by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and And if I am wrong on that assertion, I would hope that some of my Republican colleagues would come down to the floor and say that I am wrong, but I do not suspect that will be the case.  During his campaign for the White House, Donald Trump said over and over again to the American people, quote after quote, day after day, that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Well, I say to the President: For once in your life, keep the promises that you made, and tell the Republican leadership now that you will veto any legislation that cuts Social Security, Medicare, or I suspect we will not be seeing a tweet from the President on that issue.  Moving toward passing this very unfair piece of legislation, the Republican leadership--which controls the House and the Senate--will move soon to shut down the Congress and head home for a holiday break. After massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations, they believe their work is done, and they are ready to head home.  Well, I respectfully disagree. Maybe, just maybe, before Congress adjourns for the holidays, we should start paying attention to the needs of the working families of this country, to the middle class of this country, and not just the billionaire class.  We need to address the crisis that faces some 800,000 young people who are currently in the DACA Without the legal protections afforded by the DACA Program, these young people today are living in constant fear and anxiety that they may lose their legal status and, in fact, be deported from the only country they have ever known.  Imagine somebody who is 20 or 25 years of age, has lived in the United States virtually his or her entire life, went to school here, now has a job, now is in college, now is in the military, and because of Trump's disastrous attack on DACA, repealing DACA, 800,000 young people are worried about whether they are going to be able to even stay in this country.[[Page S8100]]  The American people are very clear about how they feel about this issue. I believe just today there was a Quinnipiac poll that appeared on this very issue, and this was the question:       Which comes closest to your view about undocumented      immigrants who were brought to the U.as children? A) They      should be allowed to stay in the United States and to      eventually apply for U.citizenship. B) They should be      allowed to remain in the United States, but not be allowed to      apply for U.citizenship. C) They should be required to      leave the U. That was the question asked of the American people.  Here is the answer. Seventy-seven percent of the American people--77 percent--say that these young people should be allowed to stay in the United States and move toward citizenship. Seven percent say they that should stay in the United States but not gain citizenship. Twelve percent say that they should be forced to leave the United  Republicans, by overwhelming numbers, say that these young people, these Dreamers who have spent their entire lives in this country, who know no other country, should be allowed to stay in America and apply for citizenship. Ninety-one percent of Democrats say that, and 81 percent of Independents say that.  As we speak, young people are losing their legal status. We have to act on that and act on that now, before we adjourn for the holidays. Put yourself in the place of a 20-, 25-year-old person living in extraordinary anxiety. We have to act now to address those concerns. We have to do what the American people want us to do.  As I think most people know, the Koch brothers are the major funders of the Republican They have probably given billions of dollars over the years. Even Charles Koch acknowledges that the right thing to do is to provide legal status for the  Let me quote from a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by Charles Koch and Tim Cook, the head of Apple:       The United States is at its best when all people are free      to pursue their dreams. Our country has enjoyed unparalleled      success by welcoming people from around the world who seek to      make a better life for themselves and their families, no      matter what their backgrounds. It is our differences that      help us to learn from each other, to challenge our old ways      of thinking and to discover innovative solutions that benefit      us all. To advance that prosperity and build an even stronger      future, each successive generation--including, today, our      own--must show the courage to embrace that diversity and to      do what is right.       We have no illusions about how difficult it can be to get      things done in Washington, and we know that people of good      faith disagree about aspects of immigration policy. If ever      there were an occasion to come together to help people      improve their lives, this is it. By acting now to ensure the      dreamers can realize their potential by continuing to      contribute to our country, Congress can reaffirm this      essential American ideal.

But it is not just the need to address the crisis facing our As you know, community health centers providing health insurance, healthcare, for 27 million people have not been reauthorized or refunded. We have to address that issue, and we have to address it now.  Nine million children are in the Children's Health Insurance While we are busy giving tax breaks to billionaires, we have not had time to reauthorize a health insurance program for the children of this country. We should be ashamed of ourselves.  We have disaster relief out there. Folks in Congress will go home to celebrate the holidays, and will light up our homes. In Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, they can't light up their homes because many of them still don't have electricity as a result of the recent disasters they have experienced. We need to do disaster relief. We need to do it now for the people of Puerto Rico, for the people of the Virgin Islands, for the people of Texas, and for the people of  There are 1.5 million workers who are about to lose the pensions they were promised, and those pensions, after a lifetime of work, will be reduced by 60 percent if we don't address the multiemployer pension plan crisis. We have to do that.  Over 40 million people in this country are dealing with student debt. They leave college deeply in debt. Many of them are in despair because of their financial situations--because of their outrageous levels of student debt. We have to address that.  We have an opioid epidemic that is killing people from coast to coast. We have to start investing in treatment and prevention.  We have 30,000 vacancies in the VA today.

In that regard, I would tell my friend that this afternoon, the Senate Parliamentarian advised that certain provisions of the Republican tax legislation violate the Byrd rule, including a provision allowing for the use of 529 savings accounts for home schooling expenses; the short title--the Tax Cut and Jobs Act--and part of the criteria used to determine whether the endowments of private universities are subject to the legislation's new excise tax.

580,topic-id,2148,"Mr.President, I understand that my Republican colleagues and President Trump are busy celebrating the passage of the tax bill that was voted on at 1:30 in the morning. They are very excited, and they are very happy about it. I understand that. I guess, if one is a billionaire like President Trump or is a wealthy campaign contributor, you do have a whole lot to celebrate. Maybe, if you are 1 of the 6,000 lobbyists here in Washington, DC, who helped to write the bill, you are celebrating a lot today. Yet, if you are one of the vast majority of the American people who is in the middle class, you should not be celebrating today. In fact, you should be pretty nervous.  The passage of this legislation marks a great victory for the Koch brothers and other wealthy campaign contributors who will see, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, huge tax breaks for themselves. In other words, the wealthiest people will become much wealthier. Meanwhile, the deficit--what is owed by our kids and our grandchildren--will increase by $1.5 trillion as a result of this bill. The largest and most profitable corporations--companies like Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, and General Electric--despite record breaking profits, are going to see very, very large tax breaks to the tune of many billions of dollars.  Now, at a time when the very wealthy are becoming much richer, tens of millions of American families are struggling to keep their heads above water economically. There are 40 million Americans who are living in poverty. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center tells us that in terms of this legislation, 83 percent of the tax benefits will go to the top 1 percent by the end of the decade, who are already doing phenomenally well, and that 60 percent of the benefits will go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent. Meanwhile, at the end of 10 years, some 92 million middle-class households will be paying more in taxes.  On top of all of that, as the only Nation--major country--on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people, this bill will result in 13 million Americans losing their health insurance. I understand the President was really excited about this. Hey, what a great day. There are 13 million more Americans who are losing their health insurance when we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people.  In the ending of the individual mandate, what all of the experts tell us is that our healthcare premiums will go up. If you are an average person out there, your healthcare premiums will very likely go up as a result of this legislation. Meanwhile, starting next year--I am not talking about 10 years from now--some 8 million middle-class families will pay more in taxes.  Doesn't it say a lot about Republican priorities when they make permanent the tax breaks for corporations; yet they make temporary the tax breaks for working families, which will expire in 8 years?  Furthermore, I would hope that every American is listening closely to what Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is talking about. I have to give Ryan credit for being pretty honest about the intentions of the Republican Just this morning, he was on ABC, saying what he has said for quite a while, and that is that the Republican plan is a two-step approach. Step 1 is passing the legislation that passed last night here and today in the Step 2 is, having run up a deficit of $1.5 trillion, they are now going to come back and offset that deficit by making massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  According to Ryan, they have a two-step program. Step 1 is to give massive tax breaks to the rich and large corporations and to run up the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Step 2 is to offset that deficit by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and  How unspeakable and outrageous is this plan? How much does it go against what the American people want? This gives huge tax breaks to billionaires--to the Trump family, to the Koch brothers--and then pays for those tax breaks by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and  There are millions of senior citizens and people with disabilities in Vermont and all across this country who, today, are struggling to buy food, to heat their homes, and to buy the prescription drugs that they need because they are trying to survive on $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 a year in Social There are people who have worked their entire lives and have exhausted themselves as they approach retirement. Do not tell those people who live on $12,000, $13,000 a year in Social Security that you are going to cut their benefits through a Chained CPI or by some other mechanism in order to give tax breaks to billionaires. How outrageous that would be.  Don't tell older workers--many of them with health problems after their having worked 20, 30, 40 years--that you are going to give billions of dollars in tax breaks to Microsoft, Pfizer, or General Electric, but then you are going to ask them to work more years in order to be eligible for  I understand that every Member of the Congress would like to go home for the holiday season, and so would This is the time of year during which Vermont is very, very beautiful. The truth is that it would really be unconscionable for us to leave Washington after giving tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations while we ignore the enormous problems that are facing the middle class and working families of our country.  When Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, the DACA Program, nearly 800,000 lives were thrown into chaos and uncertainty. Without the legal protections afforded by the DACA Program, hundreds of thousands of young people today are living in terrible fear and anxiety about losing the legal status they currently have in the only country they have ever known. These are young people who grew up in the United States, went to school in the United States, are working in the United States, and are in our military. This is their home. It would be unspeakable to take away their legal status and subject them to deportation.  Since the President's announcement in September, more than 11,000 people have already lost their protections under DACA, with approximately 22,000 set to lose their legal protections by the March 5, 2018, deadline. These are hundreds of thousands of wonderful young people. We cannot turn our backs on them. We must deal with DACA before we leave for the holiday break. Any end-of-the-year spending agreement must address the fear and uncertainty caused by the administration's reckless actions, and a clean Dream Act must be signed into law.  This is not just what Bernie Sanders wants; this is what the American people in overwhelming numbers want. A Quinnipiac poll came out just the other day in which 77 percent of the American people supported maintaining legal status for these young people and allowing them to move forward toward citizenship--77 percent--and that is consistent with other polls that have been taken. A vast majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents understand that it would be incredibly cruel and harmful to our country in so many ways to deny legal status to the We cannot turn our backs on the We must address their crisis right now.  It has been almost 3 months since funding for community health centers has lapsed. Our Nation's 1,400 community health centers serve more than 27 million people in roughly 10,000 communities throughout the country. In my home State of Vermont, one out of four Vermonters gets their primary healthcare, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, and mental health counseling at a community health center.  How does it happen that the Republican leadership can spend months on a bill to give tax breaks to billionaires but not address the lack of funding, the reauthorization of the Community Health Centers Program or the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides healthcare to 9 million children?  In this country, there are 1.5 million workers and retirees in multi-employer pension plans who could see the pensions that they worked for over their entire lives cut by up to 60 percent. People were promised these pensions a few years ago, and in a disastrous act, Congress took away that promise, and[[Page S8176]]working people could lose the pensions they were promised by up to 60 percent cuts in those pensions. Congress needs to act before the end of the year to make sure that no one in America in a multi-employer pension plan will see their pension cut.  Those are real issues impacting real people, but there are more. There was an article recently in the Washington Post, and it said that because of major cuts to the Social Security Administration, people with disabilities are not getting their claims processed in a timely manner. The result was that in 1 year, if you can believe it, 10,000 people with disabilities died before they got their claims processed.  What the Republicans have been very active on is making sure that the Social Security Administration does not get the funding it needs, which means that it is harder for people who have retired and people who have disabilities to get the information they need or the claims that they have processed in a timely manner. We must make sure that every senior and person with a disability gets treated with dignity. We have to restore adequate funding to the Social Security  One of the great outrages that currently is taking place in this country and really is quite beyond belief is that at a time when we live in a competitive global economy and when we need the best educated workforce in the world to be able to do the new jobs that are being created, which require more education, we have over 40 million people in our country who have left college or graduate school in debt and sometimes deeply in debt. I am talking about people I have met who have gone to medical school or dental school and are $300,000 or $400,000 in debt. People graduate college $100,000 or $150,000 in debt. This is a crisis that is impacting millions of people. It is impacting our entire economy. It is an issue that must be addressed. Maybe, just maybe, before we give tax breaks to billionaires, we might want to significantly lower the debt burden so many people in this country have in their student debt.  This is the year 2017, soon to be 2018. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Yet there are communities in Vermont, Utah, and communities all over this country that do not have adequate broadband service. How does a business start up in a community if that community does not have rapid broadband or good cell phone service? The answer is, it doesn't. It can't. That is one of the reasons why rural America is hurting so badly. We must invest in rural infrastructure to make sure every community in this country has quality, affordable broadband.  There is an opioid epidemic sweeping this country, impacting Vermont, my neighboring State of New Hampshire, West Virginia, Kentucky, and all parts of this country are seeing people dying from overdoses from opioids and heroin. This is an epidemic that must be addressed. We can't simply walk out of here and leave people all across the country without the resources they need to treat people who are addicted and to prevent our young people from becoming addicts. We need to invest in treatment and prevention for the opioid epidemic.  As we speak, there are over 30,000 vacancies in the Veterans' That means that we have to make sure every veteran in this country who goes to the VA gets the quality and timely healthcare he or she needs. We can't turn our backs on the veterans. We have to invest in the  The bottom line is that, as much as all of us would like to get out of Washington and go home, we simply cannot turn our backs on tens of millions of working people and people in the middle class. It is not good enough to pass tax breaks for billionaires and then leave town. So I hope the Republican leadership will immediately bring to this floor the legislation that we need to address the many crises facing the middle class of this country.  With that Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

392,topic-id,508,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, this amendment is about promoting greater transparency and shareholder review of political campaign activity of public corporations.  As we have heard, the underlying bill would create new restrictions on proxy advisory firms that would erode their capacity to provide reliable, independent advice to public company investors: institutional investors such as pension funds that serve firefighters, teachers, and police officers. My amendment would restore the ability of advisory firms to provide research and vote recommendations regarding a public company's spending on political campaign contributions.  Over the past half a century, public companies have increasingly entered the political arena, spending huge sums on political contributions and campaign activity. Court rulings like Citizens United and SpeechNOW.org have opened new avenues of influence for corporate America and have worked to amplify the role of public companies in our politics. Mr.Speaker, the public is becoming increasingly anxious about this.[[Page H10329]]  Fortunately, in recent years, some shareholders and public interest organizations have successfully put pressure on public corporations to adopt shareholder review of corporate political activity, stemming the tide of unchecked political spending from public corporations. Yet the underlying bill would unwind that progress, giving corporations direct influence over proxy advisory firm recommendations to shareholders regarding political activity, knocking down yet another pillar of political accountability in our politics.  Mr.Speaker, we need more, not less political accountability from our Nation's corporations. As this week has shown, corporate America has an outsized influence in our Nation's public policy. Look no further than today's vote on the GOP tax scam or yesterday's further deregulation of some of our Nation's largest financial institutions.  There is no mystery as to why this has happened. A sophisticated corporate influence economy involving campaign contributions, aggressive lobbying, a web of trade associations, corporate-backed think tanks, and outside political organizations has sprung up in Washington to shape who runs for office, who wins office, and the policies we in Congress adopt.  Mr.Speaker, Americans hate this system. They hate the arrogance with which monied interests exert their influence on our politics and our government. They feel that their voice, the voice of the people, is ignored while Big Money insiders have their way on Capitol They want us to change the corrosive status quo.  Mr.Speaker, we can take a small step forward with this amendment to restore the American people's faith in our ability to stand up to corporate power. We should adopt this modest, but important change to an otherwise flawed piece of legislation.  At a minimum, we should protect the opportunity for institutional investors to receive independent research and advice when it comes to the political activity of public companies. It is about transparency. It is about accountability. It is about the public interest.  Mr.Speaker, to that end, I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.

698,topic-id,599,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for yielding time to me.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.3312. I appreciate my colleague's redesignation, renaming of the bill. I think it is much more appropriate.  Mr.Speaker, this is a completely unwarranted piece of legislation. If you look at it, it is just another gift to the wealthy and the well connected on Wall  We keep saying that over here because it is true. It is crazy. In 2008, the economy was brought to its knees. Reckless behavior out there by a lot of these huge institutions. The Nation's largest financial institutions crashed the economy. Everybody knows it.  So what did we do? We took steps, smart steps. We put in place the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act of 2010. I think most Americans were comforted by that. They felt, okay. There are guardrails in place now so this kind of thing can't happen again.  But the fact of the matter is that, as soon as the ink was dry on that law, lobbyists moved in, the special interests moved in, and they started to unwind the core provisions, and the guardrails are starting to come down.  This is crazy. This is a case of amnesia at best or cynical capitulation to Wall Street at worst.  Proponents of the legislation say this is about helping the mom-and-pop banks on Main Street--Main Were institutions like Countrywide and Washington Mutual and Wachovia and IndyMac--these are the names that haunt a lot of A lot of American households suffered because of the behavior of those institutions. Were they Main Street banks?  The fact is, under the bill before us, some of the Nation's largest banks whose failure led to the carnage of 2008 would be exempt from heightened oversight. Exactly the kind of institutions that the public wants us to keep an eye on would no longer have that oversight in place. Of those still standing, 30 of the Nation's 38 largest financial institutions would escape sensible oversight imposed by Dodd- Even more than that, this legislation is based on the false premise that the reforms of Dodd-Frank were one size fits all. That is the phrase we always hear to justify letting go of the reins: Oh, it is one size fits all. People can't fit into this. We have got to do something.  But, no, the agency was given the maneuvering room, the flexibility, to actually customize things and have been in a position to do that.  There was a premium put on regulatory flexibility, explicitly instructing the Federal Reserve to tailor its prudential regulatory regime based on size and risk profile of financial institutions.  Ironically, the changes to asset thresholds will increase the likelihood of consolidation as large financial institutions and banks can now grow, that is, buy out small players beyond the $50 billion threshold. The banks are going to start growing bigger again. The financial institutions are going to get heavier again. It makes it easier for them to crash through whatever guardrails we can build.  The public doesn't want this, and that means true community banks very well might be absorbed by super-regional banks, which would decrease consumer credit access and worsen pricing.  Mr.Speaker, Americans are tired of watching this Congress forget the lessons of the 2008 financial crash. They are tired of a Congress that routinely favors Wall Street over the interests of Main Street, and they are tired of the same worn-out talking points that are used to justify deregulation of Wall  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

12,topic-id,298,"Mr.President, I thank my senior Senator for leading us in this resolution.  Nebraska volleyball continues to dominate. If there is any debate about the best volleyball State in the Union, there should be no more. Nebraska has proved, yet again, we have the best team, the best coaching staff, and indisputably the best fans in the country.  Two years ago, this team won the national championship at home in Omaha, setting records with the crowds that attended the games there, and last week in Kansas City, we set another alltime record with the most watched championship volleyball game ever at 18,516 fans, including my 6-year old who stayed awake at nearly 11 p.m. as we were finishing, and he was deciding to watch it upside down, hanging over the seats from the upper decks at the arena in Kansas  So I proudly join the senior Senator and Husker nation in congratulating these young women, saying ``Go Big Red'' on behalf of all 1.9 million  Just two stats of note. First, in the earlier round at the final four, Nebraska beat Penn Those are the two winningest teams in the history of volleyball. Nebraska has the most wins at 1,308. Penn State has the greatest winning percentage. We have now won five championships in 22 years, as well as three runner-up, second-place finishes in the last 30 years.  Coach Cook, as Senator Fischer mentioned, has won four championships at Nebraska over the last 17 years.

165,topic-id,428,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Brady for yielding time and for his leadership in the entire group of conferees on bringing this tax cuts and jobs bill to the floor.  I thank President Trump for working with us every step of the way to bring us to a historic moment where we are actually going to provide tax relief to hardworking families.  There are those on the other side who would say: Keep all the money in Washington, stunt economic growth, continue to let America be noncompetitive where we see jobs go overseas over and over again--large companies, thousands of jobs at a time moving to foreign countries--because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world.  Well, Mr.Speaker, it is time for that to end, and we do end that in this bill. We finally make our country competitive again so we can bring those jobs back.  Why deny opportunity for so many people who want a chance at the American Dream?  In our bill, Mr.Speaker, we cut every single tax rate and make it lower. That is more money in the pockets of hardworking families. On average, families are going to see over $2,000 more back in their paychecks every year.

This is real money to help people have better opportunities to go put more money in their kids' college tuition accounts.

337,topic-id,365,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also for her tremendous leadership.  Let's talk a little bit about the winners in this bill.  I think it is interesting to note that, if you are General Electric, since 1990 to 2017, you have contributed over $20 million to Republican campaigns. What you get back in tax relief from this legislation is almost $16 billion over the life of this bill.  If you are Microsoft, you have contributed over $17 million, and you get back $27 billion from this tax bill.  This is such a great investment for big corporations who have given money to Republican candidates over the years. But if you are not part of the country's wealthiest 1 percent, this GOP tax scam is a really bad deal for you.  It is especially bad for America's senior citizens. This tax scam raises premiums for those 50 to 64 by 10 percent, an average of $1,400, and the deficit it creates will require, under the law, $25 billion in a Medicare tax cut next year.  We have heard the Republicans say we are going to get that money back, but in this bill there is a $25 billion cut in Medicare next year. That is only the beginning. It gets worse.  Republicans aren't even hiding the fact that they intend to use this deficit that they created of $1.5 trillion as justification for slashing Medicare and They have said it. They have admitted it. They are even talking about raising the age of Social Security eligibility in order to give these tax breaks to the rich.  Seniors should not have to foot the bill for a tax scam that gives 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. American seniors deserve a better deal. So do 86 million families who would see a tax increase as a result of this scam.  To my Republican colleagues, you really do have a second chance. Because the bill got messed up, there were mistakes, it was done so fast, done in secret, it is coming back to us today. So you have a second chance to do the right thing. Please take it.

535,topic-id,1361,"Mr.President, I want to cover what I think are the seven worst aspects of this tax bill.  The first thing is that this is not a middle-class tax cut. Credible, independent analysis of this bill found that the richest 1 percent of the United States will get $85 billion of the benefits in the year 2019. These Americans will get a tax cut of more than $55,000 per person while taxpayers who fall in the middle of the road will get a couple of hundred bucks. Many in the middle class will pay more because of this bill.  People making $30,000 or less will see a tax increase of about 10 percent. Even foreign investors will do better than the middle class in this bill. What do I mean by foreign investors? I mean foreign investors. I mean people who don't live in the United States but who own stock or are investors in American companies. In 2019, they will get a $48 billion tax benefit. That is a bigger benefit than more than half of the rest of the country will get from this bill. You have to work hard to design a tax plan that helps the middle class less than this one does. In fact, the Washington Post looked at this plan a few weeks ago and found that it is the worst tax plan for the middle class in 50 years. Here is the thing. It shouldn't be that hard to do a middle-class tax cut; you just do a middle-class tax cut.  The 2 reason this bill is horrible is it is primarily written for special interests. Republicans couldn't give the middle class a bigger tax break because they needed all of that money for special interests. Real estate firms will see an immediate 16 percent decrease in taxes next year. For families who own multimillion-dollar hotels, that makes this a great bill.  Big banks and financial firms also win. Over the next 10 years, financial firms will save $250 billion. Over the next 10 years, financial firms will save $250 billion.  The biggest single beneficiary is Wells What I remember from the last election was that the lesson the voters were teaching us across America was a populous lesson, that[[Page S8113]]they were sick of financial institutions and the very powerful politically and the very powerful economically running us. Here we are giving a massive tax break to Wells Fargo, an estimated 18-percent boost in earnings just for Wells This is not a bank that has been a good player recently. They were mired in scandal after they bilked customers into buying auto insurance and created thousands of fake credit card and bank accounts.  People are not getting a tax cut. Corporations are getting a tax cut, and no one knows how we are going to pay for all of this.  This brings me to 3. If passed, this bill will increase the Federal deficit by a minimum of $1.5 trillion. With $1.5 trillion, we can pay down every single student loan in the country and still have enough money left over for middle-class tax cuts. Instead, we are going to make sure that Wells Fargo investors have another banner year.  There was an entire group of Republicans elected to the Congress on the premise that the Federal debt and deficit were too high and that we needed fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility, and now they are adding $1.5 trillion to the deficit.  4, this bill is just bad economic policy. It is premised on the idea that if you provide a tax cut for corporations, they will share it, essentially; that if you give money to a corporation and they take that money and they reinvest it in their physical plant, they make additional developments--maybe they build a new factory, or maybe they pay their people more. That sounds great. Here is the problem: The corporate sector is sitting on an unprecedented amount of cash already. The corporate sector has lots of cash already. So we have a lesson in what they will do with extra cash, right? If they were going to use extra cash to pay their people more or invest more in physical infrastructure or expand their businesses, they would already be doing that because they are already sitting on record amounts of capital. But they are not doing that. What they are doing is stock buybacks and dividends. In other words, they are paying off their shareholders.  When a group of American CEOs was asked what they were going to do with the windfall money they are about to receive, they did not say they are going to pay their people more; they did not say they are going to invest more in expanding their businesses; they indicated that they are going to do what they have been doing with their record amounts of cash, which is pour it back into stock buybacks and dividends.  This is bad economic policy. Forget the moral part for a moment. Even at the macroeconomic level, this is not smart.  5, this is bad policy because it is a bad process. This bill was written in secret. It was rushed, and it was 100 percent partisan. We know it didn't have to be that way.  One of the things I said to some of my colleagues with whom I have a strong relationship is, listen, why don't we try to do this subject to a 60-vote threshold? Why don't we try to find bipartisan agreement? And then, listen, if you find that we are operating with you in bad faith, if you find that there is no room for compromise, drop the threshold down and do it with a 51-vote margin, but at least you will have exhausted the possibility of bipartisanship.  They started with 51 votes. What does that mean? That means they never wanted to listen to That is why this process is so flawed. And now the House just sent over a bill that is so messed up, they are going to have to vote again tomorrow. To fix the garbage they sent over this afternoon, they are already talking about an additional technical fixes bill to do next year. This is the product that you get when you don't have public hearings, when you don't have bipartisanship, and when you don't take your time.  6, this bill is bad for healthcare. People's premiums are going to skyrocket, and 13 million Americans are going to go without health insurance.  7, this bill increases income inequality. This bill changes our tax system to reward wealth over work. For me, American capitalism is about, you work hard, you have a good idea, and you are rewarded. It is not about, your dad was rich, he passed the money down, and you are rewarded. American capitalism is about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. But what we are doing with the Tax Code is unprecedented--except for during the gilded age. What we are doing with the Tax Code right now is saying: We value already being rich more than we value someone who is climbing that mountain.  That is a foundational moral question--do we value work, or do we value wealth? The problem with this bill--and we can go through process and policy and politics, but the foundational problem with this bill is that, through this document, we are declaring that we value people's wealth that already exists. We value passive income more than we value earned income. And that is not good for the United States of That is the problem with this bill. We are telling people that we value people who already have money more than people who are climbing that hill. That is why I oppose this bill so strongly, and I think that is why people across America--for the very first time, at least in recent history but maybe in American history, we have a tax cut bill that is so deeply unpopular because people understand what a rotten piece of legislation this is. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.  I yield the floor.

253,topic-id,629,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from Maryland for organizing this special hour this evening and for leading the conversation.  Mr.Speaker, I share my colleagues' concern about the unfounded attacks on the special counsel and the need to make sure that the investigation is allowed to proceed to its conclusion.  But, Mr.Speaker, I join my colleagues tonight in also raising grave concerns about the unwillingness of our present administration, including not only the President, but the Justice Department as well, to take seriously the threat of foreign interference in our elections.  It is the unanimous assessment of our intelligence community that the Russian Government launched a focused campaign, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, to interfere in our elections last year.  Irrespective of President Trump's refusal to accept this objective reality or his ongoing efforts to obfuscate the truth, the ongoing threat to the integrity of our elections is real and only likely to increase in 2018. As the Russians sought to disrupt our elections last year, and as they have done so in elections around the world, we can be certain that they will be back next year.  That is why we, as Congress and as a country, need to be urgently focused on how to prevent in future elections the kinds of foreign interference we saw in 2016.  Mr.Speaker, the first primary elections are barely 3 months away and Americans will collectively head to the polls in less than 11 months. The clock is, quite literally, ticking. Without a serious effort to address these varied and increasing threats, we as a nation remain vulnerable.  Over the past month, I have had the opportunity to ask both the number one and number two official at the Department of Justice, as well as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, about our efforts to secure our elections. Their answers have been far from satisfactory.  In November, Attorney General Jeff Sessions came before the House Judiciary Three weeks prior to that, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he admitted to Senator Sasse that his Department had fallen short in addressing election security.  I was, therefore, surprised when I asked Attorney General Sessions about the actions he had taken to secure our elections subsequent to his Senate hearing. He could not name any single specific step taken by the Justice  He admitted: ``I have not followed through to see where we are on that.''  And then he committed: ``I will personally take action to do so.''  Nevertheless, when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appeared before the committee a month later, he could not demonstrate that the Department had even formally reviewed the matter.  It is clear to me that the administration is not handling this threat with the seriousness it deserves.  Last month I led a letter with 15 of my Judiciary colleagues to the Attorney General, calling on him to make good on his commitment to urgently brief Members of Congress on the Department's efforts to secure our elections from foreign meddling. The deadline for this request has come and gone, and there is still not one--no commitment from the Department of Justice to work cooperatively with Congress on this critically important issue.  This inaction is unacceptable. The clock is ticking until our next election, and we need to act and we need to act now. Our Nation needs--and the American people are right to expect--this administration to urgently and aggressively take measures to protect our elections.  Mr.Speaker, this is not a partisan issue. The very foundation of our democracy depends on the integrity of our elections.  I urge my colleagues to join us in our efforts to defend against foreign interference and hold this administration accountable for doing all it can to prevent any interference in the future.

28,topic-id,779,"Mr.President, last night the Senate passed an awful, partisan rewrite of the Tax I said a good deal about the bill over the course of the debate and added my concluding thoughts into the Record before the final vote, but let me just reiterate one point. The Republican tax bill will cement the Republican Party as the party of the wealthy and the party of the big corporations against the middle class and the working people of this country.  Corporations get permanent tax breaks. The individual tax breaks expire. By 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 83 percent of the middle class--that is almost 145[[Page S8155]]million American families--will either get a tax increase or a tax cut of less than $100.  Meanwhile, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of earners in our country will reap 83 percent of the benefits of the tax plan.  Let's go over that again. The middle class, 83 percent, either get a tax increase or a tax break of less than $100. The top 1 percent, the wealthiest, get 83 percent of the benefits. Middle-class America is asking something: Why does the top get far more than I do? Why do I get a tax increase when so many of them get a huge decrease? To boot, millions of middle-class Americans will now go without health insurance and millions more will see their premiums rise. At the same time, multinational corporations and wealthy hedge fund managers enjoy a massive tax break. To repeat, the legacy of this bill will be to cement the Republican Party as the party of the rich and powerful against the middle class.  We Democrats have been saying this for years, but our Republican colleagues with this tax bill have done us a major favor. Even their Republican supporters are realizing where the Senate Republicans and House Republicans are--on the side of the most wealthy, on the side of the big powerful corporations, not on the side of the middle class.  Whenever we have had a Republican President and Republican Congress, we get the same thing--a program of tax cuts for the rich, higher deficit and debt, and then threats to Social Security and That is what happened under President Bush, and we are seeing the exact same playbook today. There is nothing about this bill that is suited to the needs of the American worker or the American economy. My Republican friends would propose it in a booming economy or recession, whether we have surpluses or deficits. No matter what, it seems to our Republican friends that tax cuts for the rich and big corporations are the answer to our problems. The benefits will trickle down like magic to the rest of us.  Trickle down is the entire philosophy of this tax bill--trickle down. When they say they are helping the middle class, when they say they are creating jobs, it is because the wealthy get money and, in their belief, will create jobs. It hasn't happened. It hasn't happened. Corporate America has more money than ever before. The stock market is higher than ever before, and job creation isn't.  That is where this bill is at. There is nothing about this bill that suits the needs of the American worker, as I said. Trickle down has been widely discredited as an economic theory. It has been discredited by recent history, and it will be discredited again.  Our Republican colleagues are clinging. They are saying: This bill is so unpopular, but don't worry, once the economy takes off, once people see hundreds of dollars in their pockets, they will change their mind.  The economy is not going to take off. The wealthy will do better. There will be a lot of dividends. There will be a lot of stock buybacks, not too much job creation. AT&T is a big American company and a fine American company. Their tax rate over the last 10 years was a mere 8 percent, and they cut 80,000 jobs. That one statistic belies all this trickle-down bunk that our Republican colleagues still cling to even though it is outdated and disproved, and the American people will have their chance in 2018 to reject this philosophy and move our country in a dramatically different direction--back toward government that works to lift up the middle class rather than one that gives more to those who already have so much. From now until then, we Democrats will focus like a laser on making things better for working Americans and the middle class. The contrast, particularly this tax bill, which so benefits the wealthy and powerful, could not be more clear.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8154-8.txt,1036,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to thank Senator Sanders and Senator Cantwell as well, the ranking members of our committees, who worked so hard on this bill.  In closing, very soon the Senate will vote for the final time on the Republican tax bill. When future generations look back at the short and messy history of the Republican tax bill, its most enduring lesson will be what it has taught us about how not to legislate.

568,topic-id,449,"It is a perfect microcosm of the hasty and reckless process that produced this legislation.  If my Republican friends think these are the only mistakes that will be found in their bill, they are sorely mistaken. Many more will almost certainly be unearthed. But the bigger issue is the failure of this legislation to live up to each and every one of the promises made by Republicans about what it would mean for our country.  What has been sold as a middle-class miracle will instead deliver a hefty windfall to the wealthy and only paltry, temporary relief for some in the middle class. Others will see an increase right from the get-go. So all of the talk--no middle-class person will pay a tax increase--gone, gone. And in a few years, a majority of the middle class will see their taxes go up. What kind of middle-class relief is that?  What has been sold as a deficit reducer will instead balloon the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion, maybe more. Our children and grandchildren will be asked to clean up the mess made tonight by our Republican colleagues in their eagerness to give the very wealthy, the very powerful corporations, a big tax break.  What has been sold as a bill to give people more freedom to choose their healthcare will instead raise premiums and reduce the number of Americans with health insurance by 13 million. The number of people who get a small tax cut and still have to pay more than that tax cut in premium increases is large. What a huge mistake my colleagues made by eliminating that provision in the healthcare bill, because the middle class is going to pay the price.  What has been sold as a job creator and wage-booster will do little of either, as companies--large, big, powerful companies--are already initiating stock buybacks instead of hiring more workers and raising wages. Is that what you intended? Give them more money so they can buy back more stock, increasing the wealth of corporate CEOs, increasing the wealth of the very wealthy, sending billions of dollars overseas to overseas investors. That is what is happening already. Corporation after corporation has said: Aha, with this new money, we will do even more stock buybacks.  Ultimately, the American people will learn that Republicans have squandered their so-called ``once-in-a-generation opportunity'' on corporate welfare and taxes for the rich, financed by tax increases and healthcare increases on the middle class.

569,topic-id,1271,"This is serious stuff. We believe you are messing up You can pay attention for a couple of minutes.  Nearly 145 million middle-class families earning under $200,000 will get either tax hikes or a tax cut of less than $100. Eighty-three percent of the middle class will either pay more in taxes or get little but crumbs. Is that what you intended? Is that this great bill that is helping the middle class? Absolutely not.  Meanwhile, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of earners in our country will reap 83 percent of the benefits of the tax plan. The top 5 percent--the top 5 percent--will reap 99.2 percent of the benefits. Is that what you intended? That is what you are doing. The very, very wealthy--the highest spectrum--get almost all the benefits. Some bill for the middle class.  The raw numbers are a staggering indictment of the Republican tax plan, as they have been throughout the course of this debate. The data reveals what the Republican tax plan truly is--a tax scam that will rob middle-class families to pay for corporate tax breaks and giveaways to the wealthy.  In an age of extraordinary income inequality, when the upper echelons of our economy are capturing an ever-greater share of the pie, the Republican tax bill is like pouring gasoline on a raging fire, making income inequality, as bad as it is now, even worse. It will exacerbate all the bad trends in our economy that over the past few decades have produced dramatically more wealth for the already wealthy, while producing less work and less pay for working people. That fundamental imbalance in our economy will be made even more precarious. What a disgrace. That is what this bill is. It is an absolute disgrace.  It is not just an ideological difference; it is something dramatically opposite of what America needs. There is no reason for a single middle-class family to pay more while every single corporation pays less. If you want to help the middle class, give them a real tax break. The rich get far more dollars back than the middle class. That is fact--an irrefutable fact.  On top of that, as Senator Wyden warned everybody a few minutes ago, this tax bill will endanger Social Security and Republicans have already said, led by Speaker Ryan, that they will use the deficit they are about to create as an excuse to come after those earned benefits. The AARP is very reluctant to take stands on bills like this, but it was so bad for the elderly, the AARP felt compelled to publicly oppose it.  Elderly Americans are not the only ones who should be worried, although they certainly should be. If you are 40, 45, or 50, working hard, trying to put money away for retirement while sending your kids to college, and you are counting on these programs to be there when you retire, know this: Cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are likely to fall on your shoulders because of this monstrosity of a bill. The Republican tax bill is the first shoe to drop. The second will fall on the social safety net that allows millions of hard-working Americans to retire with dignity and security.  For all of these reasons, it is not a surprise that in poll after poll after poll, the American people overwhelmingly oppose this bill.  My Republican colleagues have done what is nearly impossible. It is a bad trick, but they have accomplished it.[[Page S8141]]They have managed to make a tax cut bill even less popular than previous tax hikes. Who would have thought they could accomplish that? Who would have thought? In fact, it is the second-least popular piece of major legislation in 30 years, opposed 2 to 1 by the American people, and the more they learn about the bill, the less they like it. By the way, what was the first? The Republican healthcare bill earlier this year.  It is not hard to understand why the dark heart of the Republican policy agenda easing burdens on those who already have so much, while punishing or ignoring those who have too little, is a profoundly unpopular idea. My Republican friends ought to listen to the American people, the fount of wisdom in our democracy, or there will be a reckoning.  The American people do not believe in trickle-down, as all of you seem to. Give the very top money, and they will create jobs. It hasn't happened. AT&T--do you know what their tax rate was over the last 10 years? Eight percent. Do you know how many jobs they created? They cut 80,000 people. Let's give them more money while hurting the middle class. It makes no sense.  The American people are saying in a loud, clear voice that they oppose tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy. They don't believe in trickle-down, as you do. They oppose gutting healthcare, as you want to do, and they oppose this one-party approach to legislating. The American people know that a slapdash partisan process will not result in good law. My Republican colleagues ignore the warnings of the American people at their own peril.  In just a short time, Republicans will have a choice whether or not to affix their name to this awful legislation. Although the Republican propagandists may call its passage a political victory, it will be very fleeting and illusory. The substance and polling are so rotten that a year from now, Republicans will be running away from this bill in shame for voting yes this evening.  There is an alternative: Vote no. Come to the table with Begin serious, bipartisan talks on tax reform. Get a good bill, and work in the way this Chamber is supposed to work: bipartisan, moderate, thoughtful, open. You have done none of those--none of those.  I have little faith that, at this late hour, my colleagues will choose the better course, but if they do, we could do something great for the country and for this body at the same time. We could return to regular order, where the legitimate policy differences between our parties are argued in broad daylight, and with painstaking effort, we compromise even after we fiercely debate one another. Isn't that what we came here to do?  I challenge a single one of my Republican colleagues to say they are proud of the way this tax bill was written and passed. I challenge a single one. I know this isn't what they would like to see. I know this isn't what so many of you came here to do. I know it is not what you tell your constituents the Senate ought to be. I know so many of you lament the steady erosion of bipartisanship here in the Senate, as do I, as do my fellow So rather than resign to the failures of the current moment, I plead--plead--with my Republican colleagues to imagine a better path forward. Vote no. Vote no and prevent taxes from going up on millions of middle-class families. Vote no and stop 13 million Americans from going without health insurance. Vote no, so we don't add $1.5 trillion to the deficit, putting the burden on our children and grandchildren.

804,topic-id,511,"Now to the end of the year, Mr.President, as a result of the Republican efforts to jam the tax bill through before the end of the year, we now have precious little time left to keep the government open and to solve a legion of problems.  We still haven't reached a budget deal to lift the spending caps equally for both defense and urgent domestic priorities such as combatting the opioid crisis, improving veterans' healthcare, and building infrastructure.  We have not reached a deal to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, or to extend the 702 FISA Court program.  Two major sticking points remain in the form of the disaster supplemental, which still does not treat Puerto Rico, California, and the U.Virgin Islands as well as Florida, Texas, and  Of course we have the Dreamers and a moral imperative to protect them.

They are Americans in every single important way but one; they lack the paperwork. We have to solve that problem.  We have been negotiating with our Republican counterparts for weeks in search of a deal to pair DACA protections with reasonable border security. Democrats have always believed in border security, as the comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate showed. I hope now that the tax bill is behind them, my Republican colleagues are finally willing to reach an agreement, but because of the particular importance of all of these issues, especially Dreamers, we cannot do a short-term funding bill that picks and chooses what problems to solve and what not to solve. That will not be fair and will not pass. We have to do them all together instead of in a piecemeal fashion.  Whether that global deal comes before the week is out or a later date in January, it has to be a truly global deal. We can't leave any of the issues behind. Our Republican colleagues on tax and healthcare decided not to work with us. In this case they have to work with us, and working with us means that we sit down around the table and decide there are some things you want, some things we want, and let's compromise and get it done--not just picking and choosing what you want to get done and telling us to deal with it. That will not work this time.  I can assure my friend the majority leader that my caucus will be working in good faith with his caucus as long as they choose to work with us, and we will work with our colleagues in the House as well to reach a deal as soon as possible.

849,topic-id,499,"Mr.President, on year-end issues, we are staring down a litany of unresolved issues, and we are quickly running out of time to solve them. Not only do we need to pass an extension of government funding, but as I have said many times, we need to deal with budget caps, CHIP, community health centers, 702 FISA, a disaster supplemental, and of course the  I believe we could have resolved all of these issues had my Republican colleagues, especially in the House, not put them on the back burner while jamming through their tax bill. It is unclear still what the House is going to send us to keep the government open and whether it will be acceptable to the  At the same time, the House may move forward on an unacceptable disaster supplemental which still does not treat fairly California, Puerto Rico, and the U.Virgin It doesn't include, as best we know--they are still working on it--cost sharing for Puerto Rico and additional funding for Medicaid, mitigation resiliency, and drinking water infrastructure. While House Republicans included some tax provisions in the disaster supplemental, they failed to extend the ITC for Puerto Rico, extend the childcare tax credit consistent with other States, and the tax bill also includes a devastating new business tax that treats Puerto Rico as if it is a foreign country, which could encourage manufacturers to leave the island. This tax could cost thousands of jobs and decimate Puerto Rico's economy at exactly the time when Puerto Rico is hurting from the hurricanes and needs all the help it can get. Those issues must be fixed before a disaster supplemental can move forward. Because of these inadequacies, the disaster supplemental may have to slip to next year. I think we can work it out in a bipartisan way--I certainly do--but just jamming it through without consulting us and not being fair to so many other parts of the country doesn't make sense.  Unfortunately, we still have not reached a deal yet on the Dreamers, who are very important not only to my caucus, not only to some on the Republican side but to the American people.

854,topic-id,588,"Mr.President, we have a lot of business to get to this week, but because the topic is so important, I would like to address Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in our elections and the Trump campaign's potential involvement.  Over the past several months, the investigation and the FBI have been the target of a smear campaign by Republicans, in the media primarily--in a media outlet that is hardly regarded as down the middle, in a media outlet that just seems to ask ``how high'' when President Trump says to jump.  Now it has been joined, quite naturally, by several Republicans here in Their intent is not to push back on the special counsel's findings or to introduce exculpatory evidence on behalf of Manafort, Gates, Papadopoulos, or Flynn, who have been indicted or convicted. Their intent is not to make an argument about the substance of the investigation at all. Their intent is to discredit the investigator and the investigation itself, by falsely painting it as biased or partisan. That way, whatever its findings are at the end of the day, they have created a permission structure to dismiss them.  When you are afraid of the result, you attack the process. When you are afraid of the message, you shoot the messenger. That is what is happening right now with the escalating rhetoric in the rightwing echo media chambers. The commentators at FOX News have actually called Mr.Mueller's investigation a coup--an outrageous charge that has been repeated by a Republican Congressman on the floor of the That is how overblown this rhetoric has gotten.  Mr.Mueller is one of the most trusted and respected public servants in He has served administrations of both parties. He was first appointed by a Republican and was installed as a special counsel by President Trump's pick for Deputy Attorney General, Republican Rod As everyone in America knows, he is as straight a shooter as one comes. Impugning his motives and calling his investigation a witch hunt or a coup is, frankly, hysterical.  I regret even repeating those ridiculous comments because there is not a shred of evidence to back them up--not a shred. If any of these critics had evidence, they would pursue their claims in court, but, of course, there is no evidence. So, instead, they wage a warped campaign in the press, fueled by an avalanche of trumped-up allegations and disinformation.  What are they so afraid of?  We all know why. The special counsel's investigation is an important one for our democracy. We have to get to the bottom of what happened in last year's election no matter who ends up on the short end of the stick when those results are announced: How was[[Page S8083]]Russia able to wage a successful information campaign to influence our election? To what extent were any members of Trump's Presidential campaign coordinating with that foreign attack on our democracy for political benefit?  These are vital questions that every American should know, and it is an outright disgrace that our Republican colleagues have not joined in in asking for this--so many of them--being as partisan as can be and putting their party over country. If Russia continues in these types of investigations, woe is America--woe is  Rather than this concerted campaign to sully the investigation and the FBI, President Trump and his allies should be encouraging them to do their job, to do it right, and to do it thoroughly.

917,topic-id,770,"Finally, Mr.President, since this is the last time I might be able to address this Chamber before the end of the year--let's hope so--I would like to look back at what the Senate has accomplished this year. The long and short of it, though, is that the Senate has not accomplished much to be proud of.  Despite winning only a slim majority in the last election--a condition that made this year ripe for cooperation between the parties--the Republicans used their power not to seek consensus or bipartisanship but, rather, to try to jam through a partisan agenda.  My friend the majority leader once promised that if he were ever given the majority, he would return the body to regular order. He cautioned against the Senate becoming an ``assembly line for one party's partisan legislative agenda.'' That is what Mitch McConnell said a few years ago. Sadly, that is exactly what the Senate has become under his leadership this year. For a man who professed to love the Senate and relish bipartisanship, this is probably the most partisan Senate that I have served in in all the years I have been here, and we have departed from regular order and the customs of the Senate in ways never seen before. For what end? Well, this Chamber, under Republican leadership, has devoted itself to furthering the interests of the wealthy and powerful, while ignoring or harming the interests of the middle class and working America.[[Page S8192]]  Republicans will argue that they had a great year, pointing to three things--Judge Gorsuch, the use of the Congressional Review Act to roll back regulations, and their tax bill. All three of those things help the rich and they will help corporations, but they won't help the middle class.  Senate Republicans engaged in historic obstruction to keep a Supreme Court seat open so the Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society could pick a Justice who would rule on the side of corporations instead of people.  Senate Republicans jammed through Congressional Review Act bills that rolled back protections for women, students, and workers, while lifting requirements placed on bad actors in the big oil, gas, mining, and gun industries.  They capped the year by passing a tax bill that provides huge tax breaks for the rich and biggest corporations, while providing crumbs and even tax hikes for the middle class.  They tried for months to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would send costs soaring for millions of Americans and cause millions more to lose coverage.  They failed to fully authorize CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and failed to rebuild our infrastructure, despite the President's promises.  The stock market is up, but wages are flat or nearly flat. The President and Republicans promised that they would stop outsourcing, and that hasn't happened. Even companies the President said he would personally save have sent jobs to Mexico, leaving families in the Midwest and across the country without the income they need this holiday season.  Time and time again, the middle class was an afterthought or simply forgotten by Senate Republicans and President That has been the story of the year. Republicans haven't accomplished much, but what they have accomplished has only benefited the wealthy and well connected.  The Senate's record this year has exposed the faux populism at the center of President Trump's political identity. Although he rode into office promising to help the forgotten man and woman, those are exactly the people he has forgotten, abandoning them in favor of wealthy special interests. Populism, unfortunately, under President Trump, has been traded for plutocracy.  The millions of Americans in 2016 who were frustrated at a Washington that didn't work for them feel more frustrated today, and the millions of working men and women who voted for President Trump--many of them are already feeling betrayed.  We hope that the future will be different and that our Republican friends realize that their legislative and political goals are better served by bipartisanship and compromise rather than gridlock and strife. If they do, we are willing and ready to work with them, but if they don't, voters will have a chance to move our country in a dramatically different direction in 2018. We are already seeing a yearning for that new direction in elections in Virginia, New Jersey, Tennessee, and even in deep red If the Republicans continue to hurt the middle class and give handouts to big corporations and the wealthy, they are in for a reckoning next  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his courtesy.

1009,topic-id,308,"Now, Mr.President, on tax. Earlier this week, the Senate passed one of the worst pieces of legislation in at least a decade, maybe longer. The Republican tax bill will go down in history as a rushed, sloppy, partisan rewrite of the Tax Code that benefited those who already have so much while doing little or hurting those who have too little. It will be remembered as throwing the extraordinary income inequality we see today into overdrive and fulfilling very few of the ambitious Republican promises about growth, job creation, and deficit reduction. But perhaps most of all, the Republican tax bill will define the Republican Party as the party of the rich and powerful, the party against the middle class, and that will be a rubric we will hear from now until next November and even further on.  Yesterday in the Oval Office, President Trump admitted that cutting the corporate tax rate was ``probably the biggest factor in our plan.'' Despite all his rhetoric about this being a middle-class tax bill, as soon as it passes, he admits that lowering the corporate rate was the Republicans' primary goal.  As corporations get a massive, permanent tax break, individuals will get small and temporary ones. By 2027, 145 million American families making under $200,000--83 percent of the middle class--will be either paying more in taxes or get a cut of less than $100. That is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation--no partisan affiliation. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent of income earners in our country will reap 83 percent of the benefits from this tax plan. Those facts are what make this bill so dramatically unpopular with the American people by a 2-to-1 margin in some polls, and next year the American people will have the opportunity to reject this bill and move our country in a different direction.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8191-4.txt,1036,TAX REFORM BILL,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1126,topic-id,790,"Mr.President, the clock is ticking ever closer to the end of the year. We still need to fund the government by We still need to lift the spending caps equally for defense and urgent domestic priorities,[[Page S8082]]such as combatting the opioid crisis, improving healthcare for veterans, and building rural infrastructure. We must extend the FISA program and shore up pensions for over 1 million We still need to reauthorize CHIP and end the sabotage of our healthcare markets. We have had a bipartisan deal on a stabilization package for months now. It is a product that should have been easy to include in the end-year deal. After all, it is the product of bipartisan negotiations between Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, two of our most effective But now, because the Republicans are repealing the individual mandate in their tax bill, the Alexander-Murray deal will not have its intended effect. Even worse, Speaker Ryan has just said the agreement will not pass the House unless the Hyde language is attached to it--another eleventh hour partisan demand on a bill that has already been negotiated in the What should have been an easy addition to the year-end package is getting more difficult by the hour because of Republican demands.  We still need to pass disaster supplemental funding to aid storm-stricken parts of our country--California, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, as well as Texas, Louisiana, and The disaster supplemental bill coming out of the House, while it has much better funding levels than the administration's proposal, still does not treat Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands fairly. It does not provide for cost-sharing waivers, and it doesn't include enough funding for resiliency, mitigation, Medicaid, or drinking water infrastructure. It is a step in the right direction but not good enough.  I would reiterate my plea. Texas and the Texas delegation have constantly criticized government funding. All of a sudden, now that there is a disaster, they want money. Yet what about that $10 billion rainy day fund? Let Texas spend that. I guarantee you that if it were in a blue State, some of our friends from Texas would be calling for it--the very same people who opposed aid to Sandy, the very same people who have relished putting State and local deductibility in the bill. Well, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. Let Texas dip into its $10 billion fund before it gets FEMA money. That is what seems fair and right, particularly for those who don't want to see Federal Government spending increase.  Of course, last, but certainly not least, we still need to protect the Dreamers--young people brought into this country through no fault of their own, many of them who know no other country but ours. These are people who are in our Armed Forces--over 800--who are going to our schools, who are working in our factories and offices and stores. They, like everybody else--like our ancestors--want to be They contribute to They help  Yet there are people on the other side of the aisle who have this nasty immigration attitude that affects the Dreamers and everybody else. It is so un-It is so against the statue with the torch in the harbor in the city in which I live. It is so against what the American people believe. Eighty percent want to help the Yet we are stymied so far, and 1,000 Dreamers are losing their status each week.  On all of these things, the time to act is now. Bipartisan negotiations continue to seek a compromise to ensure DACA protections as well as to provide additional border security. We Democrats are all for that--real border security that makes a difference. We should strive to reach a deal as soon as is humanly possible.  If we are not able to reach a global deal by this Friday on these many issues, there will be a temptation to do a short-term funding bill with some of these items but not others. That won't work. We should be doing all of these things together instead of in a piecemeal, week-by-week fashion. Our Republican friends cannot pick and choose what they want and do what they did on the tax bill and do what they did on the healthcare bill in saying that Democrats are not welcome to be part of the deal--because this one ain't under reconciliation.  We want to work in a bipartisan way, but a bipartisan way means just that, not Republicans deciding on their own and telling us that we should just be for it. The best way to get a good, bipartisan result, which by the Senate rules is necessary for spending bills, is for us to work together.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8081-3.txt,1036,UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL SPACE COOPERATION ACT,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

245,topic-id,2587,"Mr.Speaker, as we try to get the boards to line up, we are only going to do three of these today.  Mr.Speaker, one of the things I wanted to do tonight, and we did it during sort of the debate earlier today--I hear lots of the discussions from our brothers and sisters on the left about the tax bill, and we often tease that this place is often a math-free zone, but I wanted to actually go a little bit bigger on why this tax bill is actually so crucial to every American, whether you be on the left, on the right, or just out there working as hard as you can and not thinking about politics.  The chart I have right on the side, this is what our nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has come up with as our economic growth future. If you take a look over here, you will see 1.8 percent GDP growth for the next 10 years. But we then skyrocket up to just, actually, if you saw the details, just slightly under 2. And then the next decade, so 30 years from now, we fall back down to 1.9 percent GDP growth.  Why this is crucial is, as baby boomers are retiring, we have lots of promises. You have heard discussions, just even someone that was behind the microphone 40 minutes ago, on the other side, talking about  There are estimates out there that, over the 75-year actuarial window, Medicare is $105 trillion underfunded. It is the largest unfunded liability we know in America and, possibly, the world. This is what happens when you are growing at 1.8 percent  If you love people, if you want this society to have an opportunity to keep its promises to our seniors, to our kids, to that working family, we must have economic growth.  I talked about this earlier today, a terrific editorial in The Wall Street Journal over this weekend, saying, hey, from the left's eyes, they think about equality, income inequality, and from the Republican side, we often sound like accountants. And I am sorry, but the math is important.  We think about economic growth because, if you look at the next chart, I just want you to sort of look at the very, very end. You see this sort of gold line, green line, the other green line. Do you see the separation? That is income inequality. It has grown dramatically in the last decade.  We have also grown at only 1.8 percent GDP the last decade. Slow economic expansion is where you get the income inequality.  If the left here actually cared about the very issue they talk about all the time, they would be embracing tax bills, regulatory bills, things that would actually expand the size of this economy so everyone has a fighting chance. But you find the politics of division very powerful around here.[[Page H10243]]  Look, we all get the joke. We understand that so many of our brothers and sisters on the left, they are terrified, or their base is angry, however we want to define it. You can't let the Republicans have a victory, particularly on rewriting the Tax Code for the first time in 31 years, even though, if you actually look at many of their records in the past, they have all stood behind microphones and said the Tax Code is abysmal. It stifles economic expansion; it hurts hardworking people; and, in a low-growth environment, with this crappy Tax Code, this is what you get. But the politics are so uncomfortable that, for a lot of our friends, it is more uncomfortable to vote for something that actually might be seen as a Republican victory.  So I wish I had an elegant way of begging my friends on the Democratic side, saying: Just think about it as giving every American a fighting chance because, if we start to grow, you actually get paid more; you have more job opportunities; you can save money for your retirement, for your kids. Because where we are at today and where we have been the last decade, we are in real trouble.  You actually look at some of the nonpartisan groups, and even some of the partisan groups, on their analyses of what the U.debt structure looks like, there are many of these models that, in about 15, 18 years, they collapse, our debt to  What that means is, when we say, ``Here is the size of our economy, gross domestic product--here is the size of our economy, and here is the size of our debt,'' in just a few years, we actually surpass the amount of publicly sold debt.  This is not where we are borrowing from our own trust funds. The publicly held debt passes the entire size of our economy, and it keeps going and going and going and going. That is status quo.  Please understand, the status quo has many of the models collapsing, much of this economy, in about 15, 18 years because our debt is so huge it consumes everything.  Social entitlements right now are about three-quarters of all of our spending. Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, that includes benefits of other welfare programs, earned and unearned, that is three-quarters of our spending, and it is going to become dramatically more.  So if you are someone who actually cares about health research, if you actually care about education, if you care about the national parks, if you care about the military, if you care about our relations around the world, all those are getting squeezed because of, substantially, the demographic curve we are already in, the growth of those populations, and our attempt to keep our promises.  If you care about keeping our promises, you care about the economic growth; and the tax rewrite is one of the key elements in that. And, yes, it is going to also require thinking through immigration. It is going to be thinking through regulations. It is going to be thinking through the adoption of technology.                              {time}  1900  But understand, you can't stand around here and give speeches about income inequality and then support the very policies that actually create it. The intellectual inconsistency around here is so frustrating.  This is a really interesting board, and why it is so important is that I ask for everyone to stop thinking about the actual debt number and think about it as its ratio, as its percentage, as its burden on the size of the economy.  If we have a $20 trillion economy and $20 trillion of debt, we are at 100 percent of debt to Our economy is actually a bit bigger than that, but if you actually look at this red line, that is entitlements.  Do you notice all those years where it is flat?  That is actually not because we were spending less money on entitlements. What that is about is we were growing as an economy. Yes, we were still spending more money, but we were growing faster than the growth in that spending.  If you care about fairness, if you care about opportunity, if you care about the ability to save, if you care about income inequality, you have got to step up and do those things that are difficult--and they are very difficult--that will maximize economic expansion in this country, because the difficulties that are coming in the next decade in our inability to have enough resources or enough borrowing capacity to continue to pay is devastating. We need this economy to continue to grow.  As we walk through this, I want to actually walk through also a couple of observations. And forgive me, but this is one of those opportunities where you have a few minutes to share.  I hold a seat on the Ways and Means It has been fascinating. On occasion you will hear folks say: Well, this was rushed through.  Well, except it was built on about a decade's worth of work. If you look at all the years that Dave Camp, the previous chairman of the Ways and Means Committee; and then the chairman after him, who happened to be Paul Ryan; and now the chairman, Kevin Brady, there are volumes and volumes of documentation. There are volumes and volumes of hearings and data. And there has got to be hundreds of hours of video out there of different hearings, both the whole committee and the subcommittees have done, in just trying to understand what affects economic growth, what works and what doesn't work.  An observation. How many people in the last couple weeks have you heard walk up behind these microphones and use the early 2000s as an economic example of a tax cut?  Now, understand, that was just substantially a basic income tax. It wasn't rewriting parts of the Tax What so many folks forget to tell you, if you go back to 2002 and you actually look at what we call the baseline--and I am sorry, this is going to geek out a little bit--baseline is our model of what we think revenues are going to look like and what spending is going to look like over the next decade. Then you look at those things that are referred to as the Bush tax cuts when they finally expired.  You do realize the revenues--the revenues--that came into this government were $77 billion higher than the projection, yet you will hear people get up behind the microphone and say: Well, these didn't pay for themselves.  But that is not the math.  Now, this government spent a lot more money than was projected. We had wars, we had bailouts, we had storms. We have had all sorts of things. We spent a lot more money. But if you actually look at the revenue line when those 2002 tax cuts expired, there was $77 billion more in revenue than was projected.  Is that because of the tax cuts?  But there were lots of other effects in the economy, adoptions of technology, and all sorts of things. But the basic rule of thumb is: Here is where we thought we would be, and we were $77 billion over that.  Back to this concept of: Are there tax cuts that pay for themselves?   Are there tax cuts that don't?   And that was one of the really gut-wrenching parts of this discussion. If you actually spend some time looking at a nonpartisan group like the Tax Foundation and look at a lot of their modeling, they would come back to us and say: Hey, you could spend this money on something that is great politics, but you get almost no economic expansion from it. Or you could spend that same money or something over here that turns out not to be great politics, but is really good for the economy and really good a few years from now and someone being able to find a job, someone being able to be paid more, someone being able to save for their retirement or their kids.  How do you get up in front of an audience and say, ``I know we would love to have this because this gets me reelected. But for that same money, our society, economically, will be healthier, bigger, wealthier a few years from now if you put that money in expensing, in certain types of business tax cuts, because that expands the size of the economy''?  That is something a lot of folks haven't thought about as they grind through the technical details of thousands of thousands of pages of the Tax Parts of the Tax Code are absolutely an economic document.  How you make us competitive in the world again? How do you maximize[[Page H10244]]economic expansion? How do you maximize opportunity for everyone to have a good-paying job?  But a Tax Code is also a political document. These are things that are very popular. These are things that get us elected. These are things that certain special interests line up at our door, walk around the hallways. If you actually saw the hallways over the last few months, I didn't know there were that many lobbyists in this town, all advocating for something for their business, for their State, for their community. All are honorable. But you have got to understand, when we put together a few-hundred-page bill and grind through it month after month after month and make a change here and a change here, and then realize the interactivity when they actually model it turns out this idea blows up this idea, the number of hours that have gone into making this math work are stunning and it is a really good document.  Is it everything all of us would want? Being a Representative from Arizona, I believe it is really good for my  But the thing I care most about is it being good for our country. I believe the tax bill, the tax reform, is fair to individuals. It is simpler. It is going to also deal with the hemorrhaging we have of corporations--and these are big corporations--leaving our country, hiding their profits overseas, and moving their expenses to the United  Is that fair?  Of course it isn't, but that is what the current Tax Code allows.  If you hear someone saying, ``Vote `no' on this bill,'' if you hear them saying, ``We prefer the status quo,'' understand what they are saying: We want to live in a world of absolute mediocrity, with almost no economic growth, no opportunity to save, have higher salaries and higher opportunities. We are happy having, in a decade and a half, a debt crisis in this country.  And what they are also saying is they are okay with the hemorrhaging of American industry leaving this country because of the tax arbitrage, where they can get a better deal in other parts of the world.  That is the absurdity of some of the arguments you have heard around this body.  So back to my fairly snarky comment: We get the joke. We understand there are many out there who are terrified of Republicans getting a win here. But I want to argue that this is not a win for It is a win for our society because, if we start moving away from that 1.8 percent economic growth that our congressional budget has projected for the next decade, we have a fighting chance to financially keep our promises, to have a strong military, to have that money for our education, to have that money for healthcare research, and for you as an American citizen to see your salaries increase, see your ability to save, and know you have a brighter future.  Mr.Speaker, just as an idiosyncrasy, over the last couple months, I have been keeping a little bit of a notebook of many of the comments that have come from my brothers and sisters in this body, some supporting the tax bill and making claims, many opposing the tax bill and making claims.  I am going to make a mark in my calendar, 1 year from now coming back behind this microphone, and we are going to open up that journal and we are going to read what was said. Hopefully the American people at that time will understand this is political rhetoric and this is actually based in math. And that math, I am desperately hoping and desperately believing, is going to be great for our country.

6,topic-id,726,"Thank you, Mr. This week, we took a major step toward helping the middle- and working-class family by passing the first significant tax reform package in a generation.  I wanted to take a few minutes to thank a lot of folks for their efforts, hard work, and dedication to this process. At the Member level, both Leader McConnell and Chairman Hatch did amazing work leading us through this process.  I also had the privilege of working as part of the Core 4, with Pat Toomey, John Thune, and Rob Portman, over the past year developing this bill. Those three guys are some of the hardest working Members we have.  I also thank Marco Rubio for his dedication to improving the child tax credit, as well as Mike Lee and Ivanka  We were also able to include my Investing in Opportunity Act as a part of the legislation. This is legislation that will help distressed communities throughout the country. More than 50 million Americans today live in those distressed communities, and the Investing in Opportunity Act can usher[[Page S8206]]in trillions of dollars of investment to improve the quality of life and create a spark in some of the most challenging areas of our country economically.  I thank my House sponsor of the bill, Pat Tiberi, and my Democratic cosponsors, Corey Booker and Ron  We could not have gotten this far without the hard work and dedication of the Finance Committee staff. I thank, in particular, Jay, Mark, Jeff, Jenn, as well as the entire Finance team for their amazing work.  I also want to take a few minutes to thank my staff. I have been blessed with an amazing staff here on Capitol Hill, one of the hardest working staffs I have ever seen. I want to start off by thanking my tax guru, Shay Hawkins, who has done a tremendous job of leading us through this process--fielding thousands of calls and responding to tens of thousands of emails. I would also like to thank my LD, Charles Cogar, for his dedication and his leadership through this time. My chief of staff, Jennifer DeCasper, has done an amazing job of making sure we stayed focused on the objective. The objective was not to simply pass legislation; the objective was, in fact, to change lives where we live, to help the average American experience a little more hope, a little more opportunity by keeping a little more of their money. I also thank my commerce director who has done a fabulous job, Sean Smith, in making sure we communicated effectively the message of hope and opportunity, and my scheduler, Brie Thank God for someone who could keep me moving in the right direction. One of the hardest jobs in Washington is being a scheduler for a Member, and being a scheduler for this Member is perhaps the hardest job of scheduling.  My entire team worked diligently, long hours, but that is why we are here. We are here to work long hours, but to produce results--unparalleled results--that will make the American people have just a little more confidence in their elected officials.  Finally, I have to thank the good people of South I was first elected to Congress in 2010, and one of my first pieces of legislation was the Tax Reform Act of 2011--February of 2011--to lower the corporate tax rate and to work on restructuring our Tax  Since my first days in Congress, I have been working on this issue. The good people of South Carolina allowed me to serve as a I was elected in 2014 and reelected in 2016. I will continue to make sure my focus is back at home, where the good South Carolinians who elected me have given me a great privilege.  I will focus on the fact that our work, our dedication should be focused on those folks. The good news is, during this holiday season, we believe this tax reform package will be an early Christmas present.  Let me just say to all the folks, no matter what side of the aisle you are on, no matter where you live in this country, we are blessed--truly blessed--to live in the greatest country on God's green Merry Christmas, and may the good Lord bless us with an amazing new year.

561,topic-id,1170,"Mr.President, we have had an opportunity for the last several hours to go back and forth to debate the benefits or the negatives of this bill. This is a historic night for America 31 years in the making. If you are watching this debate at home, you might be a little confused. As Democrats and Republicans continue to talk about the same bill using very different perspectives, folks must be wondering where is the truth.  I would like to spend a few minutes clarifying some of the important points, some of the misinformation that is coming from the left. First, this is not a healthcare bill. Our friends on the left have suggested that somehow, some way this bill will eliminate coverage for millions and millions of[[Page S8136]]Americans, and they will lose their coverage. The only thing this bill actually does is it eliminates the penalty for those folks who decide not to buy health insurance. In other words, this bill reduces the tax burden on families who are working paycheck to paycheck. One-third of the families who pay the penalty are families who make less than $25,000, and 80 percent of the folks who pay the penalty make less than $50,000. Contrary to popular belief on the left, no one loses their insurance, but they will have the option to do what is in their family's best interest, what is in the individual's best interest.  We have sought for ways to work with our friends on the other side because we know this legislation is not about the Republican Party, it is not about conservatives, nor is it about liberals. It is about Americans--Americans who for too long have worked too hard and have seen too little in their paychecks.  The government does not create jobs. No matter what either side says, we don't create jobs, but we can, through this tax reform package, increase take-home pay by taking less out. Now, some may ask the question, What does that mean taking less out? Well, for your average, single parent in America who makes the average income of $41,000, as my good friend from Alaska already stated, that individual household will see about a 73-percent cut in their taxes. Said differently, that means an increase in their take-home pay.  Now, I was thinking about folks back at home in South Carolina--one person in particular--Sherrie, who is a single mother with two kids and trying to start a new business. Here is an opportunity to have just a little more margin at the end of each pay period--$1,300. These are real dollars, and my friends on the left seem to suggest that a 73-percent cut in the typical single-parent household's tax burden is not an increase.  Well, the story continues. For the average family in America making $73,000, they are looking at a tax cut of 58 percent--over $2,000 more in their paycheck. When I talk to my friends who are typical Americans--Michelle and Joe living in South Carolina, working hard, raising two beautiful kids--having a 60-percent cut in their taxes is real middle-class relief.  This is a bill that delivers, and the good news is, only in about 7 or 8 weeks, the average American will have an answer to which side is right; is it the left or is it the right? The fact is, they will be able to take a look in their own paychecks and determine for themselves the benefits of this tax cut.  When we think about the things we should be working on to restore confidence that the average person has lost in the government, we do that by making sure our tax proposal speaks to the average family. So we do double the standard deduction for individuals from $6,300 to $12,000; for single-parent households from $9,300 to $18,000; and for two-earner households, we essentially create a zero-percent tax bracket for folks living at the Federal poverty level of $24,000. By doubling the standard deduction to $24,000, we have essentially created a zero-percent tax bracket.  The good news is, it gets better. For those folks with children in the house where your child tax credit used to be $1,000, now the child tax credit is $2,000, with 70 percent of that amount being refundable--an increase from what it used to be.  So many folks on the other side have talked about whether this is simplification, but when 95 out of 100 tax filers can simply use the standard deduction, it means that, yes, on the back of a clean piece of paper, someone can determine their tax burden. This is good news. Of the 6 billion hours spent annually doing their taxes, we are going to cut that number down significantly.  For our friends living in blue States where the SALT, State and local tax, debate has been so important, we have decided to sweeten the SALT solution by allowing a hybrid of either your property taxes or income taxes to be used within that $10,000 threshold.  We have even made it easier through 529 plans to prepare and to pay for education, K-12, as well as college.  The one thing I will say that we have heard a lot of from our friends on the other side--and you will hear more of it tonight--it is It is an acronym that means false evidence appearing real. It is not the truth, but fear sells. It seems as though my friends on the other side have decided, if you just keep saying it, it must be true, and over and over and over--and we will hear it more when I am finished--there are folks demonizing this legislation.  The facts are simple, and Senator Cardin said it himself. I wrote it down when he said it because I was like: That is a clear, concise, true statement. Senator Cardin said major tax relief for families, our bill.  We are on the verge of resetting American competitiveness. By lowering our corporate tax rate, we will allow the jobs of the future to be created here at home. With a 20-percent cut in your qualified business income, we will see small businesses prospering, and when they prosper, they will hire more folks. When I was in the gym this past weekend, a small business owner who runs a battery company with seven employees said, on January 1, he is hiring a new person.  A survey done of 7,000 manufacturers, the vast majority said that with this tax cut, they will hire more people, they will increase wages, and they will improve benefits. This is good news from a global perspective, this is good news from a small business perspective, and this is good news from an individual perspective.  It is time for us to complete the people's business and vote yes for tax cuts, vote yes for an improved business climate, and vote yes for a global competition where American companies and American workers are winning.

417,topic-id,496,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.  I rise to sadly oppose this disaster supplemental, which does not do enough to help Puerto Rico and the U.Virgin  This is a bill created by Republicans with little Democratic input. At some point, they decided that rather than working in a bipartisan manner, they wanted to try and address these disasters without taking into account some of the most important Democratic priorities.  In particular, it does not address many issues crucial to Puerto Rico's recovery in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and For instance, it does nothing to address the looming Medicaid cliff, which will devastate health kits access and delivery on the island early next year. It does not waive numerous local cost share requirements, which will make it extremely difficult for the government of Puerto Rico to access large parts of the Federal funding made available here.  It does not do enough to help States like New York and New Jersey and others that have generously opened their arms to our fellow citizens displaced by these storms.                              {time}  1500  It expands the powers of the Puerto Rico Fiscal Oversight Board, giving them authority to approve the recovery plans of Puerto Rico's government.  The end result of all of this is further delay in Puerto Rico's recovery. This is not the message that we want to send to 3.4 million American citizens this holiday season.  As I look at my notes and as I look at what this debate may become today, it really comes down to one point: we as Americans, we as the United States Congress, we as the U.Government still have not come to grips with the fact that, yes, we have territories, that, yes, we have colonies.  If you ask the American people, ``Are the people of Puerto Rico American citizens?'' you would be shocked before all this information went out on the hurricanes how many would say: ``I don't know. I served with some in the Army, but I don't know if they are citizens.''  Well, I think, more and more, we need to know that the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Marianna Islands, and Puerto Rico are part of the American family. It is not as a long gone member of my party once told me when I said: What are we going to do about Puerto Rico in this bill?  He said: Well, we have no money left over.  I said: Did you have money left over for the 50 States?  He said: Well, they go first.  I said: Why do they go first? Why can't the whole family go together?  So my plea that I have made for years, I continue to make. There is a bigger issue than the one we are discussing today, and that is the fact that we have territories. We have colonies. They are part of the United They should be part of our family. We should treat them as such.

The rule provides for consideration of the Senate amendment to H.1, an act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Mr.Speaker, last evening, the Senate, on a vote of 51-48, passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which I believe is in the interest of the American people.  This is a bold, progrowth plan that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash the free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses of all sizes so that job creators can focus more on bringing not only more work to their workers, but also hiring more workers, increasing paychecks, and growing a competitive marketplace all around the world.  Mr.Speaker, we are trying to expand our economy, and there is nothing more important for any Member of this body than to know that the things that are happening in their own local communities are about the ability for people, whether they are just graduating from high school, whether they are graduating from a technical school, whether they are graduating from college, or whether they are looking for a second job or a longer career, to be successful in the marketplace in their own area, in their own home--not having to move somewhere to find a job, but in their own community. That is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to increase wages for every single community across this country. My home of Dallas, Texas, has been home to so many people who have moved there as a result of the, really, unlimited opportunities that we see right now in Texas, and that comes because Texas has found itself to be their home because so many other companies have literally been run out of their States because of high taxes--high taxes that are placed on those companies and the employees to where it makes living and being competitive more difficult.  During consideration of this legislation in the Senate, a few, relatively small provisions were removed through points of order in the Senate under what is called the Byrd rule, a parliamentary tool used during reconciliation.  The first change made by the Senate under the Byrd rule strikes the language that allowed 529 accounts to be used for homeschool expenses.  The second change modifies a provision that imposes an excise tax on the investment income of certain educational institutions. The change strikes a reference to ``tuition-paying'' students, making the exception to the excise tax available only if the institution has less than 500 students or if 50 percent or less of the students are located in the United States.[[Page H10253]]  A third small change simply strikes the short title.  Mr.Speaker, all of these provisions were included in the underlying bill as it first passed the Senate and came to the House and passed. However, at the time that this was done, there were no parliamentary points of order which were raised, which were later done.  Mr.Speaker, these minor changes will allow us to advance exactly the same discussion that we had in this body, exactly the same discussion that we have had with the American people, exactly the things that we have talked about up in the Rules Committee and across this country, as Republicans have talked about the importance of the status quo tax laws that we presently have--moved so many companies overseas, moved jobs overseas, and is not encouraging American companies to be competitive because America, when combined with State and local taxes and Federal taxes, is among the highest in the world, which means that American business finds itself in a competitive marketplace, may be a great product, but, on price, we are not as competitive.  This will allow America to achieve the greatness that it needs for a great people who want and need to be great, also.  This legislation is about making sure that the rising worker, whether they are brand-new in the marketplace or whether they are an entrepreneur, or a mother or a father out in the marketplace looking for a job, will find the ability to be successful.  The United States is already the best place in the world to live. We are an incubator always for new ideas and small business, but we are now going to be able to celebrate that to make it easier. We are taking the Tax Code, instead of being the highest taxed Nation in the world, to be one of the lowest. It is going to mean great things for the American people, the American worker, and, most of all, for people who believe that we want America to be great again.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

320,topic-id,283,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we do recognize we have a difference. We recognize we had a difference at the time we announced we were going to do this bill and we were going to change the direction we were going. This was part of a debate that happened during the Presidential election, where we had an argument. The Democratic Party very clearly said: We need to raise taxes.  Every year we see where they are on the floor during budget time to raise spending $1 trillion and raise taxes $1 trillion. That is more than what they had done under President Obama, Speaker Pelosi, and Mr.Reid; except what happens when you do that is you kill the economy, you kill the investment in families, in jobs, and in small businesses.  In the year after we had the massive tax increase, we had a GDP rate of zero. That is because there was this huge transfer from free enterprise to Uncle Sam, so the economy failed to grow. Then as the economy began to normalize, it normalized over the next 7 years at 1.2 percent.  That is what the election was about, Mr.Since the election, what has happened is we have added over 1 million net new jobs, despite a huge storm summer that impacted a lot of employment. Our stockmarket has risen dramatically, meaning that America wants to be great again, too. We are going to make it together.  So we do recognize differences. They want a $1 trillion increase in spending, and they want a $1 trillion tax increase. We want to move it the other direction.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

352,topic-id,821,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York not only for her service to the Rules Committee, but also for her service to this body and to her party.                              {time}  1115  Mr.Speaker, the bottom line is, I will take her up on that. We will bet that this works because we looked at what happened when President Obama, Harry Reid, and Speaker Pelosi put a $1 trillion tax increase on the American people; then spent $870 billion on a surplus; then added in $1 trillion of debt when they worked the deal that was for student loans; then we did cash for clunkers; then we did cell phones for all; and it just went on and on and on and on. And now they want to place the $20 trillion deficit on  What we are trying to do is to recognize that we did look at what happened economically during the 8 years that President Obama was here: 1.2 percent annual GDP growth, while our trading partners around the world--Germany, Japan, India, China--all raised their GDP numbers off growing economies because the average rate in Europe for corporate tax is 23.6 percent, while America was at 39 percent, and States all across the United States raised their taxation just like President Obama encouraged them to do: to grow government, to make it more expensive.  But what happened is, then the free enterprise system was not competitive. We began losing jobs all across the country. We began losing our competitiveness because of the high taxation rate. That is why we are going to do something about it.  So when you raise taxes $1 trillion and spend an extra $10 trillion over 8 years, there is an impact. Of course, there is an impact. What we are trying to do is respond back to the American people, who last November said: Instead of going that way, why don't we go this way; why don't we be the world's leader; why be 24th in the world in competitiveness for business; why not be first or second; why not add jobs; why not do something that places Americans, the middle class of this country in a better position?  That is the call that we are about. That is what Republicans have been trying to do, and we are responding with a bill that is going to take Americans--instead of being the most expensive tax country in the world, we are going to make us among the best. We are going to be an attractor of jobs, of investment dollars, of opportunity.  The real problem with this country, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.Neal), a Member of Congress, spoke about it to the Rules Committee, tens of thousands of jobs that pay up to $60,000 in his home State are going begging right now. Thousands of jobs in this country are going begging because we do have a problem where America doesn't want to come and take these jobs; where we cannot have people who pass drug tests; where we have people who say: Well, I don't have those abilities. Well, in Dallas, Texas, my home, we have $21-an-hour jobs begging for people who could come and work.  Mr.Speaker, what we are trying to do is to encourage America and Americans, let's get to work. Let's make this happen. Let's not blame it on somebody else. There are jobs available in America, and we are going to answer the question. We are going to answer the bell. The Republican Party is going to stand on what we do right now, and we are willing to take what comes that way.  And I will tell you what comes that way. When you go from 39.6 percent, the highest corporate tax in the world, to where you mark yourself down where virtually the rest of the world is at 23, in this case 21, we are going to be competitive. Americans are winners. Americans want to win. Americans are the best at entrepreneurism. They are the best at being innovative.  We are now--instead of Uncle Sam taking 39 percent and making us drain our resources, we are going to incent Americans to go do it.  Mr.Speaker, my staff, Ron Donato, my tax man, who has spent a lot of time working with me listening to people back in Dallas, Texas, we think this is a good deal to make the free enterprise system, which is the greatest system in the world. We are going to fuel it; we are going to fund it; we are going to make it work.  Mr.Speaker, for that reason, we will be willing to land on what happens here, so mark your calendar right now. Go look at where we are, and watch where we are going. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support this rule.

1019,topic-id,868,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the underlying legislation.  This rule provides for consideration of H.3312, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017; and the conference report accompanying H.1, the Tax Cuts and JOBS  Mr.Speaker, this rule, and specifically the underlying conference report, is the reflection of a bicameral agreement between the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate, whereby we took some of the best ideas from across not only our conference, but this country, and from our respective ideas to make a tax bill that would combine them for the best interests of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, the bottom line is that what we are doing here today is that the Republican Party is relying upon the greatest system ever invented: the free enterprise system.  The free enterprise system has brought the United States of America not only the greatest economic opportunities in the world, but it is a system of rule of law. It is a system of a Tax It is a system of ideas that has made America the envy of the world.  Mr.Speaker, I also get politically what is happening. We are taking what the Democratic Party and President Obama did to raise taxes by $1 trillion, the largest tax increase in the history of the United States, and we are trashing that today.  We are saying that the production that it made of 1.2 percent over 8 years is unacceptable to the United States of It was unacceptable then, and we will not allow that to be the gauge that we will measure our success in the future.  Secondly, we are also going to deal properly and fairly with the Affordable Care Act, a law that placed extensive burdens not only on people who did not want the healthcare bill that was placed forward, but placed a tremendous cost on the middle class of this country and the American people.                              {time}  1030  What we are doing today is bold. We are going to make the big deal the big deal the American people want and need: a stronger, brighter economic future.  It is a progrowth bill that will overhaul our Tax Code and unleash our free enterprise system. It lowers tax rates on businesses of every size so job creators can focus on hiring workers, increasing paychecks and growth.  Growth and competition are the keys to an expanding economy. More jobs and increased wages in my home of Dallas, Texas, have allowed Texas to lead the Nation not only in job creation, but to make us the envy of the world. We are now going to do that for the entire United States and help make back home for every Member of Congress competitive in the world market.  With the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world, the United States today has a broken Tax Code that has forced businesses to not only move their jobs and research overseas; it has forced us to be able to strand billions of dollars of economic advantage that should be in the United  That changes today. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will stop and reverse that trend. It will encourage American companies to bring their jobs and their operations back to the United States by lowering corporate tax rates to be competitive anywhere in the world at 21 percent and encourages U.businesses to bring their foreign earnings home, unleashing trillions of dollars in our economy. That is the future that the Republican Party wants for the United States of America and the free enterprise system.  The conference report also simplifies tax filing. It eliminates costly special interest tax breaks. It protects the abilities of small businesses to write off interest on loans and offers a first-ever 20 percent tax deduction to businesses organized as S corps, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. This will be a boom not only for the stock market, which we have seen since the day after the election, but we have seen a boom on Main Street as job creators and new small businesses are seeking to reinvest not only in their business and in their community, but for the opportunity to benefit workers in the United States of  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a direct and immediate boost for middle-income Americans who have been struggling--struggling for 8, now, 9 years--to get a handle on not only their ability to work with a broken tax system, but the ability to work with their own local businesses to make sure that their city succeeds, also.  It reduces the tax rate for low-income and middle-income It increases and extends the child tax credit to more families and, roughly, doubles the standard deduction. With this piece of legislation today, legislation for middle-income families will allow them to be a part of an economic growth model for years to come.

1059,topic-id,725,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, and really each of the members of the Rules Committee for their diligence in working yesterday for a long period of time.  As the Rules Committee met last night, not only to consider this, but really to offer full and open debate, an opportunity was given for the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.Neal) to come and speak representing the Democratic Party; the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Roskam), to come and represent the Ways and Means Committee; and the distinguished gentleman from The Woodlands, Texas (Mr.Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, to come and thoughtfully articulate not only the ideas behind this bill but what we are going to do.                              {time}  1130  Mr.Speaker, it is true that what we are doing is taking what was done by President Obama and a Democratic majority in the House and the Senate that raised taxes a trillion dollars, that, in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, really raided the American people by raising taxes on them, by causing an economic downturn, a GDP rate of 1.2 percent--an assault on not just the taxpayer, but on the free enterprise system.  It is true that we promised this last election, through the election of Donald Trump, to Make America Great Part of making America great again means making Americans great again also, making Americans not only proud of their country, but giving them an economic opportunity, and that is what the Republican Party is doing here.  We have heard not only from Mike Kelly, Congressman Kelly, who spoke about making America better, making the free enterprise system better, we heard from Congressman Woodall about being in 24th place, which is what America is, 24th in the world in doing business in a friendly environment.  We cannot survive in 24th place--24th place--by keeping the current Tax Code we have, where over and over and over we see not only companies moving to other locations within the United States of America, but moving offshore, stranding dollars, and jobs going with that.  What we are attempting to do in this bill is to make America number one, make America and the American worker number one again. We are going to make the big deal the big deal for people wherever you live in the United We are going to offer an opportunity for you to not only be taxed less, but that business that is in your city, your State that proudly they represent their hometown, they will have the opportunity to now be competitive.  Forget this, ``Oh, Republicans want to move jobs offshore.'' That is what we are sick and tired of hearing. We are sick and tired of hearing that jobs and investments go overseas.  They are coming back to America because this places America, instead of being the bottom wrung in terms of taxes, as the highest in the world. We are going to go to where we are the most competitive, where the American worker will stand a chance to stamp ``Made in America'' on those items that they want, made from my hometown, the pride of authorship of the middle class of this country, pride of authorship of knowing not just is my country going to get better, but my community and I will be better.  It is about financial responsibility, but it is also about the integrity of the free enterprise system. The free enterprise system is the greatest economic system in the history of the world. It will continue to produce great and better things for so many people.  But, Mr.Speaker, the Democratic Party tried to kill the free enterprise system when they came after the free enterprise system. We knew it and we saw it, and the world saw it, too. 1.2 percent GDP growth as opposed to, now, with a new viewpoint about making America great, we have not only doubled GDP, but we have added, net, 1 million jobs.

206,topic-id,1498,"Mr.President, yesterday President Trump and congressional Republicans went to the White House to celebrate the passage of tax legislation that was partisan and that was rammed through the Senate earlier this week without one public hearing.  Debate on this bill in the Senate is over, but I think we must not lose sight of the impact this legislation will have on so many families and on our economy.  Make no mistake--this tax bill is not tax reform. Instead, it asks middle-class families and future generations to foot the bill for massive tax breaks for large corporations and the wealthy. By adding over $1 trillion to the national debt, this tax plan will undermine our ability to address so many of the real challenges that face this country and middle-class families in  Indeed, Republicans have already made clear that this tax bill is just step 1. What we have already heard from Members of the House is that step 2 is going to be next year, and that includes deep cuts to Social Security, to Medicare, and to They are saying we are going to have to do that to address the deficits that have been made far worse by this bill.  Meanwhile, the majority's headlong rush to ram through this tax bill has meant they jeopardized access to healthcare for tens of millions of  My colleague from Ohio just talked about so many families in his State who are worried about losing their children's health insurance. We are seeing that in New Hampshire, as well, and across this country. By considering only stop-gap, short-term reauthorizations of critical healthcare programs, fear and uncertainty have been created for countless American families.  Because the Congress has failed to enact a long-term reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, health coverage for nearly 9 million children across the United States is at risk. Congress has failed to enact a long-term reauthorization of the[[Page S8213]]community health centers, which more than 25 million Americans rely on for essential healthcare. And according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the tax bill's repeal of the individual mandate means that nearly 13 million fewer Americans will have health coverage in the next year, and many millions more are going to pay increases in their rates.  In addition, the majority has also failed to enact a long-term reauthorization of the Special Diabetes That is a devastating blow to nearly 1.25 million Americans who are living with type 1 diabetes.  All of these programs have earned strong bipartisan support. That is what is so hard to understand about this. All of these programs should have been fully reauthorized for the long term because I know my colleagues in the Senate support these programs.  Once again, we have missed a prime opportunity to address the opioid crisis. We desperately need a Federal response to the opioid epidemic that includes robust, sustained resources that match the scale of this epidemic.  Just this week, we learned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that because of soaring overdose mortality rates, life expectancy in the United States has declined for the second year in a row. For the first time since the early 1960s, we have seen the second year of decline in life expectancy because so many people are overdosing because of substance use disorders. In 2016, 63,000 people died from overdoses. If we were losing that many people to a war in the Middle East, there would be an outcry in this country. I want to know where the outcry is, and when is this body going to act?  On Tuesday, the University of New Hampshire released a study that cited a fivefold increase over the past decade in our State of babies who were born addicted because of their parents' substance use disorders. Yet, in the face of this uncontrolled national public health emergency, the majority has once again failed to find appropriate funding.  Again, this is an issue that I know has bipartisan support. I worked with my colleagues here on the other side of the aisle to try to address this issue. Yet it has not been a priority, just as funding children's health insurance and the community health centers and other healthcare initiatives--the Special Diabetes Program--have not been a priority for funding.  This is an enormous lost opportunity. We could have written bipartisan legislation to address all of these issues, and we could have fully authorized, in a timely manner, critical health programs on which tens of millions of Americans rely. We could have addressed the opioid emergency, which is ravaging communities across this country. But instead, what did we get? We got a tax bill that makes a mockery of reform. It makes the Tax Code more complex, not less. It will grow the deficits and our national debt. And instead of helping the middle class in reducing the complexity of our outdated Tax Code, it creates a bonanza of new loopholes for the large corporations and the wealthiest in this country.  The majority here in the Senate had no problem coming up with $1.5 trillion in unpaid-for tax cuts for the biggest corporations in this country. In the final days before passing the tax bill, they had no problem creating a new $700 million loophole for oil and gas partnerships that will benefit oil giants, such as Shell and They had no problem creating a new loophole for wealthy individuals with large real estate holdings--a loophole that has been described as a jackpot for the Trump family and for several Members of They had no problem retaining the carried interest loophole at a cost to the Treasury of $20 billion. I remember during the campaign when Candidate Donald Trump railed against the carried interest loophole as a giveaway to Wall Street that was unfair to American workers. Again and again, Candidate Trump promised to kill this loophole, but President Trump now enthusiastically supports keeping it in the tax bill.  Yesterday at the White House, Republican leaders and President Trump celebrated the tax bill, while at the same time, many in the majority party insist that the Federal Government can't afford to help 9 million children who depend on the CHIP program and tens of millions of working Americans who rely on community health centers or the Affordable Care Act for access to healthcare.  Well, according to a study by the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation released this week, by the time many of the provisions of this tax bill expire in 2027, large corporations and the wealthiest Americans will continue to enjoy the massive permanent tax cuts because those cuts are not set to expire, but almost every income group below $75,000 will see tax increases by 2027.  Make no mistake--this tax bill is a betrayal of middle-class Americans, and it is especially a betrayal of tens of millions of Americans who placed their faith in President  This tax bill is also a case of sadly misplaced priorities. The majority in Congress have been single-mindedly focused on passing this bill at every step, adding more and more giveaways to large corporations, instead of working across the aisle to focus on the needs of the middle class. Meanwhile, they have shortchanged the Children's Health Insurance Program, they have shortchanged community health centers, and they have shortchanged the Special Diabetes They have caused hospitals and clinics across my State and across America to begin the process of reducing their services. This really demonstrates a lack of understanding and a total disregard for the needs and priorities of so many  Yesterday, Republican leaders and the President celebrated the passage of their misguided tax bill, but Senators who care deeply about regular order and bipartisanship in this body are not celebrating. Americans concerned about our national debt and our children's future are not celebrating. Americans who see growing income inequality as a threat to our democracy--a threat made far worse by this tax bill--are not celebrating either. And parents of the 9 million children who rely on the Children's Health Insurance Program are dreading notifications from their States that their children will no longer have health insurance. These families aren't celebrating during this holiday season either.  As I said earlier, the debate on this bill is over, but I intend to continue to speak out against this very damaging tax legislation. I pledge to continue to speak out in support of the real needs of working people across America, including the need for affordable healthcare.  In the new year ahead, I certainly hope to be able to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to address these urgent needs. The American people deserve better than this legislation. They also deserve a Senate that values bipartisanship, that values cooperation and compromise and the service of all Americans, not just the largest corporations and the wealthiest in this country.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is recognized.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8212.txt,1901,SIGNING AUTHORITY,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1106,topic-id,505,"Madam President, New Hampshire takes pride in its many firsts among the States, including our first in the Nation Presidential primary. This year, Granite Staters have been celebrating the 300th anniversary of the New Hampshire State Library, the first State library in It all began in Portsmouth on January 25, 1717, when the 27th General Assembly directed ``ye Law books be distributed among ye severall towns of this Province in proportion according to their last tax, except two books which shall be for ye use of ye Govr & Councile and house of representatives.'' Three centuries later, the original books are surrounded by a modern collection of more than 600,000 items, housed across from the State house in The State Library is one of our most handsome public buildings, built in 1896 of New Hampshire granite, American steel, and Italian marble.  We Granite Staters love our libraries, and we have led the Nation in making books available to all citizens. As State librarian Michael York told New Hampshire Public Radio: ``We often use the term `anchor institutions.' There are 234 communities in New Hampshire and there are 234 public libraries. Nobody else can make that claim. Not McDonald's, not 7-11, not Dunkin' Donuts.''  In 1833, Peterborough established the first tax-supported public library in the world, a central collection of books owned by the people and free to all residents of the town. In the early 1800s, so-called social or parlor libraries sprang up across our State--places where dues-paying members came together to share books. A century later, wealthy philanthropists built free public libraries all across our State, including nine impressive Carnegie libraries. Phillips Exeter Academy, a private school in Exeter, NH, is home to the largest secondary school library in the world. Today every city and town in New Hampshire has a public library, and a key mission of the State library is to provide professional development for local librarians to keep them abreast of the latest developments in library science and technologies.  The State library serves as a centralized location for State and government documents, and its collection specializes in New Hampshire newspapers, authors, and books on New Hampshire history and culture. It includes an archive of Granite State political history, including posters, buttons, and bumper stickers from New Hampshire Presidential primaries dating back to 1952. One of its most prized possessions is a 20-foot, floor-to-ceiling ``Hitchcock map'' of New Hampshire, with the State's mountains, valleys, and lakes carved in relief by Dartmouth College--students in 1877.  During my years as Governor, I had the daily pleasure of looking out on our beautiful State library from my office windows in the State capitol. Both the building and its collection are among our State's most prized cultural treasures. I am grateful to State librarian Michael York and his professional staff for their dedicated service to our State and for their loving stewardship of this special building. I join with people across the Granite State in celebrating the first 300 years of America's first State library.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgS8148.txt,1901,CONFRONTING THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, I'd like to acknowledge the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Chairman  Under his leadership, the Committee reported, and the whole House considered and passed, all twelve appropriations bills for fiscal year 2018. That doesn't happen very often anymore, and the fact that we did it this year is a credit to our  We've heard complaints about considering another CR rather than full appropriations bills. And I agree that continuing resolutions aren't an ideal solution to funding our government. Ideally, all twelve appropriations bills would be enacted by October 1st.  That process provides the Congress with its best opportunity to set priorities across government programs, and it provides the most stability for agencies to carry out those programs in an efficient and effective manner.  But sometimes we need more time to complete those negotiations. For example, in 2010, the Democrats controlled both the House, the Senate, and the White Guess what happened when they hadn't completed the appropriations process on time?  They passed a CR until the end of When they hadn't completed their work yet, they passed another CR until December 2nd. When they hadn't completed their work--they passed another CR until December 22.  Then, when we took the majority, we ended up finishing the appropriations process.  So while CR's aren't ideal, supporting a CR to keep our government functioning is the only responsible vote today--for national security, for our economy, and for the general welfare of the American people.  As Chairman of the Energy and Water subcommittee, I am very familiar with the positive impacts the federal government has in each of these areas--whether it's the Department of Energy maintaining our nuclear weapons stockpile, the Corps of Engineers dredging our ports and waterways so goods and materials can move freely, or the Bureau of Reclamation providing tens of millions of people with water.  We must avoid disruptions to these vital activities by passing the continuing resolution before us today and then working towards completing our work on final appropriations bills as quickly as possible.  Will we get all our work done by the end of this next CR? I don't know.

316,topic-id,519,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, it seems like only yesterday we were here. Does it not?  Mr.Speaker, we are 5 days away from Christmas, but it feels like Groundhog Less than 24 hours ago, the majority stood in the Chamber and passed its partisan bill to provide tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and one  Speaker Ryan called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but, apparently, by a twist of fate, he is getting that great opportunity again today, much sooner, I am sure, than he anticipated, because we are taking the bill up again this morning.  Maybe in the mad dash to provide massive tax breaks for corporations and the 1 percent, the majority failed to do the due diligence and properly vet the bill.  We found out, after it passed, that several of its provisions violated the Byrd rule in the Now, everybody knows about the Byrd rule in the Senate, and I don't understand why this was not found in the conference that was held for maybe 30 minutes.  This is the rule that prohibits the Senate from considering extraneous matters as part of a reconciliation bill.  After passing the House, provisions in this bill governing 529 college savings accounts and exempting certain universities from an excise tax were ruled out of order by the Senate The bill was so rushed that even the title of H.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was found to be a violation. Let me repeat that. The very first words of the bill didn't pass muster with a nonpartisan rule keeper in the Imagine what other areas we have yet to discover.  This is a consequence of a process that was nothing short of an abomination. There were zero hearings on the text of this bill. Not a single expert was called in to give his or her experience. It got the votes to pass only after a series of closed-door, backroom dealings, and a conference committee between the House and Senate Well, I think there were some Democrats there, but they tell me that none of them signed the conference report. The Senate was such a sham that an agreement was reached before the first public meeting ever took place.  Now, I know this is not the last time, Mr.Speaker, we will meet here to try to fix this bill. Mark my words, we will be back here next year to make more so-called technical fixes because of this hasty consideration.  The majority is rushing to pass a bill that is historically unpopular, clearly deeply flawed, and we will be forced to clean up its impacts and unintended consequences for many years to come.  I think we have all got a second opportunity here, and I would wish that my friends, to whom I only wish well, would grab up all their papers and run for the door and forget about this tax bill altogether. But I know that that wish will not come true.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

340,topic-id,1217,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the Trump White House released a National Security Strategy Report on Monday, and it pointed out: ``The national debt, now over $20 trillion, presents a grave threat to America's long-term prosperity and, by extension, our national security.''  So what do we do about that? We are going to add $1.5 trillion more.  The overwhelming majority of expert analyses show that, even with growth taken into account, this bill will cause the deficit to skyrocket. It isn't just a threat to our economic security. According to the White House, it is a grave threat to our national security as well.  The bill in front of us costs $1.5 trillion and includes permanent tax cuts for corporations, but temporary ones for individuals.                              {time}  1100  So who do you think is going to lose those first?  It is really very troubling, I think, too: the idea of looking ahead to what we are going to be dealt with. And we understand already that next year the cry will be: Oh, look at this debt. This is awful. We are going to have to cut spending.  Entitlements will be the place where the Republicans prefer to go.  So let's prepare all of our senior citizens on Social Security, Medicare, and Of course, that also hurts the ACA, that they are going to be on the line next year.  Future Congresses will be pressured to reject the budget gimmick and extend many of those tax cuts, meaning the true cost of the bill is much higher.  According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the expirations and delays hide potential further costs, which could ultimately increase the cost of the bill to $2.2 trillion.  I am sure that my Republican colleagues will argue that growth will prevent the deficit from skyrocketing. But the CRFB reports that even with dynamic scoring, the total cost of the bill without budgetary gimmicks would be over $1.6 trillion and up to $2 trillion with interest. And that takes growth into account. As a result, our debt could exceed the size of our economy by 2027.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's analysis, entitled ``Final Tax Bill Could End Up Costing $2.2 Trillion.'  [From the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, 18, 2017]           Final Tax Bill Could End Tip Costing $2.2 Trillion       The final conference committee agreement of the Tax Cuts      and Jobs Act (TCJA) would cost $1.46 trillion under      conventional scoring and over $1 trillion on a dynamic basis      over ten years, leading debt to rise to between 95 percent      and 98 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2027      (compared to 91 percent under current law). However, the bill      also includes a number of expirations and long-delayed tax      hikes meant to reduce the official cost of the bill. These      expirations and delays hide $570 billion to $725 billion of      potential further costs, which could ultimately increase the      cost of the bill to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion (before      interest) on a conventional basis or roughly $1.5 trillion to      $1.7 trillion on a dynamic basis over a decade. As a result,      debt would rise to between 98 percent and 100 percent of GDP      by 2027.       Ignoring the expirations in this bill is particularly      disingenuous given the claim that using a ``current policy      baseline'' reduces the bill's costs. The (flawed) idea is      that the bill should be compared to a current policy baseline      that counts expired and expiring provisions as if they are      continued permanently. (For more on this, see Current Policy      Gimmick Would Add Half-Trillion to Debt (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/current-policy-gimmick-would-add-half-trillion-debt)).      Using such a construct does not make sense if cost of      continuing future expirations contained in the bill are not      included in the initial cost estimate. Policymakers are      effectively claiming $450 billion of current policy savings      while ignoring over $700 billion of current policy costs.       This latest estimate updates our tally of the gimmicks from      a previous version of the bill (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-tax-bill-could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion). The      changes made in conference include both tax increases and      decreases that mostly offset each other, with a net increase      in the ten-year cost of $9 billion (compared to the Senate      bill). With these changes, the bill now has a total cost of      $1.46 trillion, or roughly $1.77 trillion with interest.      While there is no new dynamic score of the bill, assuming it      continues to produce very roughly $400 billion of dynamic      feedback (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/official-dynamic-score-shows-senate-tax-bill-will-still-cost-over-1-trillion) would      reduce that cost to about $1.05 trillion, or roughly $1.30      trillion with interest.       However, this cost does not account for as much as $725      billion of potential gimmicks that the conferenced bill      contains.       In the earlier version passed by the Senate, we identified      $585 billion (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-tax-bill-could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion) of arbitrary sunsets and      sunrises of certain provisions. Most significantly, nearly      all of the individual income tax provisions would have      expired after 2025. Additionally, the expensing provisions      ``bonus depreciation'' began to phase down starting in 2022,      and a number of new tax increases appeared in 2026. Some      provisions were set to expire even earlier, such as an      expanded deduction for medical expenses and provisions for      craft beer and paid leave--clearly setting the stage for      future extensions.       The conferenced bill adds to the Senate bill's gimmicks,      which we explain here (http://www.crfb.org/blogs/senate-tax-bill-could-ultimately-cost-2-trillion). Most significantly,      it advances the start date of the bill's requirement for      research expenses to be amortized, which nearly doubles the      ten-year savings of the provision. Additionally, the bill      tightens its limits on the business interest deduction four      years in the future--a future tax hike that may not be      allowed to ever occur. Other changes are smaller and move in      both directions.       Adding these gimmicks to the cost of the bill would      increase the total cost to $2.0 trillion to $2.2 trillion.      Though the dynamic effect of making the bill permanent is      unknown, we estimate a permanent bill would produce roughly      $450 billion of feedback, leading to a dynamic cost of      roughly $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. With interest, these      costs would rise to $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion, or $1.9      trillion to $2 trillion with dynamic effects included, over a      decade.                      TRUE COST OF CONFERENCE BILL------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Policy                           Ten-Year Cost------------------------------------------------------------------------TCJA as reported by the conference committee...           $1.46 trillionSunsetting individual tax provisions after 2025             $315 billionAmortizing Research & Experimentation (R&E)                 $120 billion expenses after 2021...........................Phasing out full expensing after 2022..........         $0 to 80 billionMaking business interest deduction more strict         $0 to $75 billion after 2021....................................Making foreign tax provisions more strict after              $50 billion 2025..........................................Sunsetting more generous medical expense                     $45 billion deduction after 2018..........................Sunsetting credit for employers who offer paid               $30 billion leave after 2019..............................Sunsetting craft beverage tax reforms..........              $10 billionConventional ``Real'' Cost.....................       $2.0-$2.2 trillionPotential Dynamic Feedback Effects.............            -$450 billionDynamic ``Real Cost''..........................       $1.6-$1.7 trillionTrue Cost with Interest........................        $2.4-2.5 trillionTrue Cost with Interest and Dynamic Effects....        $1.9-2.0 trillion------------------------------------------------------------------------       As is, the bill would cause debt to increase from 77      percent of GDP this year to 95 percent or 98 percent of GDP      by 2027, depending on whether dynamic effects are included,      as compared to 91 percent projected under current law. If      expiring provisions are extended and late-stage tax hikes      avoided, debt could reach as high as 98 percent or 100      percent of GDP by 2027. In other words, the national debt      could exceed the size of the economy.

344,topic-id,294,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am not surprised that we are back here fixing the bill, though I am surprised it is so soon, because we have been saying all along that we have got a long way to go with this bill.  If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment that will prohibit any legislation from being considered on the House floor that limits or repeals the State and local tax deduction, or repeals the ACA's individual mandate.  We know that repealing the individual mandate will lead to 13 million fewer Americans with health insurance and will cost premiums to rise by 10 percent. Now, I know that not giving healthcare is not much of an issue for the majority of this Congress because they have been trying to do that for a long time.  The bill also caps the State and local tax deduction, hurting taxpayers in my home State of New York, in California, and in other States in the Northeast, all of whom are donor My own State sends $48 billion a year to Washington, money that we get back nothing for. But we are not going to be able to do that anymore without this deduction. What we are doing then is risking the stability of the revenues that fund the public schools, fire departments, and hospitals in those  Mr.Speaker, let's make things right and defeat the previous question.

351,topic-id,397,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the majority is clearly unable to responsibly run the House of Representatives, because here we are fixing the bill less than 24 hours after it was passed.  It is a perfect example of why we need to go back to regular order: actually holding hearings, have expert witnesses and testimony, and properly vet bills.  That is pretty elementary, but it surely is true. It is especially true for bills of this magnitude that will effect every single citizen in  All the while, the government is about to run out of money, and we haven't even been able to reach a budget deal. That is Friday that the government will close if we do not do that.  We still haven't funded the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides needed healthcare to more than 9 million children.  We haven't reauthorized the community health centers, which serve more than 25 million people.  We haven't renewed the Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income students rely on for their education.  All of those programs expired back on September 30.  But here we are, wasting valuable time trying to fix the disaster of a bill that the majority passed just hours ago. It is embarrassing and it is humiliating. If we don't do better, the public is going to make us pay the price.  I want to close by quoting an article that appeared this morning in The Washington Post, written by a great columnist, Dana I wouldn't miss his writing for the world.  ``Maybe he is right and all those blue-chip economists and the nonpartisan analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional Budget Office, and others are wrong. Maybe growth will dramatically exceed forecasts, millions will enter the labor force and find work, wages will soar, and the $1.5 trillion tax bill will pay for itself. But if all that doesn't happen, the Trump tax will be blamed.''  Mr.Speaker, I end the quote there, reminding you, as Senator Schumer did yesterday, that this could be an anchor around your ankles for the rest of your lives.  Mr.Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the rule, and the bill. For heaven's sake, let us take this opportunity given us and not force this onto the American public.

1020,topic-id,1579,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I think America is pretty apprehensive this morning, certainly those who know that two American Presidents and one Governor of Kansas have tried trickle-down fairly recently and found it did not work at all and, indeed, caused great economic harm. But we are walking into trickle-down once again.  I think there is a word that describes when you do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result--I won't use that word, but I suspect most of us know exactly what I am talking about--particularly at this time when this economy was really booming, really doing well.  I appreciate that there were pockets where people were not getting jobs, and this was pointed out by Richard Neal frequently last evening. We have such a skills gap that jobs are going unfilled in America, and that is what we really should be working on today.  The fact is that corporations are awash with money. The stock market is booming, and we have the lowest unemployment rate in 17 years. Why in[[Page H10191]]the world would we trifle with that to try a failed trickle-down policy again?  Now, emergency procedures were used to bring the bill up before us today. Now, what is this urgent attention that nobody could have any amendments or anything, that it was an emergency?  We are not reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, which a lot of people think is an emergency because it provides healthcare to more than 9 million children. We are not reauthorizing community health centers, which serve more than 25 million people; and, after killing Planned Parenthood--the money--that means a lot more people will need a community health center. We are not renewing the Perkins Loan Program, which many low-income students rely on for their education.  Those three programs expired on September 30, but we are not considering them today. Instead, despite a record of 86 months of job growth--every single month for 86 months we have grown jobs--and an unemployment rate that remains steady, the majority is prioritizing tax cuts--not tax cuts for the middle class.  Don't let anybody tell you that this is tax reform. It isn't. It is a moving around of rates, but very specifically geared toward helping the rich with nothing much for the middle class who work hard to make ends meet, but tax cuts for the wealthy. The middle class will see their money go directly to the rich.  That is what the bill was designed to do. You can tell by who wrote it. There is not a single Democratic fingerprint or breath anywhere to be found. Instead, it was crafted by the lobbyists who virtually run Washington under the majority's leadership. Some swamp clearing.  Consider this: there are 11,000 registered lobbyists in Washington, D.More than half of them--more than half of 11,000--reported working on the issues involving taxes during the first three quarters of this year. Each of the 20 organizations that hired the most lobbyists to work on tax issues have reported lobbying specifically on tax reform, covering the matters included in this bill.  Now, this is the quote of all time. One lobbyist admitted to The New York Times that few Members actually had any influence on the final product. He said, ``You are dealing with 14 people instead of 535 people,'' saying specifically, as much as possibly could be said, that the 535 people in the Congress representing the people of the United States didn't do a thing on this. They wrote it.  The New York Times has reported that the travel industry lobbyists directly emailed those writing the bill to kill an amendment on tourism because a competitor who favored it has been critical of President  Business lobbyists, after already securing a lower corporate tax rate in an early version of the bill, called the members of the majority and made it even more favorable to them. They secured the removal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision designed for the very rich to get away with paying no taxes at all, and we know some people who have done that.  The majority has been very clear about whom the bill is written for. One of the members of the majority, Congressman Chris Collins, said: ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me again.'''  But, Mr.Speaker, what about the average American? What about workers and members of the middle class who can't write big campaign checks or who don't have an army of lawyers to scour the Tax Code on their behalf? Those are the people who are going to be forced to pay the price for providing the wealthy with these tax cuts.  Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is certainly a man who prefers business and knows a thing or two about running a business. He recently wrote this:  ``Corporations are sitting on a record amount of cash reserves: nearly $2.3 trillion. That figure has been climbing steadily since the recession ended in 2009, and it is now double what it was in 2001. The reason CEOs''--this is an important point. ``The reason CEOs aren't investing more of their liquid assets has little to do with the tax rate. CEOs aren't waiting on a tax cut to `jump-start the economy'--a phrase of politicians who have never run a company--or to hand out raises. It is pure fantasy to think that the tax bill will lead to significantly higher wages and growth, as Republicans have promised.''  Now, that is not somebody who is an enemy of business, and he has called this bill a trillion-dollar blunder.  This is really a remarkable time in the United States, knowing that we are on the brink of passing a bill that will adversely impact virtually every American except the rich. The majority has the votes, and there is not much Democrats can do to stop it.  Let me say again, I am glad the Democrats are not involved in writing it, but it is an insult to the word ``reform'' to associate it with this bill.  The American people know they are not getting what they were promised by the majority. We know the President campaigned mightily on doing away with carried interest, but it is still in the bill.  The bill hurts the middle class, children, veterans, and the elderly by limiting or outright eliminating many of the deductions that they rely on.  Under this bill, the personal exemption is eliminated, the mortgage interest deduction is limited, the State and local tax deduction is limited mightily, and the moving expense deduction for individuals has been eliminated. Even the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is eliminated. That will cause premiums to go up by 10 percent for those in the individual market, and 13 million people will lose their insurance--13 million.  I want to pause on that because countless times I have stood here at this very spot when there were almost 60 bills to repeal and replace ObamaCare, so we have been able to insert this now in the tax bill, which will really hurt it. I have always wondered why there was such a rush to take healthcare away from persons, and I guess somehow that money--obviously, that Medicaid money--will pay for a lot of these tax cuts for the rich.  All the tax cuts made for individuals will expire in 2025, but the tax cuts for corporations are permanent. That is not what we call reform. That keeps our Tax Code complicated by design. Wealthy families and big corporations can continue taking advantage of a system that they helped create.  Broken promises are embedded throughout the legislation. For years, I have heard members of the majority come to the floor talking about the need to address the national debt. Apparently, that was little more than a talking point, because this bill explodes the deficit by $1.5 trillion and it is completely unpaid for. Because of that, Federal law requires cuts to programs Americans depend on, including a $25 billion cut to  This isn't fear-mongering; this is fact. Speaker Ryan said just last week: ``We're going to have to get back next year.'' Next year we are going to say: Oh, my, we are going to have to do something about this spending and this debt, and so we will have to cut spending.  What is he going to cut? The things he has always wanted to cut. He says: ``We're going to have to get back next year at entitlement reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.''  We have known he has wanted to do that for a long time.  So let me say this to the public watching today: When this majority speaks of reform, you should be very worried about your future. They pushed this scam under the guise of so-called reform, but it is simply a corporate giveaway. Soon they will be back here talking about reforming Social Security and Medicare to pay for what is going to happen here today.  Let's call it what it really is: a systematic dismantling of the social contract. It will impact everyone from children to veterans to the disabled. It begins today with this bill to help the wealthy who haven't even asked for it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

1058,topic-id,420,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the Members of the majority have lined up today to tell the American people how great this bill is. If that is true, why were they afraid of holding a single hearing or listening to a single outside expert?  The 1986 tax bill had over 30 hearings and 430 witnesses and took well over a year; this one about three 3 months--written, apparently, by lobbyists. There wasn't a single hearing held on the text of this bill, not one. It was jammed through the Ways and Means Committee where our amendments, the Democrats', were blocked.  Democratic Members had under an hour to review the final text before voting. It was rushed to the Rules Committee a day earlier than announced with only 4 hours' notice, so nobody had any chance to read, and the majority there blocked 140 bipartisan amendments.  This has been a secretive process on both sides of the Senators received the text of the final bill also within an hour of the vote. The nearly 500-page bill in the Senate was riddled with errors, last-minute edits, and illegible handwritten changes in the margins. There was a single meeting of a conference committee between the House and Members there were[[Page H10197]]prohibited from offering amendments or even seeing the negotiated text.  Imagine that, you couldn't even see what they were supposed to vote on. The Senators and Representatives sat around the table for show while the press reported that the deal, even before the meeting had started, had already been reached. The Democrats had no say at all.  House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady says he is proud of this process, but it will take a separate bill just to correct some of the errors here. And there is no reason to believe he would include Democrats in that process either. It would be another partisan effort.  Let me remind everyone watching that we used emergency procedures to meet this onerous bill. In this Congress, disaster relief is not an emergency. Isn't that amazing? Funding CHIP and community health centers is not an emergency. Disaster funding is not an emergency. But rushing these tax cuts to the wealthiest among us is an emergency.  This bill, which has no deadline, is their top priority, while real emergencies are being ignored, and it is shameful. I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question on the rule and the bill.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I have spoken in this Chamber before about our work to prepare students for our 21st century economy, but today I get to stand up[[Page H10232]]here and share the work that is being done by the people on the ground fighting every day to make a difference in the lives of the students in their communities.  The Alliance brings together educators, school administrators, private business, and the local Chamber of Commerce, a cohesive group of diverse organizations, to make real progress toward improving the workforce pipeline in Berks Their goal is to have 18 school districts in Berks County adopt their framework and eventually make it a statewide initiative.  This initiative is being led by Jill Hackman, the executive director of the Berks County Intermediate Unit, and the Greater Reading Chamber Thanks to their tireless efforts, and the efforts of many others involved, students will be exposed to new learning opportunities that can open the door to family sustaining careers.  I am very proud of the work being done in my district, and I look forward to seeing their initiative change the lives of some of the 70,000 K-12 students in Berks                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-19-pt1-PgH10231-5.txt,1E+14,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017,19,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

755,topic-id,607,"Mr.President, on a different subject, talking about keeping promises; that is, other people who are counting on us to be able to act in order to get their healthcare.  We have had 81 days since the funding ended for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers. Each State is a little different because of the various combinations of funding and so on, which meant not everyone lost care immediately right after. There are three States this month, others in the first of the year, and so on.  I literally received just a few moments ago a notice from our State saying it is very likely that if we don't act, in January, families in Michigan are going to get a notice that what we call MIChild, which provides healthcare for 100,000 children in Michigan of working families who don't qualify for help through Medicaid or other assistance--they are working and maybe at work they are getting healthcare, but it doesn't cover their children, or maybe they are not getting healthcare, and they want to at least be able to cover their children, that is what MIChild is all about.  It has been 81 days since the deadline of September 30, which stopped the Federal funding from going forward. This affects 9 million children nationwide and 100,000 children in Michigan.[[Page S8166]]In addition to that, community health centers across the country serve 25 million patients every year; 300,000 of them are veterans, and 7.5 million of them are children.  I had the opportunity last Friday to visit two wonderful facilities--one in Flint, which is in Genesee County, and one in western Wayne County--and see the great work they do and talk to some of the people who were there to get care. People are counting on community health centers and they are counting on the Children's Health Insurance Program in order to make sure they have the care they need for themselves and their families.  It is important that we act. We could act right now. This is bipartisan. We passed a bipartisan bill out of the Finance Committee in September, before the deadline. I want to thank the chairman, Senator Hatch, and the ranking member, Senator I was pleased to join with them. We passed it out of committee with only one ``no'' vote. We have bipartisan support to get this done. Senator Blunt and I offered a bill that is bipartisan and has had the support of 70 Members of this body in signing a letter saying to continue funding for community health centers.  Our plan all along was to pass the children's health insurance bill out of committee in September and add health centers and then pass it before the deadline so that it would take away the anxiety, worry, and fear that families now have about what is going to happen.  Every day that goes by, people are worried about what is going to happen. Are they going to be able to take their child to the doctor, be able to get their asthma treatments, handle their juvenile diabetes, cancer treatments, or the normal things that happen to kids every day?  I am not sure if there will be any votes today. We could, today, pass the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers and let families across America know they are going to be able to have the medical care they need for themselves and their children coming into the new year.

787,topic-id,1550,"Mr.President, I want to speak about keeping promises to a very important group of Americans as well; that is, our men and women who are serving us as veterans and serving us in the military.  Representing Michigan in the U.Senate is a great honor. I know it is for all of us. One of the best parts of the job is being able to work on behalf of Michigan's veterans.  From the Civil War to the World Wars, to the Korean war, to Vietnam, the Cold War, the Gulf war, and our fight against terrorism, Michigan's veterans have given us their all. Our veterans have always been the first in line to defend our democracy. That is why they should never be at the back of any line--for a job, healthcare, housing, or a world-class education.  Unfortunately, there are times when our veterans aren't getting the benefits they deserve, have earned, and have been promised. When that happens, it is our duty to fight for those who fought for us. That is why, in 2014, Congress passed something called the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, called the Veterans Choice  This legislation aimed to reduce wait times and provide medical services to veterans in their communities after we heard of very serious issues and horrible situations that had occurred for veterans in some parts of our country.  The Veterans Choice Act was created to meet a real need--getting our veterans prompt healthcare in locations that are convenient for them. This program is especially critical for veterans in rural communities throughout Michigan as well as throughout the country--people in rural areas who were previously required to travel long distances, hours and hours, for services.  However, since it was enacted, providers across my State and in many parts of the country have not been getting paid, rural hospitals have pulled out, and this program in Michigan has not been working.  Worst of all, too many Michigan veterans and veterans across the country are struggling to get the appointments and the healthcare they need. That is why, last week, I introduced a bill I am calling the Veterans Deserve Better  This bill will help our veterans in three ways to be able to correct what is occurring right now in Michigan with a private contractor--a private provider[[Page S8165]]who has not been doing the job. I have talked to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs who understands the problem and agrees this has to be fixed.  My bill will improve the scheduling process for veterans seeking healthcare. They shouldn't have to wait weeks or months to be able to get an appointment with a doctor.  Our military operates under the simple creed, ``Leave no person behind,'' but far too many of our veterans in need of healthcare are languishing in a system that simply isn't accountable to them. Through this private contracting process, that certainly has been the case.  My bill would require the VA, and any outside contractors who are setting up healthcare appointments through the Veterans Choice Program, to provide veterans with more and better information, and if veterans are still struggling to get appointments, they will be told exactly how to file a complaint so it can get fixed.  Second, my legislation will hold third-party contractors accountable. We have excellent service through our VA medical facilities, but this new system--which is supposed to make it better, quicker, and faster--has not been working, and third-party contractors, at least in Michigan, have not been held accountable.  The VA will track all appointments made through outside contractors who must schedule appointments within 5 days. Any appointments not scheduled within 5 days will be sent to the VA for followup.  Within 30 days of this legislation being signed, third-party contractors will be required to submit a list of the veterans who have been waiting for more than 15 days for their appointments. I know of many waiting much longer. We don't leave soldiers on the battlefield. We shouldn't leave veterans to fight alone to get their healthcare needs met.  Third, this legislation ensures that Veterans Choice Program providers receive prompt payment or denial of payment. If payment is denied, the healthcare provider will need to be told why and what information they need to submit in order to get the claim processed.  The VA will also be required to submit a report to Congress on the number of unpaid claims to Veterans Choice Program providers and to take action on those claims within 45 days.  What do I mean by providers? I am talking about our hospitals in northern Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula, in the northwest side of the State, and the northeast side of the State signed up under this program to be able to provide the care for someone who is more than 40 miles away from a VA medical center; then, they find they are not getting paid for their services to the tune of millions and millions of dollars.  Veterans who have served their country and the medical providers who treat them deserve nothing less than getting this system right. Appointments should be made quickly, payments should be made for service, and there has to be continual accountability. Unfortunately, we know they aren't always getting what they need.  One of those veterans is Jerry, a former National Guardsman who was stationed in Greenville, MI, on the west side of the He now lives in Sumner Township in Gratiot  Last January, Jerry received a scary diagnosis. He had a lesion on his brain. He needed to see a specialist right away. Veterans Choice was supposed to make an appointment for Jerry to see an endocrinologist, but when he showed up for the appointment, unbelievably, he discovered he was mistakenly sent to a urologist. After that, Veterans Choice sent Jerry to a family practitioner who had no record that he even had an appointment. It was 2 days off of work and travel to visit doctors that Jerry should have never been sent to in the first place.  By this time, Jerry was understandably very upset. He reached out to my office, and I am glad he did, so we could help. We were able to contact Veterans Choice on his behalf and get him the appointment he needed with the right specialist. Now, this is after his spending 5 months--5 months--trying to get to the right doctor. There is no excuse for this.  However, Jerry's issues weren't over. When he saw the same specialist a second time, Jerry learned the doctor had never been reimbursed for his previous visit. As Jerry said, ``It shouldn't take five months to see a specialist, especially with something this scary and serious. And I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not Veterans Choice will pay for my care that I have earned.''  Yes, Jerry, you have earned and been promised that care.  Jerry is exactly right. Unfortunately, he is not alone in Michigan--I know this from talking to colleagues in other areas--particularly with this same provider. I have heard from many other Michigan veterans who can't get appointments, are getting the wrong appointments, are having to travel long distances to appointments--which, this was supposed to stop veterans from having to drive long distances for appointments--or whose healthcare providers aren't being paid for their services and then deciding they don't want to participate in the Veterans Choice  My colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee are working on comprehensive reforms to the Veterans Choice Program, and we are staring down another funding deadline. It is important this gets done, and we need to do it right away. We need to fix the problems veterans are having to deal with on a daily basis. I am looking forward to working with colleagues to fix this as quickly as possible. Our veterans deserve better. It is time we pass this legislation and make sure they get it.  I would like to end with the words of a man who knew something about service and sacrifice on behalf of our country.  Before he was President, before he was a member of this very Chamber, John Kennedy was a veteran who served in the U.Navy during World War On August 2, 1943, the PT boat he commanded was struck by a Japanese destroyer in the South The entire crew ended up in the water, and two of his men died. Although Lieutenant Kennedy badly injured his back in the collision, he helped his men find safety on an island several miles away, where they were rescued a week later. Kennedy later was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his leadership. He once said: ``As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.''  I believe that is our responsibility. It is not enough to praise our veterans on special days, although they have certainly earned every word of praise. Instead, we must work together to uphold each and every promise we have made to them.  Veterans like Jerry and so many others have always been first in line to defend us. It is time to make sure they are not at the back of the line when it comes to getting the healthcare they need.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-20-pt1-PgS8164.txt,1531,1015,2017,20,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1336,topic-id,1069,"Mr.President, I am rising today to join my voice with so many others to support young people whom we call These young people were brought to the United States as children, sometimes as babies. For many of them, this country is the only home they have ever known. I should say up front that we need comprehensive immigration reform for our security and our economy.  Our Nation's immigration system is broken, and it hurts families, workers, businesses, and farmers each and every day. But targeting these young people who have come to our country through their parents--their parents bringing them as children--does nothing to solve the larger issues that we need to address in the Senate and in the  To remind everyone, to be eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, which we call DACA, young people have to have entered the United States before their 16th birthday. They must be attending school, have graduated or earned their GED, or have been honorably discharged from the U.military, and they must not have been in trouble with the law. Those are pretty good principles for all of us--following the law and working hard. When anyone does that, they should know that our country has their back.  Those who were approved for DACA were given a legal status to remain here and a work permit so that they could work and contribute to our country. We made these young people a promise, and we need to keep it. I feel very strongly that whether it is our veterans, our people in the military going to war who are protecting us every day, who are serving our country--we made them a promise that they would have healthcare, among other promises, to make sure that veterans are not at the back of any line.  When someone works all their life--they work 30 years, they pay into a pension, and they assume that pension is going to be there--that is another kind of promise. This is also a promise that was made to young people. If they worked hard and followed the rules and stayed out of trouble and contributed to our country, either serving in the military or going to school and working, they would have the right to be here and be able to contribute to our country.  Nationwide, we know there are about 800,000 young people who are covered by In Michigan alone, we have over 10,000 young people--10,000 young Dreamers--working hard and going to school, contributing to our economy and our quality of life in Many of them have DACA status.  Those are some of the numbers; however, we are not talking about numbers here. We are talking about people's lives. We are talking about 10,000 young people in Michigan who are attending colleges, starting businesses, creating jobs, buying homes, serving in the military, and raising American children of their own. They are proud to be here. These young people aren't numbers; they are our neighbors.  In Michigan, we care about our neighbors. One of these young people is named She shared her story with me, both last week and again today. I am so pleased that she and other wonderful young people are in town today to share their stories.  Nara was born in Her parents faced intense discrimination because of their different backgrounds; one was from Poland and the other was from In 2000, when Nara was only 4 years old, she and her mom were granted a visa to come to the United  Nara excelled in school. She graduated from high school with honors and attended the University of Detroit She also found ways to give back, leading service trips around the country and volunteering for organizations, including the Humanitarian Alliance of Michigan, World Medical Relief, and Children's Hospital of Earlier this year, Nara graduated with a bachelor's degree in biology and a minor in leadership. She was awarded one of Detroit Mercy's highest honors, presented to the undergraduate student who best exemplifies the mission of the university--leadership and service.  Another one of our wonderful young people is He was brought to the United States by his parents when he was a 1-year-old. He was just a baby. He has known no other country. When Juan was in high school, he tried to enlist in the Marines to serve his country. He longed to serve the country that had given him so many opportunities. His plans changed, however, when a recruiter told him that he would likely be deported after he had served his country. Instead, Juan got a job, hoping to save up money for college. The DACA Program allowed him to get a job permit and a better job. Today he is a prelaw student at Wayne State He hopes to one day become an immigration lawyer.  Juan said this:       I believe in . . . I was raised here. I love this      country. . . . This is my home.  Nara, Juan, and so many other young people are great examples of why we need to pass the Dream We need to extend DACA as soon as possible. I would love to see it happen right now, today. Young people are waiting, have been waiting, and are in horrible situations because they don't know what is going to happen. These young people have done everything right, and they don't know whether they are going to be ripped away from their family and sent to a country they may never have been in. They want to be here, contributing to They want to earn their degrees, start businesses, raise families, and give back to their communities.  We need comprehensive immigration reform. That is for sure. But first, we need to pass the bipartisan Dream Act[[Page S8088]]as quickly as possible. These young Dreamers have done nothing wrong. They have done everything right. They have done everything they have been asked to do. It is time to make sure our country stands up and keeps its promises to them. That is what our neighbors would do.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven). Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.

208,topic-id,2098,"Mr.President, as we all know, more and more brave women are speaking out about the abuse that has been reported in the papers--abuse by the powerful, in many cases. I want to say at the outset that the country applauds these women for their courage and for setting an example for others.  Some of the stories we have heard about involve sexual harassment, but some of the other stories also appear to involve even more serious crimes, including domestic violence and sexual assault, which is an incredibly important issue that often gets underreported all across the country. As a result of these news stories, I am certainly hopeful these kinds of problems--the domestic violence problems we have in America--are going to start to receive the attention they need and deserve.  Just as we are seeing more men fired from jobs because of sexual harassment and assault, we also need to see more get the punishment they deserve, in a court of law, for violent abuse. We also need to make sure victims are protected and that they have an advocate--a lawyer--who is on their side in these cases.  Unfortunately, many who are suffering from domestic abuse and sexual assault can't afford attorneys to file charges or, importantly, to even protect themselves and their families, their kids. Here is the big irony: When someone is charged with a crime--say a sexual assault crime, say an accused rapist--that person gets a Sixth Amendment right to counsel under the U.So the perpetrator gets the right to a lawyer. What does the victim get? The victim gets nothing--no attorney, no right to an attorney.  Think about that. An accused rapist gets a lawyer under the Constitution and the victim gets nothing. In fact, what they often get, in terms of crimes, are prosecutors, if it is a criminal case. Prosecutors do a good job, but they are often looking to score a win rather than looking out for the victim and the survivor. If it is a civil case, survivors usually go without attorneys.  I believe this is wrong. Fortunately, we have been working on this in this body. We have a bill to change that. Senator Heitkamp and I introduced a bill in the Senate that was passed unanimously by this body several months ago--and actually passed it last Congress as well--called the Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act, known as the POWER Congressman Joe Kennedy in the House has introduced a companion bill where it likewise has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. Some of the most conservative Republicans and some of the most liberal Democrats are showing a broad array of support in the House just as it has enjoyed in the  When it passes through both Chambers, the bill will be a robust first step in making more lawyers available, working on a pro bono basis for victims and survivors who can't afford representation. There are thousands--tens of thousands--who fall into that category, unfortunately.  So what is the problem we are trying to solve? Domestic violence and sexual assault happens every hour, every day, in every part of our country. According to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 25 percent of American women will be victims of domestic assault in their lifetimes--one in four--25 percent. That is a horrendous statistic. Every day in the United States, on average, three women are killed by a current or former intimate partner, according to the National Network to End Domestic That is also a shocking, horrendous statistic.  No place is immune. This kind of violence happens in small towns, in big cities, on college campuses, and in suburban homes. This violence transcends political affiliation, race, and socioeconomic status. I know a number of my colleagues have watched as I like to come to the Senate floor and talk about my State--the great State of Alaska--and I like to talk about how many things are so wonderful about One thing that isn't wonderful about Alaska is, we have the highest rates of domestic violence and sexual assault in the country. So this is certainly happening in my State, and it is one of the reasons I care so much about this issue. It is happening in every State--every State represented in the U. There are no simple solutions to combat this issue of nationwide domestic violence, but experts do agree that securing a lawyer for victims is one of the best ways, if not the best way, to get victims and survivors out of their difficult situation--out of what often is a cycle of violence--to get them shelter, housing, and medical care, and protective orders.  Studies have shown that when an abused victim is represented by an attorney, their ability to break out of the cycle of violence increases dramatically. One study found that 83 percent of victims represented by a lawyer were able to obtain a protective order compared to just 32 percent in domestic violence situations when they weren't represented by an attorney.  Not only would more legal representation help victims and survivors of abuse, but it would also help protect children. In these situations, children[[Page S8207]]are often abused as well. Paige Hodson from Anchorage is a survivor herself. She has been working for years with thousands of women as an advocate for women who are trying to get out of abusive relationships and women who are also trying to protect their children. These are complicated and often difficult issues and cases, but Paige has said it is critical for both the safety of the mom and the kids to make sure they are represented by an attorney.  So what does the POWER Act do? Every area of our country--every part of America--is represented by a judicial district that is represented by a U.attorney. Under the authority of the Justice Department, some States have several U.attorney districts. Alaska has only one.  Utilizing this national framework of all of our different U.attorneys throughout America, the POWER Act sets out a way to increase connections between lawyers and victims, between advocates and survivors. The bill, which has already passed the Senate, directs each U.attorney to hold at least one annual event, inviting lawyers and legal service representatives who want to provide their legal services and pro bono time to empower victims by representing them.  It also requires U.attorneys to plan and hold events with a focus on addressing these kinds of crimes--domestic violence and sexual assault--in Indian Country and among Alaska Native populations, where some of the abuse in the lower 40 and in my State is very, very high.  Another important point about the POWER Act is that it would not add a dime--not one penny--to the Federal debt. But here is what it would do: It would create an army of lawyers--thousands of lawyers--to defend survivors of abuse. Think about that positive vision. Think about that positive vision and goal. What a great way for Americans, especially attorneys, to rise up in a positive and constructive way in response to all the bad news we are reading almost daily about these issues and show the better angles, the better side of our country.  The model for this bill came from my State of As I mentioned, we have the highest rates of domestic violence and sexual assault in the country--something that no Alaskan is proud of. When I was attorney general, working closely with our legislature, our Governor, and many of the victims advocacy groups, we launched a strategy called the Choose Respect The Choose Respect Campaign highlighted this problem in our great  We did public service announcements about how real Alaskan men choose respect; we changed the laws to make the penalties for perpetrators much harder; and we provided increased services for victims. One way we did that was to hold what were called pro bono legal summits. I hosted those summits. We brought together lawyers and victims advocacy groups, legal services groups, and this actually worked. It worked. By 2014, over 100 cases in our State were handled by volunteer attorneys providing thousands and thousands of hours of volunteer legal assistance to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Think about that. Alaska has a little over 700,000 people, and we had over 100 attorneys come out--thousands of hours, just in our State, with a small population. If we could take this model to 300 million Americans, we literally would have an army of lawyers helping survivors with volunteer time and helping meet this significant unmet need throughout our country.  As I mentioned, the POWER Act passed unanimously in the Senate, but, unfortunately, it is being held up in the Ironically, it is stuck in the Judiciary Committee--the committee focused on bringing justice to It is stuck there. Remember, this is not going to cost a dime, yet it has been stuck for months in the Judiciary It is kind of ironic. These victims need help, and this bill will do that.  It is not only my bill to help victims and survivors of sexual assault that is stuck in the Judiciary My colleague, the majority whip from Texas, Senator Cornyn, has a very important bill that he came to the floor of the Senate just last week to talk about. It is called the SAFER Act and will help States ease the nationwide backlog of thousands of untested rape kits that currently sit untested in labs and on police storage shelves across the country. There are thousands. Ending this backlog could take perpetrators off the streets and provide victims and survivors the justice they deserve. We know this would work. We know that would help.  The SAFER Act passed the Senate under the leadership of Senator Let me talk about how important that bill is to the country. In my State, there are 3,484 untested rape kits, more per capita than any State in the country. Anchorage, my hometown, has one untested kit for every 164 residents. In Juneau, AK, it is one for every 160 residents. The backlogs are all across the country. As Senator Cornyn pointed out in his speech, there are 2,000 kits that remain untested in his State, the State of In Virginia, where the State legislature has made this kind of testing a priority, there are also more than 2,000 kits sitting on police shelves.  The Detroit Free Press recently reported on how, in 2009, officials stumbled onto more than 11,000 untested rape kits. After they raised enough money to test them, 817 serial rapists were identified. That is why this is so important. Once these kits are processed, they often give us the evidence to go after the abusers, the criminals.  It is remarkable to me that both of these bills--the SAFER Act that Senator Cornyn has championed and the POWER Act that Senator Heitkamp and I have championed--are sitting in the House Judiciary Victims are not getting justice right now with these bills sitting there.  Why on Earth would such bipartisan legislation, which would literally end up helping thousands of survivors and probably bring to justice hundreds of criminals who commit these heinous crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence--why on Earth would we have bills, which have bipartisan support and little to no impact on the Federal Treasury, stuck in the House Judiciary Committee? It is beyond comprehension.  To my colleagues in the House, let's move this. Let's move these bills before the holidays. Let's start focusing on bringing justice to people who really need it.  Helping victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault is not a Republican issue, it is not a Democratic issue, it is not a women's issue, and it is not a men's issue. It is an issue that affects all of us. Working together--as Senators, as Members of the House, as Americans--we should clearly unite in this cause, which transcends politics or ideologies, because we can start changing the culture of abuse. That is what we have been trying to do in It is going to take a long time. It is going to take a long time, but we need to act.  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the House--my colleagues particularly in the Judiciary Committee--recognize the urgency of these kinds of situations and will move the SAFER Act and the POWER Act out of committee and get it on the floor for a vote as soon as possible.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

549,topic-id,2230,"Mr.President, I would like to spend a few moments talking about why my colleagues and why the American people should be supportive of this very important legislation, historic legislation, that we are debating on the Senate floor. It is particularly historic for my State, the great State of There has been a lot of misinformation on this bill, and we are seeing a robust debate, which is fine.  I don't need to repeat all the arguments on both sides, but I will say that my colleagues on the other side have seemed to focus on one particular point. They are coming here and making this point again and again; that is, the point that this bill will supposedly raise taxes on the middle class. We are hearing it, and everyone is saying it. The problem with that argument is, it is fundamentally untrue. The truth will be in the paychecks of the American people, which they will see in a few months.  Let me talk about some of the provisions that are in the bill. The bill will be a middle-class tax cut for the vast majority of  Here are some of the provisions. These are in the bill. These are the facts. The bill doubles the standard deduction. For an individual, the standard deduction goes from $6,300 to $12,000. For married couples, it goes from $12,700 to $24,000. That is in the bill. That is important for middle-class families. It doubles the child tax credit. The child tax credit is doubled from the current $1,000 to $2,000, so more parents can claim it. It is in the bill. That is a fact. And it lowers rates. In fact, it not only lowers rates for middle-income Americans, it lowers rates on every single income bracket in the IRS code. That is a fact.  Bottom line, an average family of four making $75,000 a year will have about 200 more dollars per month in take-home pay under this bill--$2,400 a year. A single parent making $41,000 a year will see their tax bill decrease by $1,300. That is a 73-percent decrease. That is a fact. It is in the bill.  Let me mention one other critical way in which this tax bill will bring middle-class and working-class tax relief. It will get rid of the very regressive and unfair individual mandate of the Affordable Care About 20,000 hard-working Alaskans and over 6 million Americans have to pay a tax, a penalty to the IRS for not buying something--health insurance--that they cannot afford. Let me repeat that. They are penalized for not buying something that they can't afford. Think about the absurdity of that.  Here is why this is such an important middle-class tax cut. When we get rid of that penalty, close to 80 percent of the 6 million Americans who pay the ObamaCare individual mandate tax--close to 80 percent of them--make $50,000 or less. Think about that. Tonight, we are getting rid of that tax, that unfair penalty, and that will undoubtedly bring tax relief for the middle class.  This bill also decreases taxes on small businesses and companies so that they can reinvest at home in our great Nation, hire American workers, give pay raises, and help grow our economy.  Many of these ideas, doing these kinds of things, have been bipartisan policy ideas for years when we have talked about tax reform. Let me give you one. In 2012, President Obama said that our current business tax structure hurt American business and inhibited growth. He said that the tax system ``provides tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas and hits companies that choose to stay in America with one of the highest tax rates in the world.''  That is from President It was true then, and it is true today.  Something has to be done, and we are doing it tonight. The bill will also give small businesses and large companies a chance to help grow our economy. You have heard Senator after Senator come to the Senate floor. My colleague from South Carolina has talked about this eloquently for years. It is an issue I care deeply about. But here is the issue. We have had a lost decade of economic growth. For over 10 years, we have not hit 3 percent GDP growth once in a year.  It is an issue I care deeply about. As a matter of fact, I come to the floor and I talk about it a lot. One thing I have noticed in my 3 short years in the Senate is that I am not sure I have seen my colleagues from the other side ever come here and talk about the need[[Page S8131]]to rev up the economy or about the fact that 1\1/2\, 2 percent growth, which is what we have had for almost the last 13 years, is not good for the country. I think, unfortunately, a lot of them believe in this idea of the new normal--that America hitting at 1\1/2\, 2-percent GDP growth is America hitting on all cylinders. Don't believe it.  We talk about GDP growth. What is that? It is really a proxy for the health of the U.economy. It is a proxy for the American dream. In the last 10 years, that economy has been sick. For millions of Americans, the American dream, which is based on a strong American economy, has been a mirage. We have to change this. This should be a bipartisan issue. Getting back to traditional levels of 3 percent or higher GDP growth should be something 100 Senators agree on. This bill is going to help us do that.  Finally, I would like to talk about something in the tax bill that will greatly benefit my State and our country; that is, opening the 1002 section of the nonwilderness Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for American energy development. A lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have talked about this, but I am going to tell you this. I can't begin to describe the elation that will be felt by many--so many--in my State when this passes. The vast majority of Alaskans support this provision and have supported it for decades. Hundreds, if not thousands, of Alaskans have worked tirelessly to get it passed since the 1002 area was set aside by this body in 1980 for possible energy development.  Don't believe all the rhetoric about ``Oh, that area is off-limits.'' That area is actually on-limits. In 1980, the Congress said: We know there is a lot of energy there, and we should look at the opportunity to explore it. Congress, come back and make the call someday.  Hundreds, thousands of my constituents, my fellow Alaskans--and I know some are in the Gallery right now, right above me--have been working on this for decades, and I want to thank all of them. But we have been stopped. We have been repeatedly stopped. You are seeing some of the arguments, many of which are truth-challenged. So I am being polite to all of my colleagues.  Year after year, we have tried. The last time that we made a big effort in this, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle killed this provision in 2005. It was a crushing evening in 2005 when this provision did not pass. It was a crushing evening for the late, great Senator Ted Stevens, particularly when then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said that killing the ANWR provision and beating Ted Stevens was ``one of the joys of my life.'' That is from the former Senate minority and majority leader.  Voting for the provision to unlock ANWR tonight will be one of the joys of my life, and I am certain that Ted Stevens will be joyfully watching from above, smiling.  Last month, a group of Alaskans came to DC to testify before Senator Murkowski's Energy and Natural Resources Committee about the importance to America, to Alaska, and to our communities of the energy provision in this bill.  Matthew Rexford, who lives in Kaktovik, AK, which is a village that is actually in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, provided riveting testimony. Let me quote from that testimony:       My fellow Inupiat and I firmly believe that attempts to      permanently block development in the 100--an area      intentionally NOT designated as wilderness because of its oil      and gas potential--is a slap in the face to our region and      its people. It's exactly the same thing as saying ``It's okay      for everyone else in this country to have a THRIVING economy,      but you can't have one at all.''  To you people living on the North Slope and you people living in Kaktovik: Sorry, you can't do it.  Matthew went on to talk about how responsible oil and gas development supports local communities by providing jobs, business opportunities, and infrastructure investments, like schools and hospitals and clinics--things that most communities in America have in abundance. We don't have those in abundance in my great  He said that the industry ``has moved our people away from third-world living conditions--we refuse to go backward in time. It has provided other basic services most Americans may take for granted'' that communities like his don't have.  Increasing domestic energy production will not only be good for my State and for communities like Kaktovik, but it will also boost our country's economy, and--this is a very important point--it will strengthen America's national security.  My colleague from Maryland, for whom I have a lot of respect, just talked about how this is going to hurt our national security. I couldn't disagree with him more. Producing more energy responsibly--oil, natural gas, renewables--and making the United States the world's energy superpower once again will dramatically increase our Nation's national security. This is something that we should all agree on.  I have served in the Marines for over two decades, and I have served as a U.Assistant Secretary of State, whose portfolio included global energy issues. I have seen how energy can be used as a tool for good, productive diplomacy and for troublesome power grabs by our Nation's foes. When we don't have to import energy from countries that don't like us or when we have the opportunity to actually export energy--American energy--to our allies, this dramatically strengthens our Nation's national security.  The Presiding Officer and I both sit on the Armed Services We have heard for years from the Department of Defense's military and civilian leaders. Whether he be Secretary Carter, a Democrat, or Secretary Mattis, a great Marine general, they have all consistently emphasized this point: Making America the world's energy superpower will help with jobs, will help with our economy, and it will dramatically help our Nation's national security.  Let me conclude by telling a story that really emphasizes this point.  Last year, I attended the Halifax International Security National security leaders throughout the world attended. I was in a meeting with a great national security leader of this body, Senator John McCain, and we were meeting with a senior-level Russian dissident.  We asked him at the end of the meeting: What more can we do in our country to help push back against the Putin regime and the activities that it is undertaking to undermine U.interests around the world and in our own country? What more can we do?  He looked at us and said: The 1 thing that you can do is to produce more American energy.  Let me repeat that. In terms of national security, the 1 thing that we can do is to produce more American energy. We do it more responsibly and with the highest environmental standards of any place in the world. Opening the 1002 area in using those high standards--the world's highest standards--with the most advanced technology, will produce more American energy for the betterment of my State, my constituents, and for the whole country. We are on the cusp of passing a bill that will put more money in the hands of the middle class, grow our economy, and fulfill a 40-year-long dream for  The might of America has always been and will always be in the ingenuity of our people--the ability of Americans to make decisions for themselves, to live their lives as they see fit, to build, to grow, and to make a better tomorrow for the next generation.  The American dream does not have a price tag, but it can be stymied. It can be stymied and stunted by an overbearing Federal Government that wants to hinder the freedom of the individual and an overbearing Federal Government that crushes economic hope and opportunity through overtaxation or overregulation. It does this by telling someone like Matthew Rexford, who is from a small village more than 5,000 miles from here, that he and his people cannot make better lives for themselves and for their children by developing resources on their own land.  That is going to end tonight. At long last, that is going to change, and the vast majority of Alaskans--Democrats and Republicans, Native and non-Native--are going to celebrate. I believe, when the American people realize and experience the positive benefits of this bill through stronger economic growth, better jobs, and more take-home pay, that they are going to celebrate too.

838,topic-id,414,"Mr.President, I want to say a few words about someone in Alaska who has been very important in my Joseph Darnell, who we know as Joe, is the Alaska Regional Solicitor for the Department of the Interior, in Anchorage, He has been in that office since 1992, was made acting regional solicitor in 2010, and was appointed to his current position in 2013. He will be retiring from his job at the end of this year.  The Department of the Interior is Alaska's largest landlord, managing 61 percent of Alaska's lands. The way the Department of the Interior manages its lands and resources is critical for Alaska's economy and for the well-being of our citizens.  I know that I often talk about Federal overreach, and while it is true that, under certain administrations, Alaska has bared the brunt of much of that overreach, but it was people like Joe who made sure that rules and regulations were followed, that the people had a voice, and worked to see that good policy prevailed. A former staff member for the late great Senator Ted Stevens, Joe learned from the best.  During his tenure, Joe worked on numerous land management and land conveyance issues for the U.Fish and Wildlife Service National Refuge System, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Park Among the more notable was the land exchange between the United States and the Aleut Corporation, which resulted in the Aleut Corporation acquiring ownership of the closed Adak Naval Air Facility on Adak Island in the Aleutian  Joe was born in Seward and raised in Juneau, Kenai, and According to his wife, Joan, they enjoy cross-country skiing, riding bicycles together, and spending time in their cabin outside of One of his great passions is small airplanes. After the first of the year, they will both be spending a lot of time in their Cessna 175, flying across the great State of Alaska, and watching their daughter Anna ski for the ski for the Nanooks at the University of Alaska,  Through his decades of dedication, Joe acquired and maintained a peerless understanding of how both national and Alaska-specific laws operate on our Federal public lands in He has advised on and navigated a great many challenges for our State during his time in public service, and his knowledge and contribution will be dearly missed.[[Page S8253]]  Best of luck to him and to his family and thanks for all he has done for all of us.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8252-3.txt,2290,1015,2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1108,topic-id,272,"Mr.Speaker, the passage of today's bill is the first step to providing desperately needed once-in-a-generation relief from the failed status quo, especially in New York  Under this bill, the typical American family making $73,000 a year will see a tax cut of $2,059, and low- and middle-income New Yorkers can finally see an immediate raise in their January and February paychecks.  As a single working mom and a person who cared for my elderly and aging parents, I and my New York colleagues fought an uphill battle to include provisions facing elimination that are vital to seniors, single parents, struggling families, and overburdened job creators, many of whom have left New York State in vast numbers.  Despite the fact that these provisions faced the very real threat of elimination, our efforts were successful in securing the historic tax credit for a State like New York, with many of our Nation's most historic and most important national landmarks, expanding the SALT deduction--the State and local tax deduction--childcare and dependent care credits, and continuing the deductibility of medical expenses, to assist our most vulnerable seniors in defraying high medical costs.  In New York's 22nd District, 99 percent of itemizers deduct less than $10,000 in property tax, the cap which represents the new deduction.  Due to Albany's mismanagement, all the counties I represent are in the top 36 highest property tax rates compared with home value nationwide.

534,topic-id,1713,"Mr.President, tonight, once again, Congress is proving to the American people that Washington is broken. This bill is not a product of deliberation of the world's most deliberative body. It is a not a product of meaningful public hearings. It is not a product of compromise or months of hard work among multiple committees. It is certainly not the product of a grand legislative idea that was desperately needed to meet the demands of the public. The bill in front of us is the product of dysfunction, partisanship, and political desperation.  Thirty years ago, the Senate passed President Reagan's tax reform 97 to 3. After the conference committee had worked it over, it passed overwhelmingly with 74 votes. That could have been the case today, but there was never an attempt to have an honest debate about this bill, and there was no attempt to get bipartisan buy-in. I reached out to lend my perspective and Montana's perspective--the perspective of rural America--but my offer fell on deaf ears, and I never heard back.  I asked the President to work with me. I raised my concerns early, and they have never made an attempt to address those concerns. There was no effort to reach across the aisle and build consensus for this bill.  Once again, the leadership of this body chose to draw a line in the sand. They chose to empower the fringes and leave those in the middle out in the cold. As a result, the first major tax bill in Congress in a generation will likely pass with the support of only one party. That is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind.  As for me, I wanted a tax bill that would ensure that hard-working Montana families and businesses had a say in this process. I wanted to construct a bipartisan bill that provided folks with tax relief without adding to the debt. I wanted to simplify the Tax Code without gutting provisions that would help build our middle class. Today, we are stuck with this final bill that does none of those things, and our options are yes or no.  There are some things in this bill that are good--three, to be exact. This bill keeps in place important medical deductions that benefit seniors and help them pay for care as they age. It expands the child tax credit to provide a boost to families across the country. It lowers income tax brackets to keep a few extra bucks in your pocket each year. But when we look at the bill, we have to weigh the good and the bad.  Speaking of those individual tax cuts--the ones I just talked about a few seconds ago--well, they are only temporary. They are short-term promises that will disappear with the wind. Estimates show that more than 80 percent of this bill's benefits will go to the top 1 percent; 60 percent will go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of our population. In fact, hard-working families will actually see a tax hike within 10 years.  But for this country's biggest corporations, this bill makes their tax cuts permanent. So at the same time that taxes start rising for teachers and farmers and electricians and nurses[[Page S8112]]and working folks, large corporations and big businesses will still be reaping the benefits from the giveaways in this piece of legislation. On top of huge benefits, this bill makes no attempt to ensure that these corporations will use the savings to create more good-paying jobs.  This bill also destroys the foundation of our healthcare system. Because of this bill, 13 million Americans will become uninsured, and everyone else's premiums will go up by about 10 percent. It will be more expensive to see your doctor. It will be harder for rural hospitals and clinics to keep their doors open. More folks will end up in emergency rooms--the most expensive medical treatment. They will be sicker, their treatment will be more expensive, and the rest of us will be forced to pay for it.  The bad list doesn't stop there. It forces a $25 billion cut to This bill pushes millions of people out of itemizing their deductions--reducing incentives to buy a home or donate to a charity. It caps State and local income tax deductions, and this targets middle-class families. It changes the way we adjust tax brackets for inflation, which will force future generations to play catchup. It will force State budgets into the red and put critical healthcare, education, and law enforcement initiatives on the chopping block. It opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling, but that is not the worst thing about this bill. The worst thing about this bill is it saddles our kids and grandkids with more crushing debt.  In 2008 and 2009, this country was going through one of the worst economic crises since the 1930s. The debt was increased in that period of time. People often say that the government needs to be run like a business. Well, if you have a business, and income is not coming in, you have to borrow some money. That is what happened. With the economic downturn, the money wasn't coming in, so our debt went up. On the other side, if you are in business and you are making a few bucks and times are better--and they are good--you pay that debt down. Well, this country is in a lot better shape now than it was in 2008 and 2009. We should be paying that debt down at this moment in time, not adding $1.5 trillion to it.  I am going to tell you, as sure as I am standing here today, within the first quarter of 2018, there will be folks standing up on the other side of the aisle saying that we need to cut Medicare, we need to cut Social Security, and we need to take away subsidies for everyone, whether they be farmers, mothers, young families, the disabled, or veterans. Money that is used to keep our public lands in public hands, dollars that are used to make education more affordable, dollars for healthcare overall--they will tell us that we simply cannot afford them because our debt is so high. But today we are going to tack on $1.5 trillion for the sake of giving the richest of the rich a tax benefit and middle-class families a temporary benefit that will go away over the next 10 years.  How they have so quickly forgotten the fiscal restraint that we talked about when Democrats controlled this body. Our national debt is already above $20 trillion. This is more than $64,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country. The path we are on is truly unsustainable.  It is not the first time we have been down this road. Bush tax cuts were sold to the American people, and we were told that they would pay for themselves. Guess what. Today those Bush tax cuts are directly responsible for one-third of that $20 trillion debt. We know this to be true. Yet here we are, about to swipe the credit card one more time for over $1.5 trillion--to put our kids and our grandkids on the hook to pay it back while we get temporary relief and the large corporations get permanent relief.  For those of us who were ignored during this process, this is what we are stuck with. There are some good things but a whole bunch of bad things--more than I can count on my hands. We can't celebrate the good things and ignore the bad. Just because we ignore it doesn't mean that it is not going to come true.  This bill will not strengthen the middle class. It will not improve our schools. It will not lower the cost of healthcare.  Let's call it what it is. It is a tax giveaway to the wealthy masked as tax reform, and those who vote yes on this bill will do so at the expense of our kids and our grandkids. They will be paying this tab long after we are gone. What is ironic about this is that most of the people who serve in this body say: I am here to make sure the next generation has an opportunity. We are taking away their opportunity with this bill. It will limit their opportunity. It will cap their potential--all for what? I am not really sure because when I go back to Montana every weekend, folks aren't stopping me on the streets and telling me that the corporations and the wealthy need a tax giveaway. What they do tell me is this: We need to make sure programs like CHIP are around. We need to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for future generations. We need to protect our public lands. We need to pass a farm bill that works. We need to invest in infrastructure. Folks, this tax bill takes away all of that potential.  We have been at war for 16 or 17 years. The military needs rebuilding. It makes it much tougher. Everyone knows what is going on in North The potential to have to spend a bunch of money there is real. Infrastructure--whether it is broadband, highways, bridges, or water systems--is in dire need of help.  The fact is, the tracks are greased; this bill is going to pass. Rather than working on the pressing issues around here, the next excuse is going to be entitlement reform, which means we are going to do our level best, in the name of the debt, to gut Medicare and Social Who knows what else will be put on the chopping block to be ripped away from working families?  This bill ties our hands and prevents us from making the kinds of investments we need to build a strong middle class, which has been the envy of the world, and it puts our most vulnerable at risk.  I am going to vote no on this bill because it is a step backward. It raises the debt. It does nothing to solve the income inequality in this country, and it pushes the American dream further out of reach.  I yield the floor.

1305,topic-id,1338,"Mr.President, I thank Senator Isakson for his words. I thank the Presiding Officer, who is currently sitting in the chair, for his work on the Veterans' Affairs  I want to talk a little bit about Chairman Isakson before I talk about the Care Over the last year, I have been able to work with a great man from Georgia who has done great work. When we started out, we talked about doing stuff we could agree upon and set the stuff we disagree upon apart, and it has ended up where we have agreed on a lot of stuff, and we have been able to get a lot of stuff done.  I would just say, in a body that is full of impasse over this last year, Chairman Isakson has been a great guy to work with because the fact is, we have set aside the political labels, and we have worked for our veterans in that committee. It is not only Johnny and myself, but members on both sides of the aisle in that committee have worked very well together and communicated so very well to make sure we could take care of the needs of our veterans across this country, whether it was in rural America or whether it was in urban America, but our work is not done.  The Care Act Chairman Isakson talked about is a very important piece of legislation. It is a bipartisan compromise. It is a bill we all negotiated on, so not everybody got everything. There are always things in it that you wish would be better, regardless of where you are in the spectrum, but this program does a lot of good things for our veterans.  It, first of all, will eliminate the Veterans First Program and replace it with one that is much easier for veterans to navigate in a system that puts in place where the veterans can seek care. It puts that system in the hands of a veteran and their doctor.  This is a bill that passed out of committee 14 to 1, and it has 26 veterans service organizations, representing millions of veterans who have endorsed this bill. It is a good bill.  I wish the Veterans' Administration, which we worked so closely with on this bill, would come out and forcefully endorse it. I think that would help a lot.  What it does is it establishes a Veterans Community Care It merges seven VA community care programs into one program, with one set of rules for both providers and the veterans. It puts the decision of where to seek care in the hands of the veteran and their doctor. No more one-size-fits-all eligibility.  If a local VA doesn't have the equipment for a certain test and there is not another VA locally that can provide that test, the vet can go to the community doc. If the roads to another VA facility are closed for snow, veterans could go to their local doctor rather than waiting for the roads to clear, which is a big issue in rural  If a nearer VA clinic has a type of doc a vet needs to see, but there is a community doc closer and the vet has a bad back, that vet can see that doc in that community, as an example. It offers convenient, walk-in care so vets can get care closer to home for minor illnesses.  Third-party administrators--also known as government contractors--will have a smaller role at the local level, and the local VA will have the flexibility of when to use them for scheduling so what makes more sense for the local VA will not be decided by bureaucrats in  The second thing it does is it improves accountability and transparency of VA's spending. It requires the VA to give Congress more notice when funding levels of programs that impact veterans are running low. It forces the VA to put together a businesslike plan about how it is going to spend taxpayer dollars, and it gives Congress more visibility in the VA contracts. It requires accountability at the medical center, regional, and the Federal levels. If the clinic isn't brought back up to snuff, we know who has failed to do their job.  I could give you a timeline on what has been going on in the last 3 years with the Choice Program--not having enough money, having more than enough money, not having enough money. That will end when we pass this bill. Congress will be able to have the oversight over the Community Care Program that it needs.  It will give long-term certainty to our veterans because a lack of long-term certainty is devastating to those veterans, and it will give those who have served the consistency and the certainty they need. No more bandaids. We need a cure.  The third thing it does is it improves VA resources in healthcare. Veterans tell me, time and time again, once they get through the door, they love the care the VA gives them. I have been told by a number of veterans that VA has saved their lives. The problem has always been getting through the door, and the biggest reason for those delays to get through that door is workforce shortages.  So our bill incentivizes medical staff to work in rural and underserved areas and Tribal VA facilities. It deploys more mobile teams to provide additional care. It removes the barriers for veterans to access telemedicine, including mental health care, closer to home. It brings more nurses and heart and lung specialists to work at the VA and clinical staff to work at vet centers.  The answer to the VA is not privatization. It is to build the VA and use the private sector to fill in the gaps that the VA cannot provide. That is what this bill does.  It also expands the VA caregiver program to veterans of all areas and their caregivers. Right now, the VA caregiver program only applies to post-9/11 veterans. We have a whole lot of veterans--especially the folks from the Vietnam war--who are getting a lot older, and this caregiver program expansion to the veterans before 9/11 is absolutely critical.  So the bottom line is this: We have worked well on the committee. We have put out a good bill. We put out a bill that works for the taxpayer and, most importantly, for the veterans.  This bill is a long-term solution. We don't need another bandaid fix. The Care Act is our long-term solution. It provides the VA what it needs to hire staff for top-notch care. It provides an integrated network of community providers to fill in the gaps for that care.[[Page S8196]]It is a balance between those two, and the veterans win.  The VSOs are on board. They were part of the discussion on this bill. We talked to the VA extensively to make sure this bill would work for the VA, and they agreed.  As I said earlier, I would love to have the VA come out forcefully for this bill. I think it would help get it passed in this body.  One thing in closing. We are going to pass a temporary stopgap measure for our budget, and VA Choice funding will probably be a part of it. I will tell my colleagues that this is the last bandaid that I am willing to put on the Choice We need a long-term solution, and if we don't get that long-term solution, we are not doing right by our veterans in this country.  With that, I would again like to thank Chairman Isakson for his leadership and for his good work on the VA When we come back here in 2018, hopefully we can get this bill passed early in the session because it is the right thing to do for our veterans.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

307,topic-id,994,"Mr.President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination of Ronald Batory to be the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration at the Department of Transportation and to express my deep frustration that this noncontroversial, highly qualified nominee has been languishing in the Senate for over 4 months due to objections by a handful of Democrats over a parochial issue entirely unrelated to the nominee's qualifications.  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held a hearing on his nomination on July 26, 2017, and reported his nomination favorably out of committee with a unanimous voice vote on August 2, 2017. At that time, not a single Senator on the committee, Republican or Democrat, expressed any doubt about Mr.Batory's extensive expertise on rail safety issues.  Mr.Batory has over 45 years of experience in the railroad industry, in both management and operational positions, and he is a respected leader in driving organizational change and, most importantly, in advancing safety improvements. In fact, Railway Age called him noncontroversial and said: ``He is the best-qualified person to be the Federal Railroad Administrator in a very long time, perhaps in the agency's history.''  Yet, despite his unanimous approval from the committee, he has been blocked from assuming his leadership duties at this important safety regulatory agency. The FRA has critical safety decisions to make on a daily basis, and the agency needs strong strategic direction and management on time-sensitive safety issues. A senior adviser, which is Mr.Batory's current role at the DOT, does not have the same legal authority or ability to lead an agency as does a Senate-confirmed  It is time to stop hamstringing Mr.Batory and get him confirmed so he can operate at full capacity. Unfortunately, it appears that we will not be able to do that without, once again, engaging in the cloture process on a noncontroversial nominee. This takes up valuable floor time that could be spent on other priorities. Yet it will, undoubtedly, still lead to his being confirmed by a large, bipartisan majority of the This pattern of obstruction--burning up a week or more of time to confirm two or three nominees who end up with overwhelming cloture and confirmation votes--must end.  The Batory nomination is also significant for another reason. Earlier this week, we saw the terrible tragedy of the Amtrak Cascades 501 derailment in Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with all of those affected, especially during this holiday season. As the NTSB continues its ongoing investigation, we will learn more about the causes of this derailment and the measures that might have prevented it.  To be clear, the tragic events of this week were not caused by a vacancy at the helm of the FRA, but the Senate must act now to install a leader at this agency to advance any safety solutions and oversight found to be needed as a result of the accident.  To date, much of the discussion surrounding this accident has been focused on positive train control or what we call While it is still early to know what, if any, impact PTC would have had on this accident, I could not agree more with the Democratic leader who earlier this week said: ``We need Positive Train Control.'' He went on to say: ``The Federal Department of Transportation is not pushing Federal PTC hard enough.''  If he truly believes the DOT needs to do more, why is he, along with a few of his colleagues, standing in the way of Mr.Batory's nomination? After all, Congress has tasked the FRA Administrator with providing the oversight and strong push that will be needed to ensure railroads meet next year's December 31, 2018, deadline for full PTC installation and training.  Make no mistake, a strong push is what many passenger railroads need. According to the FRA's latest quarterly progress report for passenger railroads, only 50 percent of locomotives are equipped and PTC operable; 64 percent of required PTC radio towers are installed; and only 24 percent of required route miles are in operation.  The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee expects to continue to play its role in conducting strong oversight of PTC implementation, including holding a hearing in 2018. However, what I do not expect the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to do is to grant any further change to the PTC deadline framework that is established in current law. That is why we need Mr.When finally confirmed, he will play a significant role in pushing expeditious and successful PTC implementation.  This is not just the view of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I might add, which, again, approved Mr.Batory, as I said earlier, unanimously, but also of the rail professionals who advance safety on the ground. The States for Passenger Rail Coalition, which consists of 25 State Departments of Transportation, wrote in July:       The issues facing the railroad industry today are      significant, and it is vital that we have an experienced,      capable and dedicated leader like Mr.Batory, who is willing      to work with the states to make the improvements necessary to      build a national rail system with an emphasis on increasing      mobility and reliability, while enhancing safety and security      now, and in the years to come.       Likewise, rail labor--representing conductors and      communication workers--and other industry groups urged the      Senate to proceed to Mr.Batory's nomination ``as soon as      possible,'' stressing ``the importance of having Mr.Batory's      expertise and leadership at the agency responsible for      railroad safety.''

503,topic-id,2516,"Mr.President, relief for Americans is on the way. This evening, we will vote on the first comprehensive overhaul of our Tax Code since 1986. In 1986, I was a young Senate staffer. I watched as that tax bill passed on the floor of the U.I was a 25-year-old staffer back then.  In a couple of weeks, my wife and I will welcome our third grandchild into the world, so it seems only fitting, after 30 years, that we go about the business of reforming the Tax Code because a lot has changed in this country. A lot has changed in this country in the past 30 years, but the one thing that hasn't changed is the Tax Our Tax Code needs to be updated and modernized to reflect the times in which we live.  Since President Reagan signed the last overhaul into law, our Tax Code has ballooned into an unwieldy, complex maze that costs American taxpayers an incredible amount of time and money and acts as a drag on economic growth and job creation.  I will say that when I was elected to the Senate, I came here, as most of us do, wanting to do big things. We want to do consequential things. We want to do things that will impact the American people in a beneficial and a positive way, and that is certainly the case with tax reform. I sought to get on the Senate Finance Committee for that reason. The Senate Finance Committee has jurisdiction over tax, trade, healthcare, and issues that really impact and affect the American people's everyday lives.  In 2011, I had the good fortune of getting on the committee, and ever since that time we have been working aggressively, planning for this very day. The suggestion by our colleagues on the other side that somehow this cropped up all of a sudden, overnight, is absolutely inconsistent with the facts. Since I got on the Finance Committee in 2011, we have had no fewer than 70 hearings on tax reform and tax-related issues.  In 2015, the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, created five working groups. I was fortunate enough to chair one of those working groups. They were bipartisan, and they were tasked with looking at all aspects of the Tax Code, broken down into five different sections, and making recommendations for tax reform. We went about that in a very diligent way. We spent weeks and months developing ideas, reported those recommendations to the full committee, and those recommendations today serve as the foundation for the legislation we are considering. That was a bipartisan process, and the Democrats participated in that. A lot of the suggestions are bipartisan ideas. The foundation for this legislation frankly, in many respects, originated with those working groups that were worked upon by both Republicans and So we stand here today with a piece of legislation that has a lot of bipartisan substance in it, even though the Democrats have refused to participate in the process.  We started out with two major goals on tax reform. One was to put more money in the pockets of hard-working Americans and to create a tax code that would foster economic growth and make American companies competitive again in the global marketplace. Those are the two goals. The bill before us today--the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--succeeds on both fronts.  The bill provides immediate, direct relief for hard-working Americans, starting next month. It lowers tax rates for Americans in every income bracket. It nearly doubles the standard deduction, simplifying the code, meaning that fewer people will have to itemize. Across the country, it varies State by State, but, on average, less than one-third of the people across the country itemize today. Well, this will reduce that number even further. Less than 10 percent of the people in this country will have to itemize because of the doubling--or near doubling--of the standard deduction. It doubles the child tax credit and significantly increases the refundable portion of the credit, which will provide important additional help for low-income families, and it maintains the earned-income tax credit.  All of this means that American families are going to see a significant drop in their tax bills for next year. Just as a case in point, a family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000 per year will see a tax cut of over $2,000, and that represents a 58-percent reduction over what they are paying today under current law. If you are a single parent with one child and have an income of $41,000, you are going to see a $1,300 reduction in your taxes, which represents a 73-percent reduction over what you are paying today under current law.  So the idea, as has been advanced by the other side, that somehow middle-income taxpayers don't benefit from this is absolutely false. It is inaccurate because these are objective facts. A doubling of the standard deduction, a doubling of the child tax credit, and a reduction in rates mean that people in all income groups are going to see significant tax relief. Just to put a fine point on that, this is based on the latest analysis by the Joint Committee on They assess and look at how these proposals will translate in terms of income groups and who gets impacted by that.[[Page S8098]]  I want to point out that if you look at income by level here--different groups and their incomes--as you can see, every income group receives a significant tax cut. In fact, lower income Americans receive the largest tax cuts, and that, again, is according to the Joint Committee on The point made earlier by my colleague from the other side was that somehow this was going to be a huge tax shift in terms of who is going to pay taxes after all this is said and done. Well, if you look at the tax burden--and by that I mean who pays taxes in this country, the share of taxes currently borne by each different income category--as you see from this chart, which is broken down by quadrant, 25 percent of the filers are in this category, 25 percent in this category, and 25 percent with $50,000 to $100,000 in income, and then the final quadrant of 25 percent is those making $100,000 and above. Well, if you look at those in the lower income categories--and this is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation--their share of the tax burden relative to what it is today is actually the same or lower. So those in lower income categories, those making $20,000 to $50,000 a year--and that represents about 25 percent of filers today--pay 4.3 percent of total taxes in this country. After implementation of the bill, they will pay 4.1 percent of total taxes in this country. Their overall tax burden will have decreased after passage of this legislation.  If you take the next category, from $50,000 to $100,000, they pay today, under current law, 16.9 percent of the total tax burden in this country. After this legislation has passed, they will be paying 16.9 percent of the total tax burden in this country.  What about those making $100,000 a year and more, which represents about 25 percent of all filers? Well, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, on which these distribution tables are based, those in that income category who are paying today 78.7 percent of all the taxes in this country--after this is passed, they will pay 79.1 percent. So their overall tax burden actually goes up after this legislation is passed and enacted into law.  Interestingly enough, this is the most recent analysis by the Joint Committee on This is the distribution table that they just put out. The category that has the biggest increase in terms of overall tax burden is those making a million dollars a year and more. Today they pay 19.3 percent of all the tax burden, all the tax liability in this country. After this is all said and done, they will pay 19.8 percent. So their taxes--those with a million and more--are going up under this legislation.  So this idea--they keep saying it on the other side, but just because they keep saying it doesn't make it true. The facts tell a completely different story. These are the facts. Again, I have come back to the point I made earlier; that is, let's put it into language that people in this country understand. When they do their taxes, they are going to see a doubling of the standard deduction and they are going to see a doubling of the child tax credit. If you are a family with kids in this country, that means that for every child you have, instead of getting a $1,000 child tax credit, you will get a $2,000 child tax credit. Couple that with the lower rates--and the marginal rates are going to be a 10-percent rate, a 12-percent rate--and where those kick in at different brackets, you are going to see a significant reduction in taxes across all income groups. That is just the reality. I think it is important that we at least, as we are talking about this subject, talk about it in terms of the facts.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also preserves elements of the current Tax Code that have been working for Under this bill, homeowners and those aspiring to own a home will still be able to deduct their mortgage interest if they itemize on their taxes. Individuals who donate to charities, to churches, and educational institutions will still be able to claim those contributions as an itemized deduction. Working Americans will retain all the current options for saving for retirement, from individual retirement accounts to the various types of employer-provided retirement plans, like 401(k)s.  This bill also provides families with permanent relief from ObamaCare's burdensome individual mandate, which is a tax on lower income Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Americans will no longer be required to buy health insurance that they don't want and can't afford or face significant financial penalties, which today disproportionately fall on those who make less than $50,000 a year.  This bill also restores the deduction for major medical expenses to where it was before For this year and next, Americans facing the burden of significant medical expenses will once again be able to deduct any expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. I hope that eventually we will be able to make that change permanent.  That is not all this is going to do. This is not just going to help Americans now; it is going to help them for the long term. It is going to give them access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure future. How does it go about doing that? By rebuilding our broken Tax Code into a modern tax system designed for a 21st-century economy.  In order for individual Americans to thrive, American businesses need to thrive. Thriving businesses expand. They hire new workers. They can afford to offer those workers higher wages. But our current Tax Code has not been helping businesses thrive. On the contrary, it has been strangling businesses large and small with high tax rates and provisions that discourage growth and drive those good-paying jobs overseas. Plus, our outdated tax structure has left American businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  This legislation changes all of that. This bill lowers tax rates across the board for small and medium-size businesses, farms, and ranches. It provides a 20-percent deduction on passthrough income, reducing the top effective tax rate on this income to no more than 29.6 percent. It permits businesses with gross receipts of up to $25 million to use the cash method of accounting and to expense their inventory costs. It allows businesses to expense new investments in machinery, equipment, and building improvements. And it expands the amount of startup and organizational expenses that new businesses can write off up front, freeing up cash flow to get the business up and running.  Accelerating businesses' ability to recover the money they invested in things like property, equipment, and inventory will encourage new business growth and help existing businesses--including farms and ranches--expand their operations, create new jobs, and grow the economy.  The bill also helps family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches by providing substantial relief from the death tax. I would have preferred to eliminate what I think is a confiscatory tax once and for all. But in this legislation, we double the current exemption to over $11 million, and by doing that, this bill will take a vast majority of family-owned businesses, farms, and ranches out of the tax's crosshairs. Too many of these businesses have wasted tens of thousands of dollars a year on costly estate planning simply to avoid the death tax and preserve that family business for another generation. That is money that these individuals would rather be investing in their businesses and their workers. This legislation allows these businesses to save critical capital for their businesses instead of forcing them to spend it to protect themselves from the heavy hand of the government.  In addition to improving the playing field for small businesses, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will boost our economy by lowering the tax rate for larger businesses. Right now, America's global businesses pay the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. By reducing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, this bill will allow American businesses to compete and win in the global economy. Just as important, this bill brings the U.international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide tax system with a territorial tax system so that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.  We haven't talked a lot about this, but one of the most important reforms in this bill is the changes we make to[[Page S8099]]the international tax system. This bill also eliminates the incentives in our current Tax Code that encouraged companies to shift jobs, profits, and manufacturing plants overseas. This bill makes it easier for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities here in  Lowering the corporate tax rate and transitioning to a territorial tax system will boost wages, jobs, and opportunities for American workers employed by our Nation's global companies. It will also increase wages, jobs, and opportunities for workers at the countless small and medium-sized businesses throughout our country that make up the supply chain for America's global companies. That is a resounding win for American workers and businesses and for our economy overall.  As I said earlier, this bill is the product of literally years of work by Members of both parties. I am excited to be here as we get an opportunity to take this bill across the finish line later today.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1067,topic-id,585,"Mr.President, this week Congress sent the President a tax reform bill that will translate into real relief for American families.  I have spent a lot of time on the floor of the Senate talking about how this bill will benefit these families in South Dakota and around the country.  Today I would like to take a few minutes to recognize the hard work of those Members and staff who made the legislative goal of tax reform a reality.  First, thank you to Senator Hatch for his leadership and members of the Finance Committee for a job well done.  Numerous hearings, member meetings, and a lot of compromise helped us get this bill to the finish line.  As a result, the contributions and priorities of each member of the Finance Committee and, frankly, those of the entire conference are reflected in the final product.  Having once served as a staffer here myself, I would like to recognize the many staff members who contributed to this product.  Mark Warren, who serves as my tax counsel, has put in countless hours on this legislation.  It has not been unusual over the last several months to find him in his office when I arrive at work before 7 a.m. and still at his desk late into the evening. With decades of experience, including time spent at the House Ways and Means Committee and at the Treasury Department, I and other members of the committee and conference relied heavily on Mark's intricate knowledge of tax policy as we crafted this legislation.  He worked very hard to help me advance priorities in this legislation including provisions benefiting small businesses, farmers, and ranchers. Thanks in no small part to his efforts, we successfully delivered a tax reform bill that will work for them. Time spent at the office is time away from family. I am grateful to both him and his family for his efforts.  I would also like to thank my legislative director, Jessica McBride, and my staff director, Brendon Brendon is a native of Madison,SD, and has been with my office for over 12 years. Jessica is a native of Miller, SD, and has been with my office for 8 years. Their work, advice, and counsel were invaluable as we moved this bill across the finish line.  I would also like to recognize a few other staff members for their hard work: Jay Khosla, Mark Prater, Jeff Wrase, Nick Wyatt, Matt Hoffman, Tony Coughlan, Eric Oman, Jen Acuna, Marty Pippins, Alex Monie, Preston Rutledge, Bryan Hickman, Brendan Dunn, and Monica  I would also like to recognize Senator Toomey's tax staff member, Randy Herdon, Senator Portman's tax staffer, Zach Rudisill, and Senator Scott's tax staffer, Shay  I know many of them over the last few months were running on very little sleep and perhaps missing important events at home with family and friends in order to be here at work. Nevertheless, they were patient, thoughtful, and tireless in their efforts because they knew the work was important and the impact would be significant.  We have all benefited from their wise counsel and have a better product for it.  Early next year, this legislation is going to have a real impact on people's lives across this country. Their hard work and contributions helped make it possible. They all worked incredibly hard and should be very proud of the work you have done on behalf of the American people.  I thank them for their service, and congratulations on a job well done.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgS8248-2.txt,1534,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS",2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
157,topic-id,174,"Mr.Speaker, this is a historic day.  I am reminded that 17 years ago, I got elected to Congress, campaigning on tax reform and campaigning on the fact that it is not our money, it is our constituents' money.

528,topic-id,618,"Mr.President, when we pursue tax reform, invariably those impacted will voice concerns along the way. I know this from experience, having done tax reform in North  Everyone was for tax reform until it came to protecting their individualized interests. However, reform was not about protecting tax benefits for the rich or the like, as some of my colleagues have suggested--understandably, for political purposes.  Tax reform is what we can do as a Congress to help spur economic growth. Without growth, we cannot solve our Nation's problems. Having an uncompetitive tax code hampers the ability of the middle class to grow and prosper.  Through this process, we have fought to ensure that there are appropriate transition rules and protections for various strategic sectors in our economy, and I am proud of the work that both Chambers of Congress have done through the conference process.  When we debated the Senate's tax reform package on the floor, some of my colleagues offered amendments on discrete issues, and I believe that, for many of these issues, we attempted to embrace, as a body, a process that defines problems and works to solve them.  I also believe that the conference committee did a good job working with JCT and the Finance Committee to address issues, without jeopardizing the underlying tax reform measure.  For other issues that were not able to be addressed in theconference report, I believe that legislating is an exercise of continued and systematic work. That means we need to come back next year in a reconciliation process and continue to improve upon this legislation.  As an example of some of the work that we must still do, I do not believe that we should penalize companies for voluntary repatriation and believe that there should be targeted transition rules in place to consider those who have a history of voluntary repatriation and are not simply doing so late in the year as tax reform became a realistic possibility. That said, I understand that some things are not always achievable, and it is tough to treat some companies differently than others when everyone is making sacrifices.  Another area that I think needs to be worked on in future iterations of tax reform are tailored transition rules for different strategic sectors like the energy sector, manufacturing sector, and other industries that have foreign tax credits stranded overseas. Additionally, as we evaluate how the tax treatment for passthrough entities unfolds, we need to ensure that we are appropriately regulating and taxing capital deployers so that we are fully realizing their potential contributions to economic growth.  In its totality, I was happy to see that there was common ground found on issues such as: how JCT scores and evaluates insurance reserves; how the limitations on business interest deductibility affects different sectors, particularly those that rely heavily on debt to operate; ensuring that there is continued parity for pass through entities in the new territorial system by preserving appropriate export incentives in the Tax Code; and many others that are so important to State and local economies.  When I did tax reform in North Carolina as the speaker of the North Carolina State House, I received many of the same criticisms that I have received as we have gone through this current reform process. Our hard work paid off in North Carolina, and I believe that it will pay off for America--as a global competitor and for all  Thank you. I look forward to supporting this conference report, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the future as we continue our collective pursuit to make America the most competitive it can be and as we continue to help America achieve its economic potential.

536,topic-id,3399,"Thank you, Mr. I rise to speak about the conference report we will be voting on later this evening. Before I do that, I want to mention a few folks by name who deserve a big thank-you for the incredible work they did to get us to this terrific point we are at today.  I wanted to start with Leader His vision and leadership made this possible, and I am grateful for that. I want to mention Chairman Hatch, who also helped to guide the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over our Tax Code; Chairman Enzi, the chairman of the Budget Committee--without a proper budget resolution, this moment would not have been possible; Chairman Murkowski, who has fought for so long to open up this little tiny postage stamp in an incredibly remote part of Alaska to prudent energy development, and finally, tonight we are going to pass the legislation to do that; Senator Cornyn, our whip, who is also a member of the Finance Committee and played a very important role; Senators Thune, Portman, and Scott, with whom I worked very closely for a very extended period of time to try to find the consensus that I think we have reached among Republican  I want to mention Senator I had many long and ultimately very fruitful conversations with Senator Corker, who approached this in a very thoughtful and responsible way. I am very grateful for him.  I want to mention some of the staff who worked incredibly hard on this: Mark Warren, who handles tax policy for Senator Thune; Zach Rudisill, who works for Senator Portman; Shay Hawkins, who handled this brief for Senator Scott; Andrew Siracuse, who works for Senator Cornyn; and Bart Massey, who handled this responsibility for Senator Enzi, and Matt They all did terrific work.  A big special thanks to some of the guys on my staff who did an amazing job. Randy Herndon joined my team earlier this year and did an absolutely extraordinary job. Fortunately, he has an incredible wealth of knowledge about tax policy, and he was able to put that to work for Pennsylvanians and for Americans in a tremendously constructive way. Brad Grantz, my legislative director, also helped to guide this process. Dan Brandt, who is my chief of staff, did some great quarterbacking.  I should point out the Senate Finance Committee staff who worked incredible hours and did a great job--Jay Khosla, Mark Prater, Jen Acuna, and the rest of the Senate Finance Committee staff, and also Brendan Dunn in the leader's office, who played a very important role.  Speaker Ryan and Chairman Brady in the other Chamber played an indispensable role in getting us here, as did Tom Barthold, who leads the Joint Committee on Taxation, quantifying every wrinkle along the way in the final product, as well as his team.[[Page S8114]]  I should also mention that the President provided constructive leadership along the way, and we worked extensively with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and the Director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, from the White  This took a long time to put together and involved an enormous amount of work, but I am so proud of what we have brought to this floor and what I believe we are going to pass later this evening. The process started over a year ago when members of the Finance Committee began to tackle what seemed like a very daunting challenge--the most ambitious tax reform in 31 years. Could we really overhaul the entire Tax Code and achieve two very important accomplishments and do it with the very narrow majority we have, knowing that our Democratic friends did not want to participate in this process, and try to get this all the way across the goal line?  I am thrilled to be able to report that I think we have accomplished those two big things. What are they? 1, we were determined from the very beginning that we would not even attempt to bring a bill to the floor unless it lowered the tax burden on the families we represent--individuals, families, middle-income and lower income families. That was 1. 2, we wanted to fundamentally restructure the business side of our Tax Code so that American workers and businesses can compete and win in a global economy against anybody. I have to tell you, we did those things, and I think that is why this is going to pass tonight.  First, on the individual side, this is absolutely a direct tax cut for the vast overwhelming majority of low- and middle-income taxpayers. They will simply pay less in Federal taxes. That is the reality.  By the way, most high-income taxpayers will have some tax savings as well. I don't apologize for that. I am in favor of lowering the tax burden on everyone. While not every last individual is going to have a tax cut, the vast majority of people will.  We do it through a variety of mechanisms. I will not go through all of them, but a couple of the mechanisms that I think people understand and appreciate are, one, we doubled the standard deduction--what does that mean? That means that a couple filing jointly, as most married couples do, the first $24,000 of income they earn doesn't get taxed at all--zero, nothing. They don't owe a dime to the Federal Government on the first $24,000 that they earn. That one step alone results in a tax reduction for many millions of In addition, we lower marginal tax rates so that the income people earn above $24,000 gets taxed at lower rates under our bill than under current law. We also dramatically increase the child tax credit so that families with children get this additional benefit on top of the ones I just mentioned.  The net effect of all of this is that every single income category pays less in taxes. You don't have to take my word for it; that is the joint tax nonpartisan review of our bill. And low-income earners receive the largest percentage of benefits of all.  For people who are listening to this debate, whether in the Chamber here or watching C-SPAN, I can understand that they could be a little frustrated because they hear our Democratic colleagues say: This is a terrible deal for the middle class. Some have even said it is a tax increase. And they have heard me and other Republicans say this is absolutely a tax cut for the middle class. Who are they to believe? I understand that frustration.  Let me suggest that there is a simple way to cut through all of this--there are two, actually.  1, look what happened on the Senate floor during debate on this. The same sort of argument was taking place when a Democratic Senator offered an amendment to take our tax policy for low- and middle-income families and individuals and make it permanent. If this were a bad deal for the middle class, presumably all the Democratic Senators would vote no, but they did not. They voted yes. It was really quite an extraordinary compliment to our work that they offered an amendment to take what we did--which is not yet permanent; we weren't able to do that; we are going to come back and revisit that, and I hope we will make it permanent--and said: This is so good, we should make it permanent right now. So I appreciate the compliment. I appreciate the validation of the tax cut, that this is for low-income and middle-income families, and I want to work with them to make sure it is permanent. We should be able to do that.  The second way we know where the truth lies in this debate is in late January, early February, just check your paycheck. Take a look. Withholding is going to go down because you are going to owe less money to Uncle Sam, so you are going to get a take-home pay raise. It is as simple as that. So the mystery will be all gone when people take a look at their check and discover that, yes, look at that, I actually got the pay raise those Republican guys said we were going to get. I am looking forward to when that happens and, at that point, I think this debate will shift to other topics. That is my guess.  I also want to touch on the tax reform on the business side because I think that is what is likely to drive the economic growth and the opportunities I want to see for the people I represent. It comes in a context. The context is the weakest economic recovery in the history of the After a very severe recession in 2008, we never really had the booming recovery we have always had in the past. It is not a huge mystery why. Our Democratic friends had complete control of the elective government, and they did all of the things they wanted to do. They had the ability--and they did--huge, repeated tax increases with no reforms, a virtual takeover of healthcare, an avalanche of new regulations, and a massive spending binge. They did all of those things and, unsurprisingly, we got a weak economy, not a strong economy.  One of the specific problems we have had and that has plagued us ever since that recession is a collapse in the growth of the capital stock, which caused a collapse in the growth of productivity, and without productivity, it is not at all surprising that workers aren't getting raises. The path to higher wages for workers is allowing workers to become more productive. To be more productive, they need better tools, and better tools are acquired through investment.  So that was lacking, and that is the heart of what we are fixing. Our reform goes right to this challenge of lowering the cost of deploying capital. What do I mean by deploying capital? What I mean is investing in the very kind of equipment that makes workers more productive and allows them to earn higher wages.  A simple example is, you go to a construction site and there are two guys working and one of them is working a backhoe and the other is working a shovel. They are both digging a hole. They are both moving dirt. Which one do you think is getting paid more? The guy operating the backhoe is always making more money because he is able to be so much more productive than any human can be with just his bare hands and a shovel. So when we make it more affordable for businesses to go out and buy new tractors, new equipment, new machinery, that gives them the chance to put those more valuable tools into the hands of their workers.  By the way, someone also has to build those things. Someone has the job at Caterpillar of making that tractor. Someone has the job of making that vehicle. Someone has the job of making the machinery.  So all of these things coming together are a very powerful driver of economic growth--not the only one. Not only do we lower the cost of acquiring that equipment, we also lower the top rate that businesses pay.  We have arguably the most uncompetitive Tax Code in the world--the top rate of 35 percent. What we do in our bill is we lower that rate to 21 percent--slightly below the average of the nations we compete with; pretty close to the average. This is going to free up American workers and businesses to compete and win in all kinds of fields where we are getting beaten today. That is going to come to an end because when we have a chance to compete on a level playing field, American workers and American business, we compete and we usually win. We are going to get back to winning.  We also recognize that most businesses in America are not organized as C corps, they are organized as[[Page S8115]]passthroughs--small, subchapter S companies, partnerships. So we have a corollary, a reduction in tax rates for them. It comes as a deduction against their earnings. It doesn't apply to all partnerships. Professional services partnerships, for instance, don't get this treatment. I would like to revisit that. I think we want to revisit that because I personally would like to see this treatment expanded to that category, but the vast majority of businesses--partnerships, S corps, C corps--are going to experience a significant tax cut that is going to allow them to compete.  Another big, important feature is moving away from this global taxation system we have. We have all been so disturbed by the stories we have read about of American companies being acquired, sometimes by a much smaller company overseas, not because the economics of the transaction make a lot of sense but because the Tax Code drives them. It just makes very little sense, from a tax point of view, to have a multinational company headquartered in the United  So we have been driving these transactions that are terrible. They usually cost us jobs. They cost us growth. This comes to an end with this reform. We are not going to have this system where we punish business for bringing money back home to the United This punishment ends, and it is going to encourage a huge inflow of capital, of accumulated profits back into the United States, because no longer will companies be facing a penalty tax unique in the world. That is over. It is a very constructive development.  What does it mean when you take one of the world's worst business tax codes and you turn it into arguably one of the best? It means more investment. It means more people all around the world are going to want to invest in It means more Americans are going to want to invest in starting a new business or expanding an existing business. It means more business will be able to afford the tools and the equipment and the vehicles I referred to earlier. That is the source of economic growth.  Some of our colleagues on the other side don't seem to acknowledge that this is a reality, but there is no great mystery here. When you lower the cost of something, you get more of it, and when we lower the cost we impose on businesses becoming more productive, we will have more productivity.  All of this comes at a very interesting time in the economic cycle. What I am referring to is the fact that we are arguably close to what economists think of as full employment--4.1 percent, 4 percent. Very seldom does the American economy go below 4 percent for extended periods. It means that when this money gets put to work--when companies go out and start buying this equipment--they need workers to fill the orders, but then they need workers to operate the equipment. Demand for workers is going to go up.  What happens when demand for workers goes up at a time when there is a relatively small number who are not employed? It means upward pressure on the wages of those workers. This is exactly the dynamic we have been waiting for and we are going to trigger that and we are going to watch this happen. I think it is going to start relatively quickly--probably next year--that we will start to see upward pressure on wages. That means the people I represent are going to find that they have options, they have higher compensation, they are getting a pay raise because their employer--it is not because employers suddenly wake up one day and decide: Oh, I will just be more generous today. It is nothing of the sort. This is the only way they can hold on to their workforce, hold on to the employees they need.  So it is very likely we are going to see an increasing share of the total economic output in the hands of the workers who produce it, and I think that is a terrific development.  A couple of other points I want to touch on briefly. One is that this legislation also effectively repeals the individual mandate of Technically, what we do is we zero out the penalty. The penalty for noncompliance goes to zero, and so that is equivalent to repeal.  First of all, this is a great strike for freedom, in my view. It is appalling to think that the Federal Government has the right to force an American to buy a product against his or her will--a terrible infringement on the freedom of  Our Democratic colleagues have described this repeal as a stake through the heart of Think about what a damning indictment that is about It is a stake through the heart. If the only way ObamaCare can survive is if people are forced to buy the product against their wishes, what kind of product could that be? What kind of business model depends on forcing people to buy your product because they will not buy it if it is voluntary?  So not only is it a significant strike for freedom, it is also tax relief for low-income folks. This ObamaCare penalty in Pennsylvania, in my State--and I think my State is typical--83 percent of the people who get hit with this tax penalty are in a household that earns less than $50,000 a year. So this is more direct relief for low- and middle-income folks.  The last point I want to make--and I see my colleague from Ohio on the floor. He did amazing, great work getting us to this point. He was a pleasure to work with and enormously knowledgeable, and I just want to congratulate him for where we are today.  A quick word about the deficits. Let me start with a very simple observation. I am convinced that when we pass this legislation and it is signed into law, the Federal budget deficits will shrink as a result of this legislation. It is very simple. The reason I say that is the economic growth, the response to the reforms, the very profound reforms we are making are going to give us a bigger economy to tax, and the extra growth, the bigger economy, means more revenue to the Federal So you could reasonably ask: Well, OK, how much more growth do you really need, though, in order to offset the lost revenue that comes from some of the changes you are making? Fortunately, that is a simple exercise in arithmetic.  We know what the answer is. Whether it is Joint Tax or the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analysis is, we will need to average between two- and four-tenths of a percent of extra GDP growth--extra economic growth--each year, on average, for the next 10 years. If we do that, then we will have a smaller deficit as a result of this legislation, not a larger one.  So, for me, what this bill comes down to is a simple question: Do you believe in America? Do you believe in the capacity of the American people to restore the vibrant growth we used to take for granted, decade after decade of annual growth of over 3 percent that caused people's wages to rise and the standard of living to grow?  We have had this period that has been stagnant, and some of our friends think, Well, that is what America is now. Just get used to it. Accept it. That is the new normal--barely 2 percent growth, if you are lucky. I think that is nonsense, and it is not true.  I still believe in I still believe in American workers. I still believe in our system. I still believe we are capable of restoring the kind of growth that has always been our birthright.  I think this legislation takes a huge step in that direction. It is a direct, immediate tax cut and, therefore, a pay raise for the hard-working people I represent, and it is a series of reforms that is going to encourage economic growth that will result in higher wages and a better standard of living as well.  I am thrilled with the opportunity we have tonight, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation.  I yield the floor.

533,topic-id,1938,"Mr.President, thank you for the recognition. I rise also to talk about the tax issue and this horrible tax cut, but I can't help but mention a little bit about what I went through the last hour or so with some wonderful young people in my office.  First of all, there are 7,000 Dreamers in my home State of New Here is one of them, shown in this picture. This is Carlos was brought to New Mexico from Mexico when he was less than 1 year old, and New Mexico is the only place that Carlos has known as his home. I had the opportunity to visit with a number of young people who are very much like They have gotten in a bus, they have come to Washington, they call themselves the New Mexico dream team, and it is a remarkable story. They told many stories to me about their situations that sounded very much like Carlos's story. They urge us to protect them. They are fearful, they are emotional, but they are also strong and courageous. Let's remember these are some of our very best and brightest young people. We cannot lose them. We must continue to fight for a clean Dream Act--no doubt about it--and we need to remember the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are here in the United States and strive and fight for true immigration reform.  Mr.President, working families in New Mexico want good jobs and good wages. They want affordable healthcare and retirement security. They want a job and educational opportunities for their children, but the Republican's latest tax plan does nothing for regular families in New Mexico or across the country. It will not create good-paying jobs, not now nor for our children. It will kick 13 million people off healthcare and raise insurance premiums. Their plan threatens Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and it does nothing to improve public education or bring down the high cost of college.  The Republican tax plan overwhelmingly benefits the rich by giving huge tax breaks to their campaign donors, to the superwealthy, big corporations, multinational businesses, and hedge funds. One of the biggest problems is, the Republican plan will drive up the debt by $1.5 trillion, and that means they will have to take a hatchet to programs working families rely on. This is not a responsible or a fair tax plan. It is a hocus-pocus tax sham, and I oppose it.  I have to reflect a little on this first year that we have seen under President Trump and the Republican majority--what a year of lost opportunities. If the Republicans had worked with us during this year, we could have had at least two big bipartisan achievements. We could have had a bipartisan improvement on healthcare, built on the successes of the Affordable Care Act, and we could have had a fair tax bill for all How sad partisanship and politics got the upper hand.  The Senate and the House majority are pushing this tax scam as fast as they can to hide it from the American people. We have not had proper hearings. We have not heard from expert witnesses or had adequate independent analysis. Even the Republicans don't know what is in it. My office has met with many New Mexicans raising red flags on the unintended consequences of this bill. No Member of Congress--no Democrats or Republicans--has had enough time to digest and understand this plan.  When it comes to legislation this important, we must follow the regular order. We must see a full analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on We must hear from the best tax experts in the country. The American people must understand the plan, and every Member of Congress must fully understand its impacts. We are not there.  Republicans and the President are not being straight about what this plan will mean for the average They aren't talking about how it will affect the President's own personal taxes. He touts it as a tax cut for the middle class and working Americans, but not one single objective analysis says it is designated to help the middle class, and his Treasury Department's one-page so-called analysis predicting a $300 billion surplus is built on unrealistic growth assumptions that no serious economist accepts. Even Republicans have said the bill is about helping their donors and cutting taxes for big corporations.  The American people are not blind. They aren't fooled by the administration's fake numbers, and they oppose this plan. Recent polling, as recent as December 13, shows that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of the bill. Sixty-five percent say the wealthy benefit the most, and almost all pollsters come out somewhere in that range.  Now, let's look at some of the hard, cold numbers. First, we know the Republicans propose adding $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years. This chart shows the difference between the Federal deficit under current law and the massive increase in the deficit under the Senate Republicans' plan. Current law is in blue, as you can see here, and the Republicans' plan is in red. It is pretty dramatic--pretty dramatic. Republicans represent themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility, but incurring this amount of debt to give big tax breaks to the rich is patently irresponsible.  To pay for this debt, the government will have to borrow by selling Treasury bills, notes, bonds, securities, and savings bonds. Based on estimates from the JTC and the CBO, the government's cost to borrow to pay for this debt will be over $40 billion over the next 10 years and even more after that unless we pay off the debt. The American people will be on the hook for $1.5 trillion. That is $12,742 for each and every American household today. My colleagues have come to the floor saying this tax bill will provide an average tax cut of around $2,000 for 1 year in 2019. What they aren't telling you is, they are also opening a line of credit on you and your family of $12,000.  This is the new Federal debt that would be taken out in every American's name every year by the So much additional borrowing by the Federal Government can also drive up interest rates. Higher interest rates mean higher costs for the government to borrow. The Congressional Budget[[Page S8111]]Office estimates that if interest rates are 1 percent higher annually than projected through 2027, the debt will be $1.5 trillion higher--that is 6 percent of gross domestic product--and the amount each American owes on their new forced Federal credit card would go up even more.  Increased Federal interest rates have real consequences for the average A rise in rates can price out a first-time home buyer; it can determine whether a young person can afford to buy a car. The average American consumer does not want to see interest rates go up. Increased government borrowing and interest rates can take up the economy's lending capacity and discourage the very private investment Republicans say they want to encourage.  Giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy also will force massive cuts in revenue coming into the Federal When I first arrived in the Senate, Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota was chair of the Budget He was a master on the Federal deficit and on the Federal budget, and he understood the danger of racking up huge deficits. In 2011, the Budget Committee was concerned that the debt threatened the national security. The committee majority developed a budget framework that Senator Conrad presented on the floor that He showed us many charts that day. One showed that the government had a budget surplus for only 5 of the last 50 years--that was in 1969, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. In those years, revenues were close to 20 percent of gross domestic product.  Around the same time, the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles budget commission concluded that the Federal Government needed revenue equal to 21 percent, but the Republicans' current tax cut legislation would leave the Federal Government with revenue of only 17 percent of  Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers sounded alarm bells in an op-ed in the Washington Post on December 10, and Larry Summers isn't alone. Bruce Bartlett was an economic adviser to Presidents Reagan and George In a September Washington Post op-ed, he freely acknowledged that he ``had a hand in creating the Republican tax myth.'' He is referring to the myth that tax cuts lead to robust economic growth. Mr.Bartlett now says: ``Republican rhetoric around tax cutting'' is ``wishful thinking. . . . In reality, there's no evidence that a tax cut would spur growth.''  In other words, tax cuts will not spur economic growth. They will create more debt, squeeze consumers, and mean steep cuts to vital government programs. So why is the majority pushing so hard for them? Why do they want this tax cut bill so badly?  There is really only one reason--for their donors. Representative Chris Collins of New York was honest about why he has to deliver tax cuts. He said, ``My donors''--and this is his quote, Congressman Collins--``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me again.' ''  Making the superrich even richer doesn't justify burdening our kids with huge government debt. It doesn't excuse threatening American healthcare, retirement security, and other vital programs, but cutting vital Federal programs is exactly the price the middle class and working Americans will be expected to pay under the Republicans' tax sham. Their plan calls for $500 billion worth of cuts, and Speaker Ryan is already talking about where they will cut. He said:       We are going to have to get back next year at entitlement      reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.      Frankly, it's the healthcare entitlements that are the big      drivers of our debt, so we spend more time on healthcare      entitlements--because that is really where the problem lies,      fiscally speaking.  He wants to starve the Treasury to benefit the wealthy, and then he wants to slash critical programs that create jobs, support innovation, secure our Nation, and help people pay for housing, food, and medicine.  I want to support tax cuts for middle-class families. I want to help make sure that working people can take home more of their pay. I also want to make sure we can pay for roads, bridges, schools, scientific research, and national defense. This bill doesn't do that; it does exactly the opposite. It takes money from the middle-class families and gives it to the ultrarich. Then it leaves us with little to support our communities, little for infrastructure, little to make the United States of America continue to lead the world in innovation, science, and economic might, and little to ensure that we take care of those in need.  This bill also fails Indian While giving billions of dollars of tax breaks to corporations, this bill does nothing to spur economic growth or attract investments in our Native communities--not even basic, low-cost provisions to ensure that Tribes receive the same tax benefits as other governments, like State governments. Once again, Tribes have been overlooked by the majority, despite early and vocal Tribal input on tax parity in Indian  I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and work with Republicans on tax reform that is fair, simplifies the Tax Code, and keeps American businesses competitive, but I cannot support tax cuts that lopsidedly benefit the ultrarich, hurt working families, neglect Indian Country, and balloon the Federal deficit.  I yield the floor.

105,topic-id,365,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this tax scam bill. Not only will it harm working families across the Nation, but it will visit another hurricane on Puerto Rico: an economic hurricane.  Today, Puerto Rico is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis. More than 235,000 of its people have already fled the island for the mainland.  After Maria, many of my colleagues--from Speaker Ryan to Leader McCarthy--went to Puerto Rico and promised they would assist the island and help them recover. Instead, what they are doing is finding a way to further drive Puerto Rico's economy into the ground.  Even though it is part of the United States--remember, since 1898, when military forces invaded Puerto Rico--this bill treats Puerto Rico as a foreign jurisdiction, levying new taxes on corporations operating there, creating incentives for them to leave the island and take jobs with them.  Let's be clear. Puerto Ricans are American citizens. They fight in our wars, many of them laying down their lives for our freedoms, yet this bill continues treating Puerto Rico differently than the rest of the United  For decades, decisions made right here in this body hollowed out, weakened, and undermined Puerto Rico's economy. This tax bill continues that awful tradition, undercutting Puerto Rico's economy once more.  All told, these tax provisions will cost Puerto Rico more than 200,000 jobs, at exactly the time when the island needs all the help it can get.  While this tax scam would hurt Puerto Rico, it also does nothing to help. While they had talked of it, there is nothing to expand the child tax credit for Puerto They eliminated the meager extensions of section 199 and rum cover-over provisions contained in the House version.  The Speaker of the House and the Republican leader went to Puerto They looked the people of Puerto Rico in the eye and made promises to help them.  That is how you help Puerto Rico?

I am proud to rise today in support of my colleague, Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer, and urge immediate passage of his bill, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017.  H.3312 uses a commonsense approach which would allow regulators the opportunity to weigh multiple factors before deeming a financial institution systemically important.  More importantly, the bill would allow the Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC, to more precisely identify systemic risk by differentiating between stable activities and those that would truly threaten the financial stability of the United  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve was given never-before-seen regulatory power to supervise those that were deemed systemically important. Unfortunately, the Fed has chosen to ignore tailoring their regulatory standards and continues to base them on asset size alone.  If an institution, indeed, is a minimal risk, then it is vital to make sure those standards reflect that lower risk.  Finally, it is important to note that an arbitrary threshold does matter to those caught in the SIFI web. These financial institutions often face significant compliance costs under a SIFI designation, redirecting resources that otherwise would provide consumers with affordable financial products.  Chairman Luetkemeyer's bill creates a framework that promotes responsible regulations and enforces market discipline, all while protecting taxpayers from unnecessary bailouts.  Mr.Speaker, again, I want to applaud my friend, the gentleman from Missouri, Chairman Luetkemeyer, for his leadership on this issue. H.3312 is about smarter regulation.

751,topic-id,1360,"Mr.President, I rise today concerned about the threats to the special counsel's critical investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.  Over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible and reckless voices have called for President Trump to shut down Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. At first, these calls came from the fringes of our political discourse--those who refuse to put our country and our security before base political instincts.  Earlier this year, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were right to push back on these misdirected calls and urge that the special counsel be allowed to do his job without interference. However, in recent weeks, those voices seem to be growing in stridency and in volume. Just this weekend, one major news organization suggested that Special Counsel Mueller could be involved in a coup against the One senior adviser at the White House has now outrageously alleged that ``the fix was in against Donald Trump from the beginning.'' Those statements are reckless. They are inappropriate, and they are extremely worrying. They are also at odds with the President's own lawyers who have pledged to cooperate with the special counsel.  Beyond being irresponsible, the seemingly coordinated nature of these claims should alarm us all--particularly since, in recent days, these baseless accusations have been repeated by several Members of the House of  I believe it is up to every Member of this institution, Republican or Democratic, to make a clear and unambiguous statement that any attempt by this President to remove Special Counsel Mueller from his position or to pardon key witnesses in any effort to shield them from accountability or shut down the investigation would be a gross abuse of power and a flagrant violation of executive branch responsibilities and authorities. These truly are red lines, and we simply cannot allow them to be crossed.  Let's take a moment to remember why Special Counsel Mueller was appointed in the first place and why it remains so critical that he be permitted to finish his job without obstruction.  Recall, last spring, when we were all reeling from a series of confounding actions by this President, beginning with the firing of FBI Director Jim Comey on May 9. Mr.Comey was fired just 2 months after publicly revealing the FBI's ongoing investigation of the Trump campaign and--as we would find out later--after several attempts by this President to improperly influence Director  Try to put yourself back into those dangerous days. Director Comey's dismissal was met with confusion and widespread condemnation. We needed a stabilizing action from our Nation's law enforcement leadership. We needed some certainty that the facts would be found and brought to light, regardless of what they were.[[Page S8172]]  Eight days after Mr.Comey's firing, Trump appointee and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to oversee the investigation into ``any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump'' and ``any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.''  His appointment reassured Americans that there will be a full and thorough law enforcement investigation. The announcement was met with support on both sides of the aisle and received nearly universal praise. In fact, many of the same people who are attacking him today praised Mr.Mueller's appointment just months ago.  Indeed, there is much to praise. The fact is, Robert Mueller has impeccable credentials as a man of the law. He has assembled a team that includes some of the Nation's best investigators, and he is leading the investigation with the professionalism it deserves.  Mr.Mueller is a dedicated Vietnam war veteran and a lifelong Republican, appointed to his current role by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, also a In fact, all of the major players to date in this investigation--former Director Comey, current FBI Director Rosenstein, and even Attorney General Sessions, who has had to recuse himself--are all The charges that some have made that somehow Democratic political bias has crept into this investigation are baseless, given the makeup of the leadership team.  In recent weeks, much has been made of some political opinions expressed by an FBI agent during the election last year. This specious line of argument conveniently ignores the fact that as soon as Mr.Mueller learned about those comments, he immediately removed that agent in question from the investigation. If anything, this incident only adds to Mr.Mueller's credibility as a fair and independent investigator.  I stand here as the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence We are in the midst of our own investigation into Russian incursion, and I am proud of the way Chairman Burr and our committee has taken on this very difficult task.  We have made tremendous progress uncovering the facts of Russian interference in our elections. Our committee's work helped expose the dark underbelly of disinformation on many of our social media platforms. We have successfully pressed for the full accounting of Russian cyber efforts to target our State electoral systems, and, despite the initial denials of any Russian contacts during the election, this committee's efforts have helped uncover numerous and troubling high-level engagements between the Trump campaign and Russian affiliates, many of which have only been revealed in recent months.  We have a lot of work to do. Our committee has gone out of its way to ensure continued bipartisan backing for this effort, and I am committed to seeing the effort through. However, it should be very clear that our committee cannot and will not stand as a substitute for Mr.Mueller's investigation.  As Chairman Burr and I have noted on numerous occasions, the FBI is responsible for determining any criminal activities related to this inquiry. As such, Mueller has already moved to indict two individuals and has negotiated two additional guilty pleas. This was an investigative path reserved solely for law enforcement, and it is essential that it be permitted to go on unimpeded.  The country no doubt remains severely divided on the question of the last election. However, the national security threat facing us today should demand that we rise above partisan differences. No matter the political divide, surely each of us--and all Americans--should want to know the truth of what happened during last year's election, and, no doubt, we want to know that as quickly as possible.  The President has long called the investigation into Russian meddling into the 2016 election a witch hunt, and he has done much to discredit the intelligence community's unanimous assessment of Russian interference in our election. The failure of this White House to lead a whole-of-government approach to prevent this type of election interference in the future--either by the Russians or some other adversary--defies understanding. The President's refusal to accept the intelligence community's assessment and his blatant disregard for ensuring that Russia never again infiltrates our election process has been unnerving and cause for significant concern.  In recent days, the President has said he is not considering removing Special Counsel Mueller, but the President's track record on this front is a source of concern. I am certain most of my colleagues believed he wouldn't fire Jim Comey either.  Firing Mr.Mueller, or any other of the top brass involved in this investigation, would not only call into question this administration's commitment to the truth but also to our most basic concept, the rule of law. It also has the potential to provoke a constitutional crisis.  In the United States of America, no one--no one--is above the law, not even the Congress must make clear to the President that firing the special counsel or interfering with his investigation by issuing pardons of essential witnesses is unacceptable and would have immediate and significant consequences.  I hope my concerns are unfounded--in many ways, I had hoped I would never have to make this kind of speech--but there are troubling signs.

272,topic-id,806,"Mr.President, just yesterday, the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive tax giveaway that will shovel truckloads of money into pockets of giant corporations and the superrich, while it leaves working families behind. And that is just the latest in a laundry list of presents that have been doled out to folks at the top. For everyone else, it has been one broken promise after another.  One of those promises was to protect 800,000 Dreamers who were brought to the United States as kids. Trump broke this promise when he ended DACA, the program that allows Dreamers to live, work, and study in the United States without fear of being deported to countries they barely know. Because Trump broke his promise, it is up to Congress to stand up and protect Dreamers by passing a clean Dream Act--a bill that gives legal status and a path of citizenship to those young people.  I want to introduce you to one of those Dreamers--Elias Elias was 6 years old when his parents brought him and his sister to the United He doesn't have many memories of his life in Venezuela, but he did hear stories from his parents and his grandfather about the everyday risks that they faced. One day, while his mother was driving, she pulled up to a stop light, and a man pulled a gun on her. Another day, his grandfather withdrew money from an ATM and then was robbed at gunpoint.  So when Elias's mother, who was an executive at a multimedia company, had an opportunity to transfer to an office in Miami, FL, she jumped at it. Elias's family came to the United States legally. They applied for and they received a visa that allows executives and managers from other countries to work in the United States and eventually apply for permanent resident status. Under that visa, the entire family would become permanent residents and would never have to worry about losing their status in the United ``Permanent'' is the key word here. Well, at least that had been their plan, only things didn't go the way they had been planned.  When Elias was 11, his mother died of cancer. He didn't know it at the time, but the day his mother died, Elias and his family lost their path to permanent resident status and became undocumented.  After his mother died, Elias clung to the belief that an education was his ticket to a better life. He challenged himself academically, taking 13 advanced placement courses and earning A's in almost every class. He also juggled a number of extracurricular activities, including speech and debate, student government, volunteering with children and the homeless, and starting his school's first traveling Model United His excellence earned him a place on the dean's list, as well as a long list of awards, including the Miami-Dade Homeless Trust Change Maker  Elias so impressed the school's staff that his high school activities director called Elias a hero and said: ``I've been teaching for 20 years and I have never seen a student like this young man.'' Scholarship committees also recognized Elias's accomplishments, and he won a coveted Myra Kraft Transitional Year Program scholarship, which provided him a full ride to Brandeis University in Waltham, He is now a sophomore at Brandeis, where he continues to make his mark.  Before DACA came along, Elias lived in constant fear that ICE would break down his door and deport him and his sister. DACA changed his life. The fear subsided. He knew that ICE agents wouldn't break down his door or seize him on his way to school. Elias told me that DACA has been a source of optimism and a light of protection.  America is the only country Elias knows. It is the only country many Dreamers know. This is their home. Dreamers like Elias have had the courage to step forward. They have come out of the shadows to tell their stories. Now Congress could show some courage and protect Dreamers by passing a clean Dream We have waited too long already. Every day that we delay, more than 100 Dreamers lose protected status. They must return to the shadows. They must think about ICE agents breaking down their doors or seizing them if they go to school or to work. The time for Congress to act is now, right now, today. We should not leave here so that we can celebrate the holidays with our families while nearly 800,000 Dreamers fear being ripped apart from their brothers, their sisters, their mothers, their fathers, and deported to countries they barely know.  If we held a vote today on the Dream Act, it would pass. So my question to Senator McConnell is this: What are you waiting for? Let us vote.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

545,topic-id,1110,"Mr.President, today is a terrible day. It is a terrible day for millions of working families in this country. They just want Congress to work for them. It is a terrible day for people who just want to get on with their lives and not have Congress cost them even more money.  It is a terrible day for millions of hard-working people, but it is a great day for giant multinational corporations and billionaires who fund Republican campaigns across this country. Today is their day. Every fundraiser, every fat check from a billionaire, and every champagne-and-caviar party has been about getting to this day--the day when the politicians whom they put in charge of Washington would pay them back with a $1.5 trillion giveaway.  Supporters of this bill call it tax reform. It is not tax reform. It is a heist--a heist that steals from millions[[Page S8124]]of middle-class families and hands that money over to the wealthy; a heist that will hurt Medicare and Social Security and reduce healthcare coverage by 13 million people in order to hand over money to giant corporations that are already rolling in profits; a heist that will hurt our economy and blow a hole in our national debt.  The American people have seen through this scam. They see through every lie that has been pushed forward. They know this bill doesn't provide middle-class tax relief. It ultimately raises taxes on more than 60 percent of working families in this country. They know this bill does not promote economic growth. Nonpartisan projections have shown that it will have a negligible impact. Even former Republican officials admit it. They know this bill will not raise wages for working people. Corporate CEOs have already said so. Those CEOs have told everyone who would listen that when they get their truckloads of money from the GOP tax bill, they will turn right around and funnel that money to their wealthy shareholders.  They know this bill isn't even to help A third of those shareholders who will get truckloads of money from the GOP bill don't even live in the United  Over the last month and a half, we have all watched as one Republican Senator after another has cast aside every single one of their supposed principles to get behind this monstrosity of a bill. Real relief for the middle class is gone. Concern about the national debt is gone. Concern about economic growth is gone.  There is only one principle left: Reward billionaire campaign donors. This is not a conspiracy theory. It is not a partisan attack. It is what Republicans in Congress are saying in public to reporters. As one of my Republican colleagues said in a moment of honesty, if they don't pass this tax giveaway bill, ``financial contributions will stop.'' And a Republican House Member said big donors told him to pass the tax bill or ``don't ever call'' them again.  Let's call this out for what it is. It is government for sale. That is how you end up with a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to corporations at a time of record corporate profits. It is not supposed to be this way. Congress is elected by the people. It is supposed to represent their interests, not those of the people and companies rich enough to fund campaigns.  Boy, there is a lot of work for us to do. Over the last 30 years, corporate profits have skyrocketed while wages for working people have stayed flat. But even though corporations--not families--have been getting richer and richer, Congress has forced families to pick up more and more of the cost of our military, our roads and bridges, and our schools.  Corporations used to pay about 30 percent of the cost of running the government. Now, it is under 10 percent. But today, the politicians who run Congress will slash corporate taxes even more and shift even more of the burden onto working families. Working people will pay more so that giant corporations can pay less.  There is no better example of this than the bill's treatment of Wells Last year, we found out that Wells Fargo had opened millions of fake accounts so that executives could goose their sales numbers, drive up stock prices, and rake in bigger bonuses. It turns out that Wells Fargo had also charged half a million customers for auto insurance they didn't need, which meant that a lot of people--including soldiers and sailors and marines--got their cars repossessed. That sounds pretty sleazy. But instead of holding them accountable for cheating their customers, this Congress is on the verge of passing a tax bill that will shower more free money on Wells Fargo than any bank in the country. That is right. When this bill passes, the punishment to Wells Fargo for cheating millions of Americans will be a big gift-wrapped present worth billions of dollars in tax giveaways.  This tax bill is shameful, and it is the result of a shameful process. There were no hearings on the bill that overhauls the Tax Code and shifts around trillions of dollars, no input from a single Democrat, and no time for vetting by actual tax experts.  Big-time donors are very happy with this outrageous tax heist, but the American people are angry, and they are right to be angry. Over and over, again and again, they watched this Congress ignore their pressing problems, ignore children's health insurance, ignore flat wages, ignore an opioid crisis, ignore hurricanes and wildfires, ignore working families who are ripped apart by greedy politicians and politics built right here in Over and over, again and again, they watch, instead, as Washington jumps to do more favors for billionaires, more favors for giant companies, and more favors for campaign donors.  Today is just one more terrible day for hard-working Americans, just one more terrible day in Washington where Washington works great for those at the top and will not lift a finger to help anyone else. People's anger is understandable. I share it. Sooner or later, a reckoning is coming, and I promise you this: When it does--when the politicians who lead this Congress and vote for this tax heist are held accountable for turning their backs on the American people who sent us here--then we will be the kind of country we want to be. Then we will be the kind of country we were meant to be--a democracy where everyone, even the richest and the most powerful, pay a fair share, and where we all work to build a better future for all of our kids.

1045,topic-id,303,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  We do need tax reform. We need tax reform that we all described in the beginning as something that would help the middle class, that would simplify taxes, and would be revenue neutral. This bill, sometimes described by its authors as doing those things, accomplishes none of those things.  Now, first of all, for the middle class, wages have been stagnant. The jobs people are getting aren't paying the bills. We know the biggest challenge we face is increasing investment, increasing wages, and increasing security.  There are some benefits in this bill for the middle class, but let's get real. Those benefits are tiny and they are temporary.  If you are a Vermont family, if you are lucky--we get hit with the SALT deduction loss--you might make a couple hundred bucks.  But at what price?  Once these benefits expire, 83 percent of the benefits of the individual tax rate goes to the top 1 percent.  At what price?  $2 trillion added to the deficit.  Let me tell you this: Vermont families, hard-earning families, working families, they would like a tax cut, but not one that their children and grandchildren are going to have to pay. That is unconscionable.  What about these corporate tax cuts?  We want simplification, so we are competitive. There is a 40 percent reduction for multinational corporations.  But, in this bill, is there any corresponding requirement that they start reinvesting in America?  Exactly the opposite.  There is a lower tax rate for companies that invest abroad, send jobs abroad, rather than invest at home. That is outrageous.  And what happens because of this deficit?  Medicare is going to be cut directly as a result of this tax bill. The infrastructure plan we all want is evaporating.  Defeat this rule and defeat this bill.

270,topic-id,844,"Mr.President, I am delighted to join my colleagues here in support of these kids who are known as Dreamers or DACA kids, who came in under the statute or under President Obama's program and who have lived here for many years in this country, passed all the requirements, and met all the standards. These are good kids. There is absolutely no reason for them to be the target of the kind of anxiety and fear that they are being put through to score political points. It really doesn't make sense.  By definition, these kids came to the United States of America under the age of 16. You can't even enforce a contract against a minor in this country. They do not have the legal capacity in most places to buy a sofa. Yet we are holding them to account for decisions that their parents made when they were small children.  One of the Rhode Islanders who will be affected by this came to the United States when she was 8 years old. Think of the kind of decisions that your 8-[[Page S8221]]year-old kids make or that you were making when you were 8 years old. This is a very successful young lady who is now at the Brown medical school. She is going to make enormous contributions to our country. Tossing her out or putting her in peril makes no sense whatsoever, particularly when the problems started when she was brought to this country by her parents when she was 8 years old.  Another Rhode Islander who contacted me came to the country when she was 7 years old. She is now a teacher in a middle school in Central Falls, Central Falls is a community that is emerging from bankruptcy. It has got its feet back under it now. It has a wonderful, exciting young mayor. Spirits are up, and things are going well. But it is not easy to be a middle-school teacher anywhere, and to be a middle-school teacher in a small city that has just come out of bankruptcy is not easy. This is a valuable person to Rhode Losing her adds no value to anyone.  Another person who contacted me came to the United States at 10 months old. At 10 months old, they barely even knew where they were. He came from Portugal at 10 months old. Now he has a college degree in computer science. He is ready to make his contribution to our country. He has done everything right and has played by the rules, and we are loading him up with all this anxiety and peril because of a decision his parents made when he was 10 months old.  You can't go out, as I said, and buy a sofa on the installment plan at 8 years old. Yet we are trying to penalize these kids. It makes no sense at all.  It doesn't even make economic sense. The studies I have seen show that disrupting the lives of these 800,000 Dreamer kids--90 percent of whom are in the workforce--would reduce the U.GDP by $460 billion over the next decade. They are making a serious contribution here.  In Rhode Island, the delta is about $200 million in annual State GDP between having the Dream Act pass and losing the DACA kids. We would stand to gain as much as $150 million in annual GDP if the Dream Act passes, and ending DACA will result in an annual loss of $60 million to our So just in my small State, there is $200 million in economic result annually from solving this problem in a way that is humane and consistent with the way we treat children in virtually every other element of the law.  Sadly, a lot of this is twisted up in the continued fight over immigration, which the Senate really tried to solve. I am on the Judiciary Senator Durbin was on the Judiciary Committee at the time. Under Chairman Leahy's leadership, we went through hundreds of amendments and we took dozens of votes. Some 90 amendments were incorporated into the bill. It came out of the Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 13 to 5.  It came on to the Senate floor, where there were amendments. There actually was some regular order. Hundreds of amendments were considered, and the final bill passed on June 27 by 68 to 32.  Then our bipartisan Senate bill went over to the House, where the Speaker of the House refused even to bring it up--no hearing, no vote, nothing. They just froze it out. So there is a long history of why we are here today, but the price should not be paid by these kids, not when the original problem was something that was done when they were children--10 months old.  President Lincoln talked about ``the better angels of our nature.'' Let's show these kids the better angels of our nature. Let's do something decent, something bipartisan, something that is right, and let's do it soon.  I yield the floor.

844,topic-id,1772,"Mr.President, I am here now for the 190th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech to talk about an issue that falls at the intersection of climate change and jobs and consumer power and protection. You would think that a policy that simultaneously reduces the carbon emissions responsible for climate change and boosts American industrial competitiveness and puts thousands of dollars back into the pockets of American consumers would be pretty universally popular. Unfortunately, you would be wrong.  The corporate average fuel economy standards, known as the CAFE standards, set a minimum threshold for the average fuel economy of cars and light trucks that are sold in the United In 2011, the major automakers here in America--Ford, GM, and the others--enthusiastically endorsed voluntary new fuel efficiency standards which would gradually increase the fuel economy for their cars and light trucks to 54.5 miles per gallon on average by 2025.  Think about that for a second. In 2011, average fuel economy for these vehicles was stuck below 30 miles per gallon. The CAFE standards hadn't budged in years, and as a result, our automakers had stopped innovating to make cars more fuel efficient. They didn't have to make them more fuel efficient. And when gas prices soared in the mid-2000s, it was consumers who were on the hook.  Today, thanks to the voluntary agreement that was reached by the automakers, the CAFE standard is presently over 40 miles per gallon for cars and over 30 miles per gallon for light trucks. Consumers have already saved $42 billion at the pump because of those increased fuel economy standards. Consumers who purchase a new car in 2025, on average, will save about $8,000 on gas over the lifetime of that car because of those new fuel economy standards.  Of course, it is not just the consumers who win under the new CAFE standards; the environment also wins. Already the American auto fleet's increased average fuel economy has resulted in 195 million fewer metric tons of carbon emissions, and, of course, with the carbon emissions come all the rest of the pollution out of a car's tailpipe, so it is a big environmental benefit. Over the life of the CAFE standards program, total carbon emissions reductions should total 6 billion metric tons. This is huge because transportation is now the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States, and carbon emissions from cars and[[Page S8169]]light trucks account for almost one-sixth of the Nation's total.  If we are to be successful in keeping the average global temperature increase under 2 degrees Celsius--the upper bound, beyond which scientists tell us the consequences of climate change will likely be irreversible--then we have to significantly reduce our auto emissions. That is the target of the Paris climate agreement, which is represented here in this graph, from business as usual here, to all of the carbon emissions savings and efficiencies necessary to reach our Paris goal right here. Of all of this--power sector, industrial sector, efficiencies, home sector--all of it--this gold wedge right here represents the piece of it that we achieve by meeting these CAFE standards. So it is pretty important to meet those standards if we are going to hit the Paris climate goals, and it is pretty important to hit the Paris climate goals if we don't want to condemn our children and grandchildren to a very hazardous future.  Here is what is strange. The exact same set of industry players who voluntarily signed onto and supported the stronger fuel efficiency standards just 4 years ago through their trade association are now working hand in hand with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt--when something bad is happening for the environment, you can almost always find him around--to weaken them, to undo what they voluntarily agreed to and promised the American people.  Following the election of Donald Trump, the Auto Alliance--the trade group that represents automakers like Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volvo--claimed that the very same standards the automakers had voluntarily supported just a few years before now reflect what they call an ``extraordinary and premature rush to judgment.'' Shortly after Pruitt came into office, the Auto Alliance asked him to revisit the standard.  By the way, just before I gave this speech, I googled ``Auto Alliance.'' I went to their website, and I hit the search engine on it. I typed in ``climate change'' and hit ``search.'' Those words ``climate change'' do not appear on the Auto Alliance's website, to give you an idea how seriously they take this problem, at least at the trade association level.  So the Auto Alliance, when Pruitt came in, asked him to revisit this CAFE standard that their member companies had all agreed to. Pruitt, who, as Oklahoma's attorney general, had been notoriously compliant to industry, gladly complied.  The Auto Alliance has a long history as the trailing edge of the automotive industry, opposing seat belts, opposing air bags, and opposing catalytic converters. Now, in the polluter-friendly Trump administration, it sees a tempting chance to sell more gas-guzzlers. But is that smart? Over the long term, does this risk actually consign American automakers to global irrelevance?  We sell these cars in an international market, so let's look at what that international market is moving to. Countries around the world have realized that the future of the automobile lies not with the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine but with alternative sources of power--electricity or hydrogen fuel cells, for instance.  By the way, I just got a Chevrolet Bolt, the all-electric car. Not only is that good for the environment, it is a wonderful car to drive. It is a fun car to drive. It is great vehicle.  China, the world's largest car market, recently announced that by 2025, 20 percent of new cars sold there must run on alternative fuels, and it is on its way to an eventual total ban of the sale of gasoline and diesel-powered cars. That is where the biggest car market in the world is headed.  The European Union is the world's third largest car market. The Netherlands has announced that starting in 2030, all cars sold must be emissions-free. Belgium is considering a similar measure. France and the United Kingdom will ban sales of new gasoline and diesel-powered cars starting in 2040. Norway, while not a member of the EU, is very much part of that European economy. They are even more ambitious. By 2025--just over 7 years from now--all new cars sold in Norway must be emissions-free.  Moving on to Japan, the world's fourth largest car market--Japan now has more electric charging stations than it has gas stations. India is the fifth largest car market. It has announced that by 2030, all new cars sold there must be electric or hybrid vehicles. So with the entire world moving toward cleaner, newer technology and innovative vehicles, why does this automotive lobby group--the Auto Alliance--suddenly want to renege on the promise its members made to the American people to raise and abide by those CAFE standards?  We should hope that our business leaders would be honorable enough to keep their word. That is a fairly basic proposition. But if the future of the industry lies with ever more fuel-efficient cars--hybrids, electric cars, fuel cell cars--why would the auto industry in America be furiously lobbying the Trump administration to go backward? Breaking your word to go backward doesn't seem to make sense, even from a business point of view.  Electric vehicles and alternative fuel vehicles represent the future of the auto industry. China and other countries get this. The Chinese are trying to poach our electrical engineers to develop their automotive industry so that it can one day beat ours. Meanwhile, executives at our automakers are scheming with Pruitt to head back to the past, to get out of the promise that they made to build more innovative, fuel-efficient cars.  Investing in the technologies of the future will help ensure that the electric vehicle revolution, which is on our doorstep, doesn't leave America behind, doesn't leave American innovators behind, doesn't leave American workers behind, and doesn't leave American automakers behind.  A midterm review of these CAFE standards found that the automakers already have the technology to meet the new standard and that the new standard will save money for their customers. It is to the benefit of their customers to keep going with the CAFE standards they agreed to.  An independent analysis by the nonprofit organization CERES found that the CAFE standards provide automakers and their suppliers the certainty they need to increase investment in the cleaner technologies that are necessary for the long-term health of the industry, and with that certainty that leads to increased investment, the increased investment leads to jobs.  This ought to be a no-brainer. A policy that protects consumers and the environment while promoting innovation and making American companies more competitive for the global market should be something we can all agree on. But there is also a simpler, more old-fashioned principle at stake here: Keep your word.  Ford, GM, and the others told the American public that they would compete for car buyers' business by delivering quality, energy-efficient vehicles. That is what they told the American public, and they said it voluntarily. This wasn't forced down their throats through a regulatory proceeding; this was a voluntary agreement that they signed up for and were enthusiastic about at the time.  They should keep their word. Why is that asking too much of American corporate leadership? Keep your word. How basic a principle is that? They should stop their trade association lobbying to water down the CAFE standards promises that they made.  It is a recurring problem around here, as many of us have noticed, that the trade association is usually on the trailing edge of the industry; it is like the worst voice of the industry. That is surely the case here, where the trade association for our American automakers is trying to get them to set it up so they will break their word to the American people about a promise that they made--a very simple one, which the technology is already there to achieve.  Even if you don't care one whit about climate change, even if you laugh that off, even if you go down the Trump road that it is a Chinese hoax, we still ought to be honoring those CAFE standards for American jobs, for American ingenuity, and for American innovation.

48,topic-id,318,"Mr.Speaker, most of what you just heard from the Reading Clerk you could have heard during the previous 4 hours of testimony that we have been taking in the Rules Committee this morning. I understand there was no other game in town going on this morning, so if folks were tuning in to C-SPAN, they were treated to my friend from Massachusetts, our ranking member from New York, our chairman from Texas, and all the gang there on the Rules Committee as we worked through this.

This is an additional appropriations measure.                              {time}  1230  It comes under a closed rule, Mr.Speaker, but it does self-execute two amendments that had been offered: an amendment by ",CREC-2017-12-21-pt1-PgH10349.txt,2008,"CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT",2017,21,December,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,topic-id,1258,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this time of year folks get rightfully exorcised about the issues of the day.  We all came here to do something for the men and women whom we represent back home. Every time we get to the end of a year, we think: I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done; I have got to get it done. I recognize those passions are going to exist.  I actually don't believe for a minute that my friend from Massachusetts believes my vote in favor of the tax bill had anything to do with fundraising or my donors. He might believe that about somebody in this Chamber--I hope that he does not--but I know he doesn't believe it about me. It just isn't true.  I have been fighting for tax reform since the day I was elected. In fact, I ran for this job to fight for tax reform. We do the American people a disservice when we suggest something nefarious is going on. Sometimes we just disagree, Mr.Speaker, and those disagreements are okay. In fact, those disagreements are expected. Our Founders intended them, and they created this institution to sort those disagreements out. So I hope we won't sell either ourselves or the American people short in that regard.  But I do want to agree with my friend that this is frustrating. It is frustrating to be here for a continuing resolution, Mr.Remember that we passed the National Security and Defense Appropriations bill in July of this year. We have waited patiently for the Senate to be able to take it up, and it has not.  We passed all of the appropriations bills, Mr.Speaker, before the end of the fiscal year, back in September, and we have been waiting for the Senate to take those up. It has not. It is an incredibly frustrating time.  Now, my friend suggested a solution would be bipartisanship. I could not agree with him more. It takes 60 votes to move something through the I just barely have over 50 The only way these funding bills are going to move through the Senate is with bipartisan support. For anyone in this Chamber to deny that is going to be to deny the reality of math. Bipartisanship is the solution.  I remember, Mr.Speaker, when my President invited the Democratic leadership down to the White House to work on exactly this issue a month ago. Folks got frustrated with the tweet he sent out that morning and decided they were going to stay home.  I understand the frustrations. What I don't understand is missing out on an opportunity to build this bridge. It happens above my pay grade, I am going to confess. To the 700,000 people I represent back home, Mr.Speaker, let me go ahead and confess this deal is taking place way above my pay grade.  But it is probably right there at the pay grade of the President of the United States, the Speaker of the House, and the minority leader. When folks don't show up to the table for the conversation, it makes it harder to get there.  Is there always a good reason to stay home?  I am sure there is.  Are there more good reasons to be there?  I think the answer is:  Mr.Speaker, I will advise my friend from Massachusetts that I don't have any speakers remaining this morning. Folks have been exhaustibly elucidated by the 4 hours of discussion we had this morning, and I am prepared to close when he is.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1245  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have a lot of concerns about the way this process is unfolding.  And, yes, the gentleman is right. I am exorcised. I am exorcised that we have gone through all of these gyrations, including being on hold trying to figure out what we were going to bring to the floor all night last night, and we end up with this: basically kicking the can down the road for a few weeks and not dealing with some essential emergency priorities that are a concern to most people in this country.  Again, going back to this tax bill, that is an example of where bipartisanship might have been helpful. I don't recall a tax reform package--I don't even want to call it reform because, basically, it is a giveaway to big corporations and to wealthy special interests--that has been rammed through Congress purely on a partisan basis.  But maybe it had something to do with the fact that Democrats weren't welcome to the table.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that Democrats were locked out.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that this so-called conference committee was a sham and, when Democrats showed up, a deal had already been struck.  That is not bipartisanship.  And maybe we are a little bit exorcised because, time and time again, when people go before the Rules Committee looking to offer legitimate, germane amendments to try to improve legislation, rather than being able to have the opportunity to offer those amendments on the floor and have a debate, we are shut out all the time.  Again, this Congress, this Republican Congress, this session, has the distinction of being the most closed session in the history of our country. That is the distinction.  So, yes, we are exorcised. And we are exorcised over the fact that, as we are about to adjourn for Christmas, hundreds of thousands of people, DREAMers in this country, their lives have been thrown into turmoil. These are people who have served in our military. They have led rescue efforts during these recent hurricanes. They contribute greatly to our community. A majority of people in this country want them to remain here, and we can't even get a vote on the House floor, notwithstanding the fact that we all know that, if we brought it to the floor, we would pass it.  Mr.Speaker, the Republican majority has prioritized their tax scam bill over reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, helping DREAMers, and even funding our government, which brings us to where we are now, days before Christmas, scrambling to fulfill our most basic responsibilities.  But we should be doing more here than just trying to keep the lights on. We also have a responsibility toward the hundreds of thousands of young Americans--they are Americans in every way except on paper--who have been betrayed by this administration. We need to pass the Dream Act, and we need to do it now. Thirty-four of my Republican colleagues have already spoken up and urged Speaker Ryan to help these young people. The majority of this House is ready to do the right thing.  Mr.Speaker, here is our chance to do just that. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.3440, the Dream The bipartisan, bicameral legislation has the support of the majority of this House and would pass if it were brought up for a vote.  Mr.Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?  There was no objection.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Doggett).

52,topic-id,335,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, here, in these cold days outside, it is easy to create a lot of rhetorical heat on the inside. I would argue that legislative light is what we need more often than not.  We brought the Children's Health Insurance Program bill to the floor that my friend from Texas just referenced, Mr.We didn't just bring it to the floor; we brought it through committee. We brought it through committee, and we passed it. We brought it to the House floor, and we passed it. We sent it to the Senate, and there it sits.  But when it passed the House floor, my friend from Texas voted ``no.'' He voted ``no.''  Now, do I believe for a moment that is because he hates children? I do not.  Do I believe for a moment that it is because he doesn't want folks to have access to healthcare? I do not. I believe he had legitimate policy reasons for deciding not to reauthorize the program then that he has just taken to the floor and talked about the merits of reauthorizing.  It is okay to disagree on those issues, and it is even okay to highlight those differences. What is not okay is to describe this Chamber as a Chamber that doesn't care. What is not okay is to describe this as a Chamber that doesn't act.  My friend was absolutely right: it is a bipartisan priority to fund the Children's Health Insurance Program, and we did. The Senate has not acted. It hasn't gotten the full reauthorization done. If we pass the continuing resolution today, that funding will continue.  Let's disagree on those things that we disagree about, but let's be honest with ourselves about the legitimacy of those disagreements. Let's try to find more light than heat in this new year.

56,topic-id,452,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My friend from Florida is a good accountability partner up on the Rules I have learned from his intellect, and I have learned from his experience in this I value that, and I value his friendship.  When he says that more closed rules have been passed in this Congress than any other, he is absolutely right. He is absolutely right. And that is worth talking about, as my friend does regularly in the committee.  Unfortunately, we usually just have that half of the conversation. What we don't talk about is that many of those closed rules were for bills that were so well worked out in a bipartisan way in committee that there were no amendments offered, that we had already come together in such a collaborative, productive, admirable way that we ought to be bragging about instead of denigrating that we didn't have amendments that were offered.  Other bills, Mr.Speaker, were bills that might not have been so generally agreed upon. But when my friend the chairman of the Rules Committee sends the call out to all 435 Members of Congress and says: If you have any ideas, bring them to the Rules For many of those bills, Mr.Speaker, there wasn't one idea suggested, not one idea suggested to change the underlying bill.                              {time}  1300  So did it come under a closed process?  Well, of course, it did, if closed means we ask everybody for all of their ideas and no one had one, so there was no idea to debate on the floor.  Mr.Speaker, there are so many ways that we can do better with one another, but I would suggest to my friends that the way to do better with one another is to build that on a foundation of trust, not a foundation of recriminations.  We have an opportunity in this new year, Mr.Speaker, to turn a page in this institution. I want to say, in my time on the Rules Committee, Mr.Speaker, I have never had a chairman who worked as hard to open the process and hear from Members as the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Sessions), the current chairman.  Time and time again, where other folks would have walked away from the table, the chairman has stayed there to get input, to hear ideas. Time and time again, when the process would have been truncated, he has extended it to make sure folks had a chance to have their voice heard.  I am grateful for that, Mr.I am grateful to the chairman for that model that he sets in that committee.

61,topic-id,549,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, you likely did, as I did yesterday, get a wonderful Christmas card from our friend from California, which I very much appreciated. She was there with her beautiful family. I appreciate the sincerity of her words today.  I will just remind this Chamber that we are having that conversation for[[Page H10356]]one reason and one reason only. That is because, when Democrats had the White House, the U.House, and the U.Senate, but--much like Republicans today--didn't have 60 votes to get around the filibuster, instead of President Obama and the Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate trying to find a bipartisan pathway forward that could get 60 votes, they chose to craft an administrative solution, one that I thought was illegal, one that I thought was unconstitutional, but chose to go it alone.  Mr.Speaker, that is not a blame statement. It is an explanation of some systemic challenges that exist in this place.  I can assure my colleagues, and I am happy to have someone disabuse me of the notion, but I have yet to see the issue that we have solved by blaming each other more for it. I have yet to see that pathway to success.  The pathway I have seen is when folks turn the cameras off, when they roll up their sleeves, when they decide they don't much care who gets the credit for a solution, they just want to solve it.  I will put another one on my colleagues' plate, because, again, I don't doubt their sincerity. Raju is one of my constituents. He is here on an H1-B visa. His wife, Manju, is here on an H-4 visa. He came to this country legally 11 years ago. Every few years, he has to renew his visa, which costs thousands of dollars. When his visa expires, when his driver's license expires, he has to go back and do it. He is not complaining. That is what the law of the land said. When he agreed to come here, he agreed to follow the law of the land. He can't start his own business. He can't change employers. He is a captive of the visa program that he came in on. There is no pathway, Mr.Speaker, for Raju and Manju to get the same benefits that my colleagues are arguing so passionately for for 800,000 additional people.  Mr.Speaker, the human stories don't begin and end with the DACA program. Again, a problem that President Obama created; not solved, but created.  I can go line by line by line of folks who are facing similar challenges, and I question where the justice is when I can name constituent after constituent after constituent who has done everything right, who has paid every dime the government has asked, who has applied for every piece of paperwork that the government has asked, who has stood in every line that the government has asked, and there is no pathway forward for them.  Let's not pretend that there is not common ground that we can come together on. Let's confess that perhaps we haven't spent enough time trying to do it.

But I want to say, in all candor, that, in spite of that, we are disrespected each and every day when our ideas are shut out and, in turn, our constituents are disrespected. I represent the same number of people as the Speaker of the House, as any Republican and any other Democrat in this Chamber, and yet, routinely, we are told that our ideas are not welcome.  I believe, Mr.Speaker, that every Member of this House, Democrats and Republicans alike, are entitled to basic respect. We have just gone through the most closed session in the history of our country, more than 58 closed rules in this session. Over 1,500 amendments, both Democratic and Republican amendments, were blocked. That is not what we were promised by the leadership of this  We are disappointed with what we are dealing with today. We are disappointed with the inaction and lack of support for the CHIP program and the community health centers funding. We think that is inadequate. We are disappointed that more funding isn't provided to deal with the opioid crisis.  I could go on and on and on, but today, we are asking the Speaker to allow a vote to help the DREAMers, men and women who came here as children, who have served in our military, who have been first responders saving lives in these disaster relief efforts, 91 percent who work and pay taxes. They are important. They are valuable. We should celebrate them.  I would say to my colleagues this is a matter of decency. The right and decent thing to do is to help them, not rationalize inaction.  Please, please, for the sake of all that is good about our country, join us in[[Page H10357]]defeating the previous question so we can have an up-or-down vote on the Dream Act, so we can actually help these 800,000 people, these young individuals who are giving so much to our country. It is the right thing to do.  This is the Christmas season. I hope you are all moved to joining us and to helping these people because, as we have learned, each and every day that we wait, more and more of them lose their status. They lose their jobs. Their lives are thrown into deeper turmoil.  It is wrong for us to go home and not deal with this. The decent thing to do is to vote on the Dream  Vote ``no'' on the previous question.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

66,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  There has been a lot of productivity this week. There has been a lot of work that has gone on this week. I am looking around up there at the dais with you, Mr.I see a lot of unshaven faces. I'm not just taking about I am talking about folks who intended to shave and might not have made it home last night to get that done.  It takes an incredible amount of staff time to do this. So what Mr.McGovern and I do up in the Rules Committee, our staffs have been there past midnight time and time again this week and then back in at dawn.  I wish that more of the American people, Mr.Speaker, could see the hardworking, dedicated staff, the team that goes into making all of this possible, because I think it would make them proud. I think, in a season like this, it would lift them up and make them feel better about who we are as a people and the things that we could accomplish together.  One of those young people, Mr.Speaker, is Nate Blake on the Rules He is sitting right here behind me. He is leaving us after 5 years of service. I want to put that into perspective, Mr. There is not a staff member up here that can't leave today and get better hours and more money going anywhere else in town. You will work on Capitol Hill for one reason and one reason only, and that is that you believe, if only you work hard enough and long enough, you would make America just a little bit better.  Mr.Blake is one of those believers. We will miss him on the committee. It is a great honor for me that his very last rule is to be one of mine, and I thank him for his service.  Mr.Speaker, they often say everything's been said but not everyone has said it. We don't need to go down that path today. This House has done its job. It has done its job in a collaborative way. It has done its job in a way that the American people can be proud of.  If we pass this rule, we will not only fund the government, send money to the troops, send money to community health centers, send money to education, send money to courts, send money to the environment; we will not only take care of those funding responsibilities; we will also provide those dollars needed for those men and women spread out from Florida to Texas to California to Puerto Rico to the Virgin There is a real human being behind each and every one of these dollars that will go out the door today.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, vote ``yes'' on this rule so we can get to that underlying legislation.

323,topic-id,519,"Mr.Speaker, I very much appreciate the chairman for yielding me the time.  I have the great pleasure serving on the Rules I also have the great pleasure of serving on the Budget So I felt it incumbent to come down and talk a little bit about[[Page H10255]]the Byrd rule process that goes on in the It is part of the 1974 Budget It became a custom in the Senate during 1985 and 1986, and ultimately it was codified and put in the act permanently.  To describe what went on in the Senate as some sort of proofreading error is just nonsense, just absolute nonsense. We have this process called reconciliation that allows the Congress, the House, and the Senate to get really tough things done. As a part of that process, the Byrd rule says: What we don't want to do is get involved in extraneous issues. We want to stay focused on these issues that are most important to the American people. So if you try to get outside the lanes of fundamental tax reform, those provisions become what they call ``Byrdable.''  But, Mr.Speaker, you are probably as uplifted as I am by the conversation you hear about the importance of bipartisanship and collaboration. I wish that that were more true. What we saw yesterday in the United States Senate I would tell you is a little bit of the pettiness that we see on Capitol  Is it true that the Senate had the right to prevent parents who homeschool their children from being able to finance that homeschool education through taxes and 529 savings accounts?  The Senate had that right under the Byrd rule and they exercised it. Democrats went after homeschooling parents and said: No tax breaks for you.  They had the right to do it, but to describe that as some sort of proofreading error over here is a mistake. It was intentional to give homeschooling parents that opportunity and it was intentional when the Senate Democrats stripped it out.  Secondarily, it was intentional to put a title on the bill: Jobs and Tax It was intentional. That is why we came together to focus on this bill, because we care about jobs and we care about a 21st century tax system.  Was the Senate completely within their rights to strip the title of the bill?  Mr.Speaker, they were. If you believe when the Senate can't fund the government, when the Senate can't reauthorize CHIP, when the Senate can't reauthorize a 702--you go right down the list--and if you believe it is an important use of the Democratic minority's time on the Senate side to strike the title of the bill because it doesn't actually impact deficit reduction, it is within their right.  Does it represent the highest and best use of their time?  It does not.  Does it represent the highest and best of those of us who are here in public service together?  It does not.  I recognize that we have fundamental disagreements about the impact of tax reform and its merits.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.

325,topic-id,410,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, we have an opportunity to do great things together, and occasionally I come down to this floor and I put my heart into it. I don't just put my heart into it on the floor, I put my heart into it for hours and hours, day after day, in the Rules I put my heart into it on the Transportation I put my heart into it on the Budget  Mr.Speaker, do you know what?  Sometimes I lose. Sometimes I lose. But what makes this process great is we both come down here and do the very best that we can.  Let's not describe what is going on here for the American people as some sort of proofreading error, as some sort of rush job where folks didn't have time to do it right. That does a disservice not just to the Members of Congress, but to the staff that work through these issues with us side by side, day after day, week after week, month after month, and, yes, in the case of this bill, year after year.  We have a choice with how we spend our days. I am proud that we spend our days doing fundamental tax reform. It has been far too long. We don't call it once in a generation because it is a rhetorical tool. We call it once in a generation because there are men and women in this Chamber who were not alive the last time that we did it. It is important, and I am glad we are doing it.  The Senate has every right to do what the Senate did yesterday. And by ``the Senate,'' I mean the minority Members who insisted on their point of order. We could have sent this bill to the President's desk with protections for homeschooling parents who are doing their very best to provide for their kids, but my Democratic colleagues said no. So this bill is still going to go to the President's desk. It is just not going to have those protections. I believe that is a mistake. I hope we will come back together. I hope we will right that wrong in the coming days.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman so much for his leadership on this issue. Mr.Speaker, I thank the Chair for his leadership on this issue.

1050,topic-id,530,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the time. We were in the Rules Committee last night, Mr.Speaker, and we were having this same kind of conversation. We were going through the list one by one by one of all the families and how folks were going to benefit, about the children and graduate students, folks facing medical challenges. We went through one by one by one and talked about all the folks who were going to benefit from this great tax cut, and it was powerful.  But I was reminded, Mr.Speaker, that when we started this conversation, it wasn't even a tax cut conversation. It was an economic growth conversation, Mr.It was an economic growth conversation. Where we have ended up is there are going to be tax benefits for every single working family in the country, but where we started was how do we get those wages for working families up? How do we get job creation up? How do we get America growing, not at these stagnant rates of Obama years, but back at powerful rates as we saw in the Bush years,[[Page H10196]]as we saw in the Clinton years, as we saw in the Reagan years? That was the conversation.  Mr.Speaker, if we had historically normal economic growth--not fantastic economic growth--historically normal economic growth, we would have a balanced budget in this country today. There is an economic consequence of economic failure. What we have done in this bill, Mr.Speaker, by allowing businesses to expense their investment, allows them to make their employees more productive on day one. That is going to have a powerful impact, not just on employee wages, Mr.Speaker, but on economic growth across the entire country.  This bill is not about should we pay taxes. We must. This bill is about how we pay taxes. Can we do it better? Does America need to be the worst in the world? Or can we be first in the world?  We are answering that question today. We are answering that question today. And with every single vote a Member in this Chamber casts, it is not about is everything in this bill exactly the way you would have crafted it. I assure you, Mr.Speaker, for me, it is not. The question is: Does this bill move us in a direction of competitiveness across the globe? It does. The question is: Does this bill focus on wages and growing those wages? It does. The question is: In this opportunity that we have, did we take it or did we waste it?  We haven't answered that question yet, Mr.Speaker, but I believe that later on today we will. We are going to answer in the affirmative. Give us a chance. Should it have taken us 31 years to get to this place? It should not. Can we make a difference together today for the country? Yes, we can. It will be a lasting difference.

495,topic-id,2585,"Thank you, Mr. Mr.President and colleagues, today the Republican Party officially turns its back on America's middle class. Our constituents believe Congress must require multinational corporations to pay their fair share, ensure that the middle class has the chance to truly get ahead, and protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Instead, Republicans are doling out new giveaways to the multinational corporations, raising taxes on the middle class after a brief sugar high, and taking away the Medicare and Social Security guarantees for the future.  It takes hard work to muscle a tax plan this unpopular and destructive[[Page S8090]]through the Writing it is the easy part, especially when you are just checking off the far-right tax policy wish list. Normally, the hard part is sticking to your baseless talking points, ignoring the public outcry, and turning a blind eye to the loads of evidence that your plan is designed to fail.  This process has certainly been as far from normal as it can get. The bill comes at an enormous cost and represents a huge missed opportunity. For some perspective, the $1.5 trillion Republicans plan to borrow for their tax bill would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program for 915 years--915 years of a lifeline for families who are walking on an economic tightrope with That is what you could get for the $1.5 trillion Republicans are borrowing to pay for their tax bill. Spent on infrastructure, it would build towering, new monuments in the tradition of the Hoover Dam, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Interstate Highway Aimed permanently at helping the middle class, it would give long-struggling Americans a meaningful chance to get ahead.  But this isn't real tax reform or a serious solution to the major policy challenges of our time; this is a stimulus plan for shareholder goodies and executive compensation. Today, Republicans are ignoring decades of evidence that trickle-down economics is a fantasy. Republicans have cut taxes bit by bit for multinational corporations and high-flyers, but we have seen wages stay flat. The benefits of those previous tax cuts never trickle down.  In this debate, Republicans seized on a talking point about workers getting a $4,000 average raise if the bill becomes law, but that figure is based on a made-up, revenue-neutral plan that was never on paper. It is fake math, plain and simple.  I want to issue a warning to the public today. Passing this bill guarantees years and years of instability in our Tax Code and painful, drawn-out battles over tax policy here in the Because of the pure partisanship and the recklessness of the process that went into drafting this legislation, the bill is already full of mistakes that are going to have drastic, unintended consequences.  Down on K Street, they are already working overtime to exploit new special interest loopholes. The giant passthrough tax loophole, which has been widely covered in the business pages, is just the beginning. There are going to be big new incentives for multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas, and with that, more factory towns and mill towns are going to go dark. Fewer Americans will have the kinds of reliable manufacturing jobs that support a family. There are going to be extraordinary new pressures on State and local finances, and that is going to hamper their ability to build new roads and bridges and schools. There are going to be new and annual fights over the stop-and-go tax policies. Around here, they are called tax extenders. And what they do is ensure a lack of the predictability and certainty we need for innovation and growth.  All the evidence says that many of the policies in this bill are going to be a nightmare to administer. This means that with this bill, tax cheats get a holiday gift and have the opportunity to create new rip-offs. What this means for the typical family who just wants to file and get a refund on time is that there are going to be more hassles because the government is going to have to devote more time to trying to catch the cheats.  The defining economic challenge of our time is guaranteeing that the middle class and those who strive to be middle class have a chance to get ahead. Our country is home to the world's most powerful economic engine, and it generates levels of prosperity that have never been seen before, but working families and the middle class have been on the outside of the winner's circle for generations. The Republican plan isn't an answer to that challenge. In fact, it almost certainly makes the problem worse.  At a time when the middle class needs fundamental, permanent reforms to give them a chance to get ahead, the best--the best the Republican plan offers is a sugar high. The fact is, it will not be long before the sugar high wears off and tens of millions of hard-working Americans will find themselves paying higher taxes--higher taxes--as a result of this bill. Corporations, on the other hand, reap the benefits of permanent tax breaks and a loophole-ridden system that, in my view, just begs to be gamed.  The trail of broken promises that Republicans have left behind in this process is long and unforgettable. The President said his tax bill would not benefit his family or people like him. That is untrue. The Treasury Secretary said there would be no tax cut for the upper class. He was happy to have that called the Mnuchin rule. That is untrue. Republicans in Congress said the principal feature, the main feature of their plan, would center on a middle-class tax cut. That is untrue. Republicans said their bill would make the system dramatically simpler. That is untrue. Republicans said their bill would allow families to file their taxes on a postcard. That is untrue. Republicans said their plan would pay for itself. That, too, is untrue.  Even many of the promises Republican leaders made to their own colleagues have been broken, but there is one that they are not trying to hide. The deficit hawks have flown back to town, and they are already stirring up a battle over entitlement reform, and they are going to look at a variety of health programs and programs that are a lifeline to millions of  Our people are not thrown off by the Washington lingo. They know that when Republicans say they are coming after entitlement reform, they have the knives out for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, anti-hunger programs, education funding, and more.  Our distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Chairman Enzi, was talking about how dynamic scoring would take care of things and that it was just off base to be concerned about these deficits because dynamic scoring would make everything turn out fine. The reality is that all of the independent analyses have shown that this bill comes up way short in terms of projected revenue. The Tax Foundation, for example--which is not exactly a leftwing operation--says the Republicans were hundreds of billions of dollars short. What the Joint Committee on Taxation said is that the Republican plan was $1 trillion short.  Let's put it in context. Remember that Steve Mnuchin said that this plan would not only pay for itself but that it would leave $1 trillion left over. Yet both the Tax Foundation and the Joint Committee on Taxation said that this bill comes light years away from paying for itself.  I say to my colleagues, it didn't have to be this way.  I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee on the floor.  As I have indicated, Democrats believe that the Tax Code is a rotting mess and has to be fixed. For years, there has been bipartisan interest in getting tax reform done right. Seventeen Democratic Senators came together, even in a last-ditch effort to try to bring some bipartisanship into the process, and laid out ideas for some common ground. I commend that group, led by our colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, and our colleague from Virginia, Senator I have written two comprehensive, bipartisan tax reform bills, first with Senator Judd Gregg and then with a member of the President's Cabinet, Dan The majority leader always likes to talk about how nobody on this side is interested in bipartisanship. When Democrats laid out their principles, the first thing we said was how important it ought to be that we focus on bipartisanship. That letter was shared with the Republican leadership. Then you have the group of moderates. Then you have the actual bills that were written. So this idea advanced by the Republican leadership that there was no interest in bipartisanship does not resemble reality.  By the way, a lot of Senators here know that we have a pretty current example--the 2015 tax bill. It is kind of a model of what you can do. Both sides had good ideas. Bipartisanship is not about taking each other's dumb ideas; anybody can do that. But in the 2015 bill, my colleagues on this side said that the earned-income tax credit ought to be expanded, and we wanted the child tax credit and the American opportunity tax credit.  The Republicans, led by my distinguished colleague, Senator Hatch, had[[Page S8091]]some pretty good ideas too. They wanted to make the research and development credit permanent and the expensing provisions, which are so important for farmers and rural communities, and they had some ideas on business incentives. So we said: We are going to find some common ground here. We are going to take good ideas from both sides.  The tragedy of this bill is that Republicans wouldn't build on the good work of the 2015 tax legislation, where good ideas were accepted from both sides. This time around, there was zero outreach from Republicans on this issue. There was not one moment when Republicans actually shared even a piece of paper or a document about ideas that might bring both sides together. In fact, we can go all the way back to November 2016. They were still putting the voting machines back into storage when the first whispers began about tax reform happening through a completely partisan process.  Now, in coffee shops across America, most folks are not talking about budget reconciliation. Budget reconciliation is Washington lingo for saying: We aren't going to do this right; we are just going to make it our way, partisan, with no effort to try to bring people together. And after those whispers in November of 2016, within days, Chairman Enzi, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and my good friend, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and everybody is on board.  Then, the majority leader, in December of 2016, made it official: We weren't going to build on the history of successful tax reform, which required bringing both sides together; the majority leader said that we are going with reconciliation and partisanship. Reconciliation is a full-on rejection of the history of successful tax reform, and it is a full-on rejection of bipartisanship. It is the majority saying to the minority, as was the case: We just don't want your ideas because we don't need your votes. When you look at the way this debate played out, it is obvious that has been exactly the approach my Republican colleagues have taken.  The administration's first tax outline, which was shorter than your typical drugstore receipt, didn't contain an ounce of Democratic input. Then, what we had with the Republicans were the closed-door meetings of what they called the Big 6, a Republican-only group who turned their outline into a framework for a bill. The framework they released, which was roughly the same size as your typical drugstore receipt, still reflected no Democratic ideas.  Everybody knew that if we did it this kind of way, the public was going to catch on. They were going to see this as a con job and they were going to catch on that this is going to give the middle class the shaft, so they decided that they just have to move at the speed of light. That is what the House did.  Here in the Senate, the Republicans dropped their plan late at night, just before the Veterans Day weekend, and the Finance Committee was supposed to start the process of voting on it a few days later.  There was a whole new bill introduced in the middle of our markup that turned the tax bill into a healthcare bill--a healthcare bill--with a fresh attack on the Affordable Care There was another set of last-second changes introduced literally minutes before the final committee votes happened. The bill makes $10 trillion in tax policy changes, and there was never a single hearing on the specifics of the legislation.  Let me just repeat that. I want the public to know that. There was never a single hearing--not one--on the specifics of this legislation.  We are going to hear on all points a push by my colleagues on the other side to say that there were 70 hearings. Well, sure, there were people who would come in from time to time and talk about issues. There wasn't one hearing--not one--on the specifics of the legislation.  On the Senate floor, the Republicans played hide the ball for days until they dropped the final version of their bill late at night on a Two full days of debate had already passed, and the final bill was a mystery.  I stood here hour after hour asking where the bill was--an economy-transforming bill, a tax hike on tens of millions of middle-class Yet Republicans kept it hidden until the very last second. When it was revealed to the public, we saw my colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, holding it up with illegible notes scrawled in margins. It wasn't anywhere near enough time for any Member of this body to read the bill and grasp each of its provisions.  Even the conference committee was an exercise in reckless partisanship. News reports said that Republicans had agreed to a final bill, but they were empty-handed at the only official conference meeting. So what was going on at this so-called conference meeting? This was, I guess, a reality show version of a conference committee. The conferees were supposed to ask questions about out-of-date plans from the other body, in the Senate, when the actual, final bill was still locked behind closed doors.  The chairman didn't allow any motions or any amendments. Just like every other step in the process, this was a sham debate, and now the bill is a few hours away from passage.  I close with this: This bill has the power to reshape the American economy in far-reaching and unforeseen ways. It has the power to send families into economic hardship. It has the power to threaten this country's ability to uphold the special promises of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social And this bill was written in the shadows, written in the dark, with billions and billions of dollars' worth of changes tumbling out at the last second, the result of special interest influence and hushed conversations in back rooms.  There were no public hearings on the specifics of this legislation, and people wonder why the American people oppose it. Republicans have chosen to ignore them. They have chosen to ignore them. What is happening is un-It is wrong. I am here to say that this vote will not be forgotten.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Strange).

506,topic-id,238,"Mr.President, I thank Senator  I want to pick up for a moment on his eloquent points and then pose a question to him about what we will be doing here in a few minutes.  Senator Sanders has eloquently spoken to the needs of the American people, our veterans, the Dreamers, the disasters. Those are bipartisan efforts. Mr.Crapo and I want to fix the broken system of fighting fires.  Senator Sanders mentioned children's health insurance. This bill borrows $1.5 trillion and is going to end up borrowing a lot of it from foreign interests. That would fund the Children's Health Insurance Program for 915 years. So what the Senator from Vermont is doing is saying: Look at all the constructive areas where we can really meet the needs of the people, and, instead, we are working on a tax bill that is going to betray the middle class. It is going to betray the middle class, and in my view, as the distinguished Senator from Vermont and I have discussed, this bill--this tax bill--is a textbook case of writing legislation in an undemocratic way, in a secret way, with provisions that were airdropped for lobbyists into this legislation in the middle of the night.  Senator Sanders and I were part of the so-called conference committee last week where we didn't even have the relevant bill in front of us.

Late Friday night, we were able to remove a particularly offensive provision that would have turned some churches in America into partisan, political organizations. Specifically, there was an effort here to overturn what is called the Johnson amendment, named after Lyndon Johnson, that barred churches from endorsing partisan political activity with political candidates.

From what my friend from Pennsylvania has just said, using this new data that we just got from the Joint Committee on Taxation, what we have picked up--and my friend from Pennsylvania has clearly done his homework--is that something like 60 million taxpayers with an annual income of $200,000 or less will get practically nothing--maybe $100 a year in tax relief or a tax increase.

566,topic-id,559,"Mr.President, the issue with the Cruz amendment is straightforward. The Byrd rule states that the primary purpose of a budget bill is to address spending and taxes. If, on the other hand, you are debating a major policy change and the budget impact is merely incidental, the provision just doesn't comply with the Byrd rule. That is the case here.  The Cruz amendment has a modest budget impact, but the impact is vastly outweighed by the profound impact, as a matter of social and education policy, of providing Federal support for homeschooling for the first time. In fact, last week, the Senator from Texas called his section 529 homeschooling provision ``the most far-reaching Federal school choice legislation bill ever passed.'' I agree with the Senator's assessment of his amendment. The issue of Federal support for homeschooling is, in fact, major policy. There is no question that there are parents who want to homeschool their kids. I am certain that many of them are very conscientious. Yet this is the first time the Federal Government would provide Federal support for homeschooling. That is why the Parliamentarian ruled against Senator  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Enzi motion to waive the Byrd rule point of order, which we will vote on shortly.  I also want to close for the Finance Democrats on this tax issue with some brief remarks. My colleague from Texas once again has been saying, as many Republicans have done tonight: Middle-class folks, wait until Your paychecks are going to be bulging.  Here are the facts. We just got them from the Joint Committee on Taxation--a specific table that shows that 60 million taxpayers with an annual income of $200,000 or less will get $100 a year in tax relief or a tax increase. That looks to me like a third of all taxpayers are not exactly going to have bulging paychecks the way we have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  The fact is that some of the rhetoric we have heard from Republican colleagues tonight didn't sound half bad, so it is a real shame that the rhetoric doesn't resemble the plan on paper.  As I indicated, this bill is not centered on a middle-class tax cut. The[[Page S8140]]fleeting sugar high the bill provides offers some middle-class families a modest amount of help, but it is basically a distraction from the giveaways to the multinational corporations and powerful donors.  One of our Republican colleagues tonight repeated that if passed, the deficit is going to drop when the bill is enacted. I just have to say that fantasy is over. Even independent conservatives are saying that there is no third alternate reality in which Republican tax bills perform magic.  I want to close tonight by saying to the public that I would really like to wrap this up with a warning: The American people should know that the far-right architects of this tax plan are going to be coming for your Social Security and Medicare before you take your Christmas tree down. That is the end game. That is what Americans need to know is coming next. And on this side of the aisle, we want the American people to know that we are going to be on their side.

863,topic-id,1081,"Mr.President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss the Senate's investigation into Russia in the 2016 election. Specifically, I have been reviewing for months documents in the possession of the Senate's Intelligence I regret to say, the depth of the committee's investigation is completely unsatisfactory into the crucial issues of what I call following the money.  Early in 2017, I began asking the committee leadership to look into any and all financial relationships between Russia and Donald Trump and his associates. In an open hearing the committee held in March, I noted a number of public facts. First, there is an extraordinary history of money laundering in Billions of dollars from corruption and other illegal activities have been moved out of the country. Second, the President's son said in 2008: ``Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.'' Third, entities associated with the President had already been the subject of millions of dollars of fines for willful, repeated, and longstanding violations of anti-money laundering laws. Fourth, the Congress and the American people still haven't seen the President's tax returns.  Since then, there have been numerous additional press stories about associates of the President and their financial connections to In my view, these stories require thorough, detailed investigation. It is not just by the press. The special counsel's indictment against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort included extensive detailed allegations of laundering of millions of dollars from pro-Russia-Ukrainian interests. This indictment provided a clear example of how a foreign-influenced campaign can be financed through illicit means and why the importance of following the money is so crucial.  There have been others, acknowledged financial connections, such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his payment from RT, the television station that is part of Russia's state-run propaganda apparatus.  Then there are the strange denials, such as when Jared Kushner wrote in his statement in July, ``I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector.''  I can state, that is some kind of good lawyering because the word ``rely'' is subjective. Mr.Kushner did not deny financial ties to He said he hadn't relied on those funds, not whether he had any, not whether he ever had any, but he hadn't relied on them. That is about as lawyerly and subjective a statement as you can imagine.  My bottom line is, these financial ties need to be a central focus of the Intelligence Committee's inquiry. The reason I say this, I want to spell out what the connection here is. Our inquiry covered counterintelligence concerns related to Russia and the election, including any intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns. Following the money is counterintelligence 101.  If you want to compromise somebody, money is one of the best ways to do it. Well, let me repeat that. That is the connection. That is the connection between the counterintelligence work that is so important and part of the committee's charge. That counterintelligence work involves following the money because that is key to really getting into the question of whether somebody's been compromised because one of the best ways to do it is through funds.[[Page S8232]]  Tonight, based on this review of documents, I call again on the committee to follow the money aspects of this inquiry, including by holding public hearings specifically on this topic.  In addition, it is not just the Intelligence Committee that ought to focus on these issues. As I have been saying since March, the Senate Finance Committee, of which I am the ranking Democrat, has a crucial role to play on follow-the-money issues as well. Relevant documents produced by elements of the Treasury Department which are outside the intelligence community, such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, ought to be reviewed. There is a need to review these documents by the Finance Committee staff because we have specific experience and expertise in financial investigation.  In addition, the Finance Committee specifically has oversight responsibilities for tax matters. The Manafort indictment, which included tax evasion, demonstrated clearly that taxes, tax evasion, offshore accounts, and suspicious real estate transactions are all connected. They are all connected, and they ought to be part of any serious investigation into ties between Russia, the President, and his associates. Unfortunately, I and our committee have gotten no cooperation from the Treasury Despite my repeated requests as the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, the Treasury Department has just stonewalled--plain old stonewalling--the lead committee with jurisdiction for the agency.  For that reason, I want to announce tonight that I will hold indefinitely the nomination of the individual to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis until the Department cooperates with the Finance Committee and provides the committee with documents it needs to do its job.  Again, I regret that I have to take this step. By the way, many of these documents are unclassified in nature, so the Treasury Department is denying the Finance Committee access to unclassified documents. That is just completely unacceptable.  We all understand that we are in the midst of extraordinary and dangerous times. As our own intelligence community assessed in January, Russia interfered in our election with a clear preference for Donald No one, other than Donald Trump, has apparently called this assessment into question. For the sake of our national security and the future of our country, it is important to get to the bottom of every aspect of this attack on our democracy. The American people have clearly stated the urgency behind this.  My view is that the Congress has an obligation to follow the money wherever the evidence leads and to conduct a thorough investigation that leaves no stones unturned and presents to the public what we find. I will close by way of saying that I don't see how you can do the essential counterintelligence work that is so important to our committee--and I note that the distinguished Presiding Officer of the Senate, the Senator from Missouri, is a member of the committee and a valued one--I don't see how the committee can do its counterintelligence work without following the money, because we know that those financial issues are absolutely key--that money is the key to compromising an individual--it is obviously so important in trying to ensure that we have policies in this country that protect our security and our role in the world.

834,topic-id,205,"Mr.Speaker, this morning I saw a dramatic bit of evidence as to why the American people overwhelmingly reject the Republican donor relief bill known as the tax reform bill.  Chairman Brady of the Ways and Means Committee, the author of this bill, was asked why he didn't do anything in the bill to change the carried interest deduction, that provision which allows billionaire hedge fund managers to pay a lower income tax rate than tens of millions of regular  He said the middle class Americans don't care about that, working families don't. I understand why he didn't want to try to defend the protection of carried interest. There is no defense for it.  But here is why every American ought to care: Because every dollar of lost revenue that goes back to those billionaire hedge fund managers will result in cut services for the vast majority of Americans, for Medicare, for Medicaid, for Social Security, and for many others. It will add to the debt that their children and grandchildren will have to pay for.

1030,topic-id,187,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my fellow Kentucky native for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, today, my Republican colleagues will vote to approve a historically unpopular bill.  The American people don't buy Republican claims that the bill will help middle class families. In fact, in several years, more than 83 million middle class families will see a tax hike.  The people see that Republicans have sold their souls and principles to give tax cuts to wealthy corporations and to pay back their billionaire donors. They know the Republicans have abandoned any claim to fiscal responsibility. After all, nonpartisan analyses conclude this bill will add more than $1 trillion to the debt.  But the Republican leadership has a plan to make up the difference, and it is something else. They are already working on legislation to make massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs families need.  This isn't tax reform. This isn't help for the middle class. It is a scam, it is fraud, and it will have dangerous, long-lasting consequences for the American people.

544,topic-id,1032,"Mr.President, I rise today in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs We know the world has changed a whole lot in the last 30 years--the way we travel, how we communicate, the way we work, our hairstyles, the clothes we wear, the movies we watch, the music we listen to--but one thing hasn't changed: Our outdated Tax Code hasn't kept up. We simply can't afford to wait any longer. Now is the time to act.  Hoosiers need a raise. Working families across America need a raise. American businesses need to remain competitive in what is an increasingly global and hypercompetitive economy.  The bill we are voting on today will provide real relief to all Americans, especially middle-class families and those of modest means. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will creates a Tax Code that is simpler, that is fairer, and that allows Hoosiers to keep more of their hard-earned money, and that is what they want.  This bill we are voting on today will help create an environment where jobs and businesses can grow by making permanent a corporate tax reduction to 21 percent. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. That is no way to remain competitive.  We will lighten the burden on small businesses with this legislation. I come from a small business family. My dad worked 6, 7 days a week growing up. He sold HVAC equipment and spent a lot of time on the road. I know because he told me that it irked him that when he added up his profits, he discovered toward the end of the year that over half of what he earned he paid to various forms of government. We provide relief to businesses like that.  We shift the structure of the international tax system so that foreign profits from U.S.-based companies will be invested right here in American communities, not overseas.  Throughout this process, I have listened carefully to extensive feedback from the people of Indiana, and I have to say that I am grateful for all the Hoosiers who weighed in over the course of this effort. They helped me shape this work product in a way that will more benefit the people of Indiana today and for future generations.  I heard, for example, from Susan from Susan said:       Our tax system has become so complicated--the average      person needs to hire someone with expertise to help. If most      of us didn't have to hire help--right there we'd be saving      money.  Susan, you are right, and that is why we have lightened the burden for millions of Americans with this proposal.  Under this act that we will be voting on this evening, 9 out of 10 Americans can take the standard deduction. We have doubled the standard deduction, vastly simplifying compliance with a convoluted, unfair Tax Code that picks winners and losers. We undo so much of that with this bill we will vote on this evening.  I heard from Debbie from Clark Debbie contacted my office about her business's challenges. Debbie said the following:       We are constantly striving to reinvest in our company      through new equipment and increased wages to hire and retain      good employees. A lower corporate tax rate will allow us to      buy more equipment and offer . . . better wages.  It is common sense, and I am glad that Debbie contacted me to reinforce what is on the mind of so many Hoosier business owners.  This bill continues and expands the support for Indiana's highest priorities, and that is why I will be supporting it. Among these priorities are deductions for contributions to benefit our charitable organizations essential to communities throughout Indiana and throughout our country and keeping tuition waivers for graduate students untaxed. I again thank the graduate students and all the stakeholders throughout Indiana who had concerns related to this issue. They weighed in. We made changes to the legislation to accommodate their concerns, and this will enable Hoosiers to be better equipped to thrive in this ever-changing global economy in which we live.  We managed to maintain the earned income tax credit so that work pays more than joblessness. We expanded the child tax credit for families trying to make ends meet. We protected the adoption tax credit so that caring adults can become loving parents. We preserved private activity bonds. These benefit low-income housing and help to build hospitals and schools and other essential programs in the communities that need them most.  Now, the bill also makes good on our promise to repeal what many regard as the most oppressive aspect of ObamaCare--the individual mandate tax. I promised Hoosiers for years and years that I would get rid of the individual mandate. Tonight we will be fulfilling that promise.  In Indiana nearly 140,000 Hoosiers chose to pay this tax instead of buying insurance they either don't want or can't afford. In my home State, 81 percent of those who paid this tax made less than $50,000 per year. This comes from the And 40 percent of the people who pay this tax make less than $25,000 a year. Tell me this isn't a tax on the working poor.  This bill lifts the burden for families in Indiana and across the country, and it is one of the many reasons that I will be proudly supporting it. Collectively, this is a no-brainer. This legislation will lead to an increase in capital investment, which will lead to an increase in economic growth. This bill will make workers more productive so that they earn higher wages. This bill, across every income category, will cause Americans to see a reduction in their tax rates and more take-home pay--more of their hard-earned money in their pockets. So many Americans haven't seen an increase in take-home pay in well over a decade. It is time to provide relief to hard-working American families. It is time to create certainty for our job creators so that they can create more jobs.  I look forward to helping to move this legislation across the finish line this evening. I hope we get some bipartisan support in that effort.  I yield the floor.
