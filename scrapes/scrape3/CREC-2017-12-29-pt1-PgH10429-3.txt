                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God and Father, as we come to the end of another year, it is 
fitting that this House and this country give pause to reflect on the 
blessings You have bestowed on our lives and on our work. We thank You 
for the prosperity and peace Your mercy extends.
  As we conclude our service this year and anticipate the challenges of 
the next, we recall Your heartening words: ``The faithful love of the 
Lord never ends. His mercies never cease. Great is His faithfulness; 
His mercies begin afresh each morning.''
  We count on Your mercies, Lord, as we look upon the task before us, 
to lead and govern our Nation informed by Your will and purposes, so 
that we may enjoy the union, the peace, and the justice that is Your 
intention for all peoples.
  Bless all who work and assemble in this House, and bless this session 
with Your spirit that it may result in much good fruit and lasting 
peace.
  Amen.
