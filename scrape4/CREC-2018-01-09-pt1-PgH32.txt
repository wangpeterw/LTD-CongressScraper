              RECOGNIZING STOP THE BLEED TRAINING COURSES

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stop the 
Bleed training courses offered by the American College of Surgeons.
  Every year, more than 180,000 Americans die from injuries sustained 
in a myriad of ways. What many people may not know is that a large 
number of these fatalities result not from instantaneous trauma but, 
rather, from blood loss. From the moment a major injury occurs, the 
clock is ticking. Uncontrolled bleeding can kill us in as little as 5 
to 10 minutes.
  Bleeding is a preventable cause of death, and that is why the Stop 
the Bleed effort is such a valuable program. The American College of 
Surgeons, working in partnership with many other organizations, has now 
made this training easily available to Americans across this country.
  I had the opportunity to participate in Stop the Bleed training 
myself, and as part of my course, I learned how to properly apply 
bandages and tourniquets. And do you know, what? It actually was kind 
of fun.
  We should do everything possible to ensure that more accidents don't 
become tragedies. This effort must include integrating blood loss 
prevention into our preparedness toolkit. Let's all be ready to come to 
the aid of our fellow citizens if the need ever arises.
  Madam Speaker, let's stop the bleed.
