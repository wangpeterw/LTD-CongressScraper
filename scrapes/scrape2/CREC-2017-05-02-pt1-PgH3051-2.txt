                   POLL SHOWS MEDIA IS NOT MAINSTREAM

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the national media's continued 
crusade against President Trump further demonstrates that they are not 
mainstream.
  A Morning Consult poll found that a majority of Americans believe the 
media is ``out of touch with everyday Americans.'' Most significantly, 
37 percent said they trusted President Trump to tell the truth, while 
only 29 percent said the media is truthful.
  The media's open hostility to the President continues to erode his 
credibility. A poll by the University of Virginia Center for Politics 
found that 88 percent of Trump voters agree with him that the media 
``is the enemy of the American people.''
  Let's hope the media will put aside their bias and give the President 
fair and objective coverage. It may be the only way for the media to 
rebuild their credibility.
