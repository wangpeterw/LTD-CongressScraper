                   WILSON AMENDMENT TO THE 2018 NDAA

  (Ms. WILSON of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on the night of April 14, 2014, 
Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from the Chibok Government Girls 
Secondary School in Nigeria, a night we all remember.
  Although some girls fled or have been released, more than 100 Chibok 
girls remain in captivity today with Boko Haram, the deadliest 
terrorist organization in the world.
  Last year, Congress unanimously passed bipartisan legislation 
sponsored by U.S. Senator Susan Collins and myself to require a 5-year 
strategy to conquer Boko Haram. Last night, an amendment to solidify 
the bill and add a sense of Congress that expresses our support for the 
kidnapped schoolgirls and the United States strategy for countering 
Boko Haram was passed in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.
  I thank Armed Services Committee Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member 
Smith, Rules Committee Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and 
Congressman Alcee Hastings.
  We will continue to fight against Boko Haram and their vicious and 
cruel tactics against the Nigerian people. We will continue to wear red 
every Wednesday until all of our girls are released.
  Remember to tweet, tweet, tweet, #bringbackourgirls.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would ask Members to heed the 
gavel.
