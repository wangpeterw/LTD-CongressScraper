                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Immortal, invisible, God only wise, we praise You that those who 
trust in You will not lack any good things. We thank You that You are 
the source of our strength and the strength of our lives.
  Guide our lawmakers in all their undertakings. Stay close to them and 
infuse them with Your Spirit of Wisdom. May they strive for Your 
approval instead of seeking the approbation of humanity. When our 
Senators face troubles, rescue them from each one, enabling them to 
tell of Your excellent greatness. Lord, give them the grace to receive 
things as they are, while resolving by Your grace to make them what 
they ought to be.
  And, Lord, we pray for the victims and families of the Great Mills 
school shooting.
  We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.
