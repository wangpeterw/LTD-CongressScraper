                  REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF THOMAS RUSSO

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Thomas 
Russo. Tom was born in New Orleans and grew up in Louisiana, where he 
received a degree in broadcast journalism from LSU.
  I got to know Tom in his role as assignment manager at the WPMI 
television station in Mobile, Alabama. Tom was a consummate 
professional, always with a smile on his face and a contagious 
positivity about himself. In all of my experiences, Tom was a true joy 
to work with.
  Tragically, Tom passed away, unexpectedly, on March 3 at the young 
age of 56.
  To Tom's wife, Kristine, and his children, Ryan and Nick, please know 
that Tom helped make southwest Alabama and the world a better and 
happier place. His legacy will live on in each of you.
