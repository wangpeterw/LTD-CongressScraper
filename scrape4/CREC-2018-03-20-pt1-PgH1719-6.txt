                   HONORING THE LIFE OF TERESA KIMURA

  (Mr. KIHUEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIHUEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Teresa 
Kimura.
  Teresa traveled to the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1 
with six of her friends. She was known for making every gathering an 
amazing experience.
  Teresa worked at the California Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration.
  She is remembered for her big heart, love of life, beautiful spirit, 
and infectious laugh.
  I would like to extend my condolences to Teresa Kimura's family and 
friends. Please note that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, 
and the whole country grieve with you.

                          ____________________
