                      RECOGNIZING HOPE THAT BINDS

  (Mr. COMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hope That Binds, an 
organization based out of Carlisle County, Kentucky, that aids in 
domestic and international adoption services.
  The organization was recently recognized as a 2017 Angels in Adoption 
honoree. Wendy Davis-Wilson, Jeff and Benita Davis, and Brooke Kelly 
have all dedicated their time to bridging the gaps in the complicated 
adoption processing. Wendy and Brandon, adoptive parents themselves, 
have a sincere passion for ensuring resources are available for 
families wishing to adopt.
  Through Hope That Binds, a network of loving families is growing and 
expanding constantly. To date, more than 40 families have been assisted 
through the organization's fundraisers and grant programs.
  In addition, I would like to recognize Josh and Mandy Thurman, who 
were also selected as Angels in Adoption honorees. After a 2-year 
adoption process starting in 2013, the Thurmans brought their son, 
Townes, home to Simpson County from Ethiopia. Families like the Davises 
and Thurmans make a major difference in the lives of children who need 
loving families.
  On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate both 
families in their efforts to make the dream of a family a reality for 
children in need.
