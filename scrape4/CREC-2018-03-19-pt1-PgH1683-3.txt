               REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE LOUISE SLAUGHTER

  (Mr. REED asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to stand with my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as those on our 
side, in recognition of a life well done; that is, the passing of our 
colleague Louise Slaughter. To me, tonight, it is something we should 
take a moment to reflect upon and recognize: her life, her commitment 
to this body.
  Having served with her on the Rules Committee, I can personally 
attest, being a fellow New Yorker, that we shared a commitment to our 
home areas; that we always brought the passion of our beliefs, both on 
the left and the right, into the room; but at the end of the day, 
Louise Slaughter represented us well, in the sense of how she 
represented and carried herself in this Chamber as she represented her 
people, her folks back home in Rochester, New York.
  And I am proud to call her and remember her this evening as a Member 
of this body and her service to all of us. She was a Southern lady at 
heart, had a good wit, and she will be missed by many Members, if not 
all Members, on both sides of the aisle.
