                     DON'T MESS WITH BALLARD HOUSE

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, ``Don't mess with Texas'' is a phrase we 
Texans use when challenged.
  The folks in Katy, Texas, tweaked that phrase a little bit after 
Hurricane Harvey. They tweaked it to, ``Don't mess with Ballard 
House.''
  In 2008, Cinco Charities opened temporary lodging for families coming 
to Katy for treatment of life-threatening conditions, a home away from 
home. Five years and 500 guests later, it became clear that Cinco 
Charities needed to have a permanent home.
  Angels on Earth, Monty and Erin Ballard, raised the funds for 24 
family suites. Before Harvey, it was clear we needed more rooms. Monty 
and Erin's foundation gave a $2 million grant to double the size of 
Ballard House. Groundbreaking is tomorrow.
  Harvey gave us a big hit, but we turned that 24 suites now into 48 
suites for families. The message is clear: Don't mess with Ballard 
House.
