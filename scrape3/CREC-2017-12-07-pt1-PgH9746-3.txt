                      CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jack Hong from 
Edina High School who won this year's Congressional App Challenge in 
Minnesota.
  Every year, the Congressional App Challenge encourages students to 
create an original app by writing computer code. The competition 
inspires students across the country to explore computer science and 
STEM fields, fosters innovation, and promotes involvement by some who 
are historically underrepresented in tech fields.
  Jack won this year's competition by designing an app called Pomo 
Timer that blocks distracting websites on the user's computer for short 
periods of time.
  I would also like to recognize Madiha Rizvi of Brooklyn Park who won 
runner-up for creating an app called Jobscope that helps young adults 
find jobs in their communities.
  Zara Thomas and Omar Elamri from Minnetonka Middle School were also 
both honorable mentions for their apps.
  Mr. Speaker, these students have shown ingenuity, imagination, and 
intellectual curiosity, and their inventive talent will take them far. 
I congratulate them on their achievement and wish them the best in 
future academics.
