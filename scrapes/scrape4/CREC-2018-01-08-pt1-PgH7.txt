                 EL SALVADOR TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment 
with the administration's decision to terminate temporary protected 
status--TPS--for hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans. This decision 
comes just after it terminated TPS for Haiti and Nicaragua.
  In 2001, El Salvador was struck by a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that 
left destruction and tragedy in its wake, resulting in 250,000 
Salvadorans coming to the U.S. seeking safety. Since then, they have 
been key parts of our communities and important contributors for our 
economy. It is cruel and inhumane to tell them that they will no longer 
be afforded temporary status here in the U.S. and that they have to go 
back to unsafe and uncertain conditions.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to reverse the decision to 
terminate TPS for El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Haiti. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in a letter to the administration asking it to 
right this wrong and to also extend this status for Honduras.
