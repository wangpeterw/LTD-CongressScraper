     IN SUPPORTOF NOMINATION OF SECRETARY OF EDUCATION BETSY DeVOS

  (Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HUIZENGA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my friend Betsy DeVos, 
President-elect Trump's nominee to serve as the nextSecretary for the 
Department of Education.
  Betsy is a passionate and dedicated servant with a big heart for 
kids. She is a grandmother of five who has made it herlife's mission to 
ensure that all children in America have access to a quality education 
no matter what their ZIP Codes are.Betsy has fought for children in 
classrooms to State capitals, and her efforts have given more kids hope 
for a brighter future.In our shared home State of Michigan, Betsy led 
the effort to pass the State's first charter school law. According to 
StanfordUniversity, Michigan's charter school students now perform at a 
higher level than do their peers.
  I witnessed Betsy's creativity and discipline firsthand when we 
served together on the board of the Compass College ofCinematic Arts, a 
Grand Rapids, Michigan-based film school and production company. We 
implemented rigorous standards that setCompass up for accreditation, 
and it now holds them accountable.

  I know that Betsy is up to the challenge of ensuring our children are 
prepared to compete and thrive in our ever-changingworld.
