                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Sovereign Lord of the Universe, we pray today for all who govern. Use 
our Senators for Your glory, providing them with wisdom to live with 
the integrity that brings stability to nations. Because of their 
labors, enable us to live peaceful, quiet, godly, and dignified lives, 
growing in grace and in a knowledge of You.
  Lord, inspire our lawmakers in every situation to seek to glorify 
You, doing justly, loving mercy, and walking humbly on the path You 
have chosen. May they speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, 
ensuring justice for those who are perishing. Lord, keep our Senators 
ever in the circle of Your unfolding providence as they find delight in 
doing Your will.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
