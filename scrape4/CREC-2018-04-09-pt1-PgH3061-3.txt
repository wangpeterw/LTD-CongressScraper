                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Vincent DeRosa, St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  God our Creator and Guide, as this House seeks to participate in Your 
own loving care for our people, grant its Members likewise a 
participation in Your wisdom, prudence, and perseverance in good.
  Rouse in their hearts a humble reverence for those who have gone 
before us and joyous hope for the future.
  In particular, excite in their deliberation a lively concern for the 
most vulnerable among us so that each and every person may be assured 
of needed comfort when their hour of need inevitably comes.
  We ask these and all other blessings in accord with Your will for 
these United States of America.
  Amen.
