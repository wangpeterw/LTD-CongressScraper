OBJECTING TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXECUTIVE ORDER SUSPENDING VISAS AND 
                  THE U.S. REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to object to the 
administration's recent executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee 
Admissions Program and visas from certain countries in the Middle East 
and east Africa. Protecting our national security, of course, must 
always be our number one priority.
  This executive order, however, Mr. Speaker, does not focus on the 
precise challenges that we face. We can keep our homeland safe by 
immediately implementing more thorough screening procedures rather than 
pursuing this broad brush approach.
  Although this measure is temporary and some individuals will continue 
to be admitted on a case-by-case basis, Congress needs to work to 
ensure that this order does not apply to U.S. residents, does not apply 
to those who have already been issued a visa, or does not apply to 
those who have already been granted refugee status.
  I urge the administration to work with Congress and Federal agencies 
to find a measured plan that protects our national security, honors our 
existing commitments, and follows the letter and spirit of the law.
