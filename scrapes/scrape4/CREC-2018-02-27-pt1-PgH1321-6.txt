                PAYING TRIBUTE TO REVEREND BILLY GRAHAM

  (Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life 
and legacy of Reverend Billy Graham. He was America's pastor. He was a 
humble man, and he devoted his life to helping people of all 
backgrounds discover the true peace and joy found in the life of 
service to Jesus Christ.
  Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of problems to solve in this country, much 
of which are too deep for mere legislation. We need prayer more than we 
need policy solutions. We need repentance more than we need reform.

[[Page H1322]]

  Mr. Speaker, we need God more than we need government. Billy Graham 
understood that.
  We need more of what Billy Graham talked about for six decades, that 
simple story that God so loved the world that He gave His only son to 
die for us, and that if we believed that, we would have eternal life 
with Him. That is what we need.
  Thank God for Billy Graham.
