          RECOGNIZING THOSE WHO HELPED IN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, California, northern California, where I am 
from, has been suffering, as so many people know, from devastating 
fires these last few weeks. I think it is very appropriate to point out 
the incredible efforts of our first responders and our firefighters in 
saving so much valuable property and the lives that have been saved, as 
well as citizens pulling together to help each other.
  We see the best in Americans during these times of crisis, and that 
has not gone unnoticed in northern California as well. Our hearts are 
with those folks who have suffered losses and more loss of life than 
could be imagined in modern-day America with all the firefighting 
apparatus and prevention we have. Still, it shows you have to have 
preparedness; you have to have defensible space; and you have to be 
ready, at any given time, during this type of fire season.
  Again, our hats are off to our first responders and our firefighters 
for the amount of property and lives they have been able to save under 
these conditions. God bless them.
