                           WASTEFUL SPENDING

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, we sure find a lot of ways to waste money in 
this town, but the EPA may have just reached a new low. We are spending 
$5 million on a study to force-feed rats lard and coconut oil until 
they are morbidly obese, then we pump their enclosures full of exhaust 
until they die. Then the EPA measures the amount of toxins in the fat 
cells of the rats as opposed to their skinny counterparts.
  So we are borrowing money from the next generation so that we can 
fat-shame dead rats that we ourselves have poisoned in the government.
  I would invite my colleagues to join me in fighting against this and 
so much other wasteful spending that we seem to find in Washington.
