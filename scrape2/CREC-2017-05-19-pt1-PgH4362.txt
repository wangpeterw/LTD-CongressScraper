                  RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. CULBERSON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, every day law enforcement officers across 
America put their lives on the line to protect our communities and our 
fellow citizens. National Police Week is an opportunity for all 
Americans to recognize and express our deep appreciation for those law 
enforcement officers and first responders for their selfless service.
  I want to take a moment to honor those who have lost their lives in 
the line of duty.
  In Harris County, Texas, we recognize and remember the lives of Chief 
Clint Greenwood and Deputy Darren Goforth, who worked tirelessly to 
keep Houston safe. Both of these men served their communities and 
families honorably, and we are so grateful for their sacrifice.
  As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Subcommittee, it is and will continue to be one of my 
top priorities to ensure that our law enforcement officers have the 
resources they need to protect our communities and to protect 
themselves. We must always honor and protect those who protect us.
  I express a deep thanks to the people of Texas and America, to all 
our uniformed officers, for their dedicated service to our Nation.
