  revisions to the aggregates and allocations of the fiscal year 2018 
                  concurrent resolution on the budget

                                         House of Representatives,


                                      Committee on the Budget,

                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2018.
       Mr. Speaker, I hereby submit for printing in the 
     Congressional Record revisions to the aggregates and 
     allocations set forth in H. Con. Res. 71, the Fiscal Year 
     2018 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, and the Statement 
     of Committee Allocations for Fiscal Year 2018 published in 
     the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017.
       The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123), 
     enacted on February 9, 2018, amended the statutory 
     discretionary spending limits for fiscal year 2018 base 
     discretionary programs in the amount of $629 billion for 
     defense programs and $579 billion for

     non-defense programs. Section 5301 of H. Con. Res. 71 permits 
     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget to adjust the 
     applicable levels and committee allocations in the budget 
     resolution and the Statement of Committee Allocations 
     published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017, 
     for enacted legislation that amends the statutory 
     discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of the 
     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 
     (BBEDCA). For fiscal year 2018, aggregate levels of budget 
     authority and outlays, the allocation to the Committee on 
     Appropriations, and the allocation for Overseas Contingency 
     Operations/Global War on Terrorism, included in the Statement 
     of Committee Allocations published in the Congressional 
     Record on November 2, 2017, are revised. These revisions are 
     provided for the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to 
     H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. 
     Associated tables are attached.
       Section 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for adjustments to the 
     statutory discretionary spending limits for certain purposes 
     including program integrity initiatives and disaster relief. 
     The House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625, the 
     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, contains $1.896 
     billion in budget authority for program integrity initiatives 
     and $7.366 billion in budget authority for disaster relief, 
     both of which are within the allowable limits for their 
     respective purposes as established under section 251(b)(2)(B) 
     and (C) of BBEDCA. Accordingly, I am submitting an adjustment 
     to H. Con. Res. 71 and the Statement of Committee Allocations 
     published in the Congressional Record on November 2, 2017, 
     pursuant to section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
     1974, to accommodate funding for both program integrity 
     initiatives and disaster relief contained in the House 
     Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1625, the 
     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. After making these 
     adjustments, the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to 
     H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, is 
     within the fiscal year 2018 statutory discretionary spending 
     limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. Associated tables are 
     attached.
       These revisions represent an adjustment for purposes of 
     enforcing sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget 
     Act of 1974. For the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act 
     of 1974, these revised aggregates and allocations are to be 
     considered as aggregates and allocations included in the 
     concurrent resolution on the budget and the Statement of 
     Committee Allocations published in the Congressional Record 
     on November 2, 2017, as adjusted.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Steve Womack,
                                                         Chairman.
