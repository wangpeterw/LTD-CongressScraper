       FUNDING LEGAL SERVICES IN PROTECTION FROM EXECUTIVE ORDERS

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the DREAMers, 
Immigrants, Refugees--or DIRe--Legal Aid Act. This bill will fund legal 
services to protect them from the recent executive orders.
  In my district last week, I held an immigration town hall. The place 
was packed with people who were afraid for their neighbors and afraid 
for our communities, and this was before the executive order was 
released. When I was at LAX this past Saturday evening, I saw the fear 
escalate. President Trump's executive orders directly challenge the due 
process rights that are guaranteed to all of us under the Constitution.
  My legislation will help DREAMers, immigrants, and refugees have 
access to legal representation. Refugees are already vetted by the 
State Department, and the State Department does a very good job. If we 
want to do extreme vetting, let's do it right, and let's do it legally.
  If we wish to remain a beacon of freedom to the world, we must stand 
up for immigrants and refugees who look to America as a place of hope. 
We can't just claim we are the greatest Nation in the world--we have to 
be the greatest Nation in the world.
