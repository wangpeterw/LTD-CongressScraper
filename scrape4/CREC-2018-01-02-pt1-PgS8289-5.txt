                  NOMINATIONS REMAINING IN STATUS QUO

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 
notwithstanding the order of December 21, 2017, and the provisions of 
rule XXXI, all uniformed military promotions pending in the Senate 
remain in status quo, with the exception of the following: PN765, 
PN540, and PN475, and that the following defense civilian nomination 
also be returned to the President: PN1096. I further ask consent that 
the previous order be modified to reflect that PN1193 should be 
returned to the President and PN1316 should remain in status quo.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
