             RECOGNIZING RAY HECKLER, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a 
true American hero, Ray Heckler, who is being laid to rest in Arlington 
today with full military honors.
  Ray began his service to his country as a private in the Army, and 
retired after 40 years as a command sergeant major in the Illinois 
National Guard in Urbana. During his time in the Army, he served in 
Germany, Berlin, Japan, Paris, Africa, Morocco, Casablanca, and Marcel 
in France. He was awarded the Bronze Star in France for his heroic and 
praiseworthy service on the field of battle.
  Remembered by those closest to him as being a helping hand whenever 
needed, Ray spent time with his community by working to construct and 
rehabilitate homes through Habitat for Humanity.
  It is my honor to recognize Mr. Heckler and his devotion to our 
country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family as they mourn the 
loss of a truly courageous and selfless man.
  Rest in peace, Ray Heckler.
