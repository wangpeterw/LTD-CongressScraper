                              POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted and sober in 
respectful support for my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line 
from sea to shining sea. These men and women behind the badge rise each 
day and serve each night as we work and as we slumber, sure to face 
dangers unknown, certain to face enemies unseen, and sometimes to be 
completely unappreciated. This week, we recognize them and we celebrate 
them.
  To my brothers and sisters of the thin blue line, please hear that 
your support within this body is unwavering and shall not falter.
  God bless you, one and all.

                          ____________________
