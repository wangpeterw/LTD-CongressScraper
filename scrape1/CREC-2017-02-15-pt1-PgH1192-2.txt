       INHUMANE HUNTING TECHNIQUES ON WILDLIFE REFUGES IN ALASKA

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, so far, in 2017, Donald Trump and the 
Republicans have targeted women, immigrants, and health care. Now they 
are setting their sights on bear cubs, wolves, and coyotes.
  Republicans, in cahoots with the gun lobby and with trophy hunters, 
want to eliminate a rule that currently prohibits hunters from using 
brutal means to kill our majestic animals in Alaska's 16 wildlife 
refuges.
  This rule prevents snaring and trapping bears, including cubs, 
hunting wolves in their dens, and shooting bears from helicopters, 
among other methods.
  Now, those opposed to the rule say that it hurts Alaska's economy, 
but there is no evidence of that. In fact, big game hunting represents 
only 2 percent of wildlife-related recreation on our national wildlife 
refuges.
  Meanwhile, the National Park Service has estimated that wildlife 
watchers, those who go to see wildlife, not to shoot them, contribute 
$1 billion to the State's economy.
  I ask you: Is a trophy on the wall really worth it?
  So please vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 69 introduced by our colleague, 
Mr. Young.
