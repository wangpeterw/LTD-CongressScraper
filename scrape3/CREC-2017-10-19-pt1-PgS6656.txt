                              S. Res. 297

       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States 
     have parents who work outside the home;
       Whereas high-quality programs that expand learning 
     opportunities for children, such as afterschool, before-
     school, summer, and expanded learning opportunities, provide 
     safe, challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences, 
     including experiences that encourage science, technology, 
     engineering, and math, that help children and youth develop 
     social, emotional, physical, cultural, and academic skills;
       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs and high-quality 
     expanded learning opportunities provide students with hands-
     on, engaging lessons that are aligned with the school day;
       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs complement 
     regular and expanded school days and support working families 
     by ensuring that the children of those families are safe and 
     productive during the hours parents are working;
       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, 
     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the 
     well-being of children and youth in the United States;
       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs that partner with 
     high-quality community-based organizations build stronger 
     communities by integrating schools with the larger community; 
     and
       Whereas Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of 
     afterschool, before-school, summer, and expanded learning 
     opportunities programs, held on October 26, 2017, highlights 
     the critical importance of those high-quality programs to 
     children and the families and communities of those children: 
     Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate supports Lights on Afterschool, a 
     national celebration of afterschool programs held on October 
     26, 2017.
