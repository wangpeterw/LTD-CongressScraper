                         ABSENCE OF LEADERSHIP

  (Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, as a former police chief, I have seen the 
effects of good government and I have seen the effects of bad 
government, and what we have seen over the last few days is bad 
government.
  As the party in charge of the Senate, the House, and the White House, 
the Republican majority has a responsibility to pass a budget that 
sustains critical services for the American people.
  Instead, they passed a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway, chose to ignore 
critical concerns, and push an anti-immigrant agenda.
  I have seen the horrible outcomes of trying to make one group of 
people afraid of another. I have seen the results of ignoring the real 
dangers to America, like racism, gun violence, poverty, and lack of 
opportunity.
  We are a nation of immigrants.
  As leaders of a pluralistic society, we have a responsibility to 
build a nation with compassion for people. But this shutdown was about 
more than immigration. It was about our military, our veterans, our 
seniors, our children, and adequate disaster relief.
  Mr. Speaker, I will not support a complete absence of leadership. I 
will continue to fight for real solutions.
