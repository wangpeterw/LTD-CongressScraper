                      CONGRATULATING PAT BRADFORD

  (Mr. ROUZER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to make special mention of 
Pat Bradford, who recently stepped down as publisher and editor of the 
local paper she founded, the Lumina News.
  The Lumina News has served as the voice of Wrightsville Beach and its 
surrounding communities since 2002. This local paper covers a wide 
range of topics but sets itself apart by covering matters especially 
important to coastal communities.
  The Lumina News has consistently been ranked first in its North 
Carolina Press Association newspaper category. In fact, first in nine 
new top awards for 2016.
  With her recent departure from the paper, Pat is focusing her 
attention on the very successful monthly sister publication which she 
co-founded, the Wrightsville Beach Magazine.
  I have had the pleasure of getting to know Pat in the past few years 
and will certainly miss interacting with her as publisher and editor of 
the Lumina News.
  Congratulations to you, Pat, for your continued success in all these 
endeavors and for your continued contributions to the Wrightsville 
Beach community and beyond.
