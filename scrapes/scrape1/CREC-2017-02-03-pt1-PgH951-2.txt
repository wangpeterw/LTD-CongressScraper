                         REMEMBERING EMILY HART

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Mrs. Emily 
Hart, who passed away on Monday, January, 23, 2017. She was 82 years of 
age.
  Mrs. Hart was born in 1934 to her parents, Emily and Edwin Tribble, 
in Washington, D.C., where her father worked as an editor of the old 
Washington Star newspaper for nearly 40 years. She spent her early 
education in Washington, D.C., before she moved on to Vassar College in 
New York City, where she studied political science.
  No matter where she was, Mrs. Hart dedicated her time and energy to 
bettering the community. In Washington, she was a proud member of the 
National Cathedral Foundation and the National Preservation Historical 
Society. In St. Simons, she joined the Coastal Georgia Historical 
Society; was a devout member of the Christ Church Frederica; and worked 
with the St. Simons Land Trust, which works to preserve the island's 
natural beauty and improve the quality of life in the community.
  Although she was always aiding the community, her greatest joy came 
from her family, which included her husband--retired U.S. Marine 
Colonel Nick Hart--her three children, and her seven grandchildren.
  Her sharp wit, passion for learning, and detailed stories of the past 
are what will be remembered most dearly. I express my condolences to 
Mrs. Hart's family for their loss. She will be missed.
