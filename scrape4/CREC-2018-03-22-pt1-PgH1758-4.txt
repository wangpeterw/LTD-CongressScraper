                   COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

  (Ms. BARRAGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. BARRAGAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Colorectal 
Cancer Awareness Month. This type of cancer is the second leading cause 
of death in the United States.
  Each March, we raise awareness about this terrible disease and spread 
the word about the importance of getting screened. If you are 45 years 
or older, please get yourself screened early.
  The disease poses an especially high risk to African-American men and 
women who have the highest rate of death and the lowest survival rate 
among all Americans. This is why I am proud to support funding for 
programs like the Colorectal Cancer Control Program, which was 
established specifically to address disparities in screening rates and 
to improve access to underserved populations.
  Along with the Affordable Care Act, which requires the coverage of 
screening tests, we can provide the healthcare that Americans need to 
stay cancer free.
