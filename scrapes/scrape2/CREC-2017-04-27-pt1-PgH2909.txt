               CELEBRATING GULFSTREAM'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
50th anniversary of Gulfstream Aerospace, the largest private sector 
employer in Georgia's First Congressional District.
  Gulfstream's origins as an aerospace company are steeped in American 
history. During World War II, Roy Grumman built war planes for the 
United States during the war. After the war ended, he sought a new use 
for his resources and, in 1958, founded Gulfstream to build business 
airliners instead.
  Mr. Grumman's first project, the Gulfstream I, made its first flight 
on August 14, 1958. This purpose-built business aircraft was the first 
of its kind and revolutionized general aviation. Gulfstream produced 
more than 200 of the original aircraft, many of which are still 
operating today. The first project spawned more aircraft models and 
helped exciting innovations take off.
  On September 29, 1967, Gulfstream landed in Savannah, Georgia, where 
it remains headquartered to this day. Savannah offers optimal land 
availability, labor supply, transportation facilities, and weather 
conditions, making it the perfect location to operate.
  We have gladly welcomed Gulfstream in our district for the last 50 
years, and this impressive company has greatly contributed to the 
community by employing nearly 10,000 people.
  Congratulations to Gulfstream Aerospace on reaching its 50th 
anniversary, a milestone I am confident it will continue to build on.
