MICHAEL KENNY NAMED 2018 GRAND MARSHAL OF SAVANNAH'S ST. PATRICK'S DAY 
                                 PARADE

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Michael Kenny for being named the 2018 grand marshal of the Savannah 
St. Patrick's Day Parade, the second largest St. Patrick's Day Parade 
in the United States. It is important for everyone in Savannah, but 
most specifically, it is important for the Savannah Irish.
  Savannah has a historically large Irish community, integral to the 
fabric of our city, and the St. Patrick's Day Parade is a direct result 
of this impact. The first public observance of the holiday began in 
1824, and now the parade has around 280 bands, families, soldiers, and 
floats, all marching through the streets of Savannah.
  A family affair, the Kenny family owns a successful local roofing 
company and has worked with the parade for over 40 years. His father, 
Nicolas Kenny, Jr., was the grand marshal in 1978.
  In past years, the committee has chosen between many candidates for

marshal, but this year, Mr. Kenny was the only person nominated, a 
testament to the support and respect he maintains throughout Savannah.
  Mr. Speaker, I know that Mr. Kenny will do a great job with this 
year's festivities, and I look forward to the celebration.
