                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Spirit of the living God, fall afresh on us. As the clock ticks 
toward another deadline, inspire our lawmakers to be instruments of 
Your purposes. May they humbly seek to do what is best for our Nation 
and world, achieving together what cannot be done without allies.
  Lord, give them the wisdom to see that there is a practical morality 
based on absolutes that they should follow. Remind them that they are 
accountable to You for their thoughts, words, and deeds. May they speak 
truth as You give them the ability to comprehend it, finding workable 
solutions to challenging problems.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
