                      FIGHT ONLINE SEX TRAFFICKING

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, sex trafficking is a modern-day slavery 
that violates the human rights of nearly 21 million victims every year. 
It is a rampant crime, committed around the world, but what many don't 
realize is that human trafficking is unfortunately a big problem right 
here in the United States.
  Online trafficking is booming because there are no serious legal 
consequences for the websites that exploit or profit from the 
exploitation of innocent and vulnerable young children. Websites like 
backpage.com are able to evade responsibility for their role in 
trafficking in this industry as they continue to profit from ads 
selling girls for sex.
  That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1865, the Allow States and 
Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, bipartisan legislation 
that will give Federal, State, and local prosecutors the tools that 
they need to hold websites accountable for supporting this horrendous 
industry and help put an end to the online sale of trafficking victims.
