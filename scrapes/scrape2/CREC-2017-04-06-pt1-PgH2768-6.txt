                     QUAPAW AREA COUNCIL GOLD LEVEL

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Quapaw Area 
Council, which, for the first time, was recognized by the Boy Scouts of 
America's Journey to Excellence program as a Gold Level Council, the 
highest award possible.
  The Boy Scouts of America's Journey to Excellence program is designed 
to encourage excellence and reward success at all levels of scouting, 
measuring several indicators that include fiscal management, 
fundraising, youth advancement, youth camping, and membership 
recruitment.
  As a fellow Scout, I am proud of the high standards our Scouts in 
Arkansas are setting. This achievement is a credit to the dedication of 
members of the council, countless volunteers, devoted parents, and 
committed Scouts.
  On behalf of all Arkansans, congratulations. We look forward to 
following your continued success for generations of Scouts to come.
