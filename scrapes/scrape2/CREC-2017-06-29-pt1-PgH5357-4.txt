                         HONORING ANDREW ROGERS

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give special recognition 
to Andrew Rogers, the last surviving member of the heroic 1941 
Willamette University Bearcats football team. The 1941 season was a 
tremendous success for the team, going 8-2, capturing the Northwest 
Conference title.
  But we remember that Bearcats historic season for far more than just 
athletics. At the end of the season, Willamette University was invited 
to play the University of Hawaii on December 6, 1941.
  The following morning, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor began. 
Rogers, the entire team, and visiting Willamette supporters volunteered 
to guard the Punahou School for 10 days while others helped with the 
injured.
  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Rogers volunteered to join the 
United States Marine Corps, where he served as an infantry platoon 
leader for the 3rd Marine Division throughout the Second World War. He 
served meritoriously during the final phase of the recapture of Guam, 
as well as during the Battle of Iwo Jima.
  Rogers reminds all Americans of the impact we can have when we step 
up in times of need. His military service during a dark, uncertain time 
in our history is another shining example of the Greatest Generation.
  I am proud to share his story and offer this small piece of 
recognition for all that Andrew Rogers has done for this great country.
