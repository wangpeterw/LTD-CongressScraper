                                 PRAYER

  Reverend William Gurnee, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  O Lord, who founded the Earth and determined its size; who commanded 
the morning and shown the dawn its place, we sing with gratitude for 
the gifts of life and truth.
  We humbly beg wisdom and prudence for those who work in this Chamber.
  May the laws of this Nation be a mirror of Your will.
  Give the Members the virtue of courage in difficult times, the virtue 
of charity in all times and at the end of the day, the certain 
knowledge that they have served their country well.
  We ask all things in Your Holy Name.
  Amen.
