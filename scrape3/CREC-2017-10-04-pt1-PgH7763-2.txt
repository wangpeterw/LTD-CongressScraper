ALLOWING VA-CREDENTIALED HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO PRACTICE TELEMEDICINE 
                           ACROSS STATE LINES

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend 
the Department of Veterans Affairs for proposing a rule that will allow 
VA-credentialed healthcare providers to practice telemedicine across 
State lines. This is excellent news because our veterans should receive 
the best care possible no matter where they live or are located.
  With advances in technology, we see new opportunities for veterans to 
obtain coverage through telemedicine, especially in some of our most 
rural areas.
  The VA rule is similar to a bill that I introduced together with 
Representative Julia Brownley, called the VETS Act. The existing 
licensure requirements for VA service providers are not in line with 
the technology and care available today.
  Outdated regulations prevent individuals who receive care within the 
VA system from accessing qualified providers who utilize telemedicine 
simply because of the geography and a State border. That is wrong, and 
we must change it.
  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the VETS Act and work to give our 
veterans access to the best care possible. Our servicemen and -women 
answered their country's call. Let's be there for them when they return 
home.
