6004,topic-id,1656,"Mr.President, even in its early days, this administration has embarked on a course of foreign private interest entanglements and conflicts of interest that are truly staggering.  Just this morning, the Associated Press reported that China has granted preliminary approval for 38 new trademarks. They are Trump trademarks, paving the way for the President, Donald Trump, and his family to ``potentially develop a host of branded businesses from hotels to golf clubs to bodyguard and concierge services.''  These reports are contained in public documents. All but three are in the President's own name. The AP report also quotes an official as saying that ``for all these marks to sail through so quickly and cleanly, with no similar marks . . . no issues with specification, boy, it's weird.''  Now, the speculation is that these trademarks could not have been issued without approval by the ruling Communist Party, that hierarchy had to be involved, and that awareness had to involve their approval for these intellectual property interests. The benefit is to the President through his private interests. The fact is, the President of the United States should be beholden only to the American people, not to personal profit, but in fact these trademarks raise the specter that the President possibly is beholden to the approving officials in China even more than to the American people. That is an issue that merits investigation. Like so many issues arising in this young administration, the question is, Who will do that investigation?  The lawyers in China representing Donald Trump applied for these trademarks in April of 2016, even as then-Candidate Donald Trump railed against China at his campaign rallies, criticizing Chinese currency manipulation, its intellectual property theft, its attraction of jobs from this country to theirs. The question arises, What has he done about those issues? In fact, China continues to manipulate its currency, continues to attract jobs from this country, and continues its aggressive policies in the area around that country.  The question is whether an inquiry is appropriate--which certainly it seems to be--and who will supervise it. It is the same question that arises with respect to Russian interference in our electoral system and the potential ties between Trump team officials and the Russians who committed those acts. Those ties have been established by evidence that is now incontrovertible because it is admitted by the officials themselves, now Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former National Security Advisor Michael  It is now a matter of factual record that Russia engaged in a series of deliberate cyber attacks in order to carry out an unprecedented plot to undermine the 2016 elections with the goal of assisting Donald The growing body of evidence clearly and unmistakably indicates that Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russia during the election. These deeply troubling claims of coordination with a foreign government to influence an American election certainly deserve exacting scrutiny and investigation, and the more we learn, the more troubled we become. In fact, we are rapidly careening toward a constitutional crisis. These recent revelations about Vladimir Putin's government and former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn resulted in his resignation. There have also been details about contact between Attorney General Sessions, our former colleague, and the Russian Ambassador that have caused his recusal from all inquiries of that subject matter.  I believe a special prosecutor must be appointed to investigate the Russian interference and meddling in our election, the massive cyber attack misinformation, and propaganda campaign conducted to subvert that election. The potential for cooperation, condoning,[[Page S1661]]connecting between the Trump officials and Russia certainly merits investigation as well. Without reaching conclusions, the special prosecutor ought to investigate and then reach a conclusion. His conclusion should be based on fact, not surmise or speculation.  For weeks, I have called for a special prosecutor to investigate possible ties between members of the Trump campaign, the Trump transition, and the Trump White House to Russian officials who sought to interfere with our election. I support the Intelligence Committee in conducting its investigation. I would favor the appointment of a special commission or a select committee of the Congress to do factfinding, make reports and recommendations in a fully transparent way, but only a special prosecutor can take action based on criminal intent. Only a special prosecutor can pursue violations of criminal law, to not only investigate but also bring charges and seek appropriate punishment and remedy. Only the Deputy Attorney General of the United States can appoint a special prosecutor because the Attorney General has recused himself--in other words, taken himself out of all of the areas of this subject matter. That is why I asked yesterday that the nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, commit to appoint a special prosecutor.  His answer to me was that he wishes to wait until he is approved by the Senate--assuming his confirmation occurs--to decide whether to appoint a special prosecutor. He claims he needs to familiarize himself with the facts and circumstances of any ongoing investigation before he can make a decision. With all due respect, the facts he needs to know are already established. They are already a matter of public record. They are already known to the American public. There is an investigation ongoing by the FBI--and with good reason--into Russian meddling in our elections, this massive campaign of misinformation and cyber attack that they purposefully conducted to influence the outcome of our election.  We know the Justice Department must investigate and pursue the ongoing investigation, wherever the evidence leads. Part of that evidence inevitably will be meetings that were conducted by his boss, the Attorney General of United States, Jeff Sessions, which is why the Attorney General has recused himself--because he could be involved in that investigation as a witness, as a subject, even possibly as a target, as could the President himself.  To close that investigation, the Deputy Attorney General, or whoever is conducting it, needs to question the Attorney General of the United To conduct that investigation, that questioning must occur. So the Deputy Attorney General would be expected to be investigating his boss. If he decides to conduct that investigation himself, he must appoint a special prosecutor to establish the independence of that inquiry, to assure that in reality and in appearance the American public is assured that the investigation is independent, objective, impartial, vigorous, and fair.  The facts that warrant a special prosecutor are already known and they are already a matter of public record. That is why I believe he must commit himself now, before his confirmation--in fact, as a condition of his confirmation--to take that action, which preserves the credibility and public confidence in the Department of Justice that he observed very eloquently in his confirmation hearing as one of his central objectives.  There is a lot of precedent for this step. The most prominent one perhaps is Elliot Richardson, when he was the Attorney General designee. He was requested by the Judiciary Committee, at that time, to make the same kind of commitment--and he did. He kept his promise. He appointed Archibald Cox to be special prosecutor, and the Watergate scandal was appropriately investigated and pursued. That example--when Elliot Richardson had enough facts, just as Rod Rosenstein does now--ought to be the lodestar here. It ought to be the model for his commitment to appointing a special prosecutor.  The simple fact is, Rod Rosenstein, like Elliot Richardson, knows everything he needs to know to be sure a special prosecutor is necessary, and especially because he is a career prosecutor with a distinguished record, and because he has that intellect and integrity that would qualify him probably to be confirmed, he should know it is the right thing to do. Maybe he will do it if he is confirmed, but it would serve the interests of justice, and it would help to sustain and enhance the trust and public confidence in the Department of Justice if he were to do it now, as Elliot Richardson did many years ago.  We live in an extraordinary time. The conflicts of interest and foreign entanglements that threaten our Nation, beginning at the very top of this administration, impose a unique mandate on the Department of The recusal of the Attorney General from this investigation indicates that leadership and integrity are necessary at every level as never before. That is why, in this extraordinary time, I urge the Deputy Attorney General nominee, Rod Rosenstein, to do the right thing and make sure there is an investigation that is independent and vigorous, as well as fair and full; that we know all of the facts eventually and that action is taken appropriately to deal with the Russian interference in our election, the potential ties between the Trump administration--before and after the election--in those improper interferences by the Russians in our election, and that the danger of coverup, indicated by the potential false statements made by Jeff Sessions before the Judiciary Committee and Michael Flynn elsewhere, be stopped before it starts. Only a special prosecutor can provide the unbiased and fair answers that are so urgently needed.  The American people deserve an explanation. They deserve an explanation for the trademarks that have been issued to Donald Trump in They deserve an explanation by a special prosecutor on Russian meddling and Trump ties to that meddling. Whether the independent and special prosecutor broadens the scope of that investigation to include the entanglements or conflicts of interest involving China is a question that will have to be addressed by that official, but this much we know now. We are rapidly careening toward a constitutional crisis, a crisis of credibility as well as legal challenges. The historic opportunity and obligation this nominee owes the country cannot be avoided.

6267,topic-id,1895,"Mr.President, I am going to talk about the resolution we are moving to that will allow us to repeal and begin the replacement for the President's health care plan.  A little over 3 years ago, President Obama hailed the start of the ObamaCare exchanges as a life-changing opportunity for For most Americans, it was life-changing, but it didn't turn out to be an opportunity. It was a life-changing experience because in many cases the insurance they had was no longer affordable, what they thought met their family's needs was no longer available, and the cost continues to go up.  When President Obama pushed the health care law through Congress without a single Republican vote, he repeatedly assured Americans that they would be able to keep the plans they had, that they would be able to keep the doctors they had, and that every family would have a significant reduction in their health care costs. He continued to make every one of those commitments until the plan actually was put in place and it was obvious those commitments were not going to be what happened. By the end of 2013, at least 4.7 million Americans had their plans canceled because they didn't meet the law's mandatory requirements. Remember, these were plans that 4.7 million people thought met their individual needs, and they could afford those plans. That is why they bought them. They might not have been perfect. They might have still been a stretch on their budget, but they decided: This is insurance I can afford, and it is insurance that meets the needs that I can afford to meet with the insurance I can buy.  The President's claims about everybody being able to keep their policies and keep their doctor were so far from reality that PolitiFact rated it as the lie of the year. I don't like to use that language as it relates to the President of the United I would say it must be really easy to become isolated in the Oval Office, and the President may get lots of information that sounds to him as if his plan is working, but the truth is that the President is not entitled to his own facts. He is entitled to his own opinion. He is entitled to his vision of what he thinks health care in America should look like, but he is not entitled to his own facts. If it is not happening the way he thinks it is happening, somebody needs to tell him. But, of course, in just a few days there will be a new President, and we have to deal with the chaos, frankly, that has been created under the old law.  President Obama said this law would mean more choice, more competition, and lower costs for millions of Nobody can find those A number of Americans got on Medicaid, another government program, who weren't on Medicaid before. But there aren't millions of Americans who have more choices, and there aren't millions of Americans who have more competition for their business, and there aren't millions of Americans who have lower costs. In fact, just the opposite would be the case in Missouri, where I live. A number of insurers pulled out of the exchange totally. Our neighboring States all have the same experience and, in some cases, even worse experience, but the competition, the choices, just aren't there because the system doesn't work.  We have 115 counties in our State, and in 97 of them, you have one choice; you have one insurer offering insurance. That one insurer may offer three different plans, but there is no competition for whatever level you are shopping for. There is only one place to get that level. This would be as if there is one shoe store in town and none of the shoes fit and they all cost too much, but if you didn't buy the shoes in that shoe store--and the chairman of the Budget Committee knows a lot about shoe stores--you would have to pay a penalty for not buying shoes that were available at that one location. Everybody would think: Well, that is unacceptable; you ought to at least be able to drive to another community and look for shoes. But that is not the case in 97 places, 97 counties. The vast majority of our State and a couple of States have no counties on the individual exchange that have competition. We went from several--every county a year ago in Missouri had at least two companies offering insurance, so there was at least a competitor. Some had more than two companies offering insurance. Now 97 have one company.  The promise was to bend the cost curve. The cost curve bent, but it bent the wrong way. The cost curve went up; it didn't go down. In our State, again, increased premiums have been as high as 40 percent.  In a number of States, they are in the 70-percent category. In one State, there is a 100-percent increase--not from when ObamaCare started but from last year--in places where the cost of insurance for individuals and families had too often already doubled, and now another add-on.  I was with somebody the other day, and I asked them about their insurance. He was a healthy guy in his mid-40s. His wife and two daughters were healthy. I said: What are you doing for insurance?  He said: I am self-employed. In 2009, there were four of us. We had insurance we thought met our needs. We were paying $300 a month. Now we are paying $1,190 a month, and we have a $7,500 deductible. If two of us are sick, we have to submit that deductible twice before we get any assistance from the insurance company--a $15,000 deductible if two people in the family are sick with a $1,190 monthly premium.  This is a family that had no health care problems. This is not a response to somebody who has a policy that they were using. This is a policy that wasn't being used and, of course, with a $7,500 deductible unlikely to be used unless that family really has a catastrophic situation occur. What I believe that family found out a few months after I visited with them was that their policy went up closer to $2,000 than $1,190.  The average deductible for a mid-level plan--there are the gold plan, silver plan, the bronze plan. For the silver plan, the average deductible in the exchange last year was $3,000. The average deductible in the bronze plan was $5,000, and it is higher than that for many people.  To make matters worse, if you aren't able to afford the few options available on the exchange, you pay a penalty. So you have no competition. You are required to buy the product, and if you don't buy the product, there is a penalty. It could have been as much this year as $2,045, but if your option is to pay $15,000 or $20,000 for insurance that has this high deductible, that is what many people have decided to do.  I have heard a lot of Missourians from the day this was initiated through today talking about the individual challenges they have seen. For[[Page S85]]example, Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, said that the premiums for his employees have doubled. Why would that be the case? One, the standards necessary for a policy change and, two, if you're losing all this money in the individual marketplace, the insurance companies make that up somewhere. So his premiums have doubled. At the same time, they have continually had to raise deductibles and seriously reduce benefits. The cost goes up and the coverage goes down. I think that is what President Clinton said when he said this is a crazy system. It is costing more all the time and covering less. That is what Dave has found out in his business, and he was told late last year that he should expect a 40-percent increase this year. He said: If that happens another time, we are no longer in the employee-employer provided insurance marketplace.  Another location that serves our State and happens to be headquartered also in Columbia is the Older Americans Transportation System, a not-for-profit. They provide critical transportation services to older Missourians, and they have it other places in the country--older Missourians to low-income people, to underserved parts of our State that don't have other transportation options. The costs to insure their drivers have gone up by half a million dollars. The paperwork to comply with the law's requirements, as the executive director told me, is so complex and cumbersome, they had to spend additional money to hire a consultant to implement a software program to help them keep up with the new mandates. It suddenly got even harder to be a not-for-profit and break even.  Families and small businesses shouldn't be penalized because the law did not live up to its promise: If you like your health care, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Family costs will go down by $2,500 after this plan is put in place. Those things didn't happen.  We are in a chaotic situation now, and it is time to move in a new direction. We will have a bill before us very shortly that will allow us to begin that transition to do things that will prevent Washington from getting in between health care providers and their patients. We will do things that will break down barriers that artificially restrict choice and prevent Americans from picking insurance that meets their family's needs that they can still pay for. What a concept that would be.  This is basically the system we had before. It wasn't a perfect system, and I will say the biggest straw man put forward in that system was that nobody else had any ideas. There were plenty of other ideas, ideas that would better serve American families, American job creators, American job holders, people--plans that would have allowed small businesses to band together and become a bigger group to seek group insurance for a number of businesses instead of just one business's health savings account, better use of health savings accounts, buying across State lines, and things that I proposed specifically on letting your family stay on your insurance a little bit longer. Frankly, that was a 4-page bill that adds 3 million people to insurance every year so you can stay on your family policy until you are 26. There are four pages with a lot of white space. This does not have to be that complicated. There is no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, you are adding young, healthy people, not much cost to anybody but fundamentally no cost to taxpayers. It is just an additional way to look at things like buying insurance across State lines would be. There are solutions here, but we have been prevented from moving to those solutions.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that will allow us to move forward. We will begin to eliminate the chaos of ObamaCare and restore the focus of health care to patients, people, the doctors they want to have, and the places they want to go to get their health care.

I have a deep belief that this is a body that can do good things for the American people. We don't always agree, and too many things are not getting done, but I have seen this body at its best. I have seen our ability to rise to the occasion. Along the way, I have made friendships and found respect for people and my colleagues across the aisle, as well as fellow  I have witnessed occasions where Members of both parties have put principle before partisanship and evidenced a willingness to actually embrace personal political risk to stand up for what they believe is right and honorable and in the best interest of our country. Given this, this is a day in which I rise with painful disappointment. Frankly, I feel a deep sense of astonishment and even a sense of crisis. Thus, I feel a deepened determination to fight with everything I have against the efforts of my Republican colleagues that I believe will harm our country as a whole but particularly the most vulnerable people in our country.  This is about the Republican push, really the race--what I believe is a reckless race--to repeal the Affordable Care Act without putting forth any legislation, any proposal, any plan on how they intend to replace it. This is fundamentally dangerous, and it will hurt millions of I have heard over the past month people rightfully saying: Well, this is how the Affordable Care Act was implemented.  I understand the frustrations that have resulted from that, and people think this was jammed through along partisan lines many years ago using similar legislative tactics. The truth is, that is simply not the case. The Affordable Care Act went through a long and arduous process and received input from doctors, nurses, patient groups, medical specialists, medical professionals of all types.  The Affordable Care Act started with listening sessions, then hearings, then came the advice and counsel of policy experts, businesses, market experts, insurance companies, health nonprofits, hospitals--literally thousands and thousands of people over thousands of hours, often through public discourse, putting forth ideas that actually shaped and changed legislation. I wasn't in the body then. I was a mayor in Newark, NJ, but I know this occupied months of debate.  Years later, Republicans are seeking to undo this work with a kind of plan to move forward. They are saying that they have a plan, but no plan exists.  I am a big believer that there are things we can and we must do to improve health care in America, to improve the Affordable Care Act, but what I have to make clear is that it is profoundly irresponsible to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not put anything in place. There is no plan.  This is at a time that everyone agrees--people in the Republican Party and Democratic Party continue to talk about the achievements of the Affordable Care Act, things that they want to maintain, things they believe make a real difference. Those are things I have heard Republicans praise and even say again they want to protect. These things are making a lifesaving difference for millions of  Let's be clear. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that we should not give the power back to insurance companies to deny people health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Let's be clear. Most people believe that we should allow young people, young adults to stay on their parents' plans up to the age of 26.[[Page S100]]We also believe that requiring health plans cover preventive services is a profoundly important thing to do for individuals in this country, but it actually saves Americans money by pushing people to do preventive care--mammograms, birth control, and mental health care--without cost sharing. These are logical things that the majority of Americans believe in, such as closing the prescription drug coverage gap, which too many seniors on Medicare and people with disabilities have had to face, known as that doughnut hole. We believe in prohibiting insurance companies from charging women more money simply because of their gender. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe in requiring the insurance companies to spend more on patient care and less on administrative costs, and the insurance companies shouldn't be allowed to gouge the American people while making massive profits at the same time.  There is so much that people believe in and want to have preserved, and these are tremendous things for There are bank account savings; there are lifesaving policies, all of which are popular with Democrats, Republicans, and They are popular with people on both sides of the aisle in this body.  Some Republicans have said that what they are doing will not threaten these accomplishments, but this couldn't be any further from the truth. The way they are going about this puts the health care system in a perilous position. The health care system is complicated in nuance, and to think you can repeal something without replacing it right away shows a lack of understanding of what is going to happen and what the consequences will be.  What the Republicans are doing now is quite contrary to what the Democrats did before the ACA passed in 2010. Republicans are not putting forth a proposal. They are not speaking to the health care needs of all They are not inviting professionals from all different backgrounds to help shape a plan for They are not even fulfilling what I heard countless Republicans on the campaign trail, including our President-elect, say: They would repeal and then replace. They are just not replacing.  The replace part put forth by the mantra of many Republicans has not materialized. It doesn't exist. There is no plan to replace, no statement of principles, no outline of features, no framework for a plan, no explanation of how they would pay for the things they claim they like. There is no specific timeline for when a plan might materialize or even any substantive hint of what many Republican colleagues plan on doing to address the crisis--the crisis that will surely come as a result of repealing the Affordable Care Act without giving forth any replacement.  I say time and again: Show us the plan before you repeal this legislation. If you do not do that, you will be responsible for pain, suffering, chaotic markets, and for many Americans' health care problems. There are many people who don't understand this. They listen to the political rhetoric, and they think: Hey, you might be that one who, if you are wealthy enough or secure enough, if you are a Member of this body, in fact, this concept of repealing and maybe figuring out a replacement down the road might sound good. But if you are one illness away from bankruptcy, if you know and remember the challenges of having a child with a preexisting condition, if you know that one injury, one unexpected fall could place your family in peril but for the insurance you have, if you are one of the 20 million Americans who used to be uninsured and now you have insurance, you know how perilous this moment is. You know that you can't afford the recklessness of any politician--a Republican move that equates to jumping off a cliff and then packing your parachute on the way down.  Repealing without replacing is simply irresponsible, it is dangerous, and it is threatening to our country's well-being. People--families, children, the elderly--will suffer.  This is a moment where we need Republican leaders to tell the truth and say: We want to improve our health care system. We may not believe in ObamaCare, but we can't tear it down unless we do the responsible thing and put forth a replacement.  Right now, what we have is political rhetoric that is not just rhetoric. It is perilous. It is dangerous. It is threatening to our This will inflict immediate catastrophe upon families, causing millions to lose their health insurance, and it will unleash chaos with market uncertainty and cost spikes.  There is no defense for what is being done. I don't understand it. There is no logic here whatsoever. Elections were won. You now have the floor and the ability to put forth your great vision for health care in America, but doing it backward and repealing something and not offering up a plan is truly putting politics before people. This is a move of grand political theater that comes with profound public consequences affecting millions.  As a Democratic Senator, some people will say that this is just political rhetoric, but these are not just partisan words. This is the truth and don't take my word for it. Look at the words of other more thoughtful--other very thoughtful people, Democrats and Republicans, businesspeople and nonprofit leaders, conservative think tanks and nonpartisan groups, speaking with a chorus to the point I am making. Experts across sectors, across industries, and across the country are taking a hard look at what a repeal will mean for the American people without a replacement. People from all across sectors of our country are saying what the Republicans are doing is reckless, and the consequences are dire.  Take the American Medical Association, the preeminent association of physicians. Mind you, this is an organization that opposed the enactment of the Affordable Care They have urged--this chorus of doctors has urged that ``before any action is taken, policymakers should lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what will replace current policies. Patients and other stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy to new proposals so they can make informed decisions.''  The American Medical Association isn't a political organization. They are thoughtful people whose fundamental concern is the doctors in this Nation and the health care of the people. Another respected organization representing American hospitals made it clear. The American Hospital Association warned that Republican action of repealing without a plan would result in an ``unprecedented health care crisis.''  Are Republicans listening to doctors and hospitals or are they rushing forth, willing to risk a crisis for our country, and for what? They are a President for 4 years, a Congress for 2. What is the rush to put forth a plan and just repeal? Will they listen to these experts? What about the president of America's leading cancer group, the American Cancer Society? Will they listen to them? They urge Congress to ``consider the future of the Affordable Care It is critically important that cancer patients, survivors and those at risk of the disease don't face any gap in coverage of prevention or treatment. . . . Delaying enactment of a replacement for 2 or 3 years could lead to the collapse of the individual health market with long-term consequences.''  This organization is respected by people on both sides of the aisle and is not playing partisan games. They are calling out the truth; that it is a reckless Republican move to repeal without replacing. Will Republicans listen to the American Diabetes Association? Folks with diabetes are Independents, Republicans, and Democrats, and this is an organization respected by people on both sides of the aisle. They say:       The Association strongly opposes going back to a time when      . . . treatment for preexisting conditions like diabetes      could be excluded from coverage; when people could find their      insurance coverage was no longer available just when they      needed it most.  What is the Republican plan to address these concerns and to pay for these concerns? Will they listen to private businesspeople? They, too, join in the chorus of Americans urging that Republicans not endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions.  The Main Street We all have main streets in our States and our communities. A group representing these small businesses from across the country urges lawmakers to consider the devastating effect a repeal without[[Page S101]]replace would have on small businesses:       Small business owners depend on healthy and vibrant      communities to keep us profitable in the engines of economic      growth. . . . Changes to our current health care system are      needed, but not in the form of cuts to critical programs or      through taking away our health coverage.  There are some Senators who are speaking out. It is not the entire Republican caucus. There are some who are saying exactly what I am saying. Yet we are still rushing toward a vote, even with Republican Senators having the courage to stand up. Just yesterday Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, before voting to proceed to this measure, said: ``It is imperative that Republicans do a replacement simultaneous to a repeal.'' I respect my Republican colleague for saying what is common sense and speaking up against the reckless actions being taken by the Republican Party as a whole, and some fellow Republican Senators have joined him in similar statements, including Lamar Alexander, the chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions The Republican from Tennessee, who noted in an interview in November 2016 that when it comes to the ACA, ``what we need to focus on first''--Senator Alexander said--``is what would we replace it with and what are the steps that it would take to do that?''  Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine shared in an interview last month that she was ``concerned about the speed in which this is occurring'' and expressed concern over what would happen to her constituents in Maine who had signed up for insurance through the ACA, saying: ``You just can't drop insurance for 84,000 people in my State.''  I not only talk about Republicans in this body, but there are conservative think tanks focused on our country that are speaking out now as well. The American Enterprise Institute said in a 2015 report that ``repealing the law without a plausible plan for replacing it would be a mistake.''  So here we have it from all over the country, people across the political spectrum, experts, market analysts, insurance executives, doctors, nurses, hospital leaders, patient groups; these people in our country who are beyond politics and even beyond their opinions of the Affordable Care Act when it was enacted are now speaking in a chorus of conviction in one voice: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act without a clear plan to preserve the things that are making America healthier and more financially strong and secure. Don't recklessly rush into a politically motivated move that would endanger the health care of millions of Americans, increase the costs for millions of Americans, throw insurance markets into chaos, endanger our hospitals' financial stability, and put our most vulnerable Americans into crisis: our seniors, people in nursing homes, retired coal miners, people recovering from drug addiction, the poor and other underserved communities.  We are America, and this is a time that we must call, not to party rhetoric but to who we are and what we stand for. We cannot let this repeal without replacement happen. We must know what the Republican plan is so experts, market analysts, insurance folks, doctors, everyone understands what will happen. Americans will be hurt. It is time to put our country and the people first. There is no rush. The voters gave this body 2 years. It gave the Presidency 4 years. We must now fight these efforts. We must resist. We must call to the conscience of neighbors and appeal to the moral compasses of our Republican leaders to do what they said they would do--put forth your plan. Let the American people know what they are going to do and do not thrust millions of your fellow country men and women off a cliff and shout promises to them as they fall: ``Hey, don't worry. We will figure something out before you hit the ground.'' Where is the honor in that strategy? Call the public together, gather your experts, put forth a thoughtful process, and develop what you think is better, what improves upon what we have now, what doesn't diminish our unassailable gains that we have had but build upon them. Give us a plan, not empty promises. Give America hope. Don't plunge millions into despair and uncertainty. Show decency, not costly craven politics. We know who we are as a country. Profound are the words, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among . . . `'  This government, this body, the United States Senate, led by Republicans here and in the House and in the White House, must stand for these ideals. Health care is critical to life. We must stand for these ideals. Health care is critical to liberty, our freedom from fear, our freedom from illness, our freedom from deprivation. We must stand for these principles. Health care is critical to the happiness, the joy, the greatness of To secure these rights, governments are instituted, and we were elected to stand for the American people, by the American people, to fight to defend our brothers and sisters. This government and actors must put our ideals first, not partisanship and not theater. Do not attack these ideals through a rash and reckless repeal. Be thoughtful. Be kind. Be magnanimous. The well-being of our Nation is in the balance.  May God bless us in this time of crisis. May wisdom prevail over politics.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

6002,topic-id,564,"Madam President, I join literally millions of Ohioans and tens of millions of Americans in my concern about what the House of Representatives is trying to do to our healthcare laws and our healthcare system.  I leave just one statistic with my colleagues in the Senate, and that is that in my State alone, there are 200,000 people who are now under treatment for opioid addiction, and they are able to get this comprehensive treatment because they have insurance under the Affordable Care  The legislation apparently coming out of the House of Representatives, even though we do not know how much it costs, is a big tax cut for the wealthy. We do not know how much it costs because they are moving so quickly. It was under wraps, and now they are moving it so quickly that the Congressional Budget Office has not even had time to look at it and understand what it costs, nor has it been able to tell us how many of the 22 million Americans who have insurance under the Affordable Care Act will lose their insurance. They want to move so fast that they are not even answering the basic questions of how much it costs--a lot; how much it is going to add to the deficit--a whole lot, but they will not be specific; and how many people will lose their insurance.  As I said, today 200,000 Ohioans are getting treatment for opioid addiction under the Affordable Care Most of them--we think at least half, but tens of thousands of them will lose their treatment just like that, right in the middle of their addiction treatment. What does society gain by that, other than some Republican talking points, when people chanted for 6 years ``repeal and replace ObamaCare,'' never having any idea how they were going to replace it--still don't--to do it right and continue that effort.  Finally, there is the hypocrisy of this, where Members of Congress in the House and in the Senate enjoy taxpayer-financed health insurance. People in this body--most of the 100 Senators and most of the 435 Congressmen and Congresswomen--have health insurance provided by taxpayers, yet they want to take insurance away from millions of These are people who have jobs. They are millions of Americans who have jobs, who are making relatively low wages. Some of them may be holding two or three part-time jobs. They make low wages. They have no health insurance provided at their job. People in Congress who have taxpayer-funded health insurance are taking their insurance away, stripping them of that insurance. How morally repugnant that is. How hypocritical that is. Yet they move along their merry way.  We should defeat these efforts. We should continue to make improvements in the Affordable Care Act, but not wholesale destruction that will throw hundreds of thousands of Ohioans off of the insurance they have.  I will close with this. My Republican Governor has admonished his Republican colleagues around the country and in Congress not to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw 900,000 people in Ohio off of their insurance without a replacement to take care of it. This bill coming out of the House is far from an adequate replacement.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.

6257,topic-id,3679,"Mr.President, first I want to thank Senator Durbin for his comments about the policy of repealing the Affordable Care Act and not knowing what comes next, the impact it is going to have on people from I am going to talk about people in I have received similar letters showing that people are going to be adversely impacted.  I want to share with my colleagues the conversation I had with the secretary of health from Maryland has Governor Hogan, a Republican Governor, and his secretary of health met with me several weeks ago to express his concerns about the impact on the people of my State of Maryland if the Affordable Care Act were repealed. What I heard from the secretary of health of Maryland was similar to what I heard from many of the health care stakeholders from the hospital association to physician groups, to health care advocates, to ordinary Marylanders who have contacted me about their concerns about what happens if we see a repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me just give you some examples of how the Affordable Care Act is working in my State and, as Senator Durbin indicated, in his The uninsured rate in Maryland has dropped from 12.9 percent to 6.6 percent. That is about a 50-percent drop in the uninsured rate. That benefits all Marylanders--all Yes, 400,000 Marylanders now have health coverage who didn't have health coverage before, and for those 400,000, that is a big deal. That means they can see a doctor and get a physical examination. If they are ill, they can get treated and know there are doctors and hospitals that will want to take care of them because they have third-party reimbursement. They[[Page S77]]no longer have to show up in emergency rooms because that is the only place they could get to. They can now go to a doctor and get a physical examination.  Mr.President, it benefits more than just those 400,000 Marylanders, who, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, have health coverage. It affects all Marylanders because we no longer have the amount of cost shifting of those who have health insurance paying for those who don't have health insurance because they use the system and don't pay for it. That dislocation has been dramatically changed in my So all Marylanders are benefiting from having 400,000 Marylanders who now have health coverage, but it goes beyond that. Many Marylanders who had health insurance didn't have adequate health insurance. They had restrictions on preexisting conditions. They had caps on their policies. It didn't cover preventive health care. They now have quality health coverage.  All of that is at risk. All of that is at risk because of what we are talking about doing, if I understand correctly. Quite frankly, I am still trying to figure out what the Republicans are doing to the Affordable Care Act, but if I understand it, they are going to repeal it, and they are not going to tell us right now how they are going to replace it. So everything that is included in the Affordable Care Act is at risk.  I will give you one more example of costs because I think this is an important point. Under the Affordable Care Act, if an insurance company wants to increase rates more than 10 percent, there are certain procedures they have to go through, certain public disclosures. We have a much more public process, but the number of claims of those who wanted to increase their policies by 10 percent have dropped from 75 percent before the Affordable Care Act to now 14 percent nationally. We have seen one of the lowest growth rates in health care costs in modern history. Yes, the Affordable Care Act has helped us do that. Why? Because individuals who had insurance now have coverage for preventive health care and are saving us money. Those who didn't have health care coverage now have health care coverage, and they are seeing doctors, and they are saving us money because if they have a disease, it is being caught at an earlier stage, being treated in a more aggressive way, and they are saving more intensive health care costs. All that is benefiting the people of Maryland and our country.  Senator Durbin mentioned several people in his State--a person in his State--and letters. I want to talk about people in Maryland whom I have talked to over the last several years about the impact of the Affordable Care Act and why they are so concerned about the policy now of repealing the Affordable Care  I want to go back to 2007. That is a date that Marylanders know very well. I want to go back to a 12-year-old, Deamonte Deamonte Driver was a 12-year-old who lived about 10 miles from here. His mom tried to get him to a dentist, but he had no insurance coverage, and she couldn't find a dentist. She couldn't find a dentist who would take care of him. Deamonte Driver needed about $80 of oral health care. He had an abscessed tooth that needed to be removed. It would have cost $80, and he couldn't find care in 2007 in the wealthiest country, in As a result, his tooth became abscessed and it went into his brain. He had thousands of dollars of health care costs, and he lost his life. As a result of that incident, I, along with other members of Congress, took up the cause of pediatric dental care to make sure every child in America has access to pediatric dental care. That is included in the Affordable Care Act as an essential health benefit.  Before the Affordable Care Act, very few health policies included pediatric dental; therefore, families were at risk as to whether they would actually use dental services because they did not have the money to pay for them. That was changed under the Affordable Care That is at risk. That is at risk because, if I understand what is being suggested here, we are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the essential health benefits. We can't allow any more tragedies like Deamonte Driver in America, and yet we will be putting our children at risk if we repeal the Affordable Care  There was another provision I worked very hard to get into the Affordable Care Act that I think is extremely important. We now have a National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of We have agencies that deal with minority health and health disparities in all of our health care agencies thanks to the Affordable Care That means we are now acknowledging that historically we have not done right for minority health in We looked at a lot of the research dollars; they were not spent in areas that minorities were impacted by. We see that access to care in certain communities is much more challenging because of minority status. We are looking at these issues and taking action.  The Institute sponsored a study in my home city of That study showed that depending on what ZIP Code you live in, your life expectancy could be as different as 30 years--a generation. Just your ZIP We are taking steps to change that in Baltimore thanks to the National Institutes and the Institute on Minority Health and Health Are the Republicans telling us that is not needed anymore, that we are going to repeal our efforts to look at minority health and health disparities? That is unconscionable. Yet, if I understand correctly, that is the course we are going to follow.  Mental health parity is another area we have talked about at great length here. We know we still have not reached that goal to make sure mental health receives the same attention as any other health need, but in the Affordable Care Act, we did amazing things to expand access to coverage for mental health and drug addiction. By expanding the Medicaid population, we have 1.6 million Americans who now have expanded coverage for mental health and substance abuse.  We have had great discussions in this body. I am very proud of the Cures Act, where we expanded coverage for drug addiction. Now Republicans are talking about taking a major step backward by repealing Medicaid expansion that allows access to coverage for mental health and drug addiction. To me, that is something that is unthinkable. Yet we are moving on that path by the legislation that is before us.  Let me share a letter I received from Lillian from In 2008 she lost her job. She has a history of abnormal mammograms. She could not get coverage. She could not get an insurance company to cover her because of the preexisting concerns. She wrote: The Affordable Care Act has worked. I have coverage.  No preexisting conditions. No longer is being a woman considered a preexisting condition in Are we now going to turn our backs on the women of America and allow these discriminatory practices that existed before the Affordable Care Act to come back? I will tell you, I am going to fight to do everything I can to make sure that does not happen, and I would hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the same. But you are marching down a path that puts women at risk, that puts Americans at risk.  We know about the caps that were in the law before the Affordable Care What do I mean by caps? That is the maximum amount your health insurance policy will pay you. Some 2.25 million Marylanders had caps on their policies before the Affordable Care Act--not just the 400,000 new people who have come into the system, 2.25 million Marylanders will be impacted if we eliminate the protection against arbitrary caps.  The tragedy about caps is that when you really need coverage, that is when you are impacted. You get insurance to cover you. You discover you have cancer. It is extremely expensive to treat cancer in an aggressive way. All of a sudden, you are in the middle of treatment and you reach your cap. What do you do? What do you do? There are real, live examples from before we passed the Affordable Care We are going to go back to those days in the United States of America? That is what repealing the Affordable Care Act means for 2.25 million Marylanders who are being put at risk.  Rebecca from Baltimore told me about her daughter Eva, who is 18 months of age and has severe congenital heart defects and has gone[[Page S78]]through numerous operations. If caps are in place, she cannot get adequate care for her 18-month-old daughter. Those are real, live examples of people who are impacted by the Affordable Care She also told me: Thank you for the 26-year-old provision where you can stay on your parent's policy. At least she knows Eva will be able to stay on her policy until she is 26.  I heard from Nichole, who is a 22-year-old student at Towson She could not get affordable health coverage and was able to stay on her parents' policy. That is an important provision which is being repealed by the Affordable Care  I helped work on the provision in the Affordable Care Act that provides preventive care coverage--immunizations, cancer screening, contraception, no cost sharing. That saves money. Preventive health care saves money. It makes our health care system more cost-effective. That is why we decided to put a focus on preventive health care and expand it dramatically. Now, 2.95 million Marylanders benefit from the preventive health care requirements of the Affordable Care Act that is included in every health policy. That will be repealed, if I understand correctly what the Republicans are attempting to do on their repeal of the Affordable Care We don't have a replacement. We don't know what it is going to look like. It is not easy to figure out how to put the pieces back together again.  There is a provision in the Affordable Act that deals with prevention and public health funds and that provides dollars to deal with some of the real challenges we have out there--obesity, tobacco abuse. My State is getting funds so that we can deal with healthy eating that will not only provide a better quality of life for those who have weight issues but also lead to a more cost-effective health care system. That will be gone with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me talk for a moment about health centers because I know we made that a priority in the Affordable Care Qualified health centers are centers that are located in, in many cases, challenging communities where it is hard to get doctors and hospitals to locate. We provide access to care for people who have limited means. The Affordable Care Act did two things that are extremely important in regard to health centers. First, it provided some significant new direct resources for those programs. Secondly, because they are in challenging neighborhoods, they have a much higher number of people who have no health coverage who go into these centers; therefore, their third-party reimbursement is much lower than other health centers that are located in better neighborhoods or more affluent neighborhoods.  The Affordable Care Act has worked in expanding dramatically the capacities of these qualified health centers. We have 18 that are located in I could talk about all of them, but I have been to the Greater Baden Medical Services center several times. It is located in Prince George's They also have a center in Mary's I have been to them many times. I have seen their new facilities thanks to the Affordable Care I have seen the building in which they provide mental health services and pediatric dental care and actually adult dental care also. They provide those services to the community thanks to the Affordable Care They told me that in the very first year alone of the Affordable Care Act, they were able to reduce their uninsured rates by 20 percent, meaning they get a lot more money coming in and they can provide many more services. All of that will be gone if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. I can't be silent about that. This center is providing incredible services. It is one thing to have third-party coverage; it is another thing to have access to care. We provided both in the Affordable Care We are not going to go back.  I heard Senator Durbin talk about I just want to underscore this. This is not just about those under 65. It is about our seniors. It is about those on disability who are covered by  We heard about the doughnut hole. We all understood. We were getting numerous letters from people who fell into that doughnut hole. Guess what. Those letters are tailing off dramatically. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act closes the doughnut hole for prescription drug coverage. In my own State of Maryland, 80,000 Marylanders benefited in 2014 from the Affordable Care Act and better coverage for prescription drugs, amounting to $82 million, averaging over $1,000 per beneficiary benefit. Those over 65 have better coverage for prescription drugs. You repeal the Affordable Care Act, and all of a sudden seniors figure out they have to pay another thousand dollars a year for prescription drugs. In my State, they don't have the money to do that. You are going to again hear about prescription drugs left on the counter at the pharmacy because of the repeal.  Guess what. It even does more than that. The Affordable Care Act provided greater solvency for the Medicare system. I have heard my Republican colleagues say: We are not going to do anything to hurt Repealing the Affordable Care Act hurts It hurts the coverage and it hurts the solvency. I don't want to be part of that. I would hope my colleagues don't want to be part of that. Yet repealing the Affordable Care Act does that.  Let me talk for a moment about affordability. It is one thing to have coverage; it is another thing whether you can afford that coverage. We heard all of these stories about the increased premiums, and we know, of course, that insurance premiums in America have gone up at a slower growth rate than they did before the Affordable Care That is a fact. But we do hear about the individual market within the exchanges and how that has gone up by a significant amount, mainly because of the way it was originally rated. We have heard about that. But perhaps what many people don't know is that in my State and around the Nation, 75 percent of the people who qualify for private health insurance within the exchanges are eligible for credits. In other words, we are helping them with the affordability of their health care. In my State, that was $200 million a year to help Marylanders pay for health insurance. That will be gone with the repeal of this Affordable Care That is wrong.  I received many letters from small business owners. One of the proud parts of the Affordable Care Act is that it helped our small business owners. Why? If you ran a small business, you wanted health insurance for your employees because you wanted to keep them well. You were discriminated against before the Affordable Care You didn't have a big pool. God forbid one of your employees gets really sick during the year; your insurance premium goes through the roof. That is what was happening before the passage of the Affordable Care Are we going to go back to the days where we tell small companies: You really can't get health insurance because if someone gets sick, you lose your policies basically. That is what we are talking about.  Annette of Bel Air, MD, wrote to me. She said she has saved significant money as a small business owner as a result of the Affordable Care Tim from Laurel, MD, told me that in his small business, he saved $7,000 a year thanks to the Affordable Care The reason is simple: You have broader pools, and you get the same type of rates larger companies get now. You will lose that with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Let me tell you about one of the tragedies of this that will happen immediately, affecting America's competitiveness and entrepreneur spirit. We know that a lot of people who work for big companies have great ideas, and they want to start out on their own. I have seen that over and over again in the biotech industries of I go down the 270 corridor, the 95 corridor. I see small entrepreneurs who used to work for one of the giant defense contractors, and now they are pulling out and coming up with new ideas, doing things in a great way. That is what makes America a great nation. That is how we create jobs and how we deal with innovation.  Here is the situation. You are a 30-something-year-old, ready to leave that company and go out on your own. Your spouse has cancer. What do you do? You are not going to be able to get coverage. You are locked into that job. That will be a consequence of the repeal of the Affordable Care We are[[Page S79]]dealing with real people and real people's lives. It is irresponsible to repeal the Affordable Care Act and not tell that young entrepreneur what he or she can expect. That is what is at stake.  There is one last point I want to talk about, and that is the Patients' Bill of I helped draft the Patients' Bill of It was not easy to pass the Patients' Bill of We were able to get it in the Affordable Care We were able to get in the right that--you go to an emergency room. Under a prudent layperson standard, you did the right thing. You find out you didn't have that heart attack even though you had chest pains. Then you wake up the next morning and find out your insurance company is not paying the bill because you didn't have that heart attack. We changed that in the Affordable Care  Are we going back, eliminating those protections, the right to appeal decisions or are we going to repeal that part of the Affordable Care Act? Are we going to go back to medical loss ratios, where insurance companies can make obscene profits and not rebate those excess profits to their policyholders when we have millions of people receiving rebates today? All of that is gone with the repeal of the Affordable Care  Mr.President, I could go on and on, but I see my colleague Senator Kaine is here and others who want to speak on this issue.  Let me conclude with this. This is the wrong way to go about this. I heard the leader say that for 6 or 7 years--for 6 or 7 years--Democrats have been trying to work with Republicans to make the law even better.  We have never passed a major law that didn't need to be revisited. We understand that. We have been working to try to improve the law--not repeal it--improve it, build on it, make it better, and we have gotten no help from Republicans, not any help whatsoever.  Republicans have blocked efforts to improve this law. Instead, they are stuck on this repeal without knowing what the replacement is going to be. That is wrong. We should be working together to improve our health care system, but to pass a repeal, to put Americans at risk will lead to uncertainty, which will lead to insurance companies abandoning the market, giving consumers less choice rather than more choice. To hurt millions of Americans is wrong, and I urge my colleagues to reject this approach.  I yield the floor.

6273,topic-id,603,"It is great to see my friend from Kansas on the floor and looking forward to serving the next 6 years.  One of the things I focused on as a member of the Finance Committee on the Affordable Care Act was the idea that we have doctors, hospitals, and nurses who in some cases provide entirely too many tests and procedures and so forth that are needed to treat somebody just in order to cover--as Naval aviation used to say--our 6 o'clock. You didn't want to have somebody come up from behind you to shoot you down. So we talked about covering our 6 o'clock. Doctors, hospitals, and nurses spend a lot of time covering the 6 o'clock, as my friend knows.  I am an Ohio State boy. I am going to say something nice about Michigan, which is really out of character here. In Michigan, the University of Michigan Medical School and hospital came up with a policy called Sorry If a doctor, hospital, or nurse made a mistake that adversely affected a patient, they apologized. The idea was to apologize, make up for it, make them whole, help them get well, cover their financial costs and so forth. It is called Sorry It is a good idea.  I met a guy who is a doctor and a lawyer--a Republican--from Illinois who took the idea of Sorry Works and he put it on steroids and they called it Seven It has been a great example of what actually works to reduce the incidents of medical mistakes in hospitals and nursing homes and also to get better health care outcomes. You reduce medical malpractice costs, and you also get more satisfaction from the patient side.  We have taken that idea in Delaware--Seven Pillars--at Christiana Care, which is the big health care delivery system in our We have taken that and have begun to incorporate it in the way they work. If I am your doctor and you are my patient and I perform a procedure on you, if you are harmed or hurt--not your fault, my fault--the idea is I apologize. I meet with you privately--no lawyers--and apologize for what has happened and try to make you whole. If you lost wages, if you have pain and suffering, they pay your health care costs and make you whole. Don't hide it. Don't put it under the rug but take full acceptance, responsibility. That is one of the approaches being used to try to deal with medical malpractice costs. I think it is a good one. It is not the only good one, but it is one.  I happened to be walking through the Chamber and heard my friend speaking, and I thought I would share that with you, with everyone.  When I was Governor of Delaware, we used to meet with my We would be talking about a particular problem or challenge we faced in I would say to my Cabinet: Some other State or some other Governor has actually addressed this issue. They figured out how to deal with this this. Our challenge is to find out what works and do more of that and to see if it can be transferred to  Sorry Works is a Michigan idea. It morphed into Seven Pillars in Illinois, and now it is being incorporated in my own little State in our big health care delivery system. It is something that works. I am not sorry that it works. I am glad that it works, and I am happy to share it with my friend from Kansas and whoever else might be interested.  I yield.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,179,1715,2017.0,5.0,March
6275,topic-id,232,"Madam President, if I could speak through the  I failed to mention one thing about Sorry Works, Seven Pillars, and what we are doing in If we have that meeting between the patient who had been harmed, the physician and provider, and they have the need where there is an apology and an offer to try to make the patient whole--no attorneys involved--if the patient says no, I am not interested in doing that, nothing that is said in that conversation between the two of them can be used in a court of law, which I think is an interesting approach. We are anxious to see how it works over the next couple of years.  Ironically, I was probably the only Democrat--maybe the only member of the Finance Committee--who was trying to get included in the Affordable Care Act provisions dealing with medical malpractice. I had this idea--not to let a thousand flowers bloom or ideas like that--to figure out five or six good ideas and put them on steroids to see if they actually work on a larger scale. I could not get a cosponsor on the other side of the aisle, which blew my mind. It still does. I could never understand that. In the meantime, the ideas are starting to crop up and flourish, and, hopefully, we can find out what works and do more of that.  Thank you.

6277,topic-id,1912,"Madam President, I hear my Democratic colleagues praising I had to smile yesterday. I heard a colleague talking about how ObamaCare was addressing high pharmaceutical costs. I had to start laughing--and kind of a bitter laugh. Tell that to a senior who is paying $6,000 for her medicine, which before ObamaCare passed was a fraction of that.  We hear how great it is that ObamaCare has given so many people coverage. Say how great that coverage is to someone who has a $6,000 deductible--a $6,000 deductible--who does not have $400 in her checking account. There is a friend of mine--people don't believe it so I put it on my Facebook page. He got his quote for him and his wife. They are 60 and 61 years of age. Their premium for 1 year was $39,000, each of them with $6,000 deductibles. Again, it is on my Facebook page because otherwise no one would have believed me.  So when people speak about the affordable health care act, I have to laugh. If this is affordable, what would be unaffordable? We can clearly do better than this.  I begin this speech by calling into question my Democratic colleague's defense of ObamaCare, but we can have common ground. I applauded and still applaud the goals of those who support the Affordable Care They wish to have coverage for all. Now, that is important. For over 30 years, I have worked as a physician in a hospital for the uninsured. My medical practice has been geared toward bringing coverage, to bringing care to those who otherwise would not have it.  As I look at this issue, I have to thank them for their motivation but have to recognize that the Affordable Care Act has not achieved that in a way which most Americans find affordable. The other thing about ObamaCare is that it coerces It takes power from patients and States and gives it to Washington, DC, coercing the individual with mandates and penalties, taking away her right to choose. That is not where the American people wish to be.  I would like to believe Republicans and Democrats can find common ground. I have introduced a replacement plan that would give States the power. I am willing to concede, the minority leader believes that ObamaCare is working just fine in his State of New In my plan, we repeal ObamaCare on a Federal level, but if a State like California or New York thinks ObamaCare is working for them, God bless them.  Under my plan, a State legislature would have the right to stay on So here Congress would pass the legislation giving States the choice, and the State would either have the option we advance, which I think is superior--but when Republicans say that you can keep your health insurance if you wish, and we mean it, we mean it. If a State decided they wished to stay on ObamaCare, they could or if a State truly decides they want to have nothing at all to do with any of this, they can totally opt away from the Medicaid expansion, from any help for others in their State to purchase insurance, period.  I think this recognizes that if the minority leader wants to claim it is working in New York, they can keep it, but clearly ObamaCare is not working in some other We can talk about Arizona, where briefly a county did not have a single insurance company providing insurance and where premiums increased by as much as 100 percent. We can look at Louisiana, my State, where that quote I gave earlier--a fellow and his wife, $39,000 for 1 year's premium.  Clearly, ObamaCare markets are failing there. So let's repeal ObamaCare, give the States the power, allowing them to choose the system that will work for them. Now, health care cost is important. Under our bill, we make health care more affordable by giving the patient the choice, the power, if you will, of price transparency. Under ObamaCare, we have seen prices rise out of control. A lack of price transparency keeps providers from having to compete which takes away the consumer's power of choice.  You can see this power of choice price transparency. Fifteen years ago, LASIK surgery cost $1,000 an eye or $875 an eye, with more for astigmatism. Now you can drive down the street and you see a billboard--a billboard--that says: LASIK surgery $275 an eye. So over a period of time, when everything has increased, LASIK surgery has come down--the power of price transparency.  Another example I like to use is of a woman, a physician, went for her mammogram. She wanted to pay cash. They talked her out of it. We don't even know what to charge you.  I won't pay cash.  They billed her insurance company. She later found that if she had paid cash for her mammogram, it would have cost her $90. As it turns out, they billed the insurance company $500. Her deductible was $100. She was actually out $10 because they billed her insurance company. She should have known that price going into it.  One more example. If a doctor orders a CT scan, the cash price, according to an LA Times article a few years ago in the Los Angeles Basin, varied from $250 to $2,500. Unless you are an investigative reporter for the LA Times, able to call up and get that cash price, you otherwise would not know. I guess maybe it sometimes helps to have another example. Would anyone buy a car if they did not know the price of the car beforehand? Yet that is routinely done with health care.  Under the legislation I and Senator Collins have introduced in the Senate, and I and Pete Sessions have introduced in the House of Representatives, people will know what the cash price is. I have found, working in a hospital for the uninsured, that when you the give the patient the information and power they need to know to make the better decisions, you get better outcomes.  By the way, we have been told that Republicans don't have a plan. The plans I am speaking of now are drafted in legislative language--legislative language, again, that would repeal ObamaCare, put in price transparency, and return decisionmaking power to the patient. We should repeal the individual mandate, repeal the employer mandate, prevent the Federal Government, the long arm of the Federal Government from reaching into someone's household, forcing them to do something they don't wish to do.  There should be an alternative. Under both the World's Greatest Health Care Plan--the bill I introduced with Pete Sessions--or the Patient Freedom Act that I have Susan Collins as a cosponsor, we take all of the money a State would receive had they done the Medicaid expansion and those eligible to be signed up for the ObamaCare exchanges, and we give that money to the State to allow them to give tax credits to those who are eligible.  These tax credits could only be used for health insurance. If the patient did nothing, she would have a health savings account, catastrophic policy with a pharmacy benefit. She could use the health savings account as first-dollar coverage.  Now, under ObamaCare, $6,000 deductible. Under our plan, the patient has first-dollar coverage, so if her daughter has an earache and she takes her daughter to the urgent care center, she can cover that visit with a health savings account that would be funded with this credit. They also have catastrophic major medical coverage, so if they get in that car wreck, take them to the emergency room, sky-high pricing, they are protected from medical bankruptcy.  Under our replacement plan, we also give States the option to say that if someone in our State is eligible, they are automatically enrolled. I smile when I say that covers two populations, the person who may live under a park bench and does not have his life together to otherwise do it, and the other population would be my 22-year-old son and those like him, those young folks who never think they are going to get ill so they never sign up for insurance. Without them being in the pool, we end up with a sicker pool. That is what has happened with  By the way, it would be easy to imagine you could end up with 95 percent enrollment of those eligible should the State decide to go this way. The timeframe for our replacement would be simple. In year one, say 2017 Congress[[Page S91]]passes the enabling legislation, which in year 2018 allows the State to choose between these three options; in 2019, the State would implement the option it chooses; and by the end of 2019, we have made the transition from repeal to replace, to implementation.  Folks ask: Would I lose my coverage? I am a physician. I am going to give my perspective: a patient I might see who has breast cancer. She does not like She voted for Donald Trump, but she is on the bubble financially. She is not sure she can afford coverage, but she has breast cancer. As bad as ObamaCare is, at least she is getting some care.  Now she is having to put out all this money first, but still she is getting some care. If we keep her in the prism through which we look at this problem so that in the transition from ObamaCare to better coverage she continues to have her therapy, so at the end of this, not only does she have better coverage, but she has health and recovery from breast cancer, we have done our job. That is our Republican goal, to keep our prism as that woman who is vulnerable from a sickness she has now. In our transition, she does not lose coverage; she merely moves to better coverage.  I introduced the Patient Freedom Act with 12 Senate cosponsors in 2015 and then again teamed up with Representative Pete Sessions in 2016 to introduce the World's Greatest Health Care That is truly its name. Tom Price, our soon-to-be HHS Secretary, first introduced his Empowering Patients First Act to the House of Representatives in 2014. Speaker Paul Ryan, Representative Fred Upton, Senators Richard Burr, and Orrin Hatch have also outlined plans for comprehensive health care reform.  All of these plans create a new system that returns power of choice to patients and to Simple provisions as I have described such as health savings accounts, instituting free market values, if we put them into a replacement plan now, we will quickly have an effect upon millions. Republicans have worked hard to lay the groundwork to repeal and replace  President-elect Trump has said he wants repeal and replace to happen at the same time. He promised both. We should fulfill both promises. Our majority leader has said we can do a better job as Republicans covering more people. We have the principles, the ideas, and the plans ready to go so let's put them to use. We owe it to the American people to carry out that replacement now with a smooth transition so the insured population can grow without anyone losing coverage in the process.  Republicans are committed to creating and passing effective health care legislation to replace ObamaCare and to bring real coverage to all Now is the time to do so.

5998,topic-id,1583,"Mr.President, this week our colleagues in the House released a plan to clean up the mess left in the wake of the ObamaCare's failed promises. The bill known as the American Health Care Act represents the next step forward in keeping our promise to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which continues to fail Texans and folks all across the country.  Instead of helping more Americans and more Texans by providing more healthcare choices, ObamaCare has actually led to dwindling insurance options in a lot of counties across the country. In fact, it is estimated that almost 40 percent of counties in Texas have just one option on the exchange this year. It is hard to shop, it is hard to compare, and it is hard to get the benefits of competition when there is only one option because of  So that is actually the opposite of what the President and the advocates for the Affordable Care Act promised. That is what happens when government interferes with the market and[[Page S1658]]takes a one-size-fits-all approach to our Nation's healthcare. The fact of the matter is that the path that President Obama put us on is not sustainable. It is hurting families and burdening job creators and is taking a tremendous toll, and Americans are paying the price.  I know some of our colleagues across the aisle are relishing the fact that Republicans, the majority, are now taking this step to keep our commitment to repeal and replace They are sitting back and hoping that we fail. But the fact of the matter is that we would be having this debate no matter who won the Presidency last November 8, because ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode. It is unsustainable, and we would be dealing with our broken healthcare system no matter who won the White House on November 8 of last year.  One of my constituents wrote me earlier this year about her daughter. She said that before ObamaCare, back when she could choose the policy that she wanted, she was paying about $190 a month for health insurance, and she had a $500 deductible. Well, that sounds pretty reasonable--not great, but not terrible either. Then came Now her daughter, who unfortunately lost her job in the interim, must pay almost $400 a month with a deductible that is more than $6,000. I don't know many people who can write a check for $6,000 when they have an unexpected healthcare crisis. So in essence, she is being forced to self-insure and has been denied the benefit of even the insurance that she has, even though her premium has gone up more than double, and, of course, her deductible is now $6,000.  So to our friends across the aisle who seem to be relishing this moment where we are actually undertaking the hard work of working through a repeal and replacement program, I would say to them that ObamaCare is certainly no gold standard. It is the opposite of what we need to help our Nation's healthcare woes. There is no doubt that it is a failed piece of legislation, full of empty promises, and one we have to scrap.  So with the American Health Care Act, starting today in the House of Representatives, we will repeal ObamaCare and deliver better, more affordable healthcare choices to the American people.  This bill actually also improves That is another big part of what ObamaCare did. It forced more people onto Medicaid, which is frankly not the best quality healthcare insurance or coverage that exists.  I remember back during the ObamaCare debate, I actually introduced an amendment in the Finance Committee saying that if Congress passed ObamaCare, Members of Congress needed to be put on Medicaid--my theory being, not that it was such great coverage, but that if Members of Congress were on Medicaid, we sure would take every step necessary to actually improve it and make sure it works.  But this legislation actually does improve Medicaid and puts it on a sustainable path for the future by working with the Governors, because Medicaid is a shared Federal-State responsibility. But right now, it is growing by leaps and bounds. It is at the consumer medical inflation rate plus two, which means it is growing much faster than the economy and, unfortunately, putting unprecedented burdens on our State governments. For example, I know, talking to some Texas legislators, they said it is easily the second--and, if they weren't careful, the largest--expense item in the Texas State budget--Medicaid, or the State share of  Of course, Medicaid was designed to help the most vulnerable in our communities and enjoyed broad bipartisan support. Along the way, it became less about serving those who needed it and more about unchecked government spending, as I mentioned a moment ago. So what the American Health Care Act does is it actually puts Medicaid on a budget. It doesn't cut current spending in Medicaid; it just says that it will grow at a slower rate, and it sends much of the authority to work out the best healthcare delivery systems to our State Governors and legislators. It gives States more flexibility along the way so they can use resources to serve the specific needs of their citizens. I know in my State we frequently will come to Washington and ask the Health and Human Services Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for a waiver so we can actually use the Medicaid money and to spend it most effectively--to build either a medical home or to deal with chronic diseases, or some other flexibility we need in order to deliver quality healthcare to our constituents. But the gall of having to come to Washington, DC, and asking permission on how to spend your own money is just too much.  I believe, actually, the American Health Care Act is the most significant entitlement reform in decades. That is something we should all applaud--putting Medicare and Medicaid on a more sustainable path, not continuing to spend money that we don't have, and racking up annual deficits and adding to our national debt, which now is in the $20 trillion range, with no end in sight.  Both Federal and State governments spend a significant amount of money on Medicaid every year. As I indicated, last year nearly one-third of the Texas budget was dedicated to The fact of the matter is that when the States have to spend so much of the money they tax and collect on Medicaid, then, it is unavailable for other important purposes--law enforcement, education, and the like. There is a crowding-out effect. By responsibly reforming Medicaid, the States and the Federal Government will benefit, all while helping Medicaid work for the most vulnerable in our country and putting us on a path to fiscal sustainability.  In addition to entitlement reform, this bill will also get rid of the ObamaCare taxes that have led to hikes in premium costs, fewer options for patients, and more redtape for job creators. I know, being in Tyler, TX, for example, back after ObamaCare passed, and meeting with a woman who said she was forced, actually, to work two jobs because her employer laid her off of her full-time job, so as to come under the cap necessary for the ObamaCare employer mandate. So, literally, this single mother had lost her full-time job because of ObamaCare and was forced to work two part-time jobs just to make up the difference in income.  We will also, in this American Health Care Act, eliminate the individual mandate. President Obama said when he ran for office back in 2008 that he was opposed to penalizing the American people if they did not buy government-approved insurance, but of course he changed his tune once he was sworn into office.  We will eliminate the individual mandate so people who don't want to purchase a government-approved plan are not forced to buy a plan they don't want and that they can't afford or else suffer a penalty. This bill will also help families spend money on healthcare decisions that make the most sense to them by giving them tools so they can manage their healthcare expenses like health savings accounts.  The American Health Care Act is an answer to a promise we made and we have made repetitively in the last three elections since ObamaCare became the law of the land. I believe it is imperative we keep our promise.  Some have said: Well, this is a difficult process. I agree. There are a lot of different ideas that people have. I agree. That is a good thing, but in the end, we have a binary choice. We can either keep the status quo, which is in meltdown--which is ObamaCare--or we can pass legislation which offers more choices at affordable prices to the American people.  I believe the choice is very clear. It is a great opportunity to reform our healthcare system and Medicaid and move healthcare decisions away from Washington and back to the families, back in the States where we all live, and back in the hands of patients and their doctors. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Trump administration to make this a reality.  Again, the choice is between the status quo, which is unacceptable, which is not working, or a better way. I, for one, choose a better way: more choices at a price consumers can afford.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1692,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J. RES. 38, DISAPPROVING A RULE",2017.0,8.0,January

6266,topic-id,1902,"Mr.President, I would just say, I had the pleasure of sitting here listening to the Senator from Connecticut talk about his concerns about repealing ObamaCare, and I would say it strikes me that their posture is that we sold the American people a lemon, and we insist they keep it.  Our position is that ObamaCare has been a failure. It has been a grand--in terms of scale--experiment, a national experiment that has failed.  Yesterday I talked about the fact that my constituents are writing me and telling me that their premiums, in many instances, have doubled, and their deductible has gotten to the point that they are effectively self-insured so their insurance does them virtually no good.  We will vote to repeal ObamaCare, but obviously we are not going to leave people hanging out to dry. We are going to make sure they have coverage that they choose and that they can afford. I welcome the assistance of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to craft a bipartisan reform.[[Page S83]]  The biggest failure of ObamaCare was the fact that when our Democratic friends had 60 votes in the Senate and they had President Obama in the White House and a majority in the House, they jammed it down the throats of the American people. That is really why ObamaCare is unsustainable--because it was purely a partisan political exercise. We need to start over by repealing ObamaCare and then reforming our health care system so people can buy the coverage they want at a price they can afford. We are going to work very carefully to make sure the transition is thought out, methodical, and very carefully done.                              Nominations  Soon, Mr.President, we will be considering and confirming men and women nominated by the President-elect to fill leadership roles throughout the administration. This is crucial to ensuring a smooth transition from one President to another, and it is important to make sure the next President has the people and resources he needs to help lead our country.  I have had some of the reporters in the hallway say: How in the world can you process so many nominees at the same time, so quickly?  I said: It is the tyranny of the calendar. We are going to have a new President on January 20, and wouldn't you want--for example, the President's CIA Director choice, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence--wouldn't you want all of those key national security positions filled as soon as possible in case some of our adversaries decide to take advantage of this transition to try to threaten the United States?  It makes sense to me that we would work in an orderly sort of way with our colleagues across the aisle to make this transition a smooth one from President Obama to President President Obama has said that is what he is working to do, and you would think it would make sense for us to be a part of the solution and not a part of the problem.  Holding up confirmations just for delay's sake is irresponsible and it is dangerous. As I speak, there is a hearing going on on the foreign cyber threats in the Senate Armed Services People are justifiably concerned about what our adversaries are doing in cyber space. But it is not related to just cyber space, it is related to nuclear threats from countries such as North Korea, obviously the ongoing humanitarian crisis and civil war going on in Syria and elsewhere, the threats from Russia not only in cyber space but also to our NATO allies in Europe, and I could go on and on talking about Iran and its nuclear aspirations, its ballistic missile capability.  This is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues delay for delay's sake President-Elect Trump getting to fill his Cabinet, particularly these important national security offices? The truth is, when it comes to wanting what is best for America, we are all on the same team. We should all want what is best for our country. It doesn't do our Democratic colleagues a bit of good to delay the inevitable because, thanks to former Democratic leader Harry Reid and the so-called nuclear option that changed the Senate confirmation rules, we know that President-Elect Trump's Cabinet members will be confirmed. It is going to happen because it takes 51 votes. Just delaying for delay's sake out of partisan pique really doesn't do anything to accomplish any goal but, rather, makes our country more dangerous and denies the President-elect the Cabinet he has chosen.  When President-Elect Obama was nominated to office, we acted very quickly. In fact, on the day he was inaugurated--January 20, 2009--seven of his Cabinet members were confirmed. We were not happy about the outcome of the election on this side of the aisle. We wished a different electoral outcome had occurred. But once the voters had spoken, we accepted their verdict, and we worked cooperatively to see a smooth transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. I believe it is our duty to do that. Nearly all of President Obama's Cabinet-level nominees were confirmed within the span of 2 weeks. We came together, understood that the people had spoken, and we went to work to cooperate in good faith, not necessarily because we were happy about the outcome but because it is our responsibility to do so.  Then there are some of the statements from some of our colleagues across the aisle that they now appear to be walking away from. In the spring of 2015, Senator Stabenow, the senior Senator from Michigan, said: ``When a President wins an election, they have the right to have their team.'' She said that on April 20, 2015. I hope that not only the Senator from Michigan but her other colleagues remember that position they took then and simply reciprocate in good faith during this transition.  Senator Stabenow is right, by the way. No matter which side you are on, we know that the voters have spoken. As President-elect, he has the authority to surround himself with those he sees fit to advise him and help him as he serves our country.  For some of our colleagues to suggest that keeping the President understaffed is somehow in the best interest of the American people is palpably false. It is ridiculous. I mentioned the national security nominations the President-elect has indicated. One of those first ones was Senator Sessions, our colleague here in the Senate, the junior Senator from Alabama, to serve as Attorney General of the United The Attorney General is not only the head of the Department of Justice and has an important law enforcement role, the Attorney General also has a very important anti-terrorism national security portfolio as well. So it is very important that people like Senator Sessions, the Attorney General nominee, be put in place on a timely basis for the safety of our community.  Talking about the nomination of Attorney General Loretta Lynch not even 2 years ago, the senior Senator from Vermont urged a quick confirmation, saying: ``Confirming the top law enforcement position should be an urgent priority of the Senate.'' And he is right.  As the minority party is now considering the political strategy of obstruction, delay, and stall tactics, what has changed except that your preferred candidate did not win and our preferred candidate did win? That is the only thing that has changed.  Another nominee the Senate will consider is the President-elect's choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Last year, after the death of Justice Scalia, we promised the American people that the next President, whether it was a Republican or a Democrat, would nominate the successor to Justice We didn't say we would only vote to confirm a Republican President's nominees; we said that the American people had a right to a voice in who would make that choice, recognizing that the next Justice on the Supreme Court could serve 25 or 30 years.  Here we are 15 days before the President-elect is sworn in to the White House and the minority leader is already threatening to deny the voices and the vote of the American people from last November by blocking any nominee indefinitely.  As shocking as it sounds, on Tuesday night, just hours after the 115th Congress was sworn in, Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, was asked in an interview on MSNBC if he would ``do his best to keep the seat open.'' He answered with one word: ``Absolutely.'' Despite months of calling for a full Supreme Court, all nine members, even using the hashtag ``We need nine,'' the Democratic leader is now threatening indefinite obstruction.  Republicans were clear with the American people: We would respect their voice in whom they wanted to pick the next Supreme Court Justice, whether it was a Democrat or Republican in the White House, and we would move forward with that nominee in the new  I hope our Democratic friends don't slow-walk President-Elect Trump's nominees. It is one thing to obstruct, but it becomes an even bigger problem when they intentionally try to keep President Trump from doing the job the voters have given him the responsibility to do.  The American people made clear in November that they are done with[[Page S84]]business as usual here in Washington, Frankly, I don't think it was a robust endorsement of either one of the political parties. We got an unconventional President-elect, and I think the American people expect him to shake this place up, and I think he will. We intend to work with him to make sure there is a positive outcome for the American people. I don't think they are interested in political stunts or delay for delay's sake, nor do they want us to return to the dysfunctional do-nothing Congress of the past. They want results, and they want a path forward toward a brighter future for themselves and their families.  Let's not keep from President Trump the men and women he has chosen to work alongside him. That would only make us less safe, our economy more fragile, and the government less efficient. After all, we are paying the bills as taxpayers. Why would we want a less efficient or less effective government? In short, it will not serve the interests of the American people well.  I know we are ready on this side of the aisle to roll up our sleeves and get to work. As I have learned through hard experience, the only time anything ever gets accomplished in the Senate is when we work together. I am not talking about people sacrificing their principles.

6285,topic-id,2458,"Mr.President, in the final days of the Obama administration's second term, with all eyes focused on the President-elect, the temptation to try to take a dramatic action to seal a cherished policy legacy must have been almost irresistible. So it proved for President Obama on December 23, 2016, when he betrayed decades of robust bipartisan American support for Israel at the United Nations by abstaining from a completely biased resolution that condemns our close friend and ally Israel and condemns all the so-called settlement activity, defined as any construction in any territory won by Israel in the Six-Day  U.policy for decades has been to stand up for Israel at the United Nations, a hot bed of anti-Semitism that discriminately condemns Israel more than any country in the world, particularly when resolutions are being offered up that are outrageously biased, that attempt to predetermine the outcome of negotiations, that prejudge the basis for negotiations, or that try to dictate terms to  We have seen this pattern of appealing to the United Nations from the Obama administration over and over with disastrous deals--the nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the U.Convention on Climate Change, two international agreements that significantly threaten the security and prosperity of the United Both of them should have been submitted to this body, the Senate, as treaties.  But the President chose instead to try to impose them through the United Nations because he knew that they would never be ratified by the Senate, even when this Senate had a Democratic majority. So the Obama administration's strategy, instead, has been to curb American power by subjugating our national interests to the globalist agenda of the U.N., a policy that he is now attempting to extend to  Here are some of the main problems with UNSC Resolution 2334. First, it is an attack on Israeli sovereignty, as it falsely defines as illegal under international law building activity within Israel's own borders, which should be an internal Israeli issue. The historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel did not begin in 1967.  Let us not forget that the Six-Day War was a defensive war fought almost 50 years ago by the Jewish state against the Palestinians and their Arab enablers, who were gathering in a concerted effort to wipe Israel off the map. Against all odds, Israel won quickly and decisively and the map was redrawn to ensure that Israel was not endangered by its own borders, the weakness of which Israel's enemies had attempted to exploit.  Of course, the defeated party, the Palestinians, have not accepted this outcome. Israel has time and again invited them to negotiate a resolution--just one that involves Israel's continued existence as a Jewish state, something that the Palestinian Authority has over and over refused to acknowledge or accept.  Therein lies the bottom line for Israeli security. The pre-1967 lines proved indefensible. So rather than, as the Obama administration, treat them as some sort of gold standard, Israel's security interest has deemed them intolerable and any resolution to this issue should not be dictated by the United States or the United Nations but rather should be negotiated and decided upon directly by the sovereign nation of Israel and by the  Secondly, the resolution falsely claims that Israel's sovereignty over the eastern part of Jerusalem and areas that it controls after the Six-Day War, including Judea and Samaria, are supposedly ``occupied Palestinian territory''. This is nothing short of absurd. What that means is that, under the terms of the United Nations resolution that the Obama administration acquiesced to--indeed, there are considerable reports that the Obama administration, President Obama, and John Kerry actively encouraged and facilitated it--the Jewish Quarter, the Old City of Jerusalem, is illegal and illegitimate and not justifiably a part of Under the terms of that resolution, the location of holy sites for the Jewish people, including the most important holy site, the Temple Mount, is illegal and illegitimate to be a part of Under the terms of the resolution, the Western Wall, where Jews from all over the world go to pray, is deemed ``occupied Palestinian territory,'' illegal and illegitimate.  It is more than a little ironic that President Obama went to the Western Wall to place a yarmulke there, pretending to show respect to Israel, and yet his administration, in an outgoing act of contempt, declares the Western Wall not part of the nation of  This couldn't be further from the truth. It was also an affront to Jews around the world that the resolution was adopted on the eve of For 8 days, Jews lit candles all over the world to remember the miracle that happened there, and to commemorate the heroic battle fought by the Maccabees that liberated Jerusalem and restored their right to worship freely and the rededication of the Temple in How ironic it is that on the eve of a celebration liberating Jerusalem and rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem, the Obama administration and the United Nations would declare that Jerusalem and the Temple are not legitimately part of Israel.[[Page S96]]  How disgraceful--the United States should be not be facilitating the adoption of a resolution that at its core attempts to distort and rewrite recent history as well as the historical connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel that goes back thousands of years.  Third, the resolution will also help fuel the Palestinian diplomatic, economic, and legal warfare campaign against Israel, particularly because of its provision that calls on states to make a distinction in their dealings with Israel between pre-1967 Israel and Israel beyond the 1967 lines, encouraging boycotts, divestments, and sanctions against Israel and potentially leading to Israelis and Americans being brought in front of the International Criminal  Palestinian leaders are already promising to use this resolution to push the International Criminal Court to launch a formal investigation against  That was not an unintended consequence of this action. That was precisely the intent of the United Nations and the Obama administration--to facilitate assaults on the nation of  Yet even after this disgraceful United Nations resolution, it was clear that the administration was not yet done, with Secretary of State John Kerry delivering just days later a truly shameful speech attacking His speech, very much like Kerry's 2014 remarks likening Israel to an apartheid state, will only enflame rising anti-Semitism in It will encourage the mullahs, who hate Israel and hate America, and it will further facilitate ``lawfare,'' the growing assaults on Israel through transnational legal fora.  President Obama and John Kerry's actions were designed to secure a legacy, and in that, they have succeeded. History will record and the world will note that Barack Obama and John Kerry are relentless enemies of  Kerry's speech drew a stunning moral equivalence between our great friend and ally Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which is currently formed by a ``unity'' government with the vicious terrorists of  Secretary Kerry declared the Hamas regime and Gaza ``radical'' in the same way that he declared the duly elected Government of Israel ``extreme.'' That moral equivalence is false, and it is a lie.  The IDF, defending the people of Israel, protecting people, and keeping them safe, is not the same moral equivalent of terrorists who strap bombs to their bodies and seek to murder innocent women and children.  Kerry declared the vicious terrorism sponsored by Hamas equal to the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and he equated Israel's celebration of its birth with the Palestinian description of this event as the ``disaster.''  Unlike Barack Obama and John Kerry, I do not consider the existence and creation of Israel to be a disaster, and the Government of the United States should not be suggesting such a thing.  Kerry's speech attempted to lay out a historic and seismic shift toward the delegitimization of our ally It is a sign of their radicalism and refusal to defend American interests that Obama and Kerry chose to attack the only inclusive democracy in the Middle East--a strong, steadfast ally of America--while simultaneously turning a blind eye to the Islamic terrorism that grows daily.  Unfortunately, President Obama still has 2 weeks left in his Presidency, and he may not yet be done betraying  Next week, on Sunday, January 15, France is convening a conference with 70 other nations designed to serve as an extension of the U.resolution and the Kerry speech--an all-out assault on I am deeply concerned that what is decided at this conference will be used to try to further impose parameters or even audaciously to recognize a so-called independent Palestinian state through another Security Council resolution. The Security Council is scheduled to meet on January 17--conveniently, 3 days before Obama and Kerry leave office.  Let me speak a moment to our friends and allies across the globe.  When the President of the United States, when the administration of the United States attempts to encourage you to support their positions in the United Nations, that can be highly persuasive. It has been an arena, a forum that Barack Obama has flourished in, even as he has shown condescension and contempt for the Congress of the United States and the people of the United  But to our friends and allies, let me remind you: The Obama administration is coming to an end on January 20. If you desire to continue being a friend to America, if you desire a continued close working relationship with America, then I call upon our allies: Do not join in attacking Israel on January 15 in France or on January 17 at the Security  The new administration--President-Elect Trump--has loudly condemned the U.resolution and the Obama administration's complicity in its passage.  I would encourage our friends and allies not even to attend the January 15 conference, or, if they do choose to attend, to oppose and stand up and speak out against any further attempts to attack or undermine or delegitimize America or  I want to commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for offering resolutions to repudiate this administration for their actions of the last few weeks. It says something when you see Republicans and Democrats in Congress coming together, united to say: This action by the Obama administration is beyond the pale.  Let me underscore again to our friends and allies, to our Ambassadors, to heads of state, to friendships and relationships that we value so much: Listen to the bipartisan consensus of Congress, and do not go along with the bitter, clinging radicalism of the Obama administration, attempting to lash out and strike out at Israel with their last breath in office.  As commendable as these resolutions are, I believe the Senate and the Congress need to go further--that we need to take concrete steps so that there will be repercussions and consequences for the United Nations and the Palestinians for their behavior. That is why I am working with my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham on introducing legislation, along with other Members of this body, designed to cut the funding to the United Nations--designed to cut U.taxpayer funding going to the U.N.--unless and until they repeal this disgraceful anti-Israel resolution.  We know, previously, that one way to get the U.N.'s attention is to cut off their money. We know from the failure of other U.organizations to recognize so-called Palestine as a member-state after American tax dollars were withheld from UNESCO for doing so in 2011 that the U.over and over values its pocketbook over its leftist values.  However unintentionally, President Obama's misguided foreign policy has led to an unprecedented rapprochement between Israel and America's Arab allies, such as Egypt, Jordan, and the We have also seen hopeful signs of shifting positions at the United Nations, as countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Italy, and Australia have recently signaled that they may no longer vote reflexively in favor of the  Great Britain, although it voted for the resolution, has recently demonstrated an unprecedented degree of support for the Jewish state.  These changes represent a significant opportunity for the United States to bolster one of our most important allies, an opportunity we can preserve for the President-elect by not letting Mr.Obama squander it on the way out the door.  America should be leading the charge at the United Nations and around the world to rally burgeoning support for Israel, not trying to stab the Jewish state in the back.  Just over a week ago, I spoke with Israeli Prime Minister I told the Prime Minister that, despite the disgraceful actions of the United Nations, America stands resolutely with the nation of Israel, that the American people stand with Israel, and that I believe there is a very real possibility that the extreme and radical actions of Obama and Kerry will, in fact, backfire.  It is not accidental that they waited until after the election to do this. They could have tried to do that this summer, but Obama and Kerry knew well that the American people do not support their attempting to attack So they waited until after the election.[[Page S97]]They waited until they were on their way out the door.  Kerry, in his speech, said Israel cannot be both democratic and Jewish--one or the other, but not both.  This is an inanity that is deemed profound only in Marxist faculty lounges.  Israel is Jewish, it is democratic, and it is and should remain both. I believe that by revealing just how extreme they are, by removing the fake mask of support for Israel that Obama and Kerry have chosen to do in the last several weeks, it will help to galvanize support in this body and across the world for our friend and ally, the nation of  Israel is not only our friend and ally, but it is a partner of the United That alliance benefits the vital national security interest of Israel's military benefits the national security of the United States of The Israeli intelligence services benefit the United States of Israel's steadfastness against radical Islamic terrorism, which has declared war on both Israel and America, benefits the national security interests of this country.  It is Israel--the thriving, one and only Jewish state--that stands on the frontlines for America and, more broadly, Western civilization against the global threats we face. Our commitment to Israel must be restored and strengthened. I look forward to taking action with my colleagues--I hope on both sides of the aisle--in the near future to repudiate Obama's shameful attack on Israel, to repudiate the United Nations' efforts to undermine Israel, and to reaffirm America's strong and unshakable friendship and support for the nation of  I yield the floor.

5988,topic-id,1995,"Mr.President, in recent weeks, we have seen an astonishing series of revelations about Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 election in support of the Donald Trump campaign. Last week, the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met with the Russian Ambassador in July and September during the campaign. Yet, during his confirmation hearing, the Attorney General said under oath: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.''  Last Thursday, the Attorney General announced he would partially recuse himself from any investigation into the Presidential campaign. I note that this was a partial recusal when it comes to investigations into Russia's influence on President Trump and his circle of advisers and associates. The scope of the recusal is still unclear. For example, Attorney General Sessions does not even appear to believe that his own meeting with the Russian Ambassador on September 8, 2016, was related to the campaign. The scope of his recusal will need to be clarified.  We also continue to learn of previously undisclosed communications between the Russians and President Trump's inner circle. For example, we learned last week that Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, had met in December with the Russian Ambassador in Trump Tower, along with the President's National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who resigned on February 13. People across America are wondering when the next shoe will drop.  It is becoming clear that the President is desperate to change the headlines from these Russian revelations--so desperate, in fact, that in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, President Trump claimed that President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in an act President Trump described as ``McCarthyism'' and ``Nixon/Watergate.'' Well, President Trump's tweets again made news but not in the way he had hoped. It quickly became clear that President Trump has no evidence to back up his claims. In fact, it appeared he got his information not from America's law enforcement or intelligence agencies but from rightwing talk radio.  On Sunday, the former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, denied the President's claims, and the Director of the FBI, James Comey, took an extraordinary step of calling on the Justice Department to publicly deny the President's claims. Even Republicans like House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said they had not seen any evidence that would support what President Trump tweeted. Nonetheless, the President's spokespeople doubled down, saying that the President does not accept the contention of the FBI Director and he stands by his tweets.  Let's be clear. President Trump is playing games with the credibility of his Donald Trump is destroying the credibility of the Office of the President 140 characters at a time. If President Trump had consulted with his adviser--any credible adviser--prior to his tweets, he would have learned something that is crucial, and it is as follows: The President of the United States does not have the authority to order a wiretap. Instead, such a wiretap can be granted upon a finding by a court that there is probable cause to believe the target has committed a crime or is an agent of a foreign power.  Clearly, there are more revelations to come. The only question: How long is it going to take? How much damage will be done to the credibility of the Office of the President and America in the process?  These recent events confirm yet again the need for an independent, transparent, bipartisan commission led by Americans of unimpeachable integrity to get to the bottom of this Russian attack on the United Russia attacked our democracy. We need to fully understand what happened. We certainly need to prevent it from happening in the next election or ever again.  This week, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Americans, by a margin of 58 percent to 35 percent, believe an outside independent investigation is needed into Russian involvement in our election. It is worthy of note that just a few weeks ago, only 30-something percent of the American people were aware of this controversy with Now over 55 percent of people want an independent investigation. America is listening.  We also need the Justice Department and the FBI to proceed with a credible, impartial investigation to determine if there may have been any criminal conduct involved.  Yesterday, the President's nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, appeared before the Senate Judiciary If confirmed, Mr.Rosenstein would oversee any Justice Department investigation into the Trump administration's Russian connections after Attorney General Sessions has partially recused himself. So I pressed Mr.Rosenstein to clarify the scope of Attorney General Sessions' recusal commitment. I also asked, as did Senator Feinstein, whether Mr.Rosenstein had read the January 6 Intelligence Community assessment into Russian election interference. I cannot explain it, but in 2 months Mr.Rosenstein had not read this 15-page, unclassified report that is available on the internet. It focuses on the major issue he will face initially as Deputy Attorney General, and he told us he had not read it.  Let me add that I respect Rod He served as U.attorney in Maryland, appointed first under a Republican President and held over under a Democratic President, and that says a lot about his professionalism as a prosecutor, his reputation, and his integrity. It is hard for me to believe that he could come before a hearing, which he knew would focus on the need for a special prosecutor to look into this Russian interference, and not have been briefed to read the 15-page public report that summarizes the conclusions of all of America's intelligence agencies when it comes to this Russian interference.  I am sure he is an excellent lawyer who wouldn't enter a courtroom or stand before a judge or jury without complete preparation to the best of his ability, but yesterday, time and again, he told us he didn't take the time to read this report. I urge him to do so as quickly as possible, and when he reads it, he will see that our intelligence agencies are unequivocal in their statement that Vladimir Putin was setting out to elect Donald Trump and to defeat Hillary This is not a report from the Democratic National Committee; it is a report from our intelligence agencies. And whomever Putin was trying to help, that is secondary to the fact that he was hacking into the internet, disclosing materials, and trying to become a material player in our Presidential election.  Mr.President, 3 weeks ago, I went to visit Poland, Lithuania, and They are watching this carefully because they have been the victims of Vladimir Putin and Russia's attempts to interfere in their elections, and now they hear the United States has been victimized by Putin, as well.  One of the scholars in Poland asked me what I thought was a very clear question, and I can't answer. He said: If[[Page S1652]]the United States will not take the interference of Putin in your election seriously, how can the people of Poland believe you will take your NATO commitment to protect us from Putin seriously? Important question. Valid question.  There are exceptions on the Republican side of the aisle, and I would like to point out one of them. My friend, my colleague, and the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, made an extraordinarily forthright statement yesterday about the need for an investigation into this Russian interference. Thank goodness he is stepping away from party loyalty and stepping up when it comes to defending this I salute my Republican colleague for his leadership on this issue.  It is important to step back from the daily dysfunction we have when it comes to the Russian investigation and the White House and lack of governing and remember what is really at stake.  Five months ago, our intelligence services disclosed evidence that a foreign adversary--one ruled by a dictatorial former Communist KGB agent--was trying to help its preferred candidate in the U.Presidential election. Think about that for a moment. An adversary of the United States--a country which has imprisoned millions of Europeans in the Communist system for almost half a century and which today rigs elections and silences or murders members of the media and opposition--committed what I believe is akin to a cyber act of war against America in trying to elect someone they saw as more sympathetic to their interests.  Since those early reports, we have been provided with damning evidence by our intelligence agencies on the depth and sophistication of this operation--so favorable to its nefarious goal that it had Russian intelligence operatives boastfully celebrating after the outcome of the election.  We also know that members of President Trump's campaign met with those thought to be Russian intelligence; had suspiciously timed communications with the Russian Government just after the Obama administration placed sanctions on Russia; and in the case of top Trump advisers Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions, refused to disclose those meetings, both in public and in one case to the Vice President and in another case to the Senate Judiciary  No candidate would or at least should want help from a foreign dictator to help win political office in the United So in a situation like this, the response is obvious: Help in any way possible to clear suspicions and concerns. Go forward and serve the American people with an investigation. It seems so obvious.  Leon Panetta was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows. Leon Panetta is a friend. I served with him in the House of He was the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States, President He served as Secretary of He headed up the Central Intelligence He is an extraordinarily gifted and well-thought-of person who has a record of public service that is enviable. He was asked about what the Trump White House should do about this allegation of Russian interference in the election and the suggestion that they might have been complicit.  He said: Get out in front.  The President of the United States should say: I have nothing to hide, and we will fully cooperate with an independent commission to get to the bottom of what happened in that election. But instead, what do we have? Fanciful--in fact, patently false--tweets by the President, alleging a wiretap by the former President Trump, if he has nothing to hide, should help us clear this up once and for all.  To my Republican colleagues, so many patriots and champions of American national security, it is time for more to join Senator Graham and others to step up and speak out even on the floor of the Senate about this situation.  Each one of us in the Senate swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic. Clearly, the Russian attack is a call for all of us--of both political parties--to step up. This issue is not going to go away. We are going to continue to pursue the truth.      Nomination of Seema Verma and the Republican Healthcare Bill  Mr.President, I come to the floor to speak about the recently released Republican healthcare repeal bill and to speak on the nomination of Seema Verma to serve as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS is an agency touching the lives of 125 million people, and 34 percent of Americans receive their health insurance under one of the three Federal programs run by that agency--Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance These programs are vital to the health and well-being of seniors, children, persons with disabilities, and low-income families.

6256,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, the pending business in the U.Senate is to set the stage procedurally so the Republican majority of 52 to 48 can repeal ObamaCare, the Affordable Care That is what we are about. That is the business of the day, the week, and probably the weeks to come. So we are addressing that issue and others related to the budget.  I would like to start by sharing a story that was told to me by a family who I represent, Richard and Mary Laidman, who live in Naperville, They told me a story, and I will recount it to you.       My 13-year-old son Sam was diagnosed with leukemia one day      after the ``no pre-existing conditions exclusions for      children''[[Page S76]]     protection went into effect [under the Affordable Care Act.]      The good news is that the form of leukemia has, so far, been      effectively controlled by a magic-bullet drug. My son is      currently a very robust young man and in otherwise good      health (while the drug keeps him alive). The bad news is that      the drug, as I understand it, costs [Blue Cross Blue Shield]      about $10,000 a MONTH! Without even going into the issue of      ``Big Pharma'' pricing--  They wrote--     this means that it would take about $6 million to get my son      into his 60's. Obviously we are feeling dependent on all the      clauses of the [Affordable Care Act] right now--no pre-     existing conditions exclusions, no caps on benefits, allowing      Sam to stay on our health insurance plan till [he reaches]      age 26.  Mr.President, the bottom line according to the Laidman family of Naperville, IL, is that the Affordable Care Act is critical to their family's health and financial survival. That is what this debate is about. It is not about talking about promises made in campaigns or slogans one way or the other. It is about families like the Laidman family in Naperville who understand that were it not for the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, their son might not be here today or they may be penniless.  That is what it was like in the old days. If you had a son with leukemia and wanted to buy a family health insurance plan, good luck. If they would sell it to you, you probably couldn't afford it. And secondly, many policies had limits on how much they would pay. Listen to what she tells us: $10,000 a month just for this drug that keeps her son alive. There were policies that had $100,000 limits on the amount they pay each year. Oh, they were affordable and cheap enough. What would the Laidman family have done if that is all they had to turn to?  Sadly, we know thousands, perhaps millions, of families across America face that. That is why the Affordable Care Act made a difference. That is why it is inconceivable that the Republicans are coming to the floor, saying they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act without any replacement.  They have had 6 years to come up with a better idea, 6 years to come up with a list of improvements, and they have failed and failed miserably. Why? Because it is hard. It is difficult. We found that when we wrote this law.  Let me concede a point to the Republican leader who was on the floor this morning. I am ready to sit down. I think other Democrats are as well. If you want to change and improve the Affordable Care Act to make sure that American families like the Laidmans of Naperville have a chance for these protections in a better situation, I want to be part of it, and I have wanted to be part of it for 6 years. But the Republican approach has been very simple: All we will propose is repeal. We will not come up with an alternative.  It is catching up with them this week in Have you noticed? Senators on the Republican side of the aisle and even some House Republicans are saying publicly: You know, we really ought to have a replacement.  It is not fair for us to say to America: We're going to repeal the only protection you have. Trust us. Some day in the future we might come up with a better plan.  The atmospherics have changed--maybe even changed with the President-elect. Remember a few weeks ago when he said he thought that provision about the preexisting conditions was a good idea? Well, he is right, and so is the provision to make sure you don't have limits under the policy, the provision that allows the Laidmans to keep their son under their family health insurance plan until he reaches the age of 26.

6271,topic-id,1907,"Madam President, today I have been listening to the diatribes against the repeal resolution we are working on, and I think some things need to be answered.  The Republicans are not trying to throw 30 million people off of their insurance. What we have seen over the time of ObamaCare is that there were 30 million people who were uninsured when we started that debate, and today there are 30 million people who are uninsured. Now it is a different 30 million people. The 30 million people who couldn't get insurance have insurance, and we want them to have insurance. And the 30 million people who are now off insurance used to have insurance, but they can no longer afford it. There has been a huge increase in the cost of health care. That is not how it was supposed to be. The prices were supposed to come down.  Yesterday we took the first step in fulfilling the promise of repealing ObamaCare, which will pave the way for real health care reforms to strengthen the doctor-patient relationships, expand choices, lower health care costs, and improve access to quality, affordable, innovative health care.  As I discussed yesterday, while Republicans will start by repealing ObamaCare immediately, we will ensure a stable transition in which those with insurance will not lose access to health care coverage. This will allow us to move step by step to a new set of reforms, listening carefully to the advice of millions of Americans affected and making sure we proceed wisely, doing no harm.  There is a common misconception that some of my friends across the aisle have promoted. It is the idea that ObamaCare was a success and that repeal will be tearing down a functioning program. That is not true. ObamaCare has put our health insurance markets on the brink of collapse in many parts of the country. And what Republicans face now is an imperative to do something that the Democrats couldn't bring themselves to do when they had control, and that is to fix the problems they created.  ObamaCare became the epitome of a sacred cow for them, and any changes, as you can see, unless done by Executive action, were out of the question.  Interestingly, President Obama recently admitted in October 2016 at Miami Dade College that the law has real problems and that, in his words, ``There are going to be people who are hurt by premium increases or a lack of competition and choice.'' That is the President of the United States talking about In that same speech, he went on to call these issues ``growing pains.'' I think that is a troubling[[Page S87]]blind spot about this law that he and many of my Democratic colleagues share. Millions are facing impossibly high health insurance premiums for plans they may not even want to have. Costs are going up, and they can't afford it. Somehow these casualties of ObamaCare don't deserve relief, apparently; they are just written off as growing pains by the authors of the law.  My colleagues will recall ObamaCare architect Jonathan Gruber, who was paid in a number of different ways, who was famously exposed in 2014 for stating, amongst other things, that while crafting this bill, he believed that ``the lack of transparency is a huge political advantage'' and that it ``was written in a tortured way to make sure the CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.'' Mr.Gruber may have succeeded in masking the consequences of ObamaCare to obtain passage, but there is no way to hide the results.  A recent poll by the Gallup organization showed that more Americans continue to disapprove--53 percent--than approve--42 percent--of the law and that a majority of Americans want to see the law changed. Let me highlight that point again. A majority of Americans want to see ObamaCare either changed or replaced altogether. In fact, since passage of ObamaCare in 2010, there has never been a majority of Americans supporting the law. A quick glance around the Nation quickly explains why. For more and more Americans, there is only a single insurer from which they can select health plans, a monopoly. In fact, on Federal exchanges, one in five consumers will only be able to select plans from a single insurer. Many residents across the country only have one choice of health insurer. That is including my home State of Wyoming as well as the entire State of  What does this lack of competition mean? Prices are surging for hard-working families who now have to choose between unreasonable insurance rates or an unreasonable fine. That doesn't even include the deductible problem we have. That doesn't even include the additional taxes and prices people are paying as a result of other things that are built into the law, which I will go into later--not in this speech.  The irony of a Democrat-led effort to help resulting in the creation of a lose-lose proposition for families ran true to voters in the most recent election when they voted for change. In Wyoming, some families would be forced to pay more than 30 percent of their total income on premiums to obtain health care coverage, which often includes deductibles of over $1,000. One family faced premiums of more than $1,600 per month. That is one family, $1,600 a month. As an alternative, their tax penalty for not carrying coverage was only $1,700 for the whole year. So guess what they did. They paid the fine because they couldn't afford the insurance premium. They could also see no way that they were going to be able to get a benefit from that.  For those lucky enough to be able to afford insurance, particularly in the individual market, under the new health law, premiums are expected to increase faster in 2017 than in previous years. Some States will see insurance premiums rise by as much as 53 percent. I think that makes it truly an emergency.  After discussing the why, it is important to talk about how we are going to do this. Passing the repeal resolution we are currently debating today will allow Republicans to use the budget reconciliation process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and unaffordable law. This is the exact same procedure congressional Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of portions of Let me say that again. This is the exact same procedure congressional Democrats and President Obama used to secure passage of portions of  After Congress passes this repeal resolution, it can then move forward on reconciliation legislation that will provide for the repeal of ObamaCare and pave the way for real health care reforms. I think Members are looking forward to an open and serious debate about the future of America's health and its health care system and the importance of restoring the trust of hard-working taxpayers. I think that is something both sides can agree on, and that is what will happen.  This resolution we are debating does two things. It recognizes the point in the budget we are at considering the points of order and things that happened up to this point in time. We are just recognizing that is where this budget is. It still keeps in place the points of order to maintain some control over our spending, but the significant part is the repeal part. That is where we institute the reconciliation, and all that is, is an instruction to two committees on the Senate side and two committees on the House side. The two on the Senate side were the Finance Committee--they are the ones who deal with all of the taxes and the finance and the Medicare and the Medicaid, and they need to save $1 billion over 10 years. That is peanuts around here. They will do much better than that, I am certain. And then the HELP Committee--Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--also has an instruction to save $1 billion. That is it.  This isn't a debate over what the changes are going to be to ObamaCare; this is a debate about whether we are going to give two committees, which have jurisdiction over this situation, the ability to consider it and bring us something. It has to conform with the budget requirements, and that is going to save some money. That is why we have a very low threshold, each of them saving $1 billion. That is the time when we will have the debate on what is happening with health care. If somebody wants to raise the threshold of the $1 billion for each of the two committees, that would be perhaps acceptable--unnecessary but perhaps acceptable. If somebody wants to change the budget, we are going to have an actual chance to change the budget right after we finish this process because there is a budget for 2018. We are already a third of the way through 2017, and there are no spending bills approved. That is wrong, but that is what this budget reflects. That is where we are at this point in time on our spending. Hopefully, we will do well on the new budget and come up with a plan that is going to pull the United States out of the hole that we are in on our deficit spending, which results in huge debt.  I would like to make that distinction. Deficit is our overspending. Debt is the amount that we owe that we have to pay interest on--like pouring money down a hole--and that interest rate is going up. We get to make decisions on about $1 trillion each year, and the interest rate right now spends $200 billion right now by itself--that is at about 1 percent. If it goes to 5 percent, which is the norm for the United States, that would be $1 trillion dollars. That is the amount we get to make decisions on. What shape will our country would be in if we have to spend $1 trillion dollars on interest and that is all we have to make decisions on?  We have to do something. Health care is affecting more people in this country than anything else. So we will start immediately. We normally have a recess that would begin from the time we reorganize until the time the President is sworn in, but Republicans recognize that this is an emergency. This is something that needs to be taken care of. So we are going to stay around and get it solved.  We are going to do the processes we have to do. This is the first of the processes. There is another more important step, which has to be the actual savings part in order to do the reconciliation, and we are going to do that.  We will hear all kinds of stories of ways that people have been helped by health care, and we will hear stories about how people have been hurt by this health care. We need to fix it for both of them.  So I think Members are looking forward to an open and serious debate--I hope, a serious debate--about the future of America's health care system and the importance of restoring the trust of the hardworking taxpayers. I hope that is something we can both agree on.  Thank you. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged to both sides.

Over time, this proud group, inspired by the founding fathers of the Dominican Republic--Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sanchez, and Ramon Matias Mella--made the decision to formalize itself in order to protect their own identity and cultural heritage. They officially incorporated on March 23, 1966.  As the years passed, what initially began as a way for friends new and old to stay in touch through the power of sports blossomed into what is now institutionally and athletically one of the most important centers of Dominican Americans and their friends in the 13th Congressional Over the past 50 years, they have hosted numerous recreational sports tournaments and have played an integral role in formation of many other civic, cultural, and social organizations.

6296,topic-id,576,"Madam President, I rise today to offer my warmest wishes to my legislative director, Stephen Higgins, as he begins the next chapter of his truly remarkable professional career. It is a career that is characterized by unshakable dedication to the common good and supreme attention to detail. These qualities make Stephen Higgins a true professional. His service is a labor of love for our country and this institution in particular.  Stephen has worked in the Senate longer than all but nine of its current Members, serving this Chamber for 23 years. Stephen still remembers his first day on payroll: March 21, 1994. He began with Senator William Cohen of Maine as a counsel on the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee of the Judiciary There he began what would become a decades-long mission: to advance crime victims' rights.  A year later, Stephen joined the office of Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, where he would distinguish himself as a committed, talented lawyer over the next 18 years, serving as chief counsel in Senator Kyl's personal office and for 14 years as chief counsel on his Judiciary Committee staff. During that time, Stephen played the lead role, supporting efforts to pass a bipartisan crime victims' rights constitutional amendment. The end result: After 8 years of hard work, a landmark statute was passed by a vote of 96 to 1. This is one of Stephen's proudest accomplishments. ``We did something significant to help crime victims,'' he said. ``We enshrined into law the rights of crime victims to be informed, present, and heard.''  To put it simply, Stephen Higgins helped humanize America's criminal justice system. This work reflects his sincere beliefs about that system. ``The criminal justice system is about seeking the truth,'' he said. ``The truth matters.''  For Stephen Higgins, the truth has always mattered. He is a man of high character and great personal integrity. These attributes made him exceptionally well-suited for work in another critical realm of the Senate: judicial nominations. ``Judges hold people's lives in their hands,'' Stephen said. ``Their decisions have life-altering consequences.''  Most recently, Stephen played a key role in the nomination of Omaha attorney Bob Rossiter to serve as U.district court judge for the District of Nebraska, and last year, the Senate confirmed Judge Rossiter unanimously. This was a beautiful capstone to Stephen's Senate career.  He leaves the Senate now for a new position: managing director of the[[Page S102]]Human Ecology Institute at the Catholic University of This is an interdisciplinary research institute that will apply the rich intellectual tradition of the Catholic Church to contemporary problems in our society.

5995,topic-id,596,"Mr.President, within a matter of days, our national debt will top $20 trillion, notching another ominous milestone in our Nation's long-running addiction to spending. How did we get here?  A decade ago, taxpayers learned that many of their elected representatives were complicit in an insidious practice that rotted the legislative branch to its core, and that is congressional earmarking. Called a ``gateway drug'' by our distinguished former colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Tom Coburn, earmarks have long exacerbated the Federal Government's spending addiction.  As old as the Republic, earmarks have always been used by generations of politicians as currency to curry favor with well-connected special interests. After public outrage reached a critical mass, both the House and the Senate instituted bans on earmarking, ending what had been a corrupt pay-to-play culture in  In order to preserve this important check against the corrupting influence of earmarks, I recently sent a letter to President Donald Trump respectfully urging him to veto any legislation containing earmarks that reaches his desk. I thank my colleagues, Senators John McCain, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Ben Sasse, for cosigning this letter.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.Senate,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2017.     President Donald Trump,     The White House,     Washington,       Dear President Trump: With our national debt set to top $20      trillion within days and growing at a rate of over half-a-     trillion dollars a year, bringing fiscal sanity to the      federal budget requires immediate attention and action. We      write today to urge opposition to any efforts by Congress to      return to earmarking.       While cutting unnecessary and wasteful spending may be      commonsense to most taxpayers, behind every dollar spent is a      boisterous special interest group with the loudest being      Congress itself. Even with a full agenda that includes      repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code, easing the      regulatory burden, and strengthening our nation's security,      some lawmakers are focused on reviving the corrupt practice      of earmarking that was ended in 2011 after what seemed like      an endless series of corruption scandals.       Fondly described as a ``favor factory'' by a lobbyist      convicted of exchanging gifts for government grants, earmarks      represent the pay-to-play culture you have pledged to end. It      is unfathomable to those of us who fought to end earmarks and      witnessed our colleagues go to jail for corruption that pork      barrel politics would return, especially at this time when      Americans are clearly fed up with business-as-usual. However,      despite the success of the current moratorium enacted in both      chamber of Congress, there are efforts underway seeking to      revive the disdainful practice.       President Reagan vetoed a highway bill in 1987 because it      was larded up with 152 earmarks. Escalating exponentially,      the over-budget transportation bill signed into law in 2005      contained more than 6,300 earmarks. Earmark proponents are      trying to reassure that this time will be different,      promising fewer projects and even rebranding them as      ``congressionally-directed spending.'' With the serious      fiscal problems facing our nation, processing thousands or      even hundreds of pork requests will only distract and delay      addressing pressing national needs and push spending      decisions once again into the murky shadows.       We respectfully urge you to make it clear that you will      veto any bill Congress sends to you containing earmarks      within the legislative text or the accompanying report. We      look forward to working with you to make Washington more      accountable and stop wasteful spending where it starts, which      is often right here in           Sincerely,       Jeff       Mike       John       Rand       Ted       Ben  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1633,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

5996,topic-id,1427,"To explain the urgency behind my letter to the President, I wish to remind my colleagues in this body, many of whom were not in the Congress before enactment of the moratorium, just how bad the earmarking epidemic became.  For the uninitiated, the term ``earmark'' is a euphemism for when lawmakers work to circumvent the regular, normal appropriations process in order to secure special funding for projects in their home districts or their This resulted in Federal tax dollars being doled out to Members of Congress on a whim, bypassing normal rigorous Federal and public vetting.  Instead of focusing on oversight responsibilities or devising legislative solutions for the Nation's most pressing challenges, lawmakers and staffers devoted thousands of man-hours toward filling earmark requests. Congressional appropriators and appropriations committees transformed into what were termed ``favor factories,'' abandoning oversight responsibilities to focus on rationing out pork. To me, that was one of the most insidious parts of the whole earmarking era.  We have oversight responsibilities in There is a huge Federal budget on which we should be providing oversight, but instead of poring over agency spending and searching for waste in our trillion-dollar discretionary budget, Members and staff devoted countless hours to roughly 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget. There was so much focus on just doling out what represented 1 or 2 or 3 percent of the Federal budget that we basically neglected the rest of the Federal budget in terms of oversight.[[Page S1657]]  In less than 20 years, the number of earmarks in the Transportation bill alone grew from 152 to 6,300. President Reagan, I believe, in 1988 famously said that he vetoed the highway bill because he hadn't seen that much pork since he handed out ribbons at the county fair. There were 152 earmarks in the Transportation bill that year, and by 2005 it was 6,300. That is an increase of more than 4,000 percent.  Examples of earmarks range from a quarter billion dollars for a bridge to nowhere in Alaska--everybody became familiar with that one; $50 million for an indoor rainforest in Iowa, paid for by taxpayers across the country; and half a million dollars for a teapot museum in North All of these earmarks added up, eventually totaling about $29 billion a year.  It was in this environment that, along with a small group of like-minded colleagues, I set out to put an end to this form of transactional politics that had infected the Halls of Our mission was to place a permanent moratorium on congressional earmarks.  It took unprecedented revelations of widespread corruption and illegality and ultimately the jailing of lawmakers, staffers, and lobbyists before the public's outrage forced Congress to clean up its act. But even brazen instances of public corruption didn't stop Congress from dragging its feet on reforms, and the majority party, my party, paid the price at the polls in 2006.  The dominant mood of the electorate at that time--that of mistrust in government institutions--is strikingly reminiscent of the drain-the-swamp mentality that permeated last November's election. But despite this surging anti-insider sentiment across the ideological spectrum, there is now a chorus of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle working behind the scenes to lift the congressional earmark moratorium. These earmark defenders will trot out arguments ranging from constitutional prerogative to the insignificance of earmarks relative to the entire Federal budget. They will say: It is OK to earmark. We are only earmarking 1 percent of the Federal budget.  But all of these defenses ring hollow. The constitutional power of the purse is not a blanket mandate for Congress to spend freely; rather, it is a fundamental duty to prevent the executive branch from wasting taxpayer dollars. By using earmarks to funnel billions of dollars to special interests, Congress ceases to be a check on the executive branch. We have become no better than the free-spending bureaucrats whom we rail against.  While we were ultimately successful in securing earmark bans in both the House and the Senate, today we are seeing far too many cracks in those foundations. With so many in Congress now willing to sacrifice fiscal discipline, we have to remain vigilant against the return to business as usual. We can't afford to forfeit the hard-fought progress we have made.  The Senate Republican conference's vote earlier this year to preserve the earmark ban was an important step in the right direction, but we need to do more. That is why I sent the letter to President Trump, and it is why, should earmarks return, I intend to challenge each one of them on the Senate floor. Just as I did in my time in the House, I will file amendments to force debate and force votes on these earmarks. That way, Members can publicly defend their earmarks to the hard-working taxpayers they represent.  As we look forward to the future, I have been encouraged by the President's recognition of Washington's addiction to spending and his administration's commitment to finally doing something about it. I look forward to working with the administration to make the Federal Government leaner, more transparent, and more accountable to the taxpayers it serves.                         Border Adjustment Tax  Mr.President, I take the floor today to express my concern with the border adjustment tax. The border adjustment tax is quickly becoming the centerpiece of a planned overhaul of our tax and trade policies. I am certain that I am not the only one hearing that this approach could make everyday consumer products more expensive at the very places middle-class families shop the most. From the aisles at big-box stores to the checkout lines in grocery stores, household staples could be pushed out of reach for those who can least afford it.  In addition, there are concerns that this new policy could disrupt global supply chains and make it harder for our country's largest private sector employers to grow and to do business.  There are those who suggest that the known downsides to the new tax will be a wash because the U.dollar will be stronger; however, others are not so comfortable gambling the purchasing power of the average consumer on the unpredictability of international currency markets.  At first glance, the plan seems simple enough: Tax companies in the United States less and tax goods made overseas more. That seems simple. According to supporters, this would boost our exports, incentivize companies to locate operations here in the United States, and it would reduce our trade deficit. Unfortunately, it turns out that is not so easy. Looking inward, we simply do not produce everything we need here in the United That is why we trade with other countries in the first place. And for the things we do make here, those products often require inputs from all over the world. In fact, whether it is raw material or specialty parts, roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports consist of inputs for U.production and manufacturing. Let me say that again. Roughly 50 percent of our Nation's imports consist of inputs for U.production and manufacturing, many times for products that are then shipped overseas.  Because of our trade deals with other nations, these inputs are cheaper than they would be otherwise. Cheaper inputs mean lower production costs for U.S.-based businesses, which in turn allows these companies to expand production and to reduce prices.  What will happen if we place a 20-percent tax on all imports? Looking beyond our borders, we should also consider the reaction such a tax is sure to trigger amongst our trading partners. If the protectionist trade policies of the past have taught us anything, it is that countries tend to retaliate when they believe trade obligations have been violated. When we increase barriers to trade, nobody wins.  Do I agree that we should work to make U.businesses more competitive? Do I agree that we need to reform our Tax Code? You bet. Tax reform and pro-growth trade policies have been at the top of my list of priorities throughout my tenure in  I look forward to working with my colleagues to lower corporate and individual tax rates, eliminate costly tax earmarks, and make our Tax Code flatter, simpler, and more conducive to growth. There will always be winners and losers in a robust debate on reforming the Tax We ought to make sure the middle class isn't in the losing column.  I yield back the remainder of my time.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6005,topic-id,1111,"Mr.President, looking at today's headlines and listening to the news, it may seem as if colleagues from across the country--Democrat, Republican--don't always agree on some things, let alone anything. I think we are starting to see a consensus emerge--a very good, genuine agreement emerge between liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans on at least one matter in Washington, DC, in the Senate: Neil That agreement is on Neil  Neil Gorsuch is an exceptional nominee for the U.Supreme In fact, Judge Gorsuch is, by many extents and by many commentators, arguably one of the most talented jurists we have nominated to the Court in a very long time, at least in modern history.  As the Denver Post in Colorado said: ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind'' who has a reputation for ``[applying] the law fairly and consistently.''  You can't ask for much more than that--somebody who will apply the law fairly and consistently. However, this shouldn't surprise anyone who knows Judge Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support. All we need to do to see that is to look back to 2006 when we could see that most clearly in the U. In 2006, when Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court, 12 current Democratic Senators, including the minority leader and Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, all were in office. It was a nomination in 2006 that was unanimous, a nomination that went by voice vote.  He was so universally appealing to the Tenth Circuit Court that he had an introduction at the Judiciary Committee by both a Democratic Senator[[Page S1662]]from Colorado and a Republican Senator from Colorado, joined by every single person on the floor to vote yes unanimously.  They approved his nomination. And to give you even greater context about this vote, the people who made this vote, the approval of Judge Gorsuch in 2006 to the Tenth Circuit Court came in addition to the 12 people I just mentioned who are here today and who were here then. It also came with the support of then-Senator Obama, Senator Biden, Senator Clinton, and Senator  Approximately 11 years later, now that Judge Gorsuch has proved himself to be a mainstream jurist, a consensus builder, a profound legal mind with an even temperament and affable nature, we have a chance again to put this incredibly brilliant mind on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch is a faithful adherent to the Constitution and the organizing principles of this great democracy. I have no doubt that Judge Gorsuch will--and should--enjoy similar levels of approval among my distinguished colleagues across the aisle.  I also wish for people to learn more about Judge Gorsuch personally and to tell some stories about growing up in It is a story about how a young man from Denver, CO, through his own hard work and academic excellence, rose to the highest echelons of the legal profession and to the nearly universal acclaim of Democrats and  A fourth-generation Coloradan, Neil Gorsuch learned the value of hard work at a young age from his grandfathers. His maternal grandfather, Joseph McGill, began his adult life by working in Union Station, the main railway terminal in From there, McGill put himself through medical school and became a prominent surgeon. With his wife, Dorothy Jean, McGill raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life to and put through college.  Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration. After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through undergraduate and law school at the University of Denver by driving a trolley car. Upon graduation, John built a law practice focusing on real estate law. He also made time to help Denver's welfare department and participate in the Kiwanis Club and numerous other civic organizations. Later, John started what was at one time one of the largest law firms in Denver, Gorsuch Kirgis, where he practiced well into his eighties.  It was this family work ethic that drove Neil to get his hands dirty and pursue blue collar jobs at a young age. In Colorado, he moved furniture, he shoveled snow, he mowed lawns, and he even shoveled some more snow in the great State of It was this work ethic--and a lot of shoveling of snow--combined with his family's appreciation of higher education that helped Neil consistently realize academic excellence.  By now, I think this Chamber is well familiar with Judge Gorsuch's sterling academic credentials, receiving his undergraduate degree at Columbia, law school at Harvard, Ph.at I don't think any of us can forget, nor should we, the fact that he spent a summer at the University of  Intellect alone doesn't get you through the halls of these storied academic institutions. It requires hard work, independence--two values of the West; two values in addition to many other western values that Judge Gorsuch holds.  It is these values, these western perspectives that the Supreme Court desperately needs to grow. Judge Gorsuch is a lifelong outdoorsman. He enjoys fly fishing and skiing. In fact, I have been told that he is a double black diamond skier. His wife, Louise, cares for animals in a small barn on his land.  In addition to his love of the outdoors and his appreciation of nature's beauty, Judge Gorsuch understands the complex legal issues facing westerners and our Western  Since 2006, Judge Gorsuch served on the Federal court that covers the Tenth Circuit Court based out of Denver that covers six other Western States--Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico, Wyoming, and Those States represent nearly 20 percent of the land of the continental United  His service on this court has provided him with a unique understanding of public lands, water, and Tribal issues that many of the other Western States in the region face. Some of the most complex legal challenges in water law and others come before his court as a result. That experience would serve all of our Western States well when utilized from the U.Supreme  Over the coming days, I plan, along with many of my other colleagues, to elaborate on why Gorsuch's western values and perspective make him an outstanding choice for the U.Supreme I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure he gets a timely up-or-down vote. From the highest echelons of the legal field to the Tenth Circuit Court, to the U.Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch would make us proud, and he would serve this country well.

5990,topic-id,703,"Mr.President, I rise to oppose the American Health Care This bill will destroy the Affordable Care Act, even though the Affordable Care Act has given more Americans access to quality, affordable healthcare than ever before in our history. It would force middle-class families to pay more money for less care. It would leave more people uninsured by a lot. It would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans with what is essentially an age tax, as if our parents and grandparents don't already pay insurance companies enough for their care.  It would cause many working families to lose coverage from their employers because, under this new bill, companies would no longer have to provide their workers with healthcare, and without a mandate to do so, we know many of them will not.  It would drastically cut Medicaid funding, which would cripple our State budgets and would leave many seniors in nursing homes and lower income New Yorkers stuck without a way to pay for the medical care they actually need to survive. This bill would also take away healthcare for millions of women, including lifesaving healthcare services like breast exams and pap smears.  On top of all of this, as if to add insult to injury, this so-called healthcare plan would give tax breaks to health insurance CEOs who make more than[[Page S1654]]$500,000 a year. How is any of this going to make people in my State or in my colleagues' States healthier?  I am struggling to understand, amid all of the problems we seem to have and all of the problems we need to solve in this Chamber, why this Congress seems to have a singular fixation on taking away access to healthcare from some of the most vulnerable people in our communities. I continue to be amazed by how little empathy there seems to be in this Chamber for the millions of women, older Americans, and lower income Americans who do not have the incredible resources that we have here in Congress and who desperately need the Federal programs this bill will cut.  The legislation is completely out of touch with the actual needs of the people in my It is driven by ideology, as if it is somehow the wrong thing to do to help people in our States live healthy and fulfilling lives.  If someone is diagnosed with cancer and the only way he can afford to see an oncologist and have surgery is through an Affordable Care Act health plan, do you think he cares whether his insurance coverage was made possible by ObamaCare? If your parents or grandparents suffer from dementia and the only way they can afford the constant care and medical attention is if they sign up for Medicaid, do you think they care that Medicaid is a program that is actually run by the Federal Government?  I don't think families care about that. I think they are much more concerned about whether they have access to the insurance plans that actually cover their needs, that actually treat their illnesses, that actually give them the medicines they need, and that allow them to heal and get back to full strength.  That is why the Affordable Care Act has done so many good things for people in our States--because access to healthcare is a human right. Now that millions more Americans finally have it, it is wrong to take it away from them.  I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to think much more about the women in their lives who need access to these preventive healthcare services, to think about all of the hard-working Americans who do not earn a lot, though they work full-time jobs and cannot afford it, and to think about all of the older Americans who are really being disadvantaged through this bill so they will not be able to afford that 24/7 or nursing care they need. This bill harms all of them, and it makes their lives much harder, not easier.  I implore all of my colleagues to reject this bill.

6249,topic-id,3771,"Mr.Speaker, we had a resignation now that seems to be the big news of the day of a Cabinet member of the Trump administration.  It is interesting to have seen this Indivisible movement arise. The Daily Signal points out: `` . . . Ties to George Soros, Sows Division Against Trump, GOP Lawmakers.''  ``Democrats who used to work on Capitol Hill are helping to disrupt Republican lawmakers' town hall meetings across the country through a nationwide effort to oppose and `resist' President Donald Trump's agenda.''  And it goes on to talk about some of the leftists who are trying to do that.  And another article that says that the Indivisible team is trying to mimic strategies of the Tea But it was quite a difference. The Taxed Enough Already Party was grabbing hold of American principles, constitutional principles, principles that brought about the revolution and served the country well for over 200 years; and that we are supposed to have a government that works for us, not works us; takes away our religious freedom, tries to take away Second Amendment freedom, tries to take away freedom of religion; tells us we can't say anything negative about anything they care about or they will try to destroy us, our business. And there were people that were shocked. And then on top of it all, add a lot more tax. And as the President told Joe the Plumber, in essence: We need to take your income and spread it around the country.  I had some friends here during the inauguration. I took them to the Lincoln And, of course, on the south inside wall is the Gettysburg On the inside of the north wall is the second inaugural that is so profound. Mark Levin's father has a terrific book about it. What an amazing speech.  Lincoln is talking just shortly before his assassination. But the second inaugural, the war is winding down, it is about over, and there is so much hope abounding. He was not bitter. He was an amazing man, our first Republican He talked about the Nation and about how both the north and south both read the same Bible and both pray to the same He points out that the prayers of both could not be answered, the prayers of neither have been fully answered. But he points out that it might seem strange that a group of people would invoke God's name to wrench their bread out of the sweat of other people's brow.  But I heard enough from people in the Taxed Enough Already Party, this group that arose that--wait a minute--basically are saying when the President says, I am going to take your money that you made and spread it around, he is basically saying, Look, I am going to be the most powerful man in the world, and certainly in this country, and my principles dictate; I need to take what you work for and spread it around to other people.  Is that a way of wrenching your bread from the sweat of others?  It is interesting. But anyway, this group had 17 show up at an office. Obviously, they were more interested in publicity than a meeting, because all they had to do is call and we make sure they have a meeting and somebody is there to meet them, even though I am here in Washington when they demand to meet.  Apparently groups all over the country are following this Soros-funded effort to try to destroy the country, disrupt the country, and create anarchy and mayhem wherever they can. Fortunately, in east Texas, people realize we can't quite go as far as some groups do because nobody would accept it. I have got some constituents that are asking legitimate questions.  But what we go back to is what really gave strength to this movement, objecting to what was being done in the Obama administration, was when we had a President and a Speaker who were saying: We know that a majority of Americans don't want this ObamaCare, Affordable Care It is hard to call it affordable care because it is such a misnomer. But we see the polls. A majority of the American people don't want it, but we are going to stick you with it anyway because it is part of our agenda.  That is what was really bothering people. The thing is that this so-called Indivisible and groups like this are terrific at coming up with names that are anathema to what they really are. So you have a group called Indivisible, and their goal is completely dividing and destroying the constitutional principles of  But the thing is, a majority didn't want ObamaCare passed. It was shoved down their throats, even though most of the people in this body here had not even read it. I read it. It scared me. I am still asking for answers.  Why did President Obama need a commissioned and noncommissioned Presidential officer corps that he could call up. Initially, it sounded like a medical emergency group, but then it said they would be trained. It didn't say with weapons or with what. And it said the President would be able to call them up for any international emergency, and it didn't mention the word ``health'' or ``medical'' on that.  So, anyway, there is just so much in there that we didn't need. Most of Americans didn't want it and didn't like it. And it took away people's health insurance from them.  I was talking with thousands of people in my district. I love to do telephone townhalls with my district. This was one segment. About a third of the district last night was represented in this group, and I will have others coming up in the future. But it is very helpful to me because I can talk to people that you wouldn't see, you wouldn't hear, wouldn't see or hear you if you had 40 people come to a townhall, like sometimes do.  And since we know that there are groups out there that have instructions to create mayhem, disrupt, accuse them of racism--it is in the documents that we are seeing--whatever they bring up, charge racism, corruption, and something else, we can have a telephone townhall and I can find out what people are thinking that I otherwise wouldn't hear from.  I thought about doing a mailer to mail to as many in my district that I could, but the costs were just so dramatic. I could do it, but why spend $100,000-plus of taxpayer dollars just to find out what my district is thinking?  I think the best indication of what people in each congressional district in the country are thinking is what happened in the November election. That is the ultimate poll that anybody could ever take. And I have having been talking about for 6 years that ObamaCare needed to be repealed, that it takes away choice, that it is costing more money. You don't get to keep your doctor, you don't get to keep your insurance policy; and so many thousands in my district did not.                              {time}  1830  And so it was very helpful to hear from people, for example, how many believe the government needs to be more involved in health insurance, and I think that was at like 97 percent. There were thousands of people that had been called. But anyway, it gives me feedback.  It was interesting to note that this group, this indivisible group, the websites had gotten some information about the messages going back and forth, and one of them is, when we demand that they have a townhall that we can disrupt and they say we are going to have a telephone townhall because we can reach a lot more people, people that are invalids or homebound, seniors that couldn't get out to a personal townhall meeting can participate in the telephone townhall. They are saying how do we respond to that when there are so many more people they can reach and hear from and it helps the disabled to do these telephone townhalls, how do we respond to that? And they really didn't get a good answer, last I saw.  But it is important for every Representative to know where their district stands, where their people stand, and I continue to believe that I am the most fortunate Member of this 435-seat body because of whom I get to represent.  I had an opponent last year raising Cain about I was on national media so much, and I mean, when I think about it, why would national media want me to be on? It is certainly not my looks, certainly not because I have such an incredible voice.  You know, I would love to have a voice like James Earl Jones, or I was just so moved at the Senate Chaplain speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast a couple of weeks ago. I would love to have a voice like I think maybe God's voice may sound like[[Page H1172]]some day when I get to hear it, but I don't. I don't have a voice like that. This is what I have got. I don't put on any airs.  Why would any national media want to have me on? And I think it would have to have something to do with the fact that I represent extraordinary people in Texas where sense is very common, just so much common sense, and I think a lot of the country likes hearing about the way three-fourths of my district thinks. I think I reflect that district, and that is why, basically, three-fourths of the district voted for me. It is not because of the way I look or sound.  Even people that can't stand me in that 25 or 26 percent, they know I am going to stand up and do what I told people I am going to do. It is just that some people don't like it. Some years back, one guy wrote that I was a moron and misspelled ``moron.'' If he is listening, Mr.Speaker, he needs to know there is no E in moron.  But in any event, it is interesting to see how frantic things have gotten and how destructive some of the forces in this country have gotten in trying to bring down the principles that made us great, and it is quite disconcerting.  That leads me to a point I want to discuss, which we had the news, the tragic failing of the dam in We will continue, those of us who believe in the power of prayer, to pray that there will be no loss of life, despite the negligence of the California government in refusing for over 12 years--apparently, at least 12 years--to heed the warnings that this dam was going to be failing at some point. They needed to do something. We just need to pray that the negligence that occurred in the New Orleans area in diverting money away from shoring up the levee would not end up having the mass cost of loss of life in  But as we continue to have people try to disrupt our congressional districts, continue to try to make so much noise, create so much anarchy that it creates an inability to govern properly--despite the fact it isn't going to work--this President, this administration, and this Congress is not going to be diverted from what needs to be done.  This article came out today from the Free Beacon, by Adam Kredo: ``Former Obama Officials, Loyalists Waged Secret Campaign to Oust Flynn.''  Now, I hadn't known Flynn before. I don't believe I had met him before maybe last I might have, but I don't believe I have before that. But I had a chance to visit with him at that point with, at that time, Donald Trump, now our He is an interesting man. He has served his country well.  But there are issues that are coming out now about discussions with It would seem to me, if President Trump had an intelligence community and had people in the government service around him, the career people that were really wanting to help the country--rather than the Democrats or President Obama as he went out--that were really interested in helping the best interests of the United States of America, they would want the President to have all of the information that anyone in any of the upper echelons or anywhere in the departments that work for President Trump--wouldn't they want their boss to know or have the most accurate information?  Apparently, there was information out there that didn't come to light until President Trump had selected his National Security He had been sworn in as the National Security Adviser, and they were on a roll. And of course, one of the things General Flynn was concerned about, something that is a deep concern of so many of ours in this body, was the outrageous Iran treaty that got treated like it wasn't a treaty. It was, indeed, a treaty. It never got ratified by the Senate, but it was, indeed, a treaty. It had all of the things in it that treaties would have.  But this article goes on: ``The abrupt resignation Monday evening of White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is the culmination of a secret, months-long campaign by former Obama administration confidantes to handicap President Donald Trump's national security apparatus and preserve the nuclear deal with Iran, according to multiple sources both in and out of the White House who described to the Washington Free Beacon a behind-the-scenes effort by these officials to plant a series of damaging stories about Flynn in the national media.  ``The effort, said to include former Obama administration adviser Ben Rhodes--the architect of a separate White House effort to create what he described as a pro-Iran echo chamber--included a small task force of Obama loyalists who deluged media outlets with stories aimed at eroding Flynn's credibility, multiple sources revealed.  ``The operation primarily focused on discrediting Flynn, an opponent of the Iran nuclear deal, in order to handicap the Trump administration's efforts to disclose secret details of the nuclear deal with Iran that had been long hidden by the Obama administration.''  Mr.Speaker, I want to insert here, some of us went down to the classified area of the SCIF where we can review classified information and we reviewed what was available about the Iran deal, but we found out there was a lot of secret stuff that the administration would not allow us to know: what he had given away, what he had done, potential bad judgment in going so far out of the Obama administration's way to placate and assist the largest supporters of terrorism in the world.  Obviously, what this article is talking about, some secret parts of the agreement, those are things that we were certainly not allowed to read no matter who you were in Congress at the time.  But this says: ``Insiders familiar with the anti-Flynn campaign told the Free Beacon that these Obama loyalists plotted in the months before Trump's inauguration to establish a set of roadblocks before Trump's national security team, which includes several prominent opponents of diplomacy with The Free Beacon first reported on this effort in  ``Sources who spoke to the Free Beacon requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the situation and avoid interfering with the White House's official narrative about Flynn, which centers on his failure to adequately inform the president about a series of phone calls with Russian officials.  ``Flynn took credit for his missteps regarding these phone calls in a brief statement released late Monday evening. Trump administration officials subsequently stated that Flynn's efforts to mislead the president and vice president about his contacts with Russia could not be tolerated.  ``However, multiple sources closely involved in the situation pointed to a larger, more secretive campaign aimed at discrediting Flynn and undermining the Trump White  ``'It's undeniable that the campaign to discredit Flynn was well underway before Inauguration Day, with a very troublesome and politicized series of leaks designed to undermine him,' said one veteran national security adviser with close ties to the White House team. `This pattern reminds me of the lead up to the Iran deal, and probably features the same cast of characters.'''  And we know from news that has come out since the Iran deal was made by this administration, we know that some of the same placaters that enabled North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the Clinton administration were involved in negotiating this deal with The deal with North Korea was to stop them from getting nuclear weapons, and so my interpretation of the deal was basically this:  They promised them: We will give you everything you need to develop nuclear weapons in North Korea if you will just sign a piece of paper that says you won't do that.  The Clinton administration, some of the same people that ran to do a deal with Iran, they jumped on that. And so what happens, North Korea uses what we provided them to help create nuclear weapons. Big shock.  So it is a big shock that the Obama administration would send at least one of those original people to be the top negotiator with Secretary of State John Kerry, who never saw a Genghis Khan that he couldn't work with, and they work out a deal. We still haven't found out all of the arrangements, all of the things that were done; but we know that there is, apparently, something so sinister about what this country has done, bent over backwards to provide for Iran or allow Iran to do, that the Obama administration could[[Page H1173]]not allow right-thinking American people to know what it had done for Iran and against Israel and the United States' best interests.  But if you believe the best interests of the United States are to weaken the United States, if you believe that the United States has been the biggest problem in the world for the last 100 years, then you would think, well, then if we make a deal with Iran that weakens the United States, may even lead to our demise, the world is a better place. So it is ultimately for the good of the world because the United States is certainly weaker than it has been in decades, going back to pre-World War II military strength.  The Chinese economy, it was announced at one point, may have exceeded ours. I am not sure that is true.                              {time}  1845  Anyway, countries around the world that are threats to world peace have gotten stronger. ISIS has gotten stronger during this President's term, in fact, came into being under President Obama and got quite strong, thousands upon thousands of lives lost.  In Afghanistan, he took a war that he told people--the voters in 2008--was the important war. And what should have been just a housekeeping operation under his leadership and with his rules of engagement, it cost about four times more American military lives than were lost in the height of the Afghan war for 7\1/2\ years under President It must be something in the leadership there when one President loses four times more military members than the prior President in the same length of time and the latter President being when the war was supposed to be basically over.  This article points out that:  ``Flynn had been preparing to publicize many of the details about the nuclear deal that had been intentionally hidden by the Obama administration as part of its effort to garner support for the deal, these sources said.  ``Flynn is now `gone before anybody can see what happened' with these secret agreements, said the second insider close to Flynn and the White  ``Sources in and out of the White House are concerned that the campaign against Flynn will be extended to other prominent figures in the Trump administration.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, I can inject here: Whoever these sources are that are concerned the campaign against Flynn be extended to other prominent figures, I can guarantee them that people in and outside the United States Government right now, as I speak, will do everything within their power--some of these characters will--to prevent President Trump from getting us back on track to making the world a safer place, to getting Iran back in the little box that President Carter let them out of. They are going to go after lots of people. It is not going to be limited. This apparently is a campaign that is going to be ongoing.  Apparently, General Flynn messed up and wasn't completely honest when he should have been. A President has got to be able to trust his security adviser. That kind of goes without saying. The President has to be able to trust those people.  It takes me back to September when I was talking--it was right before General Flynn walked up, actually ironically. But I was telling: Look, I like President George He is a good man. He is a smart guy. He is a lot smarter than people give him credit. He is one of the wittiest people you can ever have a conversation with, but something that hurt him--and I wanted Donald Trump to understand this--something that hurt him was that he was such a nice guy. After the election was over, he made it known, in essence, that everything that happened in the past is bygones. What is happening now, from now on, we are going forward.  The trouble is he had people doing bad acts, even crimes like having FBI files at the White Chuck Colson went to prison a year and a half for having one. The Clinton administration had nearly a thousand; nobody did a day.  I said, you have got to clean out these departments, these agencies where Bush didn't clean them out. You have got to or they are going to undermine you the whole time you are And it looks like we are seeing that right now.  So, Mr.Speaker, I just encourage all my colleagues to let's give the Trump administration the chance to help get this country safer, freer, and just a better place to live. It is not going to happen while people are undermining the President from within his own administration and a little cabal that has those ties in this administration. It is time to clean house, and General Flynn is not who I am talking about.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-14-pt1-PgH1170.txt,1801,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6302,topic-id,1183,"Mr.President, it is because of ObamaCare that the health insurance markets in this country are badly damaged. They have gotten worse each year. They are now near collapse.  You were told 8 years ago that if you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Millions can't. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Millions of Americans were not able to keep their doctor. You were told that your health insurance premiums would go down $2,500. They have actually gone up probably $3,500. Some people don't have a choice in plans. Some counties don't even have a plan in the exchange. If you could get a plan, you might not be able to afford it. If you could afford the plan, you might not be able to use it because of the high copayments you have to have. So it is not a very good situation.  It took 6 years for the health insurance market to get as bad as I just described. It will take time for those markets to be restored. The next few years in health care will be challenging if ObamaCare is repealed or even if it is not repealed. If ObamaCare is not repealed, it will be even longer before Americans have access to a functioning health insurance market and the insurance plans they want.  When it comes to health care, every second counts. We owe it to the American people who are sick or who could get sick, as well as families and businesses trying to plan for the future, to start fixing that problem right now. That is the result of the election. That is what the Senate is going to do.  The Affordable Care Act, which could more appropriately be called the Unaffordable Care Act, has been a case of over-promise and under-delivery. People were told that their premiums would go down and that if they liked their doctor, their hospital, or their health care plan, they could keep all of it. The reality is much different. More than half of the country had two or fewer insurance plans from which to choose this year. Some regions had no insurance plans available at all. Even those who were strong supporters of the health care law, like the Minnesota Governor whom I like to quote, have[[Page S106]]said the Affordable Care Act ``is no longer affordable to many Americans.''  In my State of Iowa, the Affordable Care Act premium increases this year were over 40 percent for many individuals. Few people, of course, can afford that. Families that did manage to purchase Affordable Care Act insurance found that they could no longer afford to use it.  One Iowan recently called my office and told me that his premiums have increased 400 percent in 3 years. He also said that his deductible went up to--can you believe it--$14,000. Last year, one of his children had a major medical problem, and they had to pay for all of that care out of their pocket--not from the insurance. The family paid $12,000 for the Affordable Care Act insurance, which did not pay for any health care. Of course, that just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  The problem is that the Affordable Care Act did nothing to address the underlying causes of the high cost of health care; that is, what it costs for a hospital or a doctor to purchase or maintain medical equipment, purchase medicines, carry malpractice insurance, and a lot of other costs they have.  Rather than address the actual cost to care, President Obama and his colleagues chose to bypass real health care reform for an unsustainable entitlement and bureaucratic mandates that have priced people out of the health insurance market, rather than provide those same people with affordable and quality coverage.  So we are at it now. It is time for real health care reform, not the misguided policies that we were promised 8 years ago that now have turned out to be what I describe as misguided policies. It is time to deliver to Americans what we were promised. It is time to provide accessible, affordable health care to all But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to work with us. They know that the Affordable Care Act is falling apart. They know it is unaffordable.  As we have heard in speeches this week, the other side is trying to distract attention from the Affordable Care Act collapse by using scare tactics, like you recently heard. It is time for the Democrats to step up, instead of doubling down. It is time for statesmanship, not gamesmanship. It is time for the Democrats to stop defending the ``un-Affordable Care Act'' and deliver Americans what was promised.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Trump administration to deliver affordable health care to all Americans in the tradition of the Senate, which is what didn't happen in 2009. It was strictly a one-party program put before the Congress to pass. That is why it has failed--because so many of the people who could have made a good bill pass in 2009 were shut out of the process because this body had 60 Democratic Members and they didn't have to pay any attention to  They spent maybe 8 or 9 months trying to work with the Republicans to negotiate a bipartisan deal. But before that was completed, they said: Take it or leave it. The Republican minority at that time was not going to be dictated to, and we were pushed out of the room.  Then what ended up being the Affordable Care Act was written in the big black hole of Senate Majority Leader Reid's office, without the bipartisan input which has made so many social programs in America successful. I would name the Social Security I would name civil rights legislation, Medicare legislation, and Medicaid legislation, which all had broad bipartisan support to get them passed. In the case of the Civil Rights Act, a higher proportion of Republicans voted for it than Democrats voted for it--just one example.  That is the tradition of the Senate when you have major social legislation that has been successful, and that is why the Affordable Care Act was not successful--because it was strictly a partisan approach that was used to have it become law.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

6093,topic-id,472,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of a joint resolution disapproving of a Department of the Interior regulation known as the stream protection rule.  Through this action, my Republican colleagues are now attempting to repeal a thoughtful and thoroughly vetted regulation that reflects current science, technology, and mining practices in order to better protect people and the environment from the negative impacts of mountaintop removal mining. This regulation took 7 years to develop and updates a 30-year-old coal mining regulation.  This regulation is not, as we have seen coming out of the administration of late, some fly-by-night executive order, but rather a serious attempt by serious people to make us a healthier and more environmentally conscious nation.  However, what we see here today is business as usual for the Republican majority--turning a blind eye to science in order to help wealthy polluters at the expense of the public's health and the environment. Just because my friends' unending attempts to normalize such misguided governance have become almost numbing in their effect does not make such attempts any less appalling to those of us who believe in the scientific method and a clean and safe environment.  Indeed, the paucity of care that we see here today in ridding the books of a regulation that hardworking and good people took 7 years to write with, mind you, input from all stakeholders, is starting to look like a variation of a theme when we consider the paucity of care the Republicans in the White House have exhibited over the past 10 days.  As everyone knows, last Friday, President Trump issued an executive order banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the United States and callously shutting down the refugee program. What ensued, and I predict will continue to ensue as we speak here today, was nothing short of chaos. Scores and scores of people were detained for hours, including green card holders, children, the elderly, and even Iraqi translators who had helped the United States during the insurgency.  Equally as horrifying as this Muslim ban that is the antithesis of everything we value as Americans is the ineptitude in which such a sweeping policy was implemented. Relevant agencies were not even consulted. In fact, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, found out about the executive order on the phone while on a Coast Guard plane heading back to Secretary Mattis was also left off the list of those consulted. Had he been on it, he would have almost certainly expressed the sentiment he expressed during the campaign, mainly that the Muslim ban would cause great damage and send shock waves through the international community.

A ``no'' vote on the previous question will give us the opportunity to overturn this order. A ``yes'' vote means that the House will do nothing to stop Trump's executive action.  The American people watching this debate should take notice to see how their Representatives vote on this important motion, and they should hold their elected officials accountable.

6278,topic-id,1706,"Madam President, I rise today in support of 3 and the ongoing effort to repeal the most harmful elements of the so-called Affordable Care  While our friends on the other side of the aisle have been trying to convince the American people that there is nothing to see here and that this poorly named law is working according to plan, the vast majority of our citizens know the truth: ObamaCare just doesn't work.  According to the results of a recent Gallup poll, 80 percent of Americans want Congress to either change the Affordable Care Act significantly or repeal and replace it altogether. Let me repeat that. Eight out of every 10 people in this country agree that the status quo is unacceptable and that we need a major change in what is going on around here.  We need a major course correction in our health care system. It is not hard to see why this is the case. After all, under ObamaCare, the cost of health insurance has increased dramatically and will continue to do so well into the future. Under ObamaCare, individuals and families are being left with fewer and fewer choices when it comes to buying health insurance. Under ObamaCare, patients have fewer options and reduced access to health care providers. Under ObamaCare, the American people have been hit with steep taxes, burdensome mandates, and a health care system that simply does not meet their needs.  This year alone, premiums in the benchmark plan for the ObamaCare exchanges have gone up by an average of 25 percent, and in some parts of the country, the increases have been significantly larger than that. In addition, over the past 2 years, insurance plans have been dropping out of markets all over the country. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of the counties in the United States will have two or fewer available health insurance plans on the exchanges--and that is this year--and about a third of them have only one available option.  I am quite certain that every single Member of this Chamber has heard from a number of their constituents about these problems, about the problems they have faced as the Affordable Care Act has been implemented. I know I have. A number of Utahns have written to me to express their concerns about the increases in their insurance premiums. For example, last month, Austin from Provo, UT, told me that due to the growing cost of his insurance plan, ``I'm going to have to drop the insurance and face the penalty next year. I'm worried because, as a young husband and father, I'm barely making ends meet, and I'm not sure I can afford to pay the penalty for not having insurance.'' Similarly, Eryn from Spanish Fork, UT, noted that because her family's previous insurer dropped out of the Utah marketplace, the remaining plan that best met her family's needs was ``a plan with a small list of in-network providers and no coverage for out-of-network providers.'' She continued, saying that under this new plan, ``We will have a higher deductible ($13,000 for the family), we will have to pay the full cost of any visit to the doctor . . . and we will not be able to save as much money in our Health Savings Account each month because of the high premiums, which add up to $11,000 a year. . . . The premium is basically another mortgage payment for us, only we have no property to show for it. This is too much.''  No family should have to choose between paying their mortgage and paying for their health insurance. Yet, with all of ObamaCare's failures and broken promises, families throughout the country are currently having to make those kinds of choices.  Unfortunately, it does not get any better from here, not without a major change to the status quo. In fact, I think it is safe to say that if we fail to act, the worst is yet to come. Therefore, it is only fitting that we begin this new Congress by repealing ObamaCare and setting the stage for workable reforms that will actually bring down costs, provide more options, and let the American people--and not Washington bureaucrats--make their own health care choices. The budget resolution before us is the first step in this effort.  As we all know, the resolution contains reconciliation instructions to the relevant committees, including the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair, to draft legislation to repeal So after approving this resolution, the next step will be for the Finance Committee, the HELP Committee, as well as the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees over in the House, to get to work on putting together a repeal package. This process will be more difficult than it sounds. We don't want to be reckless, and we don't want to inflict more harm on the American people or our health care system; therefore, in addition to repealing ObamaCare, the legislation we draft pursuant to this budget resolution will have to include a stable transition period to give us the time and space we need to provide more sensible reforms.  Under the budget resolution, the legislation to repeal ObamaCare and provide that transition period will need to be reported to the Budget Committee by January 27. Then both the House and Senate will debate the legislation, hopefully passing it by simple majority votes and sending it to the desk of the incoming Once we pass this repeal legislation, we will come to the most important step in the process: replacing ObamaCare with a health care system worthy of the American people.  This will not be a simple endeavor. It is going to take a great deal of work, and it will almost certainly require the efforts of people from both parties. The Finance Committee is going to have a[[Page S92]]major role to play throughout this process of repealing ObamaCare, providing for a secure transition, and replacing the law with more effective reforms. Our committee has jurisdiction over all the major Federal health programs, including Medicare and In addition, we will have jurisdiction over the tax provisions, which include all of ObamaCare's harmful taxes as well as the premium tax credits provided to purchase plans in the ObamaCare exchanges.  I have spoken at length to my Republican colleagues on the Finance Committee about these issues, and all of them are ready and willing to do whatever is necessary to put our Nation's health care system on a more responsible path. We are going to get it done. In that I have no doubts.  To be sure, the first few steps in this effort are going to happen quickly. Once again, the plan is to produce repeal legislation before the end of this month. This, of course, is how it has to be. The American people don't have the time for us to wait around on these issues, and we don't have the luxury of sitting back and watching the problems get worse over time. The problems facing our health care system are growing by the day. We need to take the swiftest possible action.  We intend to act quickly and methodically to begin providing relief for the millions of Americans who are currently suffering as a result of ObamaCare and the unworkable system it has created. As I noted, if that effort is going to be successful, it should be bipartisan. Both Congress and the incoming administration will need to work together.                          Cabinet Nominations  On that point, Madam President, I do want to note that my friends on the other side of the aisle have as recently as this morning made a number of statements and issued several demands with regard to the process for considering and confirming the President-elect's Cabinet nominees. According to my colleagues' statements, they want multiple rounds of hearings on every nominee, which, by the way, is unprecedented. This morning, they even went further, issuing demands that certain preconditions be met before hearings could even be held on a particular nomination. These tactics are, to put it bluntly, preposterous. My colleagues are certainly free to oppose any nominee and to try to convince others to do the same. It is unfortunate that they have decided to go further by politicizing the process by which we consider nominations.  Speaking for the Senate Finance Committee, I have to say that we have an established set of vetting procedures for all executive branch nominees. Republicans and Democrats alike have those particular procedures. That process has been in place for decades and has traditionally been bipartisan.  By all accounts, the Finance Committee's longstanding vetting process is exceptionally thorough and fair, and it is deeply regrettable that some of our colleagues would try to undermine that process and not provide the incoming Trump administration's nominees the same respect and regard our committee has provided for nominees in the Obama administration and prior administrations as well. As chairman, I take this process very seriously. I have made no efforts to abbreviate or short-circuit our procedures for any nominee and have no intention of doing so in the future. I am certain all of our chairmen here in the Senate can say the same thing.  My hope is that my colleagues will stop politicizing this process at every step and allow the Senate to function as it has under both Republican and Democratic administrations. My friends on the other side may not like the results of the recent election, but their disappointment of the outcome is no justification for reinventing the way we do business here in the  I hope we will all take this into consideration and we will start cooperating with each other and get this government moving again and that we will support and sustain these people who are qualified and good people who are being chosen by the Trump-elect administration. I think it is important that we do these things and do them carefully and that we treat each other with the respect that is well deserved in this body. I hope that the petty, cheap politics will be discontinued.  Mr.President, with that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Hoeven).

6007,topic-id,1464,"Mr.President, it seems appropriate that we are debating the nomination of Seema Verma to head the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services the same week Republicans in Congress introduce a plan to dismantle the Affordable Care  Over the past 8 years, President Obama and the Democratic Party have been fighting to make sure that everyone in this country has access to affordable, quality health insurance. President Trump and his allies in Congress do not share this commitment. Instead of debating how best to expand access, they are fighting with each other to see just how many people they can kick off insurance rolls--all in a crusade, apparently, to save some people money.  This is not a crusade to improve the lives of as many Americans as possible. It is a crusade to serve their radical antigovernment ideology. In fact, ``ideology over people'' is a useful shorthand to describe the first 2 months of the Trump administration.  The problem with their ideological debates is that people are left out of the debate. Do we really know what it is like to be without health insurance? Under the plan to repeal the ACA, 20 million people in our country will be without health insurance, without healthcare. What if you were one of those people?  This question is not an academic one for me. I know what it is like to live without health insurance. When my mom brought my brothers and me to this country--I am an immigrant--her job did not provide health benefits. My greatest fear growing up as a little girl in this country was that my mom would not be able to go to work if she got sick. If she wasn't able to go to work, where would money for food and rent come from?  That is not the kind of fear we want to impose on millions of children in our country, but we will be doing just that to the 20 million people and their families who gained health insurance under the Affordable Care Act--many, for the first time in their lives. They did not have to be worried every single day that their child or their parents would be sick and would not be able to afford the care that they needed. This is not an academic exercise for any of them. They will be hurt by what we are being asked to do. It is not an academic exercise for the millions more who will lose their insurance coverage under  But no one should be surprised. This administration and their allies in Congress continue to demonstrate a commitment to alternative facts. If you believe their alternative facts, TrumpCare would improve healthcare access for working families, seniors and women, and Americans would have, as the President said, ``much better healthcare for much less money.''  But in reality, TrumpCare will do the opposite. TrumpCare would end by 2020 the ACA's Medicaid expansion that millions of people in our country depend on every day. The expansion not[[Page S1663]]only provided health coverage to millions of people for the first time, but it also helped to keep hospitals in rural and underserved communities from closing down. These rural hospitals exist all across the country. In its place, TrumpCare would change how States receive Medicaid funding, and it would do so in a way that ensures that these programs cannot keep pace with the rising cost of health insurance in their counties and in our country.  Under this new system, States would have less money to spend on Medicaid recipients and face the prospect of tightening eligibility and slashing benefits. This would be particularly devastating in Hawaii, where we saw the number of people enrolled in Medicaid grow by nearly 20 percent under the Medicaid has had a transformative impact on tens of thousands of lives in Hawaii and millions of others across the country.  Anne from Oahu walked into the Kokua Kalihi Valley Clinic 3 years ago. She had no health insurance, and she was pregnant at the age of 15. The doctors at the clinic helped Anne apply for Medicaid, which helped her afford prenatal care, gave her support to stay healthy and, very importantly, to stay in school.  Medicaid helped Anne and her husband Dan, age 17, welcome a healthy baby boy named Today, Anne is a graduate of Farrington High School, works part time, and has plans to become a pediatric nurse practitioner. Anne, Dan, and Joseph now have insurance through Dan's employer.  Reducing access to this critical program is wrong. Trying to convince the American people they would be better off with the results of these kinds of drastic negative changes to Medicare and Medicaid is yet another alternative fact.  I am encouraged that four of my Republican colleagues spoke out forcefully against any bill that would eliminate the ACA's Medicaid expansion. We need more Republicans of conscience to make their voices heard on this important issue.  TrumpCare would also be devastating for seniors in Hawaii and across the country. Under TrumpCare, insurance companies would be able to charge older Americans up to five times more for an equivalent health plan than they would be able to charge a younger person. For a President and a party that professes to hate taxes so much, they don't seem to have a problem with what amounts to an age tax.  TrumpCare's changes to Medicaid would also have devastating consequences for States like Hawaii, where our rapidly aging population depends on Medicaid to pay for nursing home and other care. The President made the American people a promise--that his healthcare plan would not touch But the cumulative effect of TrumpCare's assault on our seniors--our kupuna--would force the Medicare trust fund to go broke 4 years sooner than expected. For reference, the ACA extended the life of the Medicare trust fund by 10 years.  This would have a devastating impact for seniors like Anne and Lanny Bruder from Lanny is 80 years old and working three jobs to make ends meet. He has had two knee replacements and a heart attack. Anne has glaucoma and pays a lot of money out of pocket for her prescription eye drops. They can't afford to pay more for their health insurance, which is exactly what is going to happen under  TrumpCare would also have a profoundly negative impact on women across the country. The President's plan would completely zero out funding for Planned This lifegiving, lifesaving organization would no longer be eligible for Medicaid reimbursements or Federal family planning, which would leave a $500 million hole in their budget.  Republicans continue to claim falsely that community health centers would fill the gap in service left by the demise of support for Planned Parenthood--not true. Most of these community centers, whose resources are already stretched thin, do not provide women's healthcare or family planning services. In other words, they would not be able to replicate the services that Planned Parenthood provides all across the country to millions of women and families.  Planned Parenthood operates two clinics in Hawaii, one on Oahu and one on They are the forefront of innovation in increasing access to family planning services across the They launched an innovative new mobile application that would allow doctors to provide digital consultations to women on neighbor islands for the purpose of prescribing birth control. Recently, Planned Parenthood made their first delivery to the island of Molokai, a largely rural island with little permanent medical infrastructure. This is the kind of innovation we should be encouraging, and it is precisely the type of program that could get cut if Planned Parenthood loses its Federal funding.  I often say that there are people in this country getting screwed every second, minute, and hour of the day. Instead of reducing that number, which should be our goal, TrumpCare would increase the number of people who get hurt in our country. The wealthiest of the wealthy in our country would benefit because--not only would all these things happen under TrumpCare that would be devastating to families, to women, to our seniors--TrumpCare would also give a big tax break, a big tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country. They don't need that kind of tax cut. Do people making over $2 million a year really deserve another $150,000 a year in tax cuts? I don't think so.  TrumpCare would be a disaster for the middle class, I am going to do everything in my power to stop it from being the law of the land. We have come too far in the past 8 years to go backward. The first way we can fight back against this plan is by rejecting the nomination of Seema Verma, who would be in charge of implementing TrumpCare as the head of  ",CREC-2017-03-08-pt1-PgS1651-3.txt,1844,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,8.0,January

I am very pleased about the work that the gentlewoman has championed and that we intend to, together, lead around making sure that families have security for themselves and for their children.  I rise to congratulate the gentlewoman for what the gentlewoman is speaking about today, for the work that the gentlewoman has done, and to say that I remain very committed to trying to find all of the areas where we women, together, can put forward priorities that are important to us.  We do joke that, if they would just turn the keys of all elective office over to women, I think we would get a lot of things done--and no disrespect to our incredible male colleagues who have been right there with us every step of the way.

5993,topic-id,2844,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that is being considered by the  In December, I was informed that I was going to get one of my dreams to come true in the I had asked to be on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee when I came in, in January of 2013, and I was not on the committee. I had no complaints because I had other good committees, but I was told in December that, for this Congress, I would be added to the committee, and I am thrilled to serve on it.  When I found that I was going to be added to the committee, I knew one of the first issues we would be tackling is what to do about the Affordable Care So I have started to pay visits around the State to as many stakeholders as I can, including patients, doctors, medical students, hospitals, behavioral health facilities, allied health training programs in regions all across the State, military families in Hampton Roads just last Friday, as well as patients and their families in Chesterfield County last In all of these visits, my question has been: We are going to be tackling the Affordable Care Act; tell me what works, what doesn't work, and what we can do better. That has been the goal.  Today's committees in the House, two committees, are considering a plan that House Republicans have put on the table and are touting as a replacement of the Affordable Care I just want to talk about what it would mean, if passed, to Virginians and  This plan will reduce the number of Americans with insurance. We dropped the uninsurance rate to a historic low, but the gains that we made would be reversed and the numbers of Americans with insurance would go down.  It would raise healthcare costs, particularly on seniors, which I will discuss in a minute.  It would dismantle the Medicaid Program at the service of tax cuts for the wealthiest.  It is not an adequate replacement; in fact, it would be a dramatic retreat, and it would be a retreat that would violate promises that had been made by the President and other leaders.  Republicans--and I will get into this--have made a number of promises about what a replacement would look like, but this plan falls far short of that. That is why, within 36 hours of it being put on the table, stakeholders across the spectrum, including the American Hospital Association, AARP, the American Medical Association, nurses, nursing homes, and Republican Governors have come out to either dramatically and flatly oppose this plan or suggest significant concerns with it.  The bill has yet to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, but the House is trying to push it through committee, and even through the floor, if they can, before the CBO tells the American public what this plan would cost and, every bit as importantly, what it would cost Americans in terms of the number of people who would lose their health insurance.  A very poignant comment about the plan that was in the paper this morning was from the Republican Governor of Nevada, Brian Sandoval, who said: We Republican Governors have talked to Congress and said please pay attention to what we have to say. States bear a huge burden on these programs, especially He said: We gave ideas to the leadership, to the majority about the replacement, but none of our ideas are in this plan.  Without a CBO score, the American public and this body are completely in the dark about how many people will lose coverage and about how this will affect the American economy. Why would we move forward? Why would we try to push a vote even in a committee, much less on the House floor, before the CBO has given us this score? We don't serve the American public well by doing that.  What does the replacement bill do? One, it ends the expansion of Medicaid that was a core component of the Affordable Care Act--the expansion that has been embraced by more than 30 Then, it takes the traditional Medicaid Program and really dismantles it, instituting a per capita fee for enrollees, and moving it more towards a block grant program. That is the first thing it does.  Second, with respect to seniors, this plan would repeal a provision in the Affordable Care Act that says seniors cannot be charged more than three times the premium of a young person; it would repeal that, and it will allow insurers to charge older customers five times as much as younger customers. It would also give States the ability to set even more unfavorable ratios for seniors. This will have a significant impact on the premium of older  Third, the plan repeals the income-based subsidies, premium assistance, and cost-sharing reductions in the current Affordable Care Act and substitutes less generous tax credits that will not be adjusted to average costs of plans in particular markets. So if you are a middle-income individual in a high-cost market, you are really out of luck with this plan.  Let me give an example of how insurance would be affected in particular communities all over Virginia if the House plan were adopted. If you are 60 years old and you make $30,000 per year, under the House plan, here is[[Page S1655]]what happens. First, the cost of your insurance can be dramatically raised because you are not, at age 60 now, limited to three-to-one over a young person's premium; they can charge you five-to-one over a young person's premium. So the premium cost, if you are a 60-year-old making 30,000 bucks, goes up significantly.  Now, you get a tax credit, just as right now you get a subsidy, but the tax credit is much less generous. So the cost of your policy goes up, but here is what happens in communities all over Virginia--tax credit compared to the subsidy they currently get.  In 2020, in Augusta County, VA, in the Shenandoah Valley, the tax credit you get is worth only about half of the subsidy you would get if we continued the Affordable Care So the price is up, but your tax credit is less generous by half of the current subsidy.  In Fairfax, your tax credit is 41 percent less than the subsidy; in Bedford, 51 percent less than the subsidy; in the city of Norfolk, 51 percent less; in Rockingham, 50 percent less; Pittsylvania, 49 percent less, and Pulaski County in far Southwest Virginia, 54 percent less.  So if you are a senior, your costs go up, but the assistance you get in the tax credit is dramatically less generous than the assistance you currently get with the premium subsidy.  The bill establishes a penalty if you don't have continuous insurance. An insurer can charge you 30 percent more in premiums if you go 2 months or more without insurance. So if you are unemployed, you lose your insurance. If you forget to pay a premium for two months, you lose your insurance. If you have any gap of 2 months, that is an opportunity for insurers to come in and sock you with a massive penalty.  The bill repeals funding to a healthcare provider of choice for millions of American women: Planned It is really important to be specific about this. There is not in the Federal budget a line item that says Planned Parenthood gets axed. What Federal funds go to Planned Parenthood? Well, first, the Hyde amendment says no Federal funds can go to any organization for the provision of abortions--Planned Parenthood or anybody else. Planned Parenthood receives Federal funds because it provides healthcare to women who are eligible for So when Planned Parenthood treats a woman who is Medicaid-eligible for a medical service that is eligible for a Medicaid reimbursement, then Planned Parenthood is able to bill Medicaid just like a doctor's office is. And Planned Parenthood is the healthcare provider of choice for millions of American women to do annual checkups, pap smears, cervical cancer tests, and all kinds of basic healthcare provisions. But under this bill, Planned Parenthood will be disbarred from the Medicaid Program, even when they are providing services to Medicaid-eligible women--services that are covered by  The one thing about this bill that I would say--if you were going to say: Well, who is a guaranteed winner in this bill because there are a lot of losers, and I have tried to summarize them--the guaranteed winner is that this bill overwhelmingly repeals the provisions that raise revenue. This bill is a big tax cut bill.  The biggest revenue raisers in the Affordable Care Act were tax cuts on the wealthiest citizens. There is a tax increase for nonwage income by the top earners in the United States and an additional hospital insurance tax that also affected individuals of high income.  What this bill does is cut taxes that almost exclusively benefit the wealthy, while the bill is taking away these coverages and provisions that protect middle and lower income The tax cuts in this bill would save the top 0.1 percent of earners in the United States about an average of $195,000 a year. So if you are in the top 0.1 percent and this bill passes, you are going to get an average of a $195,000 tax break.  Millionaires get 80 percent of the value of the high income tax cuts in the House bill, with the elimination of the hospital insurance tax on high earners and the Medicare tax on investment income. In fact, a family who is going to do incredibly well under this bill is the family of our President, Donald As high earners, they are going to get a huge tax cut with this bill.  I have to ask: Is this bill a healthcare bill or is it basically a tax cut bill? You could look at this bill as basically being that the driver of it is who benefits from it. It is a tax cut on the wealthy, paid for by slashing Medicaid, slashing healthcare coverage, slashing Medicare's trust fund, slashing Planned Parenthood, taking protections like preexisting conditions that really matter to people and reducing them. So I have a real question about whether this bill is a healthcare bill at all or whether, under the guise of a repeal and replace of ACA, it is a tax cut for the wealthiest, financed by slashing the healthcare safety net.  Let me read to my colleagues what certain Republican leaders have said about this bill in the past. The deputy leader here in the Senate--a friend--from Texas, Senator Cornyn, said to Republican Governors--Governors have a lot at stake in this. I was a I know how much Governors depend on Medicaid and healthcare programs. Here is what he said on January 19, 2017: ``Nobody is going to lose coverage.''  No exception, no qualification. ``Nobody is going to lose coverage.'' That is what he said to the Republican  We were awaiting the CBO score suggesting potentially how many millions will lose coverage. Many people will lose coverage. That is not what was promised.  But, more importantly, probably, what did the President say? When the President was campaigning as a candidate, this is what he promised the American people: ``I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''  That was the test that he set for himself about an ObamaCare replacement--that no one would be worse off and that many would be better off. This does not meet that promise. It fails that promise.  At a December press conference the majority leader, Senator McConnell said: ``Surely, we can do better for the American people,'' and ``we will work expeditiously to come up with a better proposal than current law.''  Again, the promise was, we will take where we are right now and we will make it better. Nobody will lose coverage; everybody will be taken care of better. We will come up with a better proposal than the current law.  This is not that proposal. Turning Medicaid from a Federal guarantee to a per capita cap on spending doesn't mean everyone is covered; it means cuts to the States that would force States to cut eligibility, reduce benefits or provider payments. That is why providers, like the hospital associations and nursing homes, and the Republican Governors, like Governor Sandoval, are deeply opposed to this particular version. It is not better for the American people.  Protecting people with preexisting conditions, which the current bill does, but only if they have continuous coverage--that is not better for the American people because what if you lose your job or you can't afford benefits or you have a break in coverage for two months, and then you suddenly find that you are not protected, and your preexisting condition can be used against you to bar you from insurance for the rest of your life.  If you are unemployed and have a break in coverage, how do you afford a 30-percent surcharge on health insurance premiums like this plan proposes that insurance companies can sock you with? That is not better for the American people.  In closing, I will repeat something that 13 Democrats put into a letter to the Republican leadership in January: We want to work together to try to make healthcare better. We are willing to sit down at a table. We have ideas for how to improve not just the Affordable Care Act but prescription drug prices under Medicare Part D, something our citizens are deeply concerned about. We need to work together on affordability. We need to work together to make sure small businesses are able to afford coverage. We have to bring prescription drug pricing down. I know Republicans have ideas about how to do that and Democrats do too. The time is now to sit down and try to figure that out.[[Page S1656]]  Passing a precipitous repeal, trying to rush it through before the CBO scores it--a precipitous repeal that would take health insurance away from many, that would jack costs up on seniors, that would punish so many Virginians by reducing the subsidies they get now and replacing them with a less-generous subsidy--that will break a promise the President made. That will break a promise other leaders have made.  We had a HELP Committee hearing recently where we had witnesses who had been called by Democrats and Republicans before us, talking about things we need to do to fix and improve the Affordable Care They all agreed we needed to find improvements and fix it--all of them. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, they all agreed we need to find improvements. They all agreed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would be a catastrophe.  There were four witnesses. I asked them this question: If we need to make improvements, what is the best way to do it? Should we do it fast, carelessly, and secretly or should we do it slowly, deliberately, and publicly transparently?  They all said: Of course, there is only one answer to that question. We are talking about people's health. We should do it deliberately, carefully, and transparently, rather than fast, carelessly, and secretly.  We are proceeding right now in the fast, careless, and secret mode. This particular plan comically was locked in a room and nobody was able to see it last week. One of our Senate colleagues went over and tried to get in to see what was in the plan--a Republican colleague, the Senator from Now that the plan is out in the light of day, I think we can see why they were hiding it--because it has so many elements that are frightening so many people.  We can get this right. We can get this right by sitting down and having a discussion about what I have been talking to my constituents about: in the healthcare system right now, what works, what doesn't work, and what we should change. If we bring constituents around the table--individuals, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, businesses that are trying to buy insurance, doctors and nurses--if we get people around the table, they will break us out of the ``them versus our'' thing. We listen to them. We ask them those questions--what works, what doesn't, what can be fixed. We will find a path to meet the promise the President made, to meet the promise Senator Cornyn made, which is not make anything worse but taking the system as it is right now and making it better. We will only do that if we engage in a dialogue rather than trying to rush. That is what I encourage my colleagues to do.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

6260,topic-id,3571,"Mr.President, I rise to offer this amendment, amendment 8, with Senator Murphy and other Senators, to the budget resolution we are currently considering, and the purpose of amendment 8 would be to create a point of order against considering any legislation that would either strip Americans of health insurance coverage, make health care more expensive, or reduce the quality of health coverage.

A budget resolution is a tool to set forth the guidelines for spending in  We know, in the history of this body, we are not always successful in passing a budget through both Houses of Congress and approving that budget through a conference process, but at least some progress is usually made; for example, both Houses doing their budget resolutions. As you know, that did not happen in 2016. Last year, our GOP counterparts in each House decided, for the first time in the modern budget era, not to hold a hearing on the President's submitted budget, not to have any activity on a budget in the Senate, either in the committee or on the floor.  To begin, I have to ask, if the budget wasn't important enough for us to consider last year, why is it now so important for us to be taking up a budget? The answer is obvious. We are debating a budget for the sole purpose--the sole purpose--of setting in motion a process to repeal health care coverage for tens of millions of This is really about an attack on people's health care.  I and many of my colleagues have said there is a significant need to make improvements to the Affordable Care Act and, more generally, to our health care system.  Mr.President, you were a chief executive of a State, just like I was. I learned something in my first year as Governor of Virginia, which was, when I looked at all the bills that were put on my desk for signature, amendment, or veto at the end of my State's legislative session, three-quarters of the bills were not new legislation or not repeals of legislation; three-quarters of the bills were improvements of existing law. That is the work of a legislative body. Overwhelmingly, it should be improvements to existing law. The Affordable Care Act needs significant improvement, just as other health care laws do, just as virtually everything we do needs improvement.  There is no reason, while we acknowledge the need for improvement, to repeal a law outright without having a sense of what the replacement will be because, by doing so, what we do is create chaos in the economy, chaos in the health insurance market, and especially chaos in the most intimate and important area of people's lives, their health.  Actually, on that subject, there was a wonderful letter that was sent on January 3 by the American Medical Association to the congressional leadership on[[Page S80]]this very point, don't do a repeal that creates chaos for people. I am going to read some sections of the letter.  The AMA supported passage of the Affordable Care Act because it was a significant improvement on the status quo at that time.       We continue to embrace the primary goal of the law to make      high-quality, affordable health care coverage accessible to      all We also recognize that the ACA is imperfect,      and there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.  Continuing the quote:       It is essential that gains in the number of Americans with      health insurance coverage be maintained.  The letter concludes, from the American Medical Association, the largest organization representing American physicians:       Consistent with this core principle, we believe that before      any action is taken, through reconciliation or other means,      that would potentially alter coverage, policymakers should      lay out for the American people, in reasonable detail, what      will replace current policies. Patients and other      stakeholders should be able to clearly compare current policy      to new proposals so they can make informed decisions about      whether it represents a step forward in the ongoing process      of health reform.  The amendment Senator Murphy and I propose is designed to accomplish exactly the goal, exactly the goal the AMA has specified in the letter of January 3.  We would create a 60-vote point of order against any legislation that would, first, reduce the number of Americans who are enrolled in public or private health insurance coverage, so there would be a 60-vote point of order against any proposal that would reduce coverage for Americans; second, the point of order would also lie against any plan that would increase health care premiums or total out-of-pocket health care costs for Americans with private health insurance; and, third, the point of order would lie against any proposed plan on the table that would reduce the scope and scale of benefits offered by private health insurance because the ACA was not only about affordable care and it was not only about coverage, it was also about the quality of care.  Could your coverage discriminate against you because you are a woman? Could your coverage expire once you get diagnosed with an illness and now have a preexisting condition?  These bill of rights protections for patients were an important and integral part of the Affordable Care Act, and the budget point of order that we would put on the table would establish a 60-vote threshold for considering any legislation if it triggered one of those three concerns: reduction in coverage, increase in cost, reduction in quality.  The point of order actually goes right to promises that the President-elect has made. In September of 2015, President-elect Trump said:       I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it      costs me votes or not. Everybody is going to be taken care of      much better than they are taken care of now.  He has made a promise to the American public that we will not rush into a new health care chapter that reduces coverage, that reduces quality, or that increases costs.  Just 2 days ago, the key spokesperson for the President-elect Kellyanne Conway said: We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance.  She is not setting a threshold of 1 million people or 100,000 people or 10,000 people or 10 people. She is saying the threshold is this: We do not want anyone who has insurance to have that insurance jeopardized by actions of  This is what a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without a replacement plan, will mean. It will have three significant consequences, and then I want to finish with some personal stories.  First, a repeal with no replacement will inflict a significant wound on the American economy. Health care is one-sixth of the American economy, one-sixth. You cannot inject uncertainty into one-sixth of the American economy without having significant negative effects on our  Congress should be in the business of increasing certainty, not increasing uncertainty, and if we go into the biggest sector of the American economy with a repeal, without any replacement strategy, it is the equivalent of, ``I am now going to jump off a cliff and I will figure out how to land once I am in midair.'' This will be economic malpractice to affect that many people.  Second, the effect of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act is sort of an under-the-table tax cut for the wealthiest Millionaires, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed--there are two taxes on high earners that are part of the financing of the Affordable Care Act, and these taxes on high-earning Americans would expire, and this is hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years of a tax cut. Millionaires would get 53 percent of the tax cuts from a repeal, which is more than double the same group's share of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that were done during the Bush administration.  Just to put that in some context, Americans in the top 0.1 percent economically would get an average tax cut of $197,000 if the Affordable Care Act is repealed. That is one way to sort of look at this repeal without a replacement. It is essentially a tax cut for the wealthiest, financed by reductions of health care on the people who are most in need.  Third, the impact that is the most significant is the impact on the health care of average The Urban Institute did a study in December and said: If there is a repeal with no replacement or a repeal with a delayed replacement to something that we know not what it will be, there will be 30 million Americans who will lose their health insurance. About 20 million will be people who got health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and an additional 10 million will be people who will lose their insurance because of the chaos created in the insurance market.  I want to put that number, 30 million, into a context because numbers can just sound big and mysterious. Here is what 30 million people is. The number of people who would lose health insurance because of an ACA repeal is equal to the combined population of 19 States: Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska, South Dakota, Delaware, Montana, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Hawaii, Idaho, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Kansas, and Nineteen States' combined populations, that is 30 million people, and that is who is going to lose health care coverage if we go forward with a repeal without a replacement.  Eighty-two percent of these 30 million who would become uninsured are working families, 38 percent will be between the ages of 18 and 34, and 56 percent are non-Hispanic Eighty percent of the adults becoming uninsured are people who do not have college degrees. There will be 12.9 million fewer people who have Medicaid or CHIP coverage in 2019 if the repeal goes through. These are some sobering statistics. These statistics show that, at a minimum, what we are doing here is very, very consequential and very, very important and should not be rushed into in a partisan 51-vote budget reconciliation process.  I want to conclude and tell a couple of stories from Virginians of people who are going to be impacted by this. When we essentially recessed in the Senate on December 9--between then and now--I went around the State and talked to people. I heard a story that I want to share, and then I will tell a couple of quick ones.  I met with Ashley Hawkins, a young mother in Richmond, a mother of two kids. We sat around a conference table in a federally chartered community health center in Richmond and talked to stakeholders. Ashley told her story. She had a preexisting health condition. Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance was unaffordable. After the Affordable Care Act passed, she could suddenly get insurance.  Ashley owns a small business. She runs a nonprofit group that provides community arts education that serves others. Because of the ACA, she has been able to sign up on exchanges and get health insurance. Because of her income, she can receive subsidies to make that health insurance affordable. She makes $45,000 a year.  Without health insurance, the recent hospital bill for the birth of her youngest child would have been close to $16,000. With the Affordable Care Act, she receives a subsidy, and she is able to access high quality health insurance for her and her two kids for $280 a month. That is the difference between[[Page S81]]not being able to afford to go to a hospital and deliver a child and to be able to afford, as a small business owner, a health insurance policy that covers her and her two kids for less than $300 a month.  This is what she said as we sat around the table and talked about what it means to have affordable insurance. She said: ``It has to do with self esteem and security and well-being.''  Having health insurance is about security, even when you are not sick. Obviously, when you are sick or when you are delivering a child, health insurance is needed. But when you are a mother of two children, even if you are at the peak of your health and even if your children are at the peak of their health, you would go to bed at night--and Ashley described this--wondering: What will happen tomorrow if my child gets sick? What will happen tomorrow if I am in an accident? Not having health insurance for a parent is a continuous agitating voice in your mind, an anxiety creator, about what is going to happen to my family if we get sick or get in an accident, which is something that happens to virtually every family. It has to do with self-esteem, with security, and with well-being. Without the protection for people with preexisting conditions, without the subsidies in the marketplace, people like Ashley will go back to not being able to afford coverage for their families.  After the Affordable Care Act passed, I happened to be in a position where I was trying to buy health insurance in the open market without an employer subsidy for the first time in my life. When I say I was doing this, what I mean is that my wife was doing all the work because she is the one who does all the work. She talked to two insurance companies who said: Hey, sorry, Anne, we can't afford your entire family because of preexisting conditions. One company would not cover me. One company would not cover one of my children. My wife said: Hold on a second. The Affordable Care Act just passed. You can't turn somebody down on a preexisting condition now.  In each case the insurance company said: I have to talk to my supervisor. They had to call back and say: You are right; we are wrong. We have to provide insurance for your entire family.  Can I tell you this? My family is the healthiest family in the United At the time my wife was making those phone calls, of the five of us, the only time any of us had ever been hospitalized was in the three occasions my wife went to the hospital to give birth to our kids. We are a healthy family, and we were turned down twice because of a preexisting condition by insurance companies that had to say: We are wrong, and because of the Affordable Care Act, now we can write a policy for your entire family.  I had a woman write me a letter--a Virginian from Williamsburg--a couple of years ago who said: My husband and I are self-employed, and we could never afford insurance. Because we couldn't afford insurance, we decided that we couldn't have children. We couldn't pay a hospital bill. This is what the Affordable Care Act has meant to them. We often talk about life and death issues in the sense of illnesses, sicknesses, cancer diagnoses, and preexisting medical conditions. They can be life or death issues, but they can also be life issues, in the sense of this couple who wrote and said that because they could now get insurance as self-employed individuals with subsidies to make it affordable, they are now going to start a family because of the Affordable Care They could start a family.  Finally--and I will always remember this because this gives me great motivation--as I was getting outside of my native Virginia and exploring other States on an interesting 105-day summer vacation as part of a national ticket, I went to the Iowa State I told this story once before on the floor, but I am going to tell it again. A grandfather came up with a little boy in his arms. I said: What is that child's name? Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. There is Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, a place where children have been able to go to get medical care.  I knew there must be a story. I said: Hey, Jude, tell me about Jude was a 3\1/2\-year-old who was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect and by age 3\1/2\--as his grandfather told me the story, now mom and dad were coming around me as well--Jude had to have multiple heart operations at the Children's Hospital in The grandfather said to me that Jude would not have been able to have those operations and Jude would be uninsurable for the rest of his life if it were not for the Affordable Care  Then Jude's father put his hand on my shoulders. He was a big guy. He said to me: You have to tell me that you will do everything you can to make sure that Jude isn't stripped away and consigned again into the outer reaches of preexisting conditions and uninsurable, with an uncertain future for my son. I made a pledge to him. I said: I am only one person. I don't know what, at the end of the day, I can do, but I can tell you this. I can stand up to make sure that your child and other children--such as Ashley's two kids and the family that wrote me about wanting to have children--will not be left high and dry and without the security of health insurance in the wealthiest and, to my way of thinking, still the most compassionate Nation on the face of this planet.  I encourage every Member of this body to ask their constituents for stories like Ashley's, like Jude's, like my family's, and like the family in Williamsburg about how an ACA repeal with no plan would impact them.  I will go back to the purpose of the amendment. The ACA is not perfect. We ought to be talking about reform. If Republicans want to call it replace and we want to call it reform or improvement, I don't care what we call it. We should have the AMA, hospitals, patients, and Members of Congress from both parties around the table to lay down what are our concern, what are our problems, and talk about how to fix them. There is so much we can do. There is so much we can improve. But by pushing an immediate repeal through a partisan budget process, we won't have the opportunity to work together to build on that common ground.  This is not a game. Sometimes we get into a budget vote-arama, and it has a little bit of a game aspect to it. I have been here until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. when amendments are put on the table, there are 1-minute presentations of why it is good or bad, and we have a vote. It has a little bit of a feeling of a game. This is not a game. This is life and death.  Is there anything more important to someone than their health, because their health forms the foundation of their relationship with their spouse or their loved ones or their children? Health is what keeps a parent up at night worrying about the family. Health is what keeps a child worrying about an elderly parent. This is the most important thing to any person in this country, regardless of party, regardless of State, regardless of political persuasion. The worst thing we can do on a value of such importance is to rush and create chaos in the lives of millions of people.  So I conclude by saying that the amendment that Senator Murphy, I, and others offer would seek to protect what we have--protect coverage, protect costs, protect quality--by making it harder to enact legislation that would strip these important items away from tens of millions of  We should be sitting down at the table to talk about reforms. So many of us want to do that. But we should not be rushing into a repeal that would jeopardize people's lives.  I urge my colleagues to please support amendment 8.

Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island is here on the floor. I also want to thank Congressman John Garamendi for sharing his hour with us.  The focus tonight really is on jobs and trade, an issue on the mind of millions and millions of We have been joined by Congressman Brendan Boyle of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well.  I will place this up for the Nation to see. It is a chart showing just U.trade relations with Mexico and Canada and what has happened since the deal was negotiated back in the early 1990s. It was also prepared before that, during the 1980s, when the United States actually had some trade surpluses on this continent with both Canada and  This shows, in 1994, when NAFTA was actually enacted. You could see the United States begin to kind of fall into deficit. Then we had just a precipitous trade deficit, including the collapse of the peso after the NAFTA trade agreement was signed.[[Page H2681]]  This is serious business for our country because this red ink represents lost jobs, lost productive power, and communities in disrepair across this country, where production units were just picked up and put either north or south of the border.  Tonight, we want to focus on President Trump's Manufacturing Jobs Initiative, which he announced during the campaign and afterwards. Here were his words:       Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back,      the good jobs, the real jobs. They have to come back.  Well, after all we have lost, we certainly do need job creation in this country.                              {time}  1730  We are now into the third month of Mr.Trump's Presidency and closing in on his first 100 days in office, a period when most Presidents are able to pass something through this Congress that really matters to the American people. I remember when we were able to save Social Security back during the 1980s and when a Congress was elected in response to Ronald Reagan's excesses, and it was in the first quarter of the year that that was done. So we are waiting. It is 100 days now, and nothing significant has been done on the jobs and trade front.  Candidate Donald Trump's campaign for President in my region of America was actually founded on the principle of fixing jobs and trade. People listened. But if we look at this first 100 days, we see that he has really taken a back seat to his billionaire donors and their interests and a staff that seems to be more and more peopled with individuals who spent a whole lot of time at Goldman Sachs, which is a company that has been notorious in helping to outsource jobs.  Throughout the campaign, Mr.Trump touted his trade policies, assuring voters he would renegotiate Well, we have been waiting. During a debate, he said: ``NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.''  I would say that that agreement is the foundational agreement, the precepts on which all subsequent trade deals have been negotiated that have placed America in a red ink position: many more imports coming into this country, many more of our jobs being outsourced elsewhere than our exports going out.  So I ask: Are the strong planks for a new NAFTA part of what the Trump administration is proposing?  Well, no. A leaked draft notice last week revealed a tepid agenda on trade that is little more than a rehash of what the President said in his campaign rhetoric. It is not a real plan. The one action item identified in the Trump trade agenda is the announcement of a study to find out why the United States is losing in global trade. It actually doesn't focus completely on NAFTA itself, and we need healing in this hemisphere before we start looking around the world.  The reality is we know why the deficit is so bad. Bad trade deals have led to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit just last month of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. Instead, our deficit with NAFTA and Mexico and Canada is 31 percent higher. It got worse than a year ago. So I hope the President understands the real urgency of stopping U.job outsourcing, especially in the manufacturing sector. He should do more than pay lipservice. He should really take a look at how thin his administration proposals have been on renegotiating this agreement. He should establish real goals and timetables for U.trade to drive policy that will fix these job-killing trade agreements and deliver real benefits for the American people.  Now, we have Members who have been very active on this trade issue since being sworn in here in  Mr.Speaker, I yield now to Congressman David Cicilline, former mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and a very strong leader for working men and women across this country.

6355,topic-id,675,"If we look at this chart, just for those who are listening to us this evening, if you go back to the mid-1970s, as Congressman Cicilline pointed out, you will see the United States was pretty buoyant. We were actually exporting more than we were importing.  But then when China Most Favored Nation passed in 1979, 1994 NAFTA passed, and all of a sudden what was happening is the reverse flow started. We started importing more than we were exporting, and every time you get a billion dollars of red ink, you lose 5,000 more jobs in this country.  Well, my gosh, as NAFTA actually took full bore and then China permanent normal trade relations took effect here, CAFTA, which was the Central American Free Trade Agreement, here was the Colombian Free Trade Agreement, here was the Korean Free Trade Agreement, every single agreement that happened, we ended up getting more imports into our country than exports out, and promises were not kept.  Our focus tonight is mainly on NAFTA, but if we look at Korea, they were supposed to be taking 50,000 cars from us. We were supposed to have more balanced trade. Well, guess what, they didn't keep up their end of the bargain. Other markets around the world, such as Japan, remain closed to this day to cars from other places in the world.  You say: Congresswoman, that can't be possible.  I have seen it with my own eyes. I have visited there many times. When I first began my career, Japan had about--oh, 3 percent of the cars on their streets were from anyplace else in the world. Today maybe it is 4 percent, maybe it is 3.5 percent, but there are all kinds of nontariff barriers where they keep cars out. Yet you look at our country, they have put manufacturing plants here, they send product over here. It simply isn't a two-way street, and Japan is the second largest market in the world for automobiles. So the trade isn't fair. The American people know this. They are trying to fix this. It really requires the President's leadership to do it.  Congressman Cicilline talked about steel trade--I just want to put on the Record--with China, and we see what a big player she is in the market and doesn't play fair. I just want to put some numbers on the China's expansion of steel since 2000 has grown to over 2,300 million metric tons. That is a big number to imagine. But only 1,500 million metric tons are needed to actually serve the global marketplace. So what you have got is over 800 million metric tons of steel just floating around the world in warehouses and stored up in provinces in China, and they are dumping the steel.  Why does that matter?  Because in places like I represent, Lorain, Ohio, U.Steel just pink-slipped hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of more workers. Republic Steel, which sits next door to U.Steel, has shuttered their plant because of imported steel.  The President could do something about that. He could have done something about that the second day he was in office. Nothing has been done. All these workers, some of whom have worked in these plants for 28 years, in modernized plants where hundreds of millions of dollars of investment have been made to upgrade the capacity of these plants, rather than save that capacity for our country for the years ahead and to try to deal with this Chinese dumping, they are allowing more workers and more companies to go belly up in this country. It is wrong. It is wrong. This needs to be fixed. This is big time for jobs and economic growth in our country.  I want to thank Congressman Brendan Boyle, who understands this problem full well. As a younger Member of Congress and one who really speaks on behalf of working men and women in Pennsylvania and coast to coast, I thank him so much for taking time and joining us tonight. I yield to the gentleman.  ",CREC-2017-04-04-pt1-PgH2680.txt,616,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,4.0,January
6356,topic-id,1530,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman He has raised so many important issues tonight on jobs and trade and how we fix this problem for the people of our country and, frankly, the world.  One of the issues is which banks are actually financing this outsourcing. I can tell you, they are not banks in the communities that I represent. They are not big enough to put all that money, to actually take these big companies and move them out of the United States and plunk them down in a Third World environment. It is largely Wall Street banks that do that. So they fly over the heads of people that live in communities across this country.  The gentleman talked about Nabisco moving. I had an experience. I went out to Newton, Iowa, a few years ago when Maytag was closing. I felt so bad as an American that a gold star label company that had manufactured reliable, high-quality products in our country was closing. I learned what was happening. What I didn't realize was that the production that closed in Newton, Iowa, large parts of it were moved south of the border.  I was traveling down to Monterrey, I was going down there, actually, to find out what had happened to someone who was murdered, who had been a student in our community and was murdered in Monterrey, We went by this big complex that said Maytag, Amana, all of these American companies that had been outsourced to I said: Stop the cab. I am taking a picture. This is exactly what I am talking about.  I said: Let me ask a question to some of the people that were walking by and living in the area. I said: Can the people who work in that Maytag plant in Monterrey, can they afford to buy the washers they make?  Guess what? In fact, where they lived, there was no running water. There was no decent water to drink.  I thought: This is what we stand for as a country? What is wrong with this picture? For our country, in districts like mine, the results of all this lopsided trade are that citizens in northern Ohio, on average, are earning $7,000 less than they did when this century began, because of this. The playing field is simply not level.  Several years ago, I was visited by a group of United Automobile Workers from Milwaukee, They told me--and I just love these wonderful, generous human beings. They had all been pink-slipped. They had just lost their jobs. They came to see me to tell me their stories on trade and what it had done to them.  They said: Marcy, we are training those who are going to replace us in But we went down to Mexico, and we felt so sorry to see where the people lived and the conditions under which they were working that we are collecting medical items, and we are doing humanitarian shipments to that town.  I thought: Oh, my goodness, what a generous group of Americans who are facing such horror in their own lives and yet they were doing that for people who live on this continent--and were, by the way, going to be earning, like, one-twentieth of what the workers in Milwaukee earned. So it was all about cheap labor.  I really felt bad for the cheapening of the Maytag product. I am probably going to get in trouble for saying that, but it is the truth. I certainly learned a lesson by traveling to Newton,  Now, another story, this is on plastic seals. I happened to visit a plant in the Tijuana area, and I walked through the plant in This company had been moved from Ohio and its equipment shipped down to  I walked through this plant. It was about 100 degrees that particular day. I turned the corner. There were no fans taking out the exhaust. It was bloody hot, and it had to be 110 degrees. These men were working. They had T-shirts on. It was very hot that summer. They were pulling down these large levers because they were melting plastic and rubber. I witnessed this.  I thought: Boy, that really looks dangerous with that thing that they are pulling down because it was moving like this. I thought: Boy, they have got to really pay attention every time they move that steam press down so they don't catch their arm in there.  I took pictures, and I sent them back to I got a letter from one of my constituents. This constituent said: Congresswoman, did you really take a look at the picture you took?  I thought: Well, yeah, I was looking at the workers.  He said: Look at the machine, the machine, up in the right-hand corner, the button with the tape over it.  I said: Oh, yeah.  He said: I used to do that job. Do you know what that button is?  I said:  He said: That is the safety button.  In other words, when the equipment was shipped and the machine started, life wasn't worth as much in Mexico, so these workers were working with much greater risk of injury to themselves because the equipment had been tinkered with in a way that told me a lot about health and safety standards and how they are really not enforced in places like  I finally want to end with a story that relates to trade. It doesn't just have to do with goods. It has to do with human beings, with people, and why renegotiating trade deals is so important for what our Constitution says we stand for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This is a country that believes in liberty and justice for all. It has to do with the undocumented workers in our country who are coming from south of our border.  We hear all kinds of rhetoric about that, but the truth is that I face the reality of what happened in the agricultural sector with What happened is we wanted two-way trade with Mexico, but what the trade agreement did is it caused great problems in Mexico in that over 2 million small farmers in Mexico were displaced by the NAFTA agreement because our country was 18 times more efficient in corn agriculture than the Mexican people. These workers and owners of these little ejidos, these little, tiny farms that were subsistence farms, they were just completely obliterated--2 million or more people.  Well, guess what? When you lose your livelihood and the trade agreement doesn't provide for readjustment, what do you think desperate people do? They run anywhere to eat, and north of the border looks pretty attractive.  As I heard all of these speeches during the campaign about what we are going to do on trade and how we are going to fix everything, I have never heard any of the major candidates talk[[Page H2684]]about: How are you going to fix the problem for the people in Mexico who lost their livelihoods, their ability to produce for themselves?  The undocumented worker problem has a big, big root in It was an uncaring set of governments that negotiated these agreements that caused that hemorrhage that creates an endless flow of people who are desperate, who will do anything to survive. You wouldn't want this to happen to your family.  I am all for yellow corn from the United I eat corn. I just served it the other night to our family. But when a trade agreement wipes out the livelihoods of millions of people, it upsets an entire continent. So now the solution is not to figure out a way to have readjustment in agriculture in Mexico as part of a renegotiated NAFTA agreement; the answer is supposed to be a wall.  Do you know what? Walls don't feed people. Proper trade agreements feed people when they are done the right way and you don't obliterate people's lives. That is what really matters.  When I see what the White House is producing, I haven't seen anything yet that really gets us to balanced trade accounts in a way that people matter and the communities in which they live matter. And it isn't always a default to what Wall Street wants and cheap labor and substandard working conditions and substandard living conditions.  We have to do better than that. We have to aspire to a system where people are invited into a trade union in which we have rising standards of living, where we have balanced trade accounts again, and where people's incomes and living standards rise. If we don't get there, we are going to have even greater social problems on this continent.  Today, I met with El Salvadoran workers, talking about the conditions in that country, what has happened there with the maquiladoras and the situations that people face in their daily lives. This race to the bottom is not working. It is not working in our country. It is not working in the Latin American countries or in We simply have to aspire to the highest values that founded this country.

As we complete our work here this evening, I wanted to reissue our invitation to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to travel to Ohio to come to U.Steel in Lorain to really see what is happening there to the workers; and not just Lorain--we are not selfish--but all over this country where steel companies are being harmed because of imports and the fact that China, Korea, and Russia are dumping on the international market.  We need to have an embargo. We need to let our industry survive and get over this hump of overcapacity.  We are going to need that production in the years ahead, for example, in the natural gas industry for piping and so forth. These are modern plants. America should not lose them. We have lost so many steel plants. We can't afford to lose many more for the sake of the Nation's defense.  I also wanted to invite the President to I hope that somebody is listening. He campaigned a great deal in I know he likes meeting people, and it certainly would be a good way to see the immediate challenge on the trade front where real lives and livelihoods are at stake in this country.                              {time}  1815  I also just wanted to end by saying this: When you create a system of trade where people are exploited in our country, or in other countries, that really isn't the best face that America can put forward. And unfortunately, what happens too often in our country now, for example, in trade with Mexico, when you have undocumented workers who come here, many in desperation, many of them are being trafficked across the continent. You say: Oh, Congresswoman, what do you mean trafficked? I mean, some of them come here because they are desperate, and they end up paying sometimes as much as $8,000 to come here and work at a very low-wage job. They never get out of debt.  We have to take that system and move it into the sunlight out of the doldrums, because we can't treat people like chattel. There are millions of agricultural workers, for example, who come to this country with no contract. They are completely indentured to whatever coyote brings them across the border. That is not the system I want for this country. That is not fair to those families. It is not fair to their children. It is not fair to the places to which they come in our country.  They always feel uncomfortable. What kind of a system, what kind of a trade system would subject them to that? We are a different kind of country. We aspire to higher values. We aspire to treating people and elevating their worth, not diminishing their worth as human beings.  We have a lot to fix in these trade agreements, and I hope that President Trump will join us. I would like to tell him about what coyotes do. I would like to tell him how they behave, how some of them have been involved in murder of individuals from my district who fight for labor rights so that no one is afraid, that people feel that they have a legal system that will defend them.

His doctor ran some tests. The next day, Wayne received an unnerving call asking him to come back in. Before he could make the next appointment, Wayne's insurance provider called his employer to inform the company that its rates would be going up because one of its employees had cancer.

5999,topic-id,1641,"Madam President, I rise to address the bill that has been recently--and I emphasize the word ``recently''--introduced in the House of I believe it was introduced It is having not a hearing but a markup today, and may be on the House floor as soon as tomorrow or early next week.  As the President said recently, healthcare is complicated. To me, to introduce a bill that was not available to any Members of Congress before Monday, mark it up in committee 2 days later, attempt to pass it on the floor of the House, and then I understand it may come directly to the floor of the Senate without any committee consideration, it just seems to me is a disservice to the process and a disservice to the traditions and practices of this institution.  This is complicated. It is difficult. The ramifications and implications of this bill, just as any other major change in our healthcare system, are incredibly important. This is not about ideology. This is about people. This is about the impact on people. I want to talk about the impact of this bill, as we have thus far been able to assess it, on the people of When I look at a piece of legislation down here, I start with How will it affect the people who live along our coast or inland, in the small towns, and particularly people who are above the age of 50?  Maine happens to be the oldest State in the country. Therefore, anything which negatively impacts seniors doubly negatively impacts the people of my I feel this bill is a disaster for seniors. I define seniors in this case as anybody over 50 because it does several things. One of the things it does, and there should be a great deal of discussion about this, under the Affordable Care Act, which recognizes the fact that seniors and people who are older tend to have more medical needs than those who are younger, it caps differential at three times. In other words, a senior can only pay three times what a younger person pays, and even that is burdensome in many cases.  This bill changes three to five. It will be a very substantial increase in the payments and the costs of insurance and healthcare to senior citizens. Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is, I find, the most nonpartisan and informative source of information on all of these issues, has created a handy tool on their website, where you can put in information, such as family income and age, and determine what you would have paid under the Affordable Care Act and what you would pay under this new bill.  What they found was--I wanted to look and see what somebody in my State will pay. If you are a 60-year-old in Aroostook County Maine with an income of $30,000, the subsidy--the support for the premium for individual insurance--would fall by 70 percent. The support for your insurance policy under the Affordable Care Act would fall by 70 percent.  Throughout our State, the average decrease would be 48 percent--almost half. So we are talking not about some theoretical, ideological, political thing here, we are talking about people's ability to afford health insurance. It is about as clear as it could be. That is why it is frustrating to me that we collectively--the Congress--are going to be asked to consider this bill with literally no hearings, no input from the public, no discussion of how all the pieces fit together or don't fit together. Yet we are going to be asked--I believe, my understanding is, we are going to be asked to vote on this bill sometime on the floor of the Senate, without any committee consideration, in the next week or so.  This is too important to people's lives to give it such short shrift. It is just not right to make changes of this magnitude that are so vital to people's well-being and literally their health and their survival in some cases. It is unthinkable to me that we would do this without a round of hearings and discussions and the regular order that we supposedly honor around here as to how major legislation is to come to the floor.  I received a letter just recently: ``Hi, Angus.''  I like it when my correspondents say ``Hi, Angus'' instead of ``Senator.''       Hi, Angus [he says]. I have worked in the pulp and paper      industry for close to 30 years. It was a good industry up      here, supported middle-class families in northern But      we have had layoffs and closures of our mills. After every      closure, I had to obtain health insurance for my family on my      own. Before ObamaCare, this was a disaster. I could only      obtain catastrophic insurance from one of two providers.      There was no way I could pay $1,500 a month for a decent      plan. After ObamaCare, I could obtain decent insurance at a      decent price. While there may have been problems for some, it      was a godsend for my family. Please help ensure we don't go      back to the old days. We are self-employed by our small      business and would not be able to pay more for less.  That is what the bill that is in the House would do, pay more for less. By the way, how does the money work in this bill? Well, one of the things the bill does is, my understanding, and, again, I am only operating on what we have seen in the last 24 hours because of no hearings, but one of the things it does is eliminate a tax on people who make over $250,000 a year in order to cut coverage for people who are not making that kind of money.  It is a tax cut, and shifting the cost to our citizens, particularly our seniors. The pattern is, shift and shaft. Shift the cost, and shaft the people who need the coverage. This is supposed to be a substitute. It is supposed to be coverage for everyone. You have to be careful. When people talk about access, they are talking about: Yes, you can buy it, but if you can't afford it, that is not really access. This bill dramatically decreases the support for health insurance premiums through the Affordable Care  The reality is, and I hear a lot of talk about how ObamaCare is collapsing. It isn't. More people signed up this year than last year. Yes, it is true the rates went up, but that was because younger people were not signing up in significant numbers. We need to deal with that issue because that makes the risk pool older and sicker and therefore more expensive.  I have been told by insurance officials that if something like this bill that is in the House passes and the subsidies disappear and the Affordable Care Act goes away, the private health insurance market for individuals, the so-called individual market, will essentially collapse. The reality is, the uninsured population of this country has fallen virtually in half since the passage of the Affordable Care Twenty-two million people have coverage now who did not before and we can take it away.  The other piece I don't like about this bill is it phases things out so the impact will not be felt until after the next election or sometime in the future. Well, the future comes. In this case, the future is going to be pretty desolate for people who have health insurance now and are not going to have it 2, 4, or 6 years from now. It is just not right.  I am one who has been saying, since I entered this body now 4-plus years ago, that there are problems with the Affordable Care We should be working on those problems. We should be working on repairing it, not destroying it. We should not be talking about taking healthcare coverage away from people in this country.  I am sure I and many others will be addressing more comprehensively the provisions of this bill as it becomes more clear, even though we are going to have to ferret those provisions out because we are not going to have the benefit of expert testimony and views from a variety of points of view of how this is actually going to work.  The reality is, I don't think there is much question that this proposal will hammer Maine and my people. I can't stand for that. I hope the House will have a more vigorous process, they will understand what the implications are, and take a more judicious approach so we are not tearing insurance out from under people, we are not going to make the cost be driven up, we are not giving a tax break to people who make over $250,000 a year, and at the same time taking coverage away from people who make $30,000 a year.  That is wrong. We should be repairing, not repealing. I think this bill is not the right place to start. I stand for the people of I stand for the people who are going to be harmed by this, whether they are seniors or working people or self-employed people or people who have been able to start businesses because they could get, for the first time, insurance under the Affordable Care  I believe that is our obligation. We have an opportunity to work together.[[Page S1660]]I am willing to work with anyone who wants to work on improving and dealing with some of the issues that have been raised by the Affordable Care  Let's stop talking about repealing.

For centuries, most Guatemalans had no access to justice. This was exacerbated during--and in the years since--the civil war, when an estimated 200,000 people were killed or disappeared. Most of them were innocent victims of the armed forces, and only a small number of the military officers and their accomplices who were responsible have been punished. In fact, the armed forces and their benefactors have for the most part successfully avoided justice, by threatening prosecutors and witnesses and paying off judges.  At the same time, Guatemala is experiencing the corrosive effects of drug gangs, smugglers, and organized crime.

Rampant gang violence and a lack of job opportunities have caused tens of thousands of Guatemalans, including unaccompanied minors, to seek safety and employment in the United  Two individuals, Thelma Aldana, Guatemala's Attorney General, and Ivan Velasquez, the head of CICIG, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, have been courageously investigating these high-profile cases and working diligently to bring those responsible to justice.

In Guatemala, with its history of impunity, Thelma Aldana and Ivan Velasquez are making history by showing the Guatemalan people that justice is possible. It is possible even in cases in which the perpetrators are high-ranking government officials, members of their families, or others with wealth and power who have long evaded justice.  Guatemala needs our support to reduce poverty and malnutrition, improve education, combat crime, reform the police, and strengthen its economy and public institutions, but none of that can be achieved or sustained without political will and a transparent, accountable justice system.

So I am here today in April to amplify the contributions of women of color, particularly African-American women. Far too often, the blood, sweat, and tears sown by women of color goes unrecognized. So many are truly hidden figures.  Mr.Speaker, this morning, I want to honor the sacrifices African-American women made for this country during World War Sadly, to this day, their sacrifices have gone unacknowledged, and as the daughter of a World War II veteran and a Korean veteran, I am honored to shed light on a few of the tremendous contributions of African-American women during World War I want to rise to highlight the courageous efforts of more than 800 African-American women from the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, which was the first all-women, all-Black unit deployed in World War  The 6888th, its nickname ``Six Triple Eight'', was an all-women, all-Black unit that helped boost morale among Allied troops by working through major mail backlogs in Europe during World War                              {time}  1030  To sort through the major backlog of mail in Europe, the women were divided into three subunits that allowed them to run the postal service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, processing 65,000 pieces of mail per 8-hour shift.  The battalion endured the harsh winter of Europe, dimly lit rooms, and rat-infested headquarters to carry out their mission. Adding insult to injury, these courageous women also faced segregation and discrimination from the very country they were working to defend. The women were forced to run their own mess halls, hair salon, refreshment bar, and other facilities because of segregationist Department of Defense policies.  Yet despite the harsh conditions of war and unequal treatment, the women of the 6888th Battalion cleared a 6-month backlog of mail in just 3 months while posted in In France, they cleared a 3-year mail backlog in just 6 months. Thanks to their tireless efforts, United States soldiers were finally able to receive lost letters from loved ones during the war.  The courage exhibited by the 6888th proved once again that senseless acts of cruelty are no match for the will and determination of African-American women.  But in July 1945, tragedy struck Private First Class Mary Barlow, Private First Class Mary Bankston, and Sergeant Dolores Browne, who lost their lives in a Jeep accident. Recognizing their fellow comrades' sacrifices, the women of the 6888th pooled their personal resources to properly bury these women. These women who tragically lost their lives while serving in Europe are buried at the Normandy American Cemetery, which I was privileged to visit a couple of years ago.  Their contributions and sacrifices deserve to be celebrated. These Black women proudly sacrificed their lives for a country that did not value them due to racial discrimination and bigotry. So it is with great pride that I speak their names today, hoping that more people will come to acknowledge their sacrifice and the sacrifices of their fellow sisters during World War  I want to thank our Military Construction, Veteran Affairs Appropriations Chair Congressman Charlie Dent, then-Ranking Member Sanford Bishop, as well as our full committee Chair Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey for their support in the Appropriations Committee to help us uncover this great history, and also the American Battle Monuments  These great sheroes need to be brought to the attention of the American people so that they can properly be recognized for their sacrifices and their legacies.

The document says:       The creation of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah [.      . .] follow[s] years of robust public input from tribes,      local elected officials, and diverse stakeholders, and draws      from legislation introduced in In addition to      protecting more land and water than any administration in      history--  And here is the kicker--       President Obama has taken unprecedented steps to elevate      the voices of Native peoples in the management of our      national resources.  ``Unprecedented steps to elevate the voices of Native peoples.'' Nothing could be further from the truth in this situation. Perhaps if we replace the word ``elevate'' with the word ``exploit,'' that sentence might apply to the situation in Bears  Now, there is no denying that many Native American people supported President Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National But the inconvenient truth too often ignored by the Obama administration and its supporters is that virtually all of this tribal support came from Native Americans residing outside of Utah, not inside Utah, and certainly not within San Juan County where this 1.35 million-acre designation occurred.  In fact, the most prominent Native American group that advocated for a national monument in Utah is actually an alliance called the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which is made up of several tribes, and most of its members reside outside of the State of  Yet, national monument advocates routinely invoke the Inter-Tribal Coalition as the authoritative mouthpiece of all Native Americans in the Southwestern United  So how did a coalition of Native American tribes from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico rise to such a position of prominence in a debate over a national monument in a remote corner of Utah? Well, part of the answer can be found in the cozy relationships between well-funded environmental advocacy groups, powerful outdoor retail companies, and tribal organizations.  Recent investigative reporting by the Deseret News shows how radical wealthy environmental organizations, supported by the outdoor recreational industry, channeled millions of dollars to the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition only after they realized that ``hitching [their] success'' to the Navajo Nation was the only way they could achieve their longstanding goal of creating a national monument in Southeastern  The ability of uber-rich environmentalists to essentially buy a national monument in Bears Ears explains why the people of San Juan County--including the Navajo residents, whose lives and livelihoods are intricately linked to the Bears Ears Utes--stand united in opposition to a monument designation.  For the people of the Navajo Nation who live in San Juan County, taking care of their ancestral land--protecting and preserving it for the next generation--isn't optional, it is a sacred duty. It is part of their faith. It is part of who they are.  The same is true in many respects in my own faith. As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I share many of these views. My church teaches that the Earth is a divine creation that belongs to This means that human beings have a spiritual responsibility--an obligation to God--to be wise stewards over the Earth, to conserve it for our children and our grandchildren.  The Navajo people of San Juan County have always faithfully fulfilled their responsibility in the Bears Ears region, and so have the Utes who reside in the area. Caring for their homelands--and respecting it as their forefathers did--is the cultural lifeblood of the Native American people of Southeastern Take away their access to their land--restrict their stewardship over the Earth's bounty for the sake of increasing the access of wealthy urbanites who use the outdoors for their own purposes--and it won't be long before their culture begins to fade away.  The people of San Juan County understand this. They have seen their worst nightmares become reality in other Utah counties as a result of Presidential national monument designations. That is why on December 29, the day after President Obama announced the Bears Ears monument, a crowd of Utahns assembled to hold a protest on the steps of the San Juan County  Braving the frigid weather of that day, they gathered together to demonstrate that they--the individuals and the families who will be most directly affected by a Bears Ears national monument--believe that the President has no business seizing vast stretches of land to be micromanaged and mismanaged by distant Federal land agencies.  But the protesters weren't just angry. They were resolute, confident about the future, and determined to keep fighting for their right to participate in the management of the land in their community--the land that most directly affects them.  Of course, environmentalists and national monument advocates want the people of San Juan County to believe that this fight is simply over, that they have lost, that there is nothing they can do about something that affects them in a very real, very personal, very intimate way. In their view, President Obama's proclamation of the Bears Ears National Monument is permanent. It is irreversible, as if it were carved into stone. As one White House official recently told the Washington Post: ``We do not see that the Trump administration has authority to undo this.''  But they say this only because they are not looking hard enough. The truth is what can be done through unilateral[[Page S103]]Executive action can also be undone the same way. Such is the impermanence of Executive power in our constitutional republic, where major policy changes require broad consensus, forged through legislative compromise, to endure the test of time.  In a recent Wall Street Journal article, two prominent constitutional scholars, Todd Gaziano and John Yoo, explain this point as it relates specifically to President Obama's use of the Antiquities Act to designate the Bears Ears National The Antiquities Act of 1906, as they explain, does not create an irreversible monument. When a President uses it, its use is not necessarily indelible.  Gaziano and Yoo write:       After studying the President's legal authority [under the      Antiquities Act], we conclude that he can rescind monument      designations [. . .] the law's text and original purposes      strongly support a president's ability to unilaterally      correct his predecessor's abuses.  In other words, starting on January 20, President-Elect Trump can use his Executive powers to rescind President Obama's designation of the Bears Ears National I have asked the future Trump administration to do precisely that.  I have also recently cosponsored Senator Murkowski's bill, the Improved National Monument Designation Process Act, which would require all future Presidents to obtain congressional and State approval prior to designating a national monument. I have done these things, and I will do more, because I believe the preponderance of evidence proves that President Obama abused his powers--the powers granted to him under the Antiquities Act--in designating the Bears Ears National  This isn't just my opinion. It is the opinion of most of my fellow Utahns, including those patriots who assembled on the county courthouse steps in the rural town of Monticello on December 29.  These are the people who were ignored by the Obama administration. These are the people who were cut out of the decisionmaking process that produced this particular national monument designation. These are the voices that were stifled by the wealthy, out-of-State, well-connected environmental groups that spent millions of dollars to lock up our land for their exclusive use.  So it is fitting to let one of them--one of the residents of San Juan County--have the last word today. I think Suzy Johnson put it best when she said:       Mr.Obama, you have failed the grassroots natives. A true      leader listens and finds common ground. The fight for our      land is not over. Your name will blow away in the wind.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Sasse). The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1501,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6386,topic-id,1178,"Mr.Speaker, every year when we celebrate and reflect on Black History Month, we learn the stories of some of America's greatest scientists, actors, writers, entertainers, scholars, workers, and ordinary people who made major contributions to this great country.  As a member of the Military Construction, Veteran Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, I want to share the unsung stories of the valiant Black men and women who served their country dutifully during World War II even in the face of adversity.  We know about the brave Tuskegee Airmen--Red Tails--who flew fighter and bomber planes during World War II, but many do not know that the Red Tails were only a few of the nearly 1 million African Americans who served during the war. These courageous men and women fought bravely to protect the democratic ideals of freedom and equality.  Sadly, the country they served did not live up to those ideals. When they returned from victory in Europe and the Pacific, many did not receive a hero's welcome because of the color of their skin.  My dad, the late Lieutenant Colonel Garvin Tutt, was one of those heroes. He served in the 92nd Battalion in Italy supporting the Normandy invasion, was in World War II, the Korean war, and served in the Army for 25 years.  Only recently have the contributions of African-American men and women during World War II been recognized as our country has attempted to acknowledge its sad and dark past. That is why I am taking time on the floor today to honor the 138 African-American men and women buried in Normandy American Cemetery and the 5 men who remain missing. It is my hope that, by sharing these stories today and entering their names into the Record, more people will come to appreciate the sacrifices of these brave men and women who served this country with distinction during World War  Now, most people know that on June 6, 1944, approximately 2,000 soldiers landed on the beaches of Normandy for what would be a major turning point in the war, but far fewer know that the all-Black 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion served with distinction during the D-day invasions. The 320th was the only Black unit to take part on D-day and the only balloon battalion dedicated to protecting troops from intense German aircraft attacks on Omaha and Utah beaches. This was unique because Black units were usually kept from combat and fulfilled essential support services instead.  As part of their mission to protect Allied troops, the men of the 320th implemented innovative ideas to ease transportation to shore of barrage balloons that weighed half a ton. In addition to defending American soldiers during D-day invasions, the battalion also secured its own successful offensive strikes. The battalion's ingenuity and service was later recognized as an important element of the air defense team by Dwight Eisenhower, who was Supreme Allied Commander General at the time.  Sadly, no sacrifice comes without the loss of human life. During the D-day invasion, the 320th suffered two casualties. Corporal Brooks Stith and Corporal Henry Harris from the 320th are both buried at the Normandy American Each of these men was decorated with the Purple Heart, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal for their valiant service. There is James McLean of the 320th, who died on July 16, 1944. He was also buried at the cemetery.  African Americans who were buried at the cemetery, the men from the 320th, were buried with their White peers. Even though units were segregated until President Harry Truman changed official Department of Defense policies in 1948, Black and White soldiers who died in Normandy were buried together. At the Normandy American Cemetery, 135 African-American men and 3 African-American women were laid to rest from 1944 to 1945.  Mr.Speaker, there are five Black men who remain missing in action while posted in They are honored on the Walls of the Missing at Normandy with more than 1,700 others.  While women were not allowed in combat during World War II, three Black women from the 6888th Postal Directory Battalion of the Women's Army Corps are also buried at the cemetery. They were killed during an accident with a jeep.  Now, this was an all-women, all-Black unit that helped process mail in Europe during World War They were the first Black battalion deployed after First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and civil rights leader Mary McLeod Bethune advocated for Black women to join the Women's Army Corps, the WAC, for nearly a year and a half. The women received basic training and were trained in jujitsu because they were not allowed to carry firearms. They successfully helped clear massive mail backlogs in various cities across  While the women of the 6888th were celebrated for their work in Europe, some historians speculate that inspectors would sometimes give unsatisfactory reviews because of their prejudices.  Unit commander Major Charity Adams was court-martialed once for pushing back when a general threatened to send a ``white first lieutenant'' to show her how to command her unit.  We are indebted to these women for their exemplary work processing mail efficiently to[[Page H1255]]keep up the morale of our troops during But more importantly, we owe them the respect they never received.  Mr.Speaker, these men and women lost their lives too soon for a country that hasn't done a great job of remembering their bravery and their sacrifices.  An analysis conducted by the Army showed that the average age of African American service members buried at the NAC is 27 years--the prime age when a young person is starting their life.  That is why it is so important for us to remember and tell their stories during Black History  As Black History Month continues, I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in honoring their memories by also speaking on the Floor about other all-Black battalions who fought during  As the daughter of a WWII and Korean Veteran, I am very honored to be on the Military-Veterans Appropriations Subcommittee to ensure our veterans receive the care and recognition they deserve.  Let me close by thanking our Military-Veterans Chair, Congressman Charlie Dent and then Ranking Member Sanford Bishop and then full Committee Chair Rogers and Ranking Member Lowey, for their support in the Appropriations Committee and the commission for helping bring these great heroes and sheros to the attention of the American people and by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies.  Hopefully this effort will help us locate their descendants and families to and thank them and honor them as part of yes--Black History but of course this is American History that all Americans should recognize and learn from.  Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the chair of our subcommittee, Mr.Dent, Ranking Member Lowey, Mr.Bishop, and you, Mr.Rogers, for your support in the Appropriations Committee and for the American Battle Monuments Commission's very dedicated work in helping us bring these great heroes and sheroes to the attention of the American people by properly recognizing their sacrifices and their legacies.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-16-pt1-PgH1251-3.txt,1501,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6100,topic-id,623,"Mr.Speaker, the President's executive order of Friday violates the law, it violates the Constitution, and it violates good sense.  How does it violate the law? Section 202(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act specifically prohibits nationality-based discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas and other visas. That is what this order did.  Now, the law is clear that individuals who pose a threat to the United States can--and I should add, should be--barred from the United States; but you can't just legally make a blanket objection based on nationality and, I would add, based on religion. That is what the President's order does. It suspends refugee admission completely for months.  Who are these refugees? Most of the refugees admitted last year were from Burma and the Congo, not from They are people who have been vetted for years, many of whom are fleeing for their lives and will continue to live in fear.  It does something else. It suspends admission even of legal permanent residents from seven countries, violating their rights to equal protection and to due process.  People want to keep the country safe--we all do; of course, I do--but how does this order keep us safe? Let me just give an example.  General Talib al-Kenani from Iraq commands the elite American-trained counterterrorism forces that have been leading the fight against ISIS for 2 years. His family relocated to the U.for safety. He can't visit them anymore. He said this:       I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning.      Now my kids are asking: Am I a terrorist? I am a four-star      general, and I am banned from entering the United  I ask you: How does this advance our safety by barring our allies who are fighting ISIS? It doesn't.  I have got to correct something else. People have said that President Obama had an order in 2011 barring immigrants from That is false. We did additional vetting in 2011 because we wanted to make sure that anyone coming in was thoroughly examined. That slowed things down a little bit because there were new procedures, but there was never a halt to admission from those who are our allies in Iraq, those fighting ISIS with us.  I would just like to say that, in addition to violating the law, causing hardship for families trying to visit people in the hospital, permanent residents who are engineers trying to come back to run their companies in Silicon Valley, this order is a gift to They are already using it to recruit enemies of our country by saying: America is fighting As George Bush said when he was President, our argument, our fight is not with Our fight is with terrorism.  To issue this order with the President's rhetoric saying that we are going to make a distinction on who is admitted to the United States based on their religion is not only illegal, it is contrary to American values and it is contrary to our safety.  So I hope that, instead of doing this antienvironment bill today, we will instead take up H.724. This is a bill that would defund and rescind President Trump's ill-advised order from  Let me just say this.

Eventually he was assigned as an Army combat historian and rose to the rank ofcolonel. He was one of five people assigned to interview leaders of Nazi Germany after the war.  His experience as a warhistorian led to his joining the Truman administration as an adviser on local issues during his tours across the Heremained on Truman's administration throughout the remainder of his tenure and briefly into the administration of Dwight D. He was the author of ``The Bridge at Remagen,'' which detailed the Army's crossing of the Rhine River duringWorld War This publication helped make him a household name.  Ken later joined the American Political ScienceAssociation, with one of his jobs requiring him to find political science professors for colleges. His legacy in West Virginiabegan in 1957 when he got a request to teach political science at Marshall College, now Marshall Following one termat Marshall, he ran for Congress and won. He served nine terms in the U.House of Representatives from 1957 to 1977.  Hesaw West Virginia for the welcoming place it is. Once you have visited our little State, it never really leaves you. Mostimportantly, Ken recognized quickly the issues that matter in West Virginia--mostly concerning the coal industry and protectionof our miners. In the wake of the explosion at the Consol 9 mine in my hometown of Farmington, Ken played a key role in thepromotion of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. I personally lost many individuals who I knew well, including my dearUncle John and several classmates, in that explosion. The implementation of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act set thegroundwork for everything we have accomplished for our miners since then. I will always be grateful for Ken's contributions.  Among his many history-making legacies, Ken joined the march to Selma with the Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1965. Hewas the only active Member of Congress to participate.  After a successful tenure in Congress, Ken served as West Virginia'sSecretary of He moved his desk out front so he could interact with visitors passing through. He loved to visit with allWest He fought for transparency in our campaign finance system, was passionate about protecting our democraticprocess, and fought to ensure that West Virginians had access to cast their ballots.  Ken never gave up his commitment topublic service and continued to be active on the issues that matter to the public. At the age of 85, he walked 530 miles withGranny D to show his unwavering commitment to campaign finance reform, shortly after the McCain-Feingold Act passed Congress.Put simply, Ken was never one to back down from a challenge. The man was fearless and fought tirelessly for causes he believedin.  What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by dear friends and family. It is my hope that Ken'sloved ones are able to find peace, strength, and support in one another. This is a time to celebrate his life and vastaccomplishments, as well as the countless lives he touched, and to honor his memory in our thoughts and prayers.  Again, Iextend my most sincere condolences to his loving wife, Carol, and the entire Hechler family and dear friends. I am honored tojoin the people of West Virginia and beyond in recognizing his memory, as well as the unwavering love he had for his loved onesand our great His legacy of service will live on forever.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-20-pt1-PgS358.txt,1983,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6272,topic-id,1862,"Madam President, in 2010 the American people were promised a number of things, but among[[Page S88]]those things was affordable, accessible, and quality health care. They were promised that if they liked their health care plans, if they liked their insurance, they could keep those insurance policies. They were promised a system that could get more folks covered at lower costs.  Instead, unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act has failed us and has failed to keep its promises. Canceled policies, elimination of certain plans, difficulties in identifying new plans, massive premium increases, sky-high deductibles, and limited options for doctors have really become a new standard for many American families.  At the end of last year, I completed another round of 105 townhall meetings in our There are 105 counties in On occasion--it is pretty rare but on occasion someone will say: The Affordable Care Act was helpful to me and my family. My response to that is: I am glad, but surely we can come up with a proposal--a plan--that isn't so damaging to so many other people for the benefits that you claim you have acquired under the Affordable Care Surely, we can come up with a plan that doesn't increase premiums, increase deductibles, increase copayments, eliminate plans, reduce the choice of the physician you see, and reduce your ability to keep the health care plan that you like. Because I am opposed to the Affordable Care Act does not mean I am opposed to trying to make sure Americans have better options and more affordable care.  I have also visited all 127 hospitals in our I have had conversations with the chief financial officer, the CEO, the trustees, the doctors, the nurses, and almost without exception the conversation is about how bad debt expenses increase, the ability for their patients--people who are admitted to the hospital--to pay their bills is less, not more, and that is because they can't afford the copayments and deductibles.  Unfortunately, ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--has taken away the freedom to make health care decisions from Americans, from us as individuals, and given way too much authority to the Federal Kansans continue to ask me to help them get back to their former health care plans, to find a better way to do this, a plan that is more affordable with better coverage.  Over the last 6 years, I have advocated for a number of changes to our health care plan to help American families. Even before President Obama was President, we were talking about what we ought to do.  I had ideas of what we could do to improve the chances that people across Kansas and around the country would have a better opportunity to provide health care insurance for themselves and their family members. I am proud of some of the successes we have had in recent time.  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a supporter of funding for NIH, or the National Institutes of This is research that is essential to saving and improving lives, growing our economy, and maintaining America's role as a global leader, but, most importantly, it saves lives and improves health care. In addition, it saves money--the cost of health care--if we can find the cure and treatment for cancer, for diabetes, for Alzheimer's. One of the ways we can help reduce the cost of health care and make it more affordable is to make certain that we make the necessary investments in finding those cures and treatments.  Last year, I supported, and this Senate and Congress passed, the 21st Century Cures This takes us in additional directions in the way of finding those cures for life-altering diseases and, in the process, helps us to save our families' dollars. We have also worked hard to try to maintain the funding for Federal programs and agencies that work with universities and medical schools to train and recruit medical professionals who then go on to serve particularly in medically underserved areas. It is very typical of your State and mine, Madam President, in which we are experiencing the constant shortage of the necessary professionals to provide the necessary health care.  While this is progress, with a new Congress, a new year, and a new administration, we now have a tremendous opportunity to provide real substantive reform to our health care system. I mentioned the conversations I have had in townhall meetings. In addition to the health care side of the Affordable Care Act and the problems it has created for affordable and accessible health care, we have also had the challenges on the economic side--the job creation side--that the Affordable Care Act has unfortunately caused--the conversation about whether or not to expand a business, whether or not to exceed the 50-employee threshold. Those aspects of the Affordable Care Act are very damaging and need to be addressed and cured as well.  As we as a Senate, we as a Congress, and we as a country look for a replacement strategy, for something different--significantly different than the Affordable Care Act--we ought to focus on the practical reforms that embrace increased flexibility and allow American men and women to decide what is right for them and their individual family health care needs.  As we take this matter up in Congress, I wish to again put forth some specific ideas I have offered over the years as a blueprint for reform that we should try to put in place.  First, we should maintain preexisting condition protections for those with continuous coverage. Individuals with debilitating diseases and chronic conditions who have purchased health care should be reassured that their coverage will not be stripped in any future health care changes to our system.  Second, we can increase coverage by enabling Americans to shop for plans from coast to coast, no matter what State they live in. This will lower the premiums by spurring greater competition in the insurance market.  Third, we should extend tax savings to those who purchase health care coverage, regardless of their employment. To assist low-income Americans, we can offer tax credits to help them obtain the private insurance of their choice. We also can expand access to care by supporting community health centers and other primary care access points.  Fourth, instead of limiting the choice of plans, let's give small businesses and organizations the ability to pool together in order to offer health insurance at lower premiums, similar to corporations and labor unions. We also need to make it possible for health insurance to travel with workers when they move from one job to another job throughout their careers.  Fifth, we ought to increase the incentives available to individuals to save now for their future and for long-term care needs by empowering them to utilize health savings accounts and other incentive plans. Doing so enables individuals to take ownership in their health, and that is important as well.  Sixth, we need not accept the idea that costs for currently available medical treatments will inevitably rise. Instead, let's continue to support those things that bring down the cost of health care by finding cures and treatments, as I mentioned, with the National Institutes of Advancing lifesaving medical research and spurring innovation can help us accomplish health care savings, reducing the financial burden for those with diseases and their family members who care for them.  Seventh, we need to address shortages in our medical workforce by promoting education and programs at our universities and our medical schools that train physicians, nurses, and other health care officials and encourage them to practice in underserved areas through scholarship and loan repayment programs. Kansas is an example, as is your State, Madam President, where those rural areas and, additionally, those core centers of our cities lack so often the necessary health care providers.  Eighth, in order to curb the preventable costs that often occur through unnecessary emergency room visits and untreated symptoms of disease, we should provide coverage to low-income Americans, despite their limited financial means, in a financially sustainable way that ends up saving money in the long run. For all of us, the best reduction in health care costs is wellness, fitness, diet, and nutrition. That also means early preventive care. It means early diagnosis, and we make certain that Americans have access to that diagnosis and that early treatment. Ensuring access to quality care with a focus on preventive health is an effective way to limit high-cost health visits that place burdens on hospitals,[[Page S89]]physicians, our economy, and our health care system as a whole.  Lastly, we can reform our medical liability system and reduce frivolous lawsuits that result in inflated premiums and the practice of defensive medicine, where doctors order every possible test out of fear of potential lawsuit. Doing so can save tens of billions of dollars each year and make health care more affordable for more people.  The bureaucracy that goes with the providing of health care needs to be simplified. I have often looked behind the desk when I go see my family physician and wonder what all the people who are working there are doing. So much of it is not about patient care but navigating the system by which your health care bill, at least in part, gets paid. There is all the variety of insurance forms. I know this in my life--the ability to understand that insurance document that arrives in the mail and sits on our kitchen table waiting for my wife or me to figure out what this means. I have seen this with my own parents when they were living--the amount of documents, paperwork, and forms and checks for $13.19 that arrived in my dad's mailbox and trying to figure out with my parents: What does that mean? Why am I getting this?  So much cost savings and so much anxiety and angst could be eliminated if we had a system that was much more uniform in its presentation, simplifying the way in which our health care bill gets paid by our insurance provider, by Medicare, by Medicaid, or out of our own pocket. I would defy most Americans to be able, unfortunately, to understand what is the stuff that comes in the mail and what it means to them.  As we move forward with trying to replace and improve access of Americans to health care--to affordable health care--I believe there are reforms that will provide us with a good blueprint for how to start helping Kansans and all Americans across the country who have suffered under the deficiencies and the costs and the damage that comes from  I look forward to working with my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--to find solutions to take advantage of this opportunity that we have. The American people--many American people, most American people--are hurting under this law, and they have spoken clearly numerous times. It is time for us to bring to them the changes that improve their lives by improving their health care, by improving their health, and by making sure that no American is worried about whether or not the necessary health care that they need or their family member needs is outside of their reach.

6265,topic-id,1276,"Mr.President, what is happening on the floor right now is absolutely extraordinary. It is absolutely extraordinary that Republicans are using the budget process, the reconciliation process, in between the swearing in of the new Congress and the swearing in of a new President, to rip away from 20 million Americans health care insurance, to drive up rates for one-third of consumers in this country who have some form of preexisting condition--a sickness that without this law would make their rates go higher--and to throw the entire health care marketplace into chaos.  It is absolutely exceptional what is happening right now. No one in this body should normalize it. No one outside of this body should perceive this to be just politics as usual.  I was here when the Affordable Care Act passed. I was in the House of Since then, I have heard my Republican friends say over and over and over again that they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it. I can't tell you the hundreds of times I have heard that phrase, ``repeal it and replace it.''  President-Elect Trump talked about that throughout the campaign, and then 2 days after he won the election, on Thursday night, he went on national television to double down on the promise that there would be an immediate replacement. He said: There will not be 2 hours between the Affordable Care Act being repealed and it being replaced with something better.  That is the second part of the argument the Republicans have made. The Affordable Care Act, in their minds, was deficient, despite the fact that there are 20 million people who have insurance today who wouldn't have it otherwise and despite the fact that there are hundreds of millions of Americans across the country who don't have to worry about them and their loved ones having their insurance rates jacked up because they are sick, and despite the fact that seniors are paying thousands of dollars less in prescription drugs than they were.  The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect--it never was--but the enthusiasm of Republicans to take away from Americans their health insurance and to drive rates up for millions more is really unthinkable.  We heard over and over again that the priority was to repeal it and replace it. Now we are repealing the Affordable Care Act with no plan for what comes next. We are driving forward with a repeal vote with no plan for how we keep the health care system together, how we prevent it from falling into chaos, how we continue to insure the millions of Americans who rely on it.  There is a cruelty to this enthusiasm for immediate repeal that is a little bit hard to understand--it is really hard to understand.  I think about somebody like Jonathan He lives in my He lives in Meriden, He was born with cystic fibrosis. He is insured today through the Affordable Care Here is what he said:       For me, I was able to live a relatively normal life growing      up, wonderful family and friends, but health has always been      the most important thing in my life. I spend even in a good      health year probably one or two hospitalizations each year      that require IV antibiotics, I am on a whole suite of      medications, each day I take about 15 to 20 medications, some      of those are pills, some are breathing treatments, and then      there are the shots. Healthcare is the number one priority in      my life, it's more important than income, more important than      anything else, being able to maintain my health.  He is insured by the Affordable Care Act today, but he also receives the benefit of the insurance protections because Jonathan, without the Affordable Care Act, even if he had insurance, would lose it--probably a couple of months into the year--because of a practice prior to the Affordable Care Act of capping the amount of money you would be covered for in a given year or in a lifetime. Jonathan would have blown through that in a heartbeat.  It is not hyperbole when he says: ``Without the Affordable Care Act, I'd probably be dead within months.''  That is the reality for millions of people across this country. Without health insurance, they cannot survive. They can't afford their medication.  So this isn't just about politics, this isn't just about the words on the page, these are people's lives. This is about life or death, and the casualness of throwing out a law without any concept of what comes next--I have read so many quotes in the paper over the last few days of Republicans admitting they don't know yet what they are going to do in its place, but they still feel the need right now, in the lameduck session, to begin the process of repealing this law without any concept of what comes next.  Why do it now? Why not take one step back? Why not reach across the aisle to Democrats and say: Let's try to work to make this better. Let's try to answer the concerns the Republicans have, that President-Elect Trump has. Let's take some time to work through this, reform it in a bipartisan way. Instead, we are rushing forward with repeal, stealing health care for millions of Americans, plunging the health care system into chaos, with no guarantee that there is anything that is going to emerge in its place.  Senator Kaine and I have a very simple budget point of order. Senator Kaine has talked about it. It would prohibit the consideration of any legislation as part of budget reconciliation that would, 1, reduce the number of Americans who are enrolled in health insurance; 2, increase premiums or total out-of-pocket costs for those people with private insurance; or, 3, reduce the scope and scale of benefits that people have.  I have heard my Republican friends say: We are going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and we are going to replace it with something better. We are not even committing you to replacing it with something better. We are just saying, if you are going to replace it, let's guarantee now that legislation is not going to take anybody's health care insurance away who has it now who wants it, it is not going to raise costs, and it is not going to reduce benefits.  I am going to be honest. The replacement isn't coming. It is not coming, and even if it comes, it can't meet those three tests. There is no way there is a replacement coming that is going to maintain the 20 million people who have insurance now, that is going to maintain cost controls and maintain benefits. It is not happening.  News flash to the American public: This law is being repealed under a budget reconciliation process that shuts out Democrats, and it is not going to be replaced by something that is equal in quality or better. At the very least, we can all put our names and our votes to a budget point of order that commits Republicans to the promise that they have made for 6 years, which is that if they repeal this, they will not put a piece of legislation before this Congress that doesn't guarantee that everybody keeps their health insurance, costs don't go up, and benefits don't come down.  I urge, when this comes up for a vote, a positive vote from my colleagues, and I urge my Republican friends to honor the promise they have made.  I thank Senator Kaine and others for joining me in offering it.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The majority whip.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1837,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6092,topic-id,931,"Mr.Speaker, on Monday, just yesterday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 70, providing for the consideration of H.38, legislation utilizing the Congressional Review Act to overturn the final stream protection rule promulgated by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, or the OSMRE, which is at the Department of the The rule provides for consideration of the joint resolution under a closed rule, as is customary with these CRA measures.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of a critical measure that will help protect American businesses and families from the Obama administration's rampant regulatory overreach. H.38 disapproves of the final stream protection rule which was released by the Department of the Interior on December 19, 2016, representing yet another last-minute, midnight regulation from the previous administration.  This burdensome rule seeks to govern the interaction between surface mining operations and streams by establishing a buffer-zone rule that blocks mining within 100 feet of those streams. This was done, despite the Department of the Interior's own reports, which shows that virtually all coal mines in this country have no offsite impacts, they are being operated safely, and that lands are being restored successfully under existing Federal and State regulation.  During the rulemaking process, OSMRE and the Department of the Interior ignored existing regulatory success at the Federal and the State level and shut out the cooperating agencies, the States who are responsible for enforcing Federal mining regulations.  In 2015, 9 of the 10 cooperating States withdrew as cooperating agencies in the rulemaking and development process, due to OSMRE's exclusionary tactics, failure to provide for meaningful participation, and continual limiting of the States' involvement over the past several years.  The National Environmental Policy Act or, as we know it as, NEPA, requires OSMRE, as the lead rulemaking agency, to involve States in the drafting of the regulation and requires them to involve These failures, and the restrictive tactics that were employed by OSMRE, led the House Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr.Rob Bishop of Utah, to send a letter in 2015 to the GAO, the Government Accountability Office, requesting a review of OSMRE's compliance with NEPA in the agencies' development and drafting of the proposed stream protection rule. Ample evidence exists that OSMRE excluded these States from the NEPA process, in contradiction of both NEPA regulations and the memoranda of understanding between OSMRE and the  Mr.Speaker, the stream protection rule unilaterally rewrites over 400 existing rules and regulations. It threatens over one-third of the Nation's coal mining workforce and will send repercussions throughout the broader U.economy. The final rule is the definition of a one-size-fits-all solution due to OSMRE's failure to conduct the 7-year rewrite in a transparent process consistent with their statutory requirements to engage State and local stakeholders.  An economic analysis conducted by the National Mining Association found that the total number of jobs at risk of loss is somewhere between 112,000 and 280,000 people, approximately 30 to 75 percent of the current industry employment levels.  Further, the misguided regulation would jeopardize 40,000 to 77,000 jobs in both surface and underground mining operations, industries that are still reeling from 8 years of overregulation from the previous administration.  And while the Obama administration never seemed to mind the consequences of its actions on hardworking Americans, I can assure you that the new, unified Republican government is opposed to ineffective regulations like this one which unnecessarily put people out of work, raise energy costs on consumers, and do nothing to improve the environment.  By passing this rule, we have the opportunity to consider a resolution that will prevent this regulation from removing over one-half of the total U.coal reserves available for extraction, while also reducing oppressive barriers to responsible coal production.  The Congressional Review Act of 1996 was enacted to be a powerful tool to[[Page H762]]allow Congress to overturn last-minute regulations from the previous administration, under an expedited legislative process. If Congress passes a joint resolution disapproving the rule, and the resolution becomes a law, the rule cannot take effect or continue. CRAs are designed to address and invalidate problematic rules from the previous administration, and the stream protection rule clearly fits the bill.  Furthermore, this CRA provides certainty to State regulatory bodies tasked with regulating 97 percent of the coal mines in the United States and enforcing Federal mining regulations by strengthening the State primacy framework provided in the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation  Blocking the final stream protection rule will restore an important stream of State and Federal tax revenue associated with coal extraction across the country that is benefiting hardworking American taxpayers.  Mr.Speaker, every Member of this body wants to protect the environment, ensure clean water and clean air for our citizens, and encourage innovative and responsible ways to produce energy. However, these goals are not mutually exclusive, as some opponents of this legislation will argue.  It is past time that we embrace commonsense, practical Federal rules and regulations that protect the environment and the countless Americans working in the industries that support our economy and provide for greater domestic energy independence.  The rule we consider here today provides for the consideration of a bill that is critically important to the future economic growth and job growth of our country. By passing this CRA, we can take a badly needed step toward protecting American families and businesses from the rampant executive overreach that will be the defining achievement of the past administration.  I urge my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying legislation.

Mr.Speaker, getting back to the issue at hand and the stream protection rule, there are many points that my friend from Florida brought up. One occurred to me as well: Is this really a midnight rule; or could something that was started in 2008 really be considered as something that was shoved through at the last minute?  I did ask that question, and the answer is a resounding ``yes.''  During the process in 2011, some of the reports came out that were leaked that the Department did not see as favorable as it related to jobs and the economy and the negative impact that it would have on that, so they stopped the process, shutting out the States violating the memorandum of understanding that they are required to work with the States on the rulemaking process leaving those States with no recourse but to withdraw from the process.  In 2015, this Congress told them to reengage with the States, which they did to some degree, making it necessary for States to actually pay for the scientific evidence that was necessary for them to be engaged. So there are several problems that cause this to be an issue that we need to address today, and certainly making it a midnight rule, the last thing done as the administration walks out the door, qualifies this as something that we should be considering for many reasons and on many levels.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in favor of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Since the beginning of this Congress, we have devoted ourselves most prominently to a single goal: making Washington work for the people again.  There is one thing here in Washington that consistently stands against our people, our economy, and our Constitution: the Federal bureaucracy.  These agencies, bureaus, and departments--so numerous that nobody even knows how many there are--spend their lives thinking up new rules, and the rules they produce weigh down businesses, destroy jobs, and limit Americans' rights. Career bureaucrats who can't be voted out of office wield punishing authority with little to no accountability. They are agents of the status quo, and the revolving door of Federal employees moving to lobbying arms and consulting firms breed thousands of regulations that enrich the connected and powerful, sometimes at the great expense of the average This is the swamp. This is what opposes the people, and we are draining it.  In recent weeks, this House has already started its two-part plan to strip the bureaucracy of its power. We started to change the structure in Washington by passing the REINS Act and the Regulatory Accountability This week, we begin part two: targeting specific rules and stripping them from the books.  There has been no industry in America that has been more regulated than energy. We are going to use the Congressional Review Act to repeal the stream protection rule that could destroy tens of thousands of mining jobs and put up to 64 percent of our country's coal reserves off limits.  Then we will take on President Obama's 11th hour BLM methane emissions requirement. The oil and gas industry in America has already drastically reduced methane emissions even while increasing output, and the EPA already has the authority to regulate air emissions. Instead of helping the environment, this rule could cost America's energy industry up to $1 billion by 2025 and force smaller operations, especially out West, to shut down and lay off employees. So, this Friday, the House will get rid of it.  We will also take the ax to the SEC disclosure rule, which--now, if you can believe it--targets publicly traded American energy companies with even more regulatory compliance while it lets foreign companies off the hook. Washington should put American companies first, not put them at a disadvantage to their foreign competitors.  Mr.Speaker, it is not just energy, which would be bad enough; but under President Obama, the bureaucracy has even threatened our basic constitutional rights. A new rule from the Social Security Administration would increase scrutiny on up to 4.2 million disabled Americans if they attempt to purchase firearms. For the completely unrelated circumstance of having someone help manage your finances, Social Security recipients could be kept from exercising their Second Amendment rights. In an affront to due process, the bureaucracy has even attempted to blacklist from Federal contracts any business that is accused of violating labor laws, and that could be before the company has a chance to defend itself in court.  Every single one of these will be gone. With a vote in the House, a vote in the Senate, and President Trump's signature, we will get rid of every one of these job-killing and destructive regulations. The House is always at the service of the people. Now we are making the bureaucracy serve the people, too.  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH761-2.txt,2275,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6196,topic-id,567,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I would just like to take a minute to remind the American people and my friends across the aisle that we are here today, as the minority leader said, to begin the process of unwinding the burdensome regulations that are truly stifling job creation and hurting our friends and our families in each and every one of our neighborhoods across the country.  Many from the other side have tried to distract with unrelated issues. I just want to be clear that the rule today does not address immigration in any way and that none of their requests went through the regular and bipartisan process to clear such requests.  So let's focus on why we are here. We are here because we must take a firm stand against the overly burdensome and restrictive regulations that have been issued in the waning days of the previous administration. By passing this CRA, we can rescind the final stream protection rule, which the OSM produced without input from the States--responsible for enforcing mining regulations--and which disregards[[Page H770]]existing regulations on both the State and the Federal levels that have proven to be effective.  This regulation will have devastating effects on mining communities across the country and will lead to significant job losses and higher electricity costs--all while weakening U.energy security for decades. The stream protection rule will drastically reduce our access to coal and our ability to develop new clean coal technologies, which will result in reduced domestic energy protection and in tens of thousands of lost jobs in coal-producing States as well as in industries across the country that are reliant on this energy. If we fail to pass the underlying bill, the rule's devastating impacts will be felt far and wide in our great land as approximately 78,000 mining jobs will be lost, which is in addition to the tens of thousands of mining jobs that have already been lost in the last 8 years.  Mr.Speaker, coal is essential to the U.economy. It provides affordable energy that accounts for almost 40 percent of the Nation's electricity supply--almost 20 percent in the gentleman's home State of Because of its abundance, reliability, and affordability, electricity generated from coal is generally 30 percent cheaper than other alternative energy sources. Additionally, at current consumption rates, our country has more than 250 years of remaining coal reserves, ensuring that we will have energy security here at home for generations to come.  Passing H.38 will protect American jobs and families from yet another burdensome regulation that has failed to follow the basic tenets of transparency, inclusivity, and cooperation with stakeholders, cooperating States, and, most importantly, the American people.  Now is the time for Congress to overturn this unparalleled executive overreach and implement policies that protect communities that have been long forgotten by the former administration. The CRA was designed for this exact purpose, and we now have a unique opportunity to pass this legislation through both Chambers and see it signed into law.  Mr.Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the consideration of an important resolution that will ensure that mining communities and hardworking families are not pressed by another crippling Federal regulation. I believe this rule and the underlying legislation are strong measures that are important to our country's future. I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 70 and the underlying joint resolution.  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH761-2.txt,2275,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6096,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose H.38, which would disapprove the Department of the Interior's stream protection rule.  When the Obama administration announced the final stream protection rule, it was a victory for those who live in coal country. The rule prioritizes the health of our fellow Americans by establishing clear requirements for responsible surface coal mining, especially dangerous mountaintop removal mining.  If this Obama rule were fully enforced, it would protect or restore 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests over the next two decades. At the time the rule was finalized, I called for stronger stream buffer zone protections, but the announced regulation was undoubtedly a win for human health, clean water, and our environment.  I want to be very clear about what the stream protection rule does. This rule requires that mining companies avoid practices that permanently pollute streams and sources of drinking water, damage forests, and increase flood risks. The rule requires, for the first time, that streams around mining sites be monitored and tested for the presence of toxic chemicals, like lead and arsenic. This rule also requires mining companies to restore polluted streams and replant mined areas with native trees and vegetation.[[Page H764]]  These provisions ensure that mining companies take responsibility for their actions and act to ensure that coal country communities do not suffer because of destructive mining practices. Now we are debating an ill-conceived resolution which would negate these important advances.  If this rule were to be overturned, American families living near impacted streams and rivers will not be protected from toxic chemicals getting into their water. What is even more appalling is that, because the Congressional Review Act prevents substantially similar regulations from being developed in the future, this joint resolution means that these affected communities might never be protected from the impacts of mining waste in their water.  Protecting our rivers and streams from the damaging impacts of mountaintop removal has been a priority for me, and it is why in past Congresses I have introduced the Clean Water Protection Act, which would end the dumping of mining waste into our country's rivers and streams. I will be reintroducing that legislation this session.  It is unfathomable that congressional Republicans would pass this joint resolution and doom generations of children and families to irreparable harm. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.  ",CREC-2017-01-31-pt1-PgH761-2.txt,887,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,31.0,January

We are seeing the fulfillment of a past campaign promise rather than a focus on our future. The administration claims that the Clean Power Plan limits jobs. The reality is that the jobs were not lost due to tougher carbon emission standards. Instead, jobs were found due to our innovation, more competition based on cheaper natural gas, more mechanization due to advances in technology, and more tax credits for renewable energy.  The reality is that more jobs and property will be lost without reducing our CO2 output. More CO2 will lead to more acidification which will lead to less fish and less fishermen. More CO2 will lead to shrinking icecaps and expanding sea levels causing damage to property not only along the central coast of California, my district, but along all coastlines around the world.

6279,topic-id,3585,"Mr.President, I enjoyed listening to the comments of my colleague from Utah about the Affordable Care Act, and I wanted to expand on that a little if I could. I know we are having a discussion right now about whether to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and we are focused a lot on what the timeframe might be and what the replacement might be, which is appropriate, but we also have to remind ourselves as to how we got here.  We got here because the Affordable Care Act has not met its promises and has let down the people of Ohio and people around the country. Millions of these families have already had a tough time experiencing really a middle-class squeeze of flat wages, even declining wages, on average, over the last decade or so, and now higher costs. That squeeze is accelerated by the cost of health care which has gone up dramatically.  In my own State of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Insurance has reported a 91-percent increase in the individual market in Ohio in the last 6 years, an 80-percent increase for small businesses that are purchasing Affordable Care Act-compliant plans. This is since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Think about that. There has been almost a doubling of health care premium costs. Who can afford that? People certainly can't afford that as their wages are flat or even declining.  According to the Kaiser Family Health Foundation, average family premiums since the Affordable Care Act was put into place have increased by more than $4,700. Recall that one of the promises of the Affordable Care Act was that costs would go down, on average, $2,500 per family. Exactly the opposite has happened. In fact, there has been an almost doubling, with a $4,700 increase. I don't think families got that kind of pay increase to be able to afford that. They certainly haven't in  So this is a huge problem. To make matters worse, we think these cost increases are continuing to escalate in our State and around the country. In Ohio, premiums grew this year in 2017--on average, 13 percent higher than in 2016. So there have been double-digit increases in 1 year. With two plans in particular, premiums went up by 39 percent in So for some families it was much worse than that. We have had good leadership in Ohio with Governor Kasich and Mary Taylor, who is also the insurance commissioner in our State, and because of that we have done a better job of trying to control these costs, but in many parts of the country, the situation is getting even worse.  Nationally, premiums are increasing by 25 percent just this year. In Arizona, they are doubling. In Tennessee, they are rising 63 percent. In Pennsylvania, right next door to Ohio, they are rising 32 percent. I can go on and on. I am sure North Dakota has had similar problems, as the Presiding Officer can tell us about. Some people might be able to afford these higher premiums, but I think we just can't afford it.  I heard Senator Hatch talk about having to make a choice between paying your rent or being able to pay your premium. That is what I hear in Ohio as I talk to people who are struggling and are now being hit with these huge expenses. Unless we take action, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  The Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan group in Congress, and also the Joint Committee on Taxation projected that unless we do something to change the status quo, premiums will continue to skyrocket. They say they will grow by at least 5 percent per year over the next decade. By the way, that is far faster than they assume wages are going to grow so the squeeze will continue.  The law was advertised as something that would ``bend the cost curve,'' meaning we would begin to see a reduction in the costs of health care, but health care costs have gone up, not down, and on top of that, American people had to pay hundreds of billions of dollars every year in taxes for this new law. There are 19 tax increases in the Affordable Care Some of these, like the Cadillac tax, are very unpopular, even among Democrats and So we are hoping we can deal[[Page S93]]with that with any kind of repeal effort immediately.  Another goal of this law, we were supposed to be increasing access to health care. Let's talk about that for a second. We heard different things on the floor about that. About 6 million people lost health insurance they liked as a direct result of this law going into effect. About 6 million Americans were told their coverage is no longer adequate because it didn't meet the mandates so they will lose their coverage. President Obama told the American people, I am told, 37 different times that if they liked their doctor, they could keep their doctor. Of course, that turned out not to be true. When you lose your health care plan and lose your doctor, you don't feel like those promises have been kept.  The outside fact checker called PolitiFact rated that as the Lie of the Year for 2013. That is the outside group that looks at what we elected officials say is going to happen and then compares it to what actually happens. By the way, it still is not true. One in five ObamaCare customers were forced to find a new insurance company for this year.  So the Congressional Budget Office that I mentioned and the Joint Committee on Taxation, these nonpartisan groups, now project that 27 million Americans are still uninsured today. Under the status quo, if we don't take action, they say that will be the case for the next decade. So this notion that everybody is going to get covered just hasn't happened. By the way, that is about 1 in 10 people in our workforce, even after hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars have been spent on the Affordable Care Act, including these 19 new tax increases.  A lot of people have told me: Rob, I have health insurance, but I really don't because my deductible is so high. So, forgetting the premiums for a second, to pay for health care, just the annual deductible has gone out of sight. There are some plans where a deductible for a family might be $8, $9, $10,000 a year. That is not really health care because you end up paying all that money out of pocket. The average deductible for a midlevel plan for ObamaCare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, went up to $2,500 the year before last, 2015, to more than $3,000 last year, an increase of about 25 percent in just 1 year. You see that in increases in deductibles and copays, not just in the premiums.  National insurers have lost billions of dollars on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, and a lot of them pulled their plans from the This is a real problem because if you don't have competition or choice out there, you will not get the costs down. I see in my own State of Ohio we lost one-third of the companies on the exchanges just this year. We have gone from 17 companies offering insurance on the exchanges in 2016, last year, to this year having just 11--so 17 companies going down to 11 companies. We now have 20 of our counties--there are 88 counties in Ohio--20 of our counties have only 1 insurer. This is also true nationally. About one-third of the counties around the United States only have one insurer. Again, this leads to higher costs, less choice, less competition. Quality also goes down because you don't have competition for the beneficiaries. It also affects the issue of premiums going up, deductibles going up, copays going up, and the middle-class squeezed.  So the President's health care law certainly failed at its own goals that were laid out in the promises that were made. It was supposed to create jobs, too, which is a different issue. What is the economic effect of this? Having more people covered is a good thing. We all want that. But what is the economic impact on the way the Affordable Care Act was put into place? We are looking at the weakest recovery in the history of our country from a recession still. Unfortunately, we haven't seen the strong economic growth we hoped for and had anticipated after a deep recession. Some of the reason for that, in my view, is health care. Health care costs went up dramatically. People are paying a lot more for health care, not being able to get ahead, small businesses having higher and higher costs.  If you look at the latest jobs report, it is interesting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tells us that 5.7 million Americans now are stuck in part-time work who want full-time work. These are people who are looking for a full-time job but only have a part-time job. Why is that? The economy is not working as it should. It is not generating enough growth to create job opportunities full-time, but it is also because of these mandates under the Affordable Care I can tell you, economists may differ on the impact of this, but go talk to people about it.  I was in Chillicothe, OH, and someone came up to me and asked: Can you help me; because my employer is saying I can only work 28 hours a week. I figured out what it was about. She was a fast-food employee. I asked her: What did they say? And she said it was because of health care. What does that mean? It means that under ObamaCare, if you work under 30 hours a week, you are not covered by the mandates and the new costs, so some employers are going to say we are keeping you under 30 hours a week. That has led to more part-time work.  In this particular case, the woman said: I have to find another part-time job and I have kids at home and this is tough. And I said: Well, the answer to this, in part, is to change the health care law; that is, to take out some of the mandates and requirements and make it more pro-growth and pro-job rather than the current situation.  There are tens of thousands of new pages of regulations in this new law. It forces small businesses--and I am a small business person. I can tell you that I have burned a lot of time and effort to try to figure it out. You can go to consultants and pay them a bunch of money, and they will tell you they are not sure what it means either. This is one of the big issues that doesn't get talked about much with the Affordable Care Act; that it is really hard for businesses to figure out what they are supposed to do, particularly small businesses that don't have that kind of expertise inhouse. Those costs could go toward having more employees, they could go into reinvesting in business, plants and equipment, but they are going into trying to figure this thing out.  I don't doubt the good intentions of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support this legislation. We all want to see more coverage and see health care costs go down, but that is not what is happening.  Before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the CBO estimated that 26 million Americans would be enrolled in a plan in 2016. That is what they estimated. The Congressional Budget Office said 26 million would be enrolled in a plan in 2016. The actual number was 12.7 million, less than half. So, again, it hasn't met its own promises and projections.  The co-ops are another failure. There was a debate on the floor just before I got elected about should there be a public option so everybody would have an option to get into an exchange. We said let's put together these co-ops. They will be nonprofit. They will work great. We will set up co-ops around the country. There were 23 co-ops set up, including 1 in We now see that 15 of the 23 co-ops have gone insolvent.  I will tell you that last spring, when 22,000 Ohioans lost their health care because the co-op went belly up, it was tough because they had to scramble and find a new health care plan quickly. More than 860,000 Americans--people who were encouraged by this law to sign up for these co-op plans--had to scramble to find new coverage because of a failed co-op. It is tough on these families.  It is also tough on the taxpayer. We did an investigation of this under the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and we looked at what was happening to these families and we also looked at what was happening to the taxpayer. At that time, when only about half of the co-ops had gone under, rather than two-thirds, $1.2 billion of taxpayer money had already been spent on these co-ops. That money isn't coming back to the Treasury, meaning this is money that will probably never be repaid. Again, part of the problem with our deficit is that ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act is so expensive, and the co-ops in particular just wasted money. Among the surviving co-ops, 3 have not yet enrolled 25,000 members. In other words, they are not enrolling enough members even if they are surviving. So the nonpartisan Government Accountability[[Page S94]]Office, GAO, issued a report in March which confirmed the results of our investigation, and it indicates that this money, the $1.2 billion, has now increased substantially because more of the co-ops have gone under.  Many of those 22,000 Ohio families who were in the co-op had already paid deductibles in the plans they thought they could count on. Think about it. They paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in health care costs to get up to their deductible, and then all of a sudden they found out that they had to go to a new plan and they had to start all over again. So it is adding insult to injury. They lost their plan and they had to scramble to find one and then they found out they have all these out-of-pocket expenses again because although they met their deductible under the old plan, they have to start again in the new plan. This is not the way it ought to be. It is just not fair. These families did nothing wrong. All they did was what they were told to do, to sign up for these co-ops.  I think these are just symptoms of the problem. The diagnosis is clear. The Affordable Care Act is a bad law, bad economics, and bad health care policy. It hasn't worked. I think it is difficult to make the other argument. The President's health care law hasn't worked, not because it didn't have good intentions but because it tried to achieve those good intentions by forcing millions of people to buy a product they didn't want after losing a product they did want, including a $2 billion taxpayer-funded Web site that didn't work. If you recall, they had problems with the Affordable Care Act Web site and unfortunately potentially exposed a lot of personal information of many of these individuals to hackers.  As I talked about, even those who have insurance often have limited access to providers because the deductible is so high that they can't afford their health care.  With higher costs and fewer choices, the American people, by and large, are dissatisfied with the plan, the Affordable Care Act, just as they were when it was enacted. A CBS poll last month has shown that more people disapprove of the law then approve of it. A Gallup poll in November found that 8 in 10 Americans want the law repealed or significantly changed--8 in 10 Why? Because they have seen it.  By the way, most Americans were not in the exchanges, but they still felt it. Think about this. When a company is involved in the exchanges and losing money, and many of these companies are losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year, what they are doing is they are cost-shifting onto private plans, onto employer-based plans, and raising the costs for other This is part of the reason health care costs have gone up generally, not just in the exchanges but overall.  I have certainly seen this firsthand in Constituents have been contacting me for the last 6 years to tell me how this health care law has affected them. There is a father of five who wrote to me after the cost of the family's insurance doubled. Another man saw his $100 deductible soar to $4,000 while his premiums hit $1,000 a month.  I still remember the letter I received from Dean from He lost his job in 2009 as so many other Americans did during the recession. Because he lost his job, he had to go on the individual market to buy health insurance. He picked out a plan that worked for him and his family. He liked it and he bought it. Once the President's health care law went into effect, that plan was discontinued because it didn't meet the mandates and requirements of the new law. He found himself high and dry. He, too, had to buy another plan that was twice as expensive, and it cost him more than half of his pension--because that is his income. It is his pension. So not only did he lose his job, but then he was saddled with a plan he couldn't afford and a much more expensive cost of living. He didn't do anything wrong, but because of a failed, mistaken approach that Congress took to health care reform, he has now had to struggle to make ends meet.  Susan from Batavia also wrote to me. She is a single mom. She lost the plan she liked because of the President's health care plan. She wrote and said: I stay in shape. I watch my diet. I exercise regularly. I do all the right things. I had a high-deductible, low-cost plan, but under the President's new health care law, I had to change my plan.  Her coverage, by the way, was for double the price of the premium. A single mom; tough to afford it.  Another, Susan from Columbus, OH, wrote to me and told me that she works for a small business of 12 employees. When the health care law went into effect, their rates went up nearly 30 percent in 1 year. Small businesses and new businesses cannot afford that. I cannot tell you how many small businesses I have been to where I asked them: What have your premiums done over the last several years, and they tell me: Double digit, Double digit. If we get an increase in the low double digit, that is a good thing. Again, there is no place for that to come from except for wages and benefits and cutting back on employees--in some cases, again, not expanding a plan that they otherwise would have because of this health care law.  It doesn't have to be this way. We can enact real health care reform that uses the market forces that help to increase competition, that requires insurance companies to compete for our business, that allows people to get the plan they want, looking all around the country for what works best for them. This burdensome health care law is standing in the way of real reforms right now. It is hurting families in Ohio and across the country.  The health care market was far from perfect before this law so I am not arguing that the status quo is acceptable. I think we have to do things not just to repeal ObamaCare but to replace the Affordable Care Act with reforms that make better sense. We had issues before, but it has gone to worse, not better. It accelerated the problems.  I hope that over the next couple of months, as we talk about this, we will be able to come up with a replacement plan that makes sense. Republicans and Democrats alike need to come to the table on this because, again, I have listed today all the reasons the current law is not working. The status quo is not acceptable. I think it is very hard to argue that it is. That means all of us have a responsibility to say: How do we fix this? How do we come together, Republicans and Democrats alike--not on a partisan basis as was done last time--to figure out a way to do it together? We need to come together to make sure the people we represent have the chance to get the health care they want for them and their families, that fits them, where they can have costs that are affordable, where they can have quality health care that is good for them and their families, where it can be patient-centered, and we can give people the affordable care they deserve.

Imagine the difficulties she had to deal with as the first woman in Congress--in 1917, no less--a woman who stood by her convictions no matter the cost. It must have been extremely harrowing for her at times, but she soldiered on as one would expect from the first female in what was at the time, and in many ways still is, a male-dominated world.  The Congresswoman was a woman of rock-solid principles which she absolutely would not budge from, as evidenced by her being the only Member of Congress to vote against involvement in both world wars, a position that was very unpopular at the time. But she stood by her beliefs and could not be swayed, an example for all of us.  While Congresswoman Rankin served only two terms in Congress, her legacy lives on in all of the women who have served since and those who will in the future. She famously once said, and we have all said it several times because it is worth saying and repeating:  ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''  She was absolutely correct, and I am grateful for her determination to ensure that the women of this great Nation have a voice in  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in saluting this remarkable woman and the lasting legacy she has left behind as an example to all women.

I was reflecting today, when I heard that this was going to happen, about the fact that we have, in Congress, I think it is 85 women now, which is about one-fifth of the Chamber, and I think there are 20 U.Senators, which is also one-fifth on the Senate side. Obviously, those numbers are not proportionate to women's place in the population.  I hope that we could use the anniversary of Jeannette Rankin's election to reflect on things that could be done to improve these numbers today. One of the things that I would love to be able to pursue with the gentlewoman and other interested Members is the use of multi-Member districts, which were much more common at the time that she first served than they are today.  A lot of our States have multi-Member districts for election to State house or State senate. When you use multi-Member districts, the proportion of women rises considerably because what happens is people form tickets, they form slates, and it would be very unusual today to form a slate that is not balanced according to gender and some kind of racial, ethnic diversity. When we have single-Member districts, it is[[Page H2738]]much tougher to accomplish that. So that is one of the things that we could discuss, in addition to making this Chamber and other chambers much more work-family friendly, especially for people who are in the young parenting years.  I thank the gentlewoman for what she has done and salute her on this project.

6204,topic-id,613,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in strong support of H.1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017. I commend the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) for introducing this very important bill.  Over the course of the last Congress, the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee conducted rigorous oversight of TSA's technology and equipment acquisition process, and they found it fraught with waste and inefficiencies. The committee also found that TSA fails to effectively communicate its procurement needs with the private sector.  Our government relies upon private sector innovation to develop security technologies. However, that innovation comes with a price tag, and we cannot reasonably expect the private sector to spend millions of dollars in research and development of new emerging technologies without greater transparency and communication, both with the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, as to exactly what their future needs and technology investments will be in the future.  This bill will provide greater transparency into TSA's acquisition plan, allowing for industry to better meet emerging needs, and enable better congressional oversight.  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, last Congress, I served as the ranking member of the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, and we held multiple hearings on TSA's acquisition processes.  In the course of conducting oversight and engaging with stakeholders, we learned that deficiencies in TSA's planning for technology investments were causing serious issues for technology companies who produce products to meet the Agency's needs.  Under the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act, TSA was required to develop a 5-year technology investment plan. Stakeholders widely supported this strategy and welcomed the release of TSA's first 5-year plan in August of 2015, but that support eroded when the budget request for the same year did not align with the acquisition schedule in the 5-year plan.  The purpose of the plan was to give businesses the time and certainty they need to align their resources and planning to meet TSA's technology needs. Security technology manufacturers looked at the plan and invested significant resources in the technology that TSA planned to acquire, but then they saw the budget request and found that TSA had shifted direction and no longer planned to procure that technology.  That lost investment of time and resources hurts all technology manufacturers, but it can completely destroy small businesses and discourage small-business owners from working with the Federal  My bill, H.1353, will help solve this problem by requiring TSA to report to Congress on their 5-year plan annually instead of biennially, and it will require TSA to notify Congress and all relevant stakeholders of any changes or updates to the plan.  These commonsense steps will help ensure that there is ongoing engagement between TSA and industry stakeholders so that manufacturers of all sizes can continue to meet TSA's technological needs and continue to innovate and address security vulnerabilities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.  I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonnie Watson Coleman, Congressman Keating, and Subcommittee Chairman John Katko for[[Page H2213]]being original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.  H.1353 was unanimously approved by the full Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. Enacting my bill will ensure that TSA's technology objectives are more closely aligned with the industry's stakeholders that produce technologies to help TSA meet those objectives.

Frankly, the      only conceivable reason the department would release      regulations so out of sync with the Every Student Succeeds      Act and President Obama's own call to reduce high-stakes      testing is they are simply checking off their bucket list of      outstanding issues before the end of their term.       The final regulations could harm students who benefit the      most from consistent, high-quality standards for teacher      preparation programs. The regulations will create enormous      difficulty for teacher prep programs and place an unnecessary      burden on institutions and states, which are also in the      process of implementing  My second quotation comes from the comments of the provost and the chair of the Department of Education at Creighton University in Omaha, NE, dated February 2, 2015, of the comment period:       As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant      financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and      states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500      individual teacher preparation ``programs'' subject to the      complexities of these regulations.  Again, these regulations are 700 pages.       Even as a system is developed, issues regarding privacy,      low numbers, and student demographics would impact results      unfairly and result in decisions unlikely to improve teacher      preparation programs and student learning at PK-12 schools      [in Nebraska].  My third and final quotation comes from the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Nebraska, and they wrote the Department of Education about this rule as follows:       [T]he budgetary impact of this regulation is significantly      understated, if not laughable. No financial support for      states, school systems, or institutions of higher education      to implement the requirements is proposed. The regulations      create new requirements for colleges, schools, and states to      track and report on candidates and teachers for many years.      Those systems are not in place. The cost estimates make      inaccurate assumptions that colleges and states already have      the systems in place for collecting, analyzing, reporting,      and utilizing data (federally-mandated data which may or may      not be valid or reliable for the purposes for which it is      intended to be used).

It's stunning that the department      would evaluate teaching colleges based on the academic      performance of the students of their graduates when ESSA--     enacted by large bipartisan majorities in both the House and      Senate last December--prohibited the department from      requiring school districts to do that kind of teacher      evaluation.       ``Teacher prep programs need to help ensure that teachers      are ready to engage their students in powerful learning and      creating an environment that is conducive to learning. These      regulations will not help achieve that goal. These      regulations do not address ways to help the current status of      the teaching profession: the shortages, the lack of diversity      or the high turnover.       ``While the department has made minor tweaks, the flawed      framework remains the same. The regulations will punish      teacher prep programs whose graduates go on to teach in our      highest-needs schools, most often those with high      concentrations of students who live in poverty and English      language learners--the exact opposite strategy of what we      need. As we brought up in January 2015--in our comments to      the department's proposal--if programs are rated as the      department proposes, teacher prep schools will have incentive      to steer graduates away from assignments in our toughest      schools, and that will only make matters worse.       ``If we want to get it right, we should look to countries      like Finland, where prospective teachers receive extensive      training in their subject matter and teaching strategies      combined with clinical training.

Re Docket ID ED-2014-OPE-0057.     Arne Duncan,     Secretary, U.Department of Education,     Washington,       Dear Secretary Duncan: We would like to introduce      ourselves. Our names are Edward[[Page S1665]]     O'Connor, Provost, and Debra Ponec, Professor and Chair in      the Education Department at Creighton University, which is      located in Omaha, We are responding to the U.     Department of Education's proposed regulations for teacher      preparation programs released in the Notice of Proposed Rule      Making (NPRM) on December 3, 2014.       Like other teacher preparation programs in institutions of      higher education throughout the nation, the Education      Department at Creighton University embraces accountability      for our work. The faculty are eager to learn more about the      effectiveness of our graduates and seek continual program      improvement to ensure their profession-readiness in the      classroom. Our preparation programs currently employ      accountability mechanisms such as these:       National and state accreditation       Praxis II testing       Survey data from graduates and employers       Feedback from PK-12 school partners and Advisory Boards       Continuous Review of Programs       The institution's teacher preparation programs also undergo      continual reform influenced by the effective practice,      feedback from our K-12 partners, local and national workforce      demands, new requirements from our legislature and state, new      professional standards for preparation, and funding to      support new initiatives. The Education Department at      Creighton University has developed partnerships with public      and private schools where instruction and clinical practice      are on-site; integrated ``best practices'' into evidence-     based teacher preparation; placed students in high need,      diverse settings for clinical practice throughout the      program; and provided data on the impact of our programs on      our website. Our programs have a documented high placement      and retention rate for our graduates. Our teacher preparation      program actively supports accountability mechanisms that are      fair, transparent, valid, reliable, feasible, and useful for      program improvement. The proposed regulations initiated by      the Department of Education do not meet these criteria.       Overall, if these proposed regulations were adopted, they      would draw energy, funding, and attention away from      innovative reforms, proven accountability initiatives, and      overall program improvement currently under way in teacher      preparation programs across the country. Some of the specific      areas of concern are as follows:       The specific requirements outlined in the proposal usurp      the rights of the state and higher education institutions to      determine what indicators identify proficiency of teacher      education graduates and their preparation programs. This      unfunded mandate represents a significant financial burden to      institutions, local school systems, and states. The costs of      implementing these regulations have been woefully      underestimated with the understanding that no federal funding      would be available to move the proposed regulations forward.      The proposed regulations require data systems to track and      report on teacher education candidate effectiveness for      multiple years. Many states do not possess the technology      capacity to develop highly sophisticated data collection      systems which will collect, analyze, report, and utilize this      data in a meaningful manner.       The proposed regulations have generally not been tested for      validity and reliability, and attaching high-stakes      consequences at this point is of significant concern. For      example, using PK-12 student academic achievement and growth      to evaluate teacher performance is questioned by leading      research organizations and education scholars as having      questionable validity and reliability for making teacher      effectiveness decisions. Utilizing this approach of      evaluating teacher performance to his/her teacher preparation      institution is an even weaker link given the largely unknown      impacts such as implications of time and place of employment      and teacher preparation influence. The lack of a      scientifically acceptable basis for using student achievement      as a rating for program performance, even if the cost and      burden were low, makes this indicator unreasonable. In      addition, evidence that ACT/SAT/GPA scores are a reliable      indicator of teacher effectiveness is equally questionable.      Capstone assessments, which are being implemented in very      limited ways are still inconclusive in their outcomes as      measuring teacher quality.       As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant      financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and      states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500      individual teacher preparation `programs' subject to the      complexities of these regulations. Even as a system is      developed issues regarding privacy, low numbers, and student      demographics would impact results unfairly and result in      decisions unlikely to improve teacher preparation programs      and student learning at PK-12 schools.       The regulations focus on placement, retention, and      performance with PK-12 students has significant potential to      become a disincentive to encourage candidates to seek      placements in areas of high-need. This ideal conflicts with      our mission statement and preparation which seeks to lead      students to work with the underrepresented, disenfranchised,      and poor. Our teacher preparation candidates are well-     prepared, however, the potential of a teacher preparation      program being rated on test scores of high-needs students      will cause any institution pause. With lack of control of the      experience of the teachers once employed and no assurance of      resources to provide the supports for candidates in high-need      schools, it is unreasonable to compare these candidates with      candidates in non high-need situations.       The proposed timeline is unreasonable and unrealistic.      Those states piloting connecting teacher effectiveness to      student achievement are still under development and are      experiencing many ethical and legal challenges as they seek      to implement the requirements. Attaching outcomes to national      accreditation is also problematic in that the new CAEP      accreditation standards are not fully implemented and      accreditation processes using the new standards will not      officially be required until the Fall of 2016. The timeline      presented in the proposed regulations would include piloting      additional reporting requirements for the 2016-17 academic      year which is unrealistic to meet significantly increased      reporting elements, creation of new data systems, delivery of      in-service and technical assistance systems for institutions      and schools, and lack of new resources with which to      accomplish the unfunded mandates.       The proposed regulations do not consider or support the      philosophy that quality education requires a systemic      approach. Factors such as student demographics, preschool      learning opportunities, poverty and other social factors are      not controlled by PK-12 schools or teacher preparation      experiences. Other quality indicators such as equitable      funding, strong curriculum standards, focus on providing      opportunity--access--success for all students, and quality      assessment which all contribute to PK-12 student learning are      not controlled by teacher preparation programs. Therefore      equating PK-12 student performance to the quality of a      teacher preparation program is unfair and unreasonable.      However, dedication to strong commitments and collaborative      partnerships by educator preparation programs and school      systems impact the development of exemplary educators for the      future.

6337,topic-id,605,"Mr.President, more than 50 years ago, when Medicaid was[[Page S457]]created, Congress made a smart decision. Lawmakers designed a program so that if health care costs rise, if the economy starts to struggle, Medicaid would be there for the American people, no matter what.  A couple of days ago, the counselor to the President said that, as part of the replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid will be converted to block grants. Let's be clear about what this means.  People like grants, and they like Maybe they are not sure about whether they like block grants. Whether intentional or not, this kind of technocratic, bureaucratic language can trick people. It sounds fine. Maybe it is even the smart thing to do.  Let me be totally explicit about what block granting Medicaid actually means. It means cutting It means less money for It means less health care for people. It is a euphemism. It is not quite a lie, but it is a way of describing something so that you don't know exactly what it is. They are calling it a block grant because they don't want to say that they are cutting  These cuts are going to hurt millions of people. They will hurt working families who rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care for their families. We have to be pretty out of touch to not know anyone who at some point in their life will rely on nursing home subsidies from It is happening in my extended family right now.  It is important to remember that Medicaid certainly helps children. Medicaid certainly helps people who are economically disadvantaged. It helps poor people. But it also helps middle-class families, because at the end of a family member's life, who can pay for nursing home care out-of-pocket? You may have saved all of your life, but, for instance, in Hawaii a nursing home costs around $10,000 a month. So it is a rare family who can pay $10,000 a month for a grandmother or a great-grandmother or a father or a mother. Nobody can do that. This is going to harm middle-class families.  It is also going to hurt women in particular. Women need Medicaid for maternal health services and for family planning. These cuts are going to hurt seniors and people with disabilities. These people have nowhere else to turn. That is the point of Medicaid is their only option.  Now, I have heard some people say: Well, this is going to expand local control. That is preposterous. The truth is that block granting Medicaid, which is the same thing as cutting Medicaid and giving a fixed amount to the States, gives States less control, not more control. They force States to choose between seniors and kids, between people with disabilities and women, or between health care and education.  Look, it does not matter whom you voted for. American voters--left, right, and center--have this sense that what we do in Washington is that we run for office saying one thing and then we get in office and we do exactly the opposite. Frankly, the Congress has earned that reputation. This is another instance where a party has promised to not cut Medicaid, but here we are--week 1, day 5--debating cuts on this important program.  This is a deal breaker for me and many of my colleagues, and it will be a disaster for millions of  I call on everyone on both sides of the aisle to stand up for seniors, to stand up for women, to stand up for children, and to fight any cuts to  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgS456-7.txt,2173,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6307,topic-id,488,"Mr.President, I would like to discuss five topics this afternoon: the President's remarks this weekend and the lack of Republican reaction to them, his Executive order on Friday about mortgage rates, the continuing nominations process here, the President's withdrawal from TPP, and the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act that was announced this morning.  First, the need for Republicans to speak out when President Trump engages in the kind of rhetoric he engaged in this weekend. The first few days of the new administration are traditionally a time for an incoming President to call for unity and to try and bring the country together. Instead, President Trump kicked off a bizarre first weekend in office that alternated between braggadocio and furor. The President quarreled over the size of inaugural crowds, bragged about his election victory in a speech at CIA headquarters, with a wall commemorating fallen American intelligence officers behind him, and then sent his Press Secretary out to hold an emergency briefing to present ``alternative facts,'' as one of President Trump's advisers described them yesterday, about the size of the crowds again.  Whatever your politics, in order to debate, argue, compromise, and get things done for the American people, we have to be able to agree on a base line of facts. Facts aren't partisan. They don't have alternatives. The alternative to fact is fiction. If this Presidency is going to be based on ignoring the facts on the ground, we are going to have huge problems. It is not that important when you are talking about the number of people who attended an inauguration, but what about the facts if Russia is doing something that is very bad or something terrible is happening to our economy or something else? If the Presidency looks away from the real facts, we have trouble. You cannot govern a country like that.  So if the White House is ignoring the facts on the ground and is willing to make up ``alternative facts'' about crowd size, what else are they willing to stretch the truth about? National security? What Vladimir Putin is up to? The implications are terrifying.  A White House that presents alternative facts needs to be called out for doing so by both parties. The folks who can really help rein in the President are the members of his own party who have a special responsibility to do so, but they have been silent, totally silent when President Trump has been saying and doing things they know are wrong. They should be speaking out for the good of the country.  I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to help us hold the President and his White House accountable for the truth; otherwise this country is going to have a lot of trouble. Whether you are a Democrat, Republican, liberal or conservative, you cannot ignore the facts and govern and move the country forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-23-pt1-PgS368-3.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

6055,topic-id,506,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for creating this opportunity for us to celebrate 100 years of women serving in  It is remarkable that we are still trying to see our numbers inch upwards and continue to be at something like 19 percent when women represent over 50 percent of the voting population.  I thought it would be interesting to highlight one of these women in Congress, a great woman, and one that I have long admired. Her name is Helen Gahagan She was the first California woman elected to Congress in her own right--in that case, not succeeding a deceased husband.  Helen Gahagan was an actress and an opera singer who did not consider herself political until a chance conversation she had over coffee while performing in Vienna, Austria, in 1938. The man was a Nazi sympathizer, and the things she heard truly sickened her.  She returned to the United States intent on destroying She and her husband, Oscar-winning actor Melvyn Douglas, joined the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and called for a boycott of products made in Nazi  The release of John Steinbeck's seminal novel, ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' consumed her. She began studying the plight of migrant farmworkers coming to California from the Dust Bowl  After meeting the author, Helen was named president of the John Steinbeck Committee and became the national spokesperson for the rights of migrants.  That work attracted the attention of President and First Lady Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, and Eleanor became a mentor to  Helen Gahagan Douglas won the open congressional seat in California's 14th District in 1944. She was in the Hollywood area, and that was her district.  She served three terms in Congress, earning a reputation as a deep thinker, voice for the downtrodden, and skilled orator.  In 1950, she ran for the United States Senate, facing fellow southern California Congressman Richard  In the campaign, Nixon conflated her anti-Nazi views and work for migrant workers with being a communist fellow traveler.  He also employed anti-Semitic surrogates who attacked her for marrying a Jewish man.  These and other low-campaign tactics spurred Douglas to call Nixon ``Tricky Dicky,'' a moniker that stuck with him his entire career.  During the Watergate scandal, more than two decades after the 1950 Senate race, a popular bumper sticker in California read, ``Don't blame me, I voted for Helen Gahagan Douglas.''  After her death in 1980, California State Senator Alan Cranston delivered a stirring eulogy on the Senate floor. He said: ``I believe Helen Gahagan Douglas was one of the grandest, most eloquent, and deepest-thinking people we have had in American politics. She stands among the best of our 20th century leaders, rivaling even Eleanor Roosevelt in stature, compassion, and simple greatness.''  But it is Congresswoman Gahagan Douglas' own words that speak best for her legacy. As we celebrate 100 years of women in Congress, I can think of few quotes more fitting than Helen's: ``I knew men never would share power with women willingly.

6025,topic-id,660,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act of 2017.  This bill requires VA to keep a permanent copy of an admonishment or reprimand in a VA employee's personnel file. Currently, an informal admonishment remains on a VA employee's record for 2 years, while a more serious written reprimand stays in the file for more than 3 years.  Maintaining a comprehensive record of VA employees' personnel files will allow VA managers to track their employees' improvement, or lack thereof, related to the specific problem addressed in the original complaint. This approach will increase transparency, allow VA managers to address problematic performance, and give VA employees a chance to improve.  Although I support this bill, I want to address concerns raised by the American Federation of Government Employees and include this letter in the Congressional         American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                                  January 3, 2017.     Re H.27, Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation      of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents nearly      700,000 federal employees, including 230,000 non-management      employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), I      strongly urge you to oppose H.27, the Ensuring VA      Employees Accountability The bill is scheduled for floor      consideration this week under suspension of the rules.       This bill would deprive every VA employee, including non-     managerial employees, of the chance to clear his or her name      after receiving an unjustified reprimand from a manager who      is acting out of incompetence, bias, anti-veteran animus or      whistleblower retaliation.       H.27 would not increase accountability for VA      mismanagement. However, it would deprive the 115,000 veterans      in the VA workforce of the record expungement rights they had      as military personnel. It would also deprive veterans in the      VA workforce, and all VA employees, of second chances after      they receive reprimands or admonishments early in their      careers. If this bill is enacted, VA employees will no longer      have any rights to expunge their personnel files even if the      reprimands or admonishments were placed in their files      decades ago.       In addition, this bill would have an adverse impact on      agency operations and the VA's ability to recruit and retain      a strong workforce. It would divert precious VA resources      away from caring for veterans through an increase in wasteful      litigation because the bill eliminates the use of an      extremely efficient tool for settling personnel matters      through Clear Record Settlement Agreements (CRAs).       CRAs give VA managers the flexibility to resolve routine      personnel disputes efficiently and quickly without protracted      litigation or destruction of the VA careers of front line      employees, including large numbers of service-connected      disabled veterans who provide medical care, clean operating      rooms, process benefit claims, police VA facilities, and set      cemetery headstones. The Merit Systems Protection Board      (MSPB) stated in its 2013 report, Clear Record Settlement      Agreements and the Law, that 95% of agency representatives      resolved disputes using negotiated settlement agreements      (NSAs) and 89% of these agreements involved       Congress has received a great deal of testimony in recent      years from brave whistleblowers and their labor      representatives regarding the widespread management abuse of      reprimands to punish employees and destroy their VA careers.      Similarly, Congress has provided steadfast support to active      duty personnel making the often-difficult transition to      civilian employment, including VA support in the form of      vocational rehabilitation, compensated work therapy, PTSD      treatment, and programs to address homelessness and substance      abuse.       H.27 is at best ambiguous about the fate of veterans who      leave VA employment for deployment and then seek to return to      the VA workforce. Would reprimands that were placed in their      personnel files prior to deployment still be visible to all      potential VA employers reviewing the returning veteran's      application?       In closing, AFGE urges lawmakers to reject this      counterproductive assault on VA front line employees who are,      too often, unfairly reprimanded by hostile, unsupportive and      incompetent managers and human resources personnel.[[Page H31]]       Thank you for considering our views on this bill.

6026,topic-id,252,"Mr.Speaker, I share these concerns and intend to work with my colleagues across the aisle and in the Senate to ensure that if this bill passes into law, the change will not adversely impact whistleblowers, the thousands of veterans employed by the VA, and the VA employees who work hard every day to support the needs of our Nation's veterans.  Whistleblowers and employees who face unlawful retaliation from managers should have the opportunity to clear their names before any proposed admonishments or reprimands are made permanent in their records. I also want to clarify that this bill should not be used to eliminate the VA's ability to enter into clear record settlement agreements with employees or get in the way of resolving personnel matters in an efficient manner.  In our efforts to enhance personnel policies at the VA, it is important that we remember that one-third of VA employees are veterans themselves, and many more have immediate family members who are veterans. Many of these employees are also hardworking doctors and nurses who want to provide quality care for their patients. These Federal civil servants want to do a good job in order to provide veterans the best possible service, and this bill should not be used by managers to intimidate or retaliate against these employees.  This bill simply requires VA to maintain a complete record of a VA employee's personnel file, a practice intended to increase transparency and ultimately improve outcomes for veterans.

Mr.Speaker, Irise today in support of the Taxpayers Right-To-Know  This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to provide moreinformation about Federal programs and their activities online. The American people deserve to know what their government doeswith their hard-earned dollars. The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act will make it easier to evaluate Federal Government spending byrequiring Federal agencies to identify their programs, provide basic information like what their programs do, how they perform,and how much they cost. Agencies must do a better job of managing their programs and identifying areas where taxpayer dollarsare wasted.  The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reporting on duplication and continues to find new areas ofduplication across the government. In 6 years, GAO has identified 250 areas and 637 corrective actions in those areas to reducefragmentation, overlap, or duplication or address other opportunities for financial benefits. While only 41 percent ofrecommended corrective actions have been taken, GAO estimates this progress will result in approximately $125 billion infinancial benefits and savings over 15 years.  While GAO's work has been invaluable, their ability to look comprehensively atthe Federal Government is inherently limited because of the poor reporting by agencies about their activity. Quite simply, Mr.Speaker, without better data, billions more will be lost.  Current law, specifically the Government Performance and ResultsModernization Act, requires agencies to report all their programs, their funding, and their performance information to theOffice of Management and However, OMB's current inventory is incomplete and provides inconsistent information. Thismakes it more difficult and time consuming to identify areas of waste and inefficiency.

I am going to continue this in the new Congress, continuing to present the latest and most compelling scientific evidence of the changes that are coming our way driven by carbon pollution.  Nobody should take my word for it. I urge my colleagues to listen to their own home State's climatologists, their own home State's university researchers, their own home State's public health officials, and their own constituents who are out there fighting to protect their communities from the changes that are already happening right before their eyes.  In Rhode Island, we have a lot of fishermen, just as Louisiana has, Mr.The president of the Rhode Island Commercial Fishermen's Association is Chris Just this past week, he was the subject of a New York Times article. ``Climate change is going to make it hard on some of those species that are not particularly fond of warm or warming waters,'' he told the ``We used to come right here''--where he was on his boat, The Proud Mary--``and catch two, three, four thousand pounds a day, sometimes 10.'' But the whiting, the fish he was after, have moved north to cooler waters.  The Times reports that two-thirds of marine species off the northeast coast have moved from their traditional ranges into deeper and cooler water.  John Manderson is a biologist at NOAA's northeast fisheries science center, and he told the Times in that article that public policy needs to keep pace with the rapidly changing oceans, where species are shifting northward in response to warming 10 times as quickly as they do on the land. ``Our ideas of property rights and laws are purely land-based,'' he said, ``but the ocean is all about flux and turbulence and movement.''  In Rhode Island, fishermen are getting clobbered by that flux.  Captain Dave Monti is a member of the Rhode Island Marine Fisheries He wrote in the Providence Journal this week:       I often think about the fish and how important it is to      grow them to abundance so there are more fish for all to      catch and eat. . . . In 2017 we need a fish-first agenda, or      someday there may be no fish left to catch. Climate change,      acidification, overfishing by world nations, and changing      federal strategies could make it the worst of times for fish      in 2017. . . . We need to make an effort to understand what      is happening to the environment and the fish, and then take      that second step of communicating it to others to affect      policy.  That is what I am being asked.  The Providence Journal also recently wrote about how in Rhode Island the sea is moving higher and farther inland, as it is in Louisiana, which is the State losing ground fastest to the ocean of all the 50. They reported on StormTools, a program developed by Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council director Grover Fugate and University of Rhode Island emeritus professor of ocean engineering Malcolm StormTools provides 3D maps of the potential flooding damage along Rhode Island's coast. The Journal described the project as ``one of the most sophisticated models developed anywhere to project future damage from storm surges and sea level rise.'' And we are taking the results seriously.  The Journal quoted William DePasquale, who is the director of planning in one of our cities, Warwick, He said, ``When I saw some of those scenarios, my jaw hit the ground.'' That is what we are looking at, and Warwick is now using those maps to prepare for the future.  The Providence Journal has also recently written about Matunuck Beach in South Town manager Stephen Alfred warns that if the sea takes out Matunuck Beach Road, 240 homes will be totally cut off, without a water supply or access to emergency services.  The article features Kevin Finnegan, who owns the Ocean Mist, a renowned local establishment. The Journal said:       The Ocean Mist has occupied the same spot under different      names since Prohibition ended in 1933. But the ocean has      moved. Where once beach bathers had to plan a trek across      sand to reach the water from the Mist, waves now flood the      supports holding up the tavern's deck.  Finnegan and the town of North Kingstown are scrambling to build seawalls. Engineer Bill Ladd, who works for Finnegan and who the Providence Journal reports had his first beer at the Ocean Mist back when the drinking age was 18, estimates that the two walls may only buy Matunuck Beach 20 or 30 more years against the oncoming ocean. That is because, as The Independent--a local newspaper in the southern part of Rhode Island--reported in December, about 4 feet of Matunuck Beach is eroding every year. According to Director Fugate of the CRMC, that erosion will more than double by the end of the century. Rhode Island is not a big We cannot afford to have this much reclaimed by the ocean.  The Independent article quotes North Kingstown Town Council president Kerry McKay, who says that climate change threatens the property values of his community's coastal homes, which is a significant portion of the town's revenue base.       He said historical values ``will have to change'' as      coastal concerns rise, and residents ``have to be more      receptive'' to redoing building infrastructure, such as      through elevating houses.  He also said that homes ``may not be there'' in 20 years, resulting in a ``major revenue loss.''  Another Providence Journal article last week featured Tanner Steeves, a[[Page S98]]wildlife biologist with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, which has to tear up roads and parking lots along the Sakonnet River as the seas rise. The Journal writes:       As the barrier beach just south of Sapowet Point has      narrowed--losing nearly 100 feet since 1939--the salt marsh      on the other side has become more susceptible to flooding.  The Independent made Rhode Island's case for climate action in a December editorial. They said:       The signs are clear, if not immediately visible to most.       There are the well-documented, widely publicized shifts      with global import, such as the loss of polar ice and the      growing frequency of extreme weather events. Locally, there      are changes in the ecology of Narragansett Bay, and locations      at which the effects of a rising sea level--sometimes subtle,      sometimes less so--may be plainly seen. . . . But we      encourage all Rhode Islanders, from coastal communities and      beyond, to remain attuned to the situation--in terms of both      what the sea is telling us and what is being proposed to      prepare for coming changes. The stakes are enormously high,      and the broadest possible effort is required to meet the      challenge.  That is the message to me from Rhode That is why I give these speeches.  As I continue to push for honest debate on this issue in Congress, I also tour around the country to see folks on the ground in other I have now been to 15 In the closing months of 2016, I hit Texas and  In Texas, I joined Representative Elliott Naishtat, the advocacy group Public Citizen Texas, and Texas environmental advocates at a public event in Austin to call out Congressman Lamar Smith, Republican chairman of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, for his abuse of congressional power to harass public officials and climate scientists, including subpoenas demanding that States attorneys general divulge their investigative materials relating to their inquiries into ExxonMobil's potentially fraudulent climate misinformation. The committee is also harassing the Union of Concerned Scientists, 350.org, Greenpeace, and various university scientists because they are exposing Exxon for years of misleading the public on its understanding of climate change. Texans are taking notice. The San Antonio Express-News, which had previously always endorsed Congressman Smith for reelection, decided not to endorse him in this latest election cycle. The paper cited his ``bullying on the issue of climate change'' as behavior that ``should concern all Americans.''  I joined a panel discussion with leading scientists from Texas universities to discuss their research into climate change in The panel included John Anderson from Rice University, Andrew Dessler from Texas A&M University, Charles Jackson and Kerry Cook from the University of Texas at Austin, and Katherine Hayhoe from Texas Tech They had a unified voice on the dangers of climate change.  Hayhoe said Texans are seeing changes all around them.       We get hit by drought. We get hit by heat. We get hit by      storms. We get hit by sea level rise. And we're starting to      see those impacts today. . . . Texas is really at the      forefront of this problem.  Anderson of Rice agreed that the Texas climate is already changing. He said:       Accelerated sea-level rise is real, not a prediction. Its      causes are known--thermal expansion of the oceans and melting      of glaciers and ice sheets--and it is causing unprecedented      change along the Texas coast.  Dessler from Texas A&M laid out what he called ``the fundamental and rock-solid aspects of climate science: humans are loading the atmosphere with carbon, this is warming the climate, and this future warming is a huge risk to our society and the environment. We should insist that our elected representatives rely on this sound science when formulating policy.''  I returned to Austin in November to speak to the Association of Public and Land-grant President David Dooley of the University of Rhode Island had invited me to join a panel that he moderated with, among others, John Nielsen-Gammon, Texas State climatologist and professor at Texas A&M  The bottom line was simple: Climate change is real, and the scientists at our universities will be increasingly forced to defend good science, academic freedom, and climate action. University leadership will have to defend their scientists against the onslaught of FOIA requests and personal attacks that are the modus operandi for climate deniers and against the phony science fronts propped up by the fossil fuel industry to spread calculated misinformation. The American scientific community faces a real threat from that operation.  On to Pennsylvania, I had the opportunity to spend a day traveling with my friend and colleague Bob Casey around southeastern Pennsylvania getting a firsthand look at the effects of climate change and hearing about the work Pennsylvanians are doing to address it. At the University of Pennsylvania's Morris Arboretum, leaders from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Community Asthma Prevention Program, Moms Clean Air Force, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and other groups talked about kids with asthma and other conditions that worsen when temperatures and pollution levels are high.  In Malvern, we toured the LEED platinum North American headquarters of Saint-Gobain, the world's largest building materials company. The company is demonstrating that green building materials and technologies can be married with stylish design to produce stunning results. With operations in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and around the globe, Saint-Gobain is developing innovative technologies to reduce pollution, generate clean energy, and improve air quality for millions of people.  From there, we visited the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge, which is the Nation's first urban wildlife refuge and Pennsylvania's largest freshwater tidal wetland. Lamar Gore, the refuge manager, showed us how the refuge is at risk from the saltwater pushed in by rising sea levels. The refuge is adjacent to the Philadelphia International Airport, along the Delaware  As you can see from these graphics reproduced from the New York Times, at 5 feet of sea level rise, some of the city goes underwater and the refuge is in real trouble. Water encroaches upon the Philadelphia airport. At 12 feet of sea level rise, 6 percent of the city--including the refuge, airport, and parts of downtown Philly--is underwater. Projections that parts of Philadelphia will one day be uninhabitable due to sea level rise are one of the major drivers for forward-looking climate mitigation and adaptation policies of Philadelphia's Office of Senator Casey and I met with them too.  Being in Pennsylvania gave me a chance to connect with Robert Brulle of Drexel He is the scholar who documented the intricate propaganda web of fossil fuel industry-funded climate denial, connecting over 100 organizations, from trade associations, to conservative think tanks, to plain old phony front groups. The purpose of this climate denial apparatus is, to quote Brulle, ``a deliberate and organized effort to misdirect the public discussion and distort the public's understanding of climate.''  I will wrap up with a special thank-you to one of the folks who helped organize my Texas trip: Tom Smith, who has been director of Public Citizen of Texas for more than 30 years. Known by his friends and colleagues as Smitty and known for his signature straw hat, over his career he has testified more than 1,000 times before the Texas Legislature and Congress--Mr.Uphill Struggle indeed. He was successful, though, and central in creating the Texas Emissions Reduction Program, which led to wide-scale deployment of solar and wind across A true environmental champion, Smitty retires this year.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent tribute from the Texas Tribune entitled: ``Analysis: `Smitty,' a Texas Lobbyist for the Small Fry, Retiring after 31 years.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Texas Tribune, 21, 2016]  Analysis: ``Smitty,'' a Texas Lobbyist for the Small Fry, Retiring                              After 31 Years                            (By Ross Ramsey)       Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, a colorful lobbyist and liberal      activist who turned Public Citizen Texas into a strong voice      on environmental, utility, consumer and ethics issues, is      hanging up his spurs after 31 years.[[Page S99]]       In the early 90s--the heyday of consumer rights legislation      and regulation in Texas--Robert Cullick, then a reporter at      the Houston Chronicle, gave Tom ``Smitty'' Smith of Public      Citizen Texas an unofficial title: Everybody's Third            Smith, 66, announced his retirement Tuesday from his      official post after 31 years, ending a long run of organizing      and lobbying on behalf of consumers and citizens on a range      of issues like utilities, insurance and political ethics. He      was often the voice of the opposition in legislative fights      and in the media, which earned him that reporter's epithet.       He's from that part of the Austin lobby that doesn't wear      fancy suits, doesn't drive the latest luxury cars and doesn't      spend its time fawning over and feeding elected officials.      Smitty has a beard, an omnipresent straw hat and, often, a      colorful sheaf of flyers making his points on whatever cause      he's pushing at the time.       Smitty has been a leading voice for government intervention      and regulation of big industries and interests in the capital      of a state with conservative, business-friendly politicians      from both parties who pride themselves on light regulation,      low taxes and a Wild West approach to money in politics.       For the most part, Smith seems to have disagreed strongly,      vociferously, but agreeably. He doesn't wear his wins or his      losses on his sleeve.       ``The thing that I learned time after time, story after      story, is that people standing up does make a difference,''      Smith says. ``It does change policy.''       ``Citizen activism does matter, and it's the only known      antidote to organized political corruption and political      money,'' he says.       His causes over the years have included food security,      decommissioning costs of the nuclear reactors owned by      various Texas utilities, insurance regulations, ethics and      campaign finance laws. He's lobbied on environmental issues      and product safety.       He counts the ethics reforms of 1991 as one of his big      wins. As unregulated as Texas political ethics and campaign      finance might seem today, things were a lot looser before      reformers used a flurry of scandals and attendant media      coverage to force changes. Smith is proud of a medical bill      of rights that gave consumers some leverage with their      doctors and their health insurers.       Public Citizen was a key player in the creation of the      State Office of Administrative Hearings, which took      administrative courts out of several regulatory agencies and      put them in a central office, farther from the reach of      regulated industries and elected officials. Smith now points      to the Texas Railroad Commission, which still has its own      administrative hearings, as an example of a too-close      relationship between regulators, the companies they regulate      and the judges supposed to referee their differences.       He was an early and noisy advocate for renewable energy,      urging regulators and lawmakers to promote wind and solar      generation--and transmission lines to carry their power--as      an alternative to coal plants and other generating sources.      That looks easier from a 2016 vantage point than it did in      1989, when an appointed utilities regulator derided      alternative energy in an open meeting by saying that he      hadn't smoked enough dope to move the state in that      direction.       That regulator is gone now, and Texas leads the nation in      wind energy. Chalk one up for the environmental advocates.       Smitty is leaving with unfulfilled wishes. He'd like to      have made more progress on Texas emissions and climate      change, on campaign finance reforms and conflict-of-interest      laws.       The ethics reforms of 1991 included creation of the Texas      Ethics Commission and a number of significant regulations on      the behavior of the Texans contending for and holding state      office. There is always more, of course. Smith had a list of      13 reforms that year, and eight made it into law. Some of the      remaining items remain undone 25 years later.       ``All the time I've been working here, Texas politics has      been largely controlled by organized businesses pooling their      money together and making significant contributions to key      legislators,'' Smith says. ``Legislators are more concerned      about injuring their donors than they are about injuring      their constituents.''       He illustrates that with stories, like one about a      legislator asking, during a House debate, if his colleagues      knew the difference between a campaign contribution and a      bribe. ``You have to report the campaign contribution.'' And      another, when a member--former state Eddie Cavazos, D-     Corpus Christi, who went on to become a lobbyist--was making      a plea for cutting the influence of big donors. Cavazos      recalls telling a story about getting simultaneous calls from      a big donor and from someone who wasn't a political friend.      He says he told his colleagues, ``You know which one you're      going to answer first.''       ``I'm sorry to see Smitty go,'' Cavazos said ``He      provided a large voice in the Legislature that was needed--a      balancing voice. He's a good guy.''  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1823,ABIE ABRAHAM VA CLINIC,2017.0,5.0,February

6270,topic-id,1745,"Madam President, I want to begin my remarks this morning by taking stock of how the 115th Congress, led by my Republican colleagues, seems to be coming out of the gate. Here is what is coming if the budget process that began this week plays out: 30 million Americans from Portland, OR, to Portland, ME, will be in danger of being kicked off their health care plans; sharply rising health care costs for everybody else, even those who get their insurance through their employer; broken campaign promises about a replacement coming on day one. With this resolution, Republicans in the Congress are building a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the most fortunate in  I want to discuss each of those issues this morning, but first let us recognize the bottom line. What is at stake in this debate is whether or not America is going to go back to the dark days when health care was reserved for the healthy and wealthy. For nearly 7 years and through 4 punishing campaigns, Americans have heard and felt the steady, partisan drumbeat of repeal and replace from the other side. Dozens and dozens of show votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been held in either There have been countless press conferences, speeches, and hearings, even a government shutdown, and the message is always the same. The President-elect himself said that repeal and replace would happen--his words, not mine--simultaneously.  The replacement plan was coming. It would be fully written, ready to plug in--no gap, no harm relevant to anyone in our country. The same words, ``Coming Soon,'' have sat on that marquee for 7 years now. It seems to me it is time to admit that the show will not open. This is a broken promise, plain and simple. Americans are no longer looking at repeal and replace; now it is repeal and run. The consequences will be serious and immediate for tens of millions of Americans, both in access to health care and the bottom line for family budgets across the country. In short, it is a plan that will make America sick again. According to independent analysis, nearly 30 million Americans will lose their health insurance quickly after repeal. The first act of a new Congress: Kicking 30 million people off the insurance rolls--that is seven times the population of my home  The overwhelming majority of those 30 million Americans are not wealthy people. They are not in a position to be able to afford to go out and pick an expensive plan once the insurance companies get back in the driver's seat. Millions come from working families who will lose tax cuts for health insurance. Millions of others toil, often working multiple jobs, but still what they bring home is just barely enough to keep them out of poverty.  For many, signing up for Medicaid brought an end to the years when they had to choose between visiting a doctor and putting food on the table. If repeal goes forward, Americans all over the country are going to face that dilemma once again. I think it is important to remember that the danger of repeal does not end with Americans getting kicked off their insurance plans.  Repeal will send costs skyrocketing for everyone across the board, even those Americans who get their insurance through work, including a lot of folks who say the Affordable Care Act has not touched them at all. They are going to get a gut punch, a gut punch with higher premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs. When you kick tens of millions off the insurance rolls and send the markets into chaos, there is going to be a ripple effect. Everyone is going to feel those harmful effects, even those who have had the same plan from a particular employer for years or decades. Rising costs are going to eat into paychecks, crowding out the pay raises that our people need so desperately.  Colleagues, if you are watching this budget debate at home, I am sure you are going to say: Why in the world would any lawmaker go forward with this plan? I am going to go back to what I just said. In my view, this is a Trojan horse of tax cuts for the wealthy and the most fortunate.  When you look at both sides of the ledger, you see how exceptionally unfair this scheme actually is. On one[[Page S86]]side, tens of millions of Americans lose insurance and suffer economic pain. That is the typical family. On the other side, there are substantial tax breaks for those at the top of the income scale.  One of the questions I am asked nearly every day in these halls, and I am asked this by many in the press and elsewhere, is whether Democrats are going to take part in this effort and what ideas Democrats would put forward. I want to take just a minute to describe why that question is so off the mark. First, you have to look at the nature of the reconciliation process itself. Budget reconciliation is inherently a partisan exercise. Inherently, it is not a process that brings people together. It is a process that drives people apart. It is inherently partisan.  A typical proposal that comes to the Senate floor is subject to unlimited debate and unlimited amendments. Usually it takes 60 Senators, Members from both parties to come together and pass legislation. It is very rare that a party builds that kind of supermajority on its own, so the two sides have to work together. That is the Senate at its best.  I see my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator He and I have served on the Finance At its best, that is what the Finance Committee has always been about--trying to find common ground, working together to get a proposal that can get 60 votes.  Reconciliation throws those unique characteristics of bringing Senators together; basically, reconciliation just trashes it, throws it out the window. In my view, when you use reconciliation the way it is being used here, you are telling the other party you neither need nor want their votes. It puts a one-sided proposal on the fast track to passage, tight limits on debate and amendments, a bare majority of votes required to actually pass it.  I am very concerned that what is at issue now is a serious misuse of the reconciliation process. This is not a simplified procedure to address a budget issue; this is an effort to ram through repeal and run. Second, this is not your run-of-the-mill congressional debate where you have both sides bringing their best ideas forward to tackle a policy issue.  For years, my Democratic colleagues and I have said that we are ready to work on a bipartisan basis to solve this country's health care challenges. I think I have spent about as much time as anybody in the Senate working to try to find bipartisan solutions to the country's big health challenges. Back in 2008, 2009, we had a bipartisan proposal: seven Democrats, seven We had never had that before. I can tell you, we Democrats are ready to work on a bipartisan basis to solve the country's health care challenges.  For me, essentially what I have tried to make my top priority for public service--health care is one-sixth of the American economy. It has always been the issue that Americans care the most about because if you and your loved ones don't have health, nothing else much matters. So we ought to be working on a bipartisan basis to solve the country's health care challenges, finding ways to bring costs down for families, making prescription drugs more affordable, upholding the promise of Medicare, and strengthening its guaranteed benefits.  When I was director of the Gray Panthers at home, a senior citizens group, we always said that Medicare was a promise. It was a promise of guaranteed benefits. We ought to strengthen that promise, particularly updating it to incorporate changes in the program that reflect the needs of the Americans who face chronic health conditions, which is where the vast majority of Medicare dollars are going.  That is what we ought to be doing, upholding the promise of Medicare, working together in a bipartisan way. But that is not what is happening here. From the other side, what we have heard again and again is repeal and replace, dozens of partisan votes producing legislation that burned out in the Senate or met the veto pen.  Now, with a new administration, the Trump administration coming in, the Republicans kick off a procedural scheme that slashes taxes for the most fortunate, raises costs for typical Americans, and takes insurance coverage away from tens of millions of people. No Democrat is going to buy in to that proposition. The reason they won't is that the American people are not going to buy into that proposition.  This scheme is going to bring on a manufactured crisis that does harm to millions of Americans across the land, rocks our health care sector, our providers, our plans--all of those who make up this health care system. One side is pushing it, but the other side is saying: No, let's not create this catastrophe.  That is why, in my view, the questions about Democrats signing on to flawed, bad proposals miss the point. Everyone recognizes that the strict and immovable strategy adopted by the other side 8 years ago paid dividends in elections. But politics is different from governing. Politics is different from governing because there are serious life-and-death consequences to actions that deprive Americans of health insurance. Families are going to feel economic pain when premiums and deductibles jump.  I believe Americans are going to speak out. They are going to rally against an unfair, unbalanced bill that cuts taxes for the most fortunate, while putting insurance companies back again in the driver's seat. What is at stake here is pretty simple; it is whether or not America is going to turn back the clock and go back to those dark days when health care in our Nation was reserved for the healthy and the wealthy.  My colleagues and I say no way. We are going to fight that unfair, imbalanced approach in every way we can.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING Who yields time?  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.  ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS75-3.txt,1247,"CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET, FISCAL YEAR 2017",2017.0,5.0,January
