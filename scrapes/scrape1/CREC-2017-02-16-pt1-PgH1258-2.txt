              CONGRATULATING QUINCY NOTRE DAME HIGH SCHOOL

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Quincy Notre 
Dame High School on 150 years of academic excellence and service to the 
community of Quincy, Illinois.
  Quincy Notre Dame Catholic High School originally opened as a school 
serving young women. Mother Caroline and the school sisters of Notre 
Dame answered the call to meet the growing need for primary studies in 
1859. The school opened its doors in 1867 and quickly exploded in 
growth.
  Throughout the past 150 years, Quincy Notre Dame has always sought to 
serve the needs of the Quincy community and adapt to the changing 
times.
  QND remains steadfast in its mission to educate lifelong learners in 
a strong faith-based environment. I am certain that Mother Caroline and 
her Sisters would be humbled to know their simple act of faith and 
service resulted in a legacy that has impacted thousands of lives for 
150 years.
  To each educator, administrator, and individual who has helped build 
Quincy Notre Dame into the stellar institution it is today, 
congratulations. I wish you another successful 150 years.
