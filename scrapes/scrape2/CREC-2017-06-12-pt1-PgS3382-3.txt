                         SANCTIONS LEGISLATION

  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on Russia sanctions, soon we will move 
to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the Iran sanctions 
legislation. The two leaders, Chairmen Corker and Crapo, the two 
ranking members, Brown and Cardin, continue to negotiate a package of 
strong Russia sanctions that can be offered as an amendment to the 
bill. I am hopeful we can come to an agreement soon, one that at the 
very least includes legislation put forward by Senators Graham and 
Cardin that would establish a process for Congress to review any 
Russia-related sanctions relief. Senator McCain, along with Senator 
Cardin, has also submitted an amendment for tough, new sanctions, which 
I very much support. Democrats feel strongly that Russia sanctions 
should move alongside Iran sanctions, and we are prepared to do what we 
can to make sure we get a vote on a good amendment and hopefully a 
bipartisan one.
