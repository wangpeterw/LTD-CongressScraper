       CONGRATULATING BABCOCK & WILCOX ON THEIR 150TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of one of Charlotte's 
most exemplary businesses, Babcock & Wilcox, which today celebrates 
their 150th anniversary.
  Boilers made by Babcock & Wilcox powered Thomas Edison's laboratories 
and New York's first subway.
  During World War II, much of the U.S. Navy fleet was powered by 
Babcock & Wilcox boilers, and the company supplied components for the 
vital Manhattan Project. Later Babcock & Wilcox fabricated components 
for the USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine.
  More recently, Babcock & Wilcox has become a leading innovator in 
emissions control technologies, helping to protect our air, water, and 
land by controlling emissions from hundreds of power plants and 
industrial facilities around the world.
  In 2010, Babcock & Wilcox moved to Charlotte and became a vital part 
of the Charlotte region's growing cluster of industry-leading energy 
firms.
  Congratulations today to Babcock & Wilcox's 5,000 employees on this 
150th anniversary.
