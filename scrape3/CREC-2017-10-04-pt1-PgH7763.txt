                   HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN PUERTO RICO

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, right now, 3.5 million Americans, our 
fellow citizens, are facing a humanitarian crisis. In Puerto Rico, the 
majority of people still lack basic electricity, clean drinking water, 
and medicine, the bare basic necessities just to stay alive--not to 
speak of the basic resources they need to begin the great task of 
rebuilding their lives and their communities.
  It has been days since the hurricane passed over Puerto Rico leaving 
death and destruction in its wake. The people of Puerto Rico are 
literally crying out for help. There are far too many, especially those 
in rural communities, who still have not been reached by those bringing 
aid. As a Representative from an island State in Hawaii, I can only 
imagine their frustration and desperation.
  I urge the administration to dedicate all available resources to 
helping the people of Puerto Rico. Work with Congress to pass an 
emergency aid package to ensure that those delivering aid have what 
they need to help the people of Puerto Rico and save lives.
