                     IMMIGRANTS ARE THE CORNERSTONE

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my continued 
disappointment with President Trump's anti-immigrant stance, especially 
based on his joint session remarks last night.
  I admit I was very honored to attend my first joint session as a 
Member of Congress, but as a Member of Congress, as an American, and as 
a grandson of an Italian immigrant, I was disheartened that the 
President doubled down on his divisive and dangerous rhetoric against 
immigrants and continued to create fear by focusing on the worst in 
people.
  Before I came to Congress, I was a prosecutor. I understand and 
believe that those who commit serious and violent felonies should be 
prosecuted and deported. But I also grew up on the central coast of 
California, and I realize and appreciate how much immigrants contribute 
to our community.
  That is why I want to ask President Trump to come down from his gold 
tower, come out of the White House, and come to the green and fertile 
Salinas, San Juan, and Pajaro Valleys. He will see that immigrants are 
the reason why my district is called the salad bowl of the world. He 
will see that immigrants are the cornerstone, the foundation not only 
of that economy, not only of that community, but of our country.
