                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I was delayed with constituency matters 
in a hearing and was not able to be present on the floor on the vote on 
the motion to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair. If I had 
been present, I would have voted ``no.''
  I was also detained on congressional business in a hearing on the 
Lujan Grisham amendment to H.R. 2213. If I had been present, I would 
have voted ``aye.''
