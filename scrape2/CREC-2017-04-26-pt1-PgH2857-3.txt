       CONGRATULATING CONGRESSMAN STEVE STIVERS ON HIS PROMOTION

  (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my Ohio colleagues to 
congratulate Congressman Steve Stivers on his promotion from colonel to 
brigadier general of the Ohio Army National Guard.
  His promotion comes after more than 30 years in the National Guard. 
He is now one of the highest ranking National Guard members to also 
serve as a Member of Congress. Congressman Stivers served the United 
States overseas during Operation Iraqi Freedom in Kuwait, Iraq, and 
Djibouti where he was awarded the Bronze Star for leadership throughout 
the deployment.
  We are proud to have him leading the National Guard soldiers who 
protect us at home and abroad.
  Congressman Stivers, on behalf of the Ohio delegation and the 
citizens we represent, congratulations on this distinguished honor. Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to call Steve a colleague and Ohioan and a friend.
