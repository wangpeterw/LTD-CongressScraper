                        HIGHLIGHTING HALL GROWS

  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the 
success of my friends and neighbors at the Hall County Chapter of the 
Georgia Farm Bureau. This past year, the Farm Bureau launched Hall 
GROWS, an educational initiative designed to help students expand their 
knowledge of agriculture.
  In my home State of Georgia, agriculture is the largest industry, 
contributing $74 billion to the State's GDP. Our young people represent 
the next generation of farmers, agricultural experts, and consumers. It 
is our duty to ensure that these young students possess an 
understanding of the strategic advantage that agriculture represents 
for the United States.
  The Farm Bureau is donating time, funding, and other resources so 
that schools can cultivate gardens, hold workshops for educators, and 
have classroom activities to help students. Because of efforts like 
these, Hall GROWS can continue to make an impact both in the lives of 
students and on the future of the industry.
  The Farm Bureau's willingness to support students attests to the 
generosity of the American farmer. I am excited to see this program 
make a positive difference in communities like my own in Hall County in 
Gainesville, Georgia.
  Again, congratulations to the Hall County Farm Bureau for their work 
and effort and Hall GROWS.
