         HAITIAN WOMEN OF MIAMI 7TH ANNUAL COMMEMORATIVE EVENT

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today marks the seventh anniversary of 
the earthquake in Haiti which struck near its capital,Port-au-Prince, 
leaving behind in its wake total devastation and tens of thousands 
dead.
  Haitians have been resilient in their efforts to come back from this 
massive disaster, and the United States will remaincommitted to helping 
Haiti get back on its feet.
  I have had the privilege of visiting Haiti many times during my time 
in Congress, and, most recently in October, I had theopportunity to 
travel to Haiti with my dear Florida colleague Frederica Wilson weeks 
after yet another terrible disaster, ahurricane, hit Haiti.
  I would like to commend local organizations in south Florida led by 
the Haitian Women of Miami, FANM, for holding a silentmarch this 
afternoon, beginning at 4 p.m., from 62nd Street and North Miami Avenue 
to the Little Haiti Cultural Center.
  Mr. Speaker, let's continue to help Haiti and the Haitian people.
