                     THANKING FORMERPRESIDENT OBAMA

  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to offer my words of gratitude to 
President Obamaas his service to our Nation comes to a close. I want to 
commend him for his 8 years of dedicated public service. From the 
firsttime we met in 2005, I was struck by his integrity, his intellect 
and his decency. His achievements as President are toonumerous to list, 
but 3 are significant. Over 15 million jobs created since the end of 
the great recession, 20 million moreAmericans with health care, and a 
$1 trillion reduction in the deficit.
  President Obama was a strong fighter for the middleclass and the 
vulnerable. Our Nation and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are in a 
stronger position today than when PresidentObama took the oath of 
office in January 2009. As a nation, we have made progress, but we 
still face substantial challenges inorder to grow incomes, provide a 
quality education for more children, and keep our nation safe. We will 
miss President Obama'sprincipled leadership and enduring commitment to 
strengthening America.
  Mr. President, I ask unaimous consent that a CNNarticle about 
President Obama be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to beprinted in 
the Record, as follows:

            Obama's Gift to Trump: A `Pretty Solid' Economy

                            (byHeather Long)

       President Obama is giving President-elect Trump a welcome 
     gift: A pretty good economy.
       Unemployment is atits lowest level since 2007.
       Home prices are back at all-time highs.
       Growth is picking up. The economy expanded at a 3.2%annual 
     rate from July through September.
       Even the middle class is (finally) getting a raise in pay.
       ``President Trumpreally is inheriting an economy that's 
     pretty solid,'' said Kevin Hassett, an economist at the 
     conservative American EnterpriseInstitute, on CNBC Friday.
       The ``Obama economy'' deserves a ``B or B+'' grade, says 
     Paul Ashworth, chief economist at CapitalEconomics.


                       grading the obama economy

       That's not an A, but theeconomy is certainly better off 
     than it was when Obama walked into the Oval Office in 2009. 
     Back then, the country was in themidst of a deep financial 
     crisis and recession. The very month Obama took office, 
     nearly 800,000 Americans lost theirjobs.
       Obama believes he hasn't received enough credit for the big 
     turnaround. ``Anyone claiming that America's economy is 
     indecline is peddling fiction,'' Obama said earlier this 
     year.
       Unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to just 4.6% 
     now.America has gained over 11 million new jobs since Obama 
     took office.


              trump points to thoseleft behind in recovery

       Trump has repeatedly called the unemployment rate ``a 
     joke'' and ``a hoax.''It's unclear whether he will change 
     that message when he takes office. Then he would be able to 
     take credit for keepingunemployment down--or even causing it 
     to go lower.
       For now, Trump continues to hammer the Obama economy as 
     terrible.``Companies are not going to leave the United States 
     anymore without consequences,'' Trump said at a speech at a 
     Carrier factoryin Indianapolis, Indiana. ``We're losing so 
     much.''
       While hiring has picked up rapidly under President Obama--
     2014 and 2015were the best years of job growth since the late 
     1990s--the gains have almost all come in the so-called 
     ``service sector,'' notin manufacturing and blue collar work.
       ``There are some people doing fabulously well and others on 
     death's doorstep. Andthere's a heck of a gulf in between,'' 
     says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.
       The U.S. has 54,000 fewermanufacturing jobs now than a year 
     ago, according to the Labor Department.
       Trump is trying to stem that decline. He and vicePresident-
     elect Mike Pence negotiated a deal with Carrier to keep about 
     1,000 jobs in Indiana. Some of those jobs would havegone to 
     Mexico.
       The Obama team counters that 1,000 jobs is small compared 
     to the 178,000 jobs added in November alone. It wasthe 74th 
     consecutive month of job gains under Obama.


                          can trump do better?

       Trump and his new team of economic advisers promise to 
     hypercharge U.S. growth. They say they can get it to4%--
     stronger than recent years when the economy has grown only 
     2%.
       The question is how.
       Trump wants big tax cuts forbusinesses and individuals. 
     He's also planning to roll back regulation and spend more on 
     roads and bridges.
     Wall Street hasgiven these plans a big thumbs up. The stock 
     market rallied to record levels in November after Trump won 
     the presidency.Business and consumer confidence has also shot 
     up since the momentous win.


                        the big problemfor trump

       There's just one catch: The U.S. economy has less potential 
     to grow now than in the past,argues economist Ashworth.
       Two key factors drive growth: More people entering the 
     workforce and workers being more productiveon the job.
       Right now, the U.S. has an aging population and little 
     appetite for much more immigration, so it's hard to seemore 
     workers flooding into the workforce. Trump likes to claim 94 
     million Americans are out of work and need jobs, but 
     that'snot correct. That number includes retirees, people in 
     school and those who have chosen not to work in order to take 
     care oftheir family.
       In reality, about 2.1 million lost their jobs in recent 
     years and appear to have simply given up looking. Theyare the 
     hidden unemployed. Getting them jobs won't be easy as many 
     jobs today require specialized skills.
       Trump's big hope isto get productivity up by encouraging 
     businesses to invest more in

     their factories, research and workers. Businessinvestment has 
     been one of the missing parts of the recovery.
       ``We're not quite there yet, but we've made a 
     considerableamount of progress,'' says Ashworth.
