                            PETITIONS, ETC.

  Under clause 3 of rule XII,

       63. The SPEAKER presented a petition of Mr. Gregory D. 
     Watson, a citizen of Austin, Texas, relative to urging 
     Congress to enact legislation which would clarify that 
     henceforth any change to the appearance, imagery, size, 
     composition or anti-counterfeiting features of United States 
     coinage and paper currency, including the addition or 
     subtraction of any denomination thereof, would itself require 
     the future enactment of legislation by Congress; which was 
     referred to the Committee on Financial Services.
