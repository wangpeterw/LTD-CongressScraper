                          DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week we observe the 
Days of Remembrance, the Nation's annual commemoration of the 
Holocaust. The Holocaust was a systematic, government-sponsored 
persecution and murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazi regime and its 
collaborators.
  Congress established the Days of Remembrance in 1980. Each year, 
State and local governments, military bases, workplaces, schools, 
religious organizations, and civic centers host remembrance activities 
for their communities.
  The Holocaust is an unthinkable scar on humanity, and, for this 
reason, we gather annually to mourn the loss of so many lives and honor 
those who survived.
  We also remember those who risked their lives to rescue and protect 
their friends and neighbors. We remember the American soldiers who 
fought in World War II to liberate many from concentration camps and to 
defend the defenseless.
  And we remember, because, as Miriam Oster said so eloquently: 
``Education and remembrance are the only cures for hatred and 
bigotry.''
  We will not be silent. We cannot be indifferent to the suffering of 
others. May we always remember and always pledge: Never again.
