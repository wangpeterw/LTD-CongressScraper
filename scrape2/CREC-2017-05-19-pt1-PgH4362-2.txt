                          HONORING BUD SIMMONS

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in praise of a good Missourian and 
a good friend who has done a great deal to honor our men and women in 
uniform.
  For 18 years, Bud Simmons has hosted a Troop Hero Appreciation Day at 
his Pier 31 Marina and Restaurant on Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, 
where he treats military families to a delicious meal, boat rides on 
the lake, numerous prizes, and a day together as a family away from the 
stresses of military life.
  If you ask Bud why he does it, he will tell you that freedom is not 
free and that he wants to honor our heroes who are pledging their lives 
to protect ours. He remembers how many troops returning from Vietnam 
were never thanked for their sacrifices, and he doesn't want that 
mistake repeated.
  This year's event on Saturday, June 10, is the last time that Bud 
will host this event. I want to thank Bud for his efforts to honor 
those who serve. He has made a difference in countless lives of 
servicemen, servicewomen, and their families, and we are all grateful 
for his example, his leadership, and his patriotism.
  God bless you, Bud.
