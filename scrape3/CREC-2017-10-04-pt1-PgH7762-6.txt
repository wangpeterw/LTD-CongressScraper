 ENCOURAGE SENATE TO VOTE ON PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT 
                                  SOON

  (Mr. LABRADOR asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LABRADOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the 
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This legislation passed the 
House yesterday, and I encourage the Senate to vote on it soon.
  I am strongly pro-life. The Federal Government's most important 
responsibility is protecting human life, including the lives of the 
unborn. Additionally, we have a moral obligation to minimize pain and 
suffering, especially for the most innocent among us.
  The United States is one of only seven countries that allow abortions 
after 20 weeks. At the 20-week mark, anesthesia is used in fetal 
surgeries for patients still in utero. For premature babies born at 
this stage, special care is given to reduce their pain.
  H.R. 36 will prohibit abortions after the 20-week mark precisely 
because of

the substantial evidence that unborn babies at this stage can and do 
feel pain.
  I am proud to support H.R. 36, and I am glad it passed the House. I 
will continue to do all I can to advance a culture of life in Idaho and 
in America.
