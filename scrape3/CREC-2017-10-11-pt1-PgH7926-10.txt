                       ALLEN COUNTY RIGHT TO LIFE

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, on Monday night, I had the 
privilege of attending the Allen County Right to Life's 20th annual 
Uniting Our City for Life Banquet.
  The event was a wonderful time with fellow Hoosiers who share a 
common concern for the sanctity of innocent human life, from the moment 
of conception to the moment of natural death. It also was a celebration 
of the fact that our culture increasingly is recognizing the value of 
human life.
  A poll released last year found that a majority of young Americans 
support increasing restrictions that protect the unborn. Another recent 
poll found that 61 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to 
fund abortions. This

growing recognition that life is a precious and sacred gift is due, in 
large part, to the tireless efforts of organizations like Allen County 
Right to Life.
  I want to express special thanks to Allen County Right to Life 
Executive Director Cathie Humbarger and Operations Director Abigail 
Lorenzen for all they do in northeast Indiana to promote life and 
defend the unborn.
  I also want to congratulate Pat Miller on receiving the Daniel Award 
for pro-life commitment during Monday night's dinner. Throughout his 
career, he has been a consistent and compassionate voice for the cause 
of life, and there is no one more deserving of this prestigious award.
