   REPEALING WITHOUT REPLACING THE AFFORDABLECARE ACT WOULD HARM OUR 
                                ECONOMY

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi 
from the great Eighth District of Illinois.I have the honor of 
representing the hardworking families of Chicago's west and northwest 
suburbs.
  Before I took the oath of office last week, I was the president of 
small businesses in the Chicago area. As a small-businessman, I stand 
here to say that repealing without replacing the Affordable Care Act 
would harm our economy and, with it, ourworking and middle class 
families.
  Across our Nation, repealing without replacing the Affordable Care 
Act would destroy up to 3 million good-paying jobs anddestroy $1.5 
trillion in economic activity. Across Illinois, repealing without 
replacing the ACA would cost upwards of 100,000jobs; and in the Eighth 
District alone, repealing without replacing the ACA would cost upwards 
of 4,000 jobs.
  Middle class families need good-paying jobs and affordable health 
care. Repealing without replacing the ACA would,unfortunately, rob them 
of both.
