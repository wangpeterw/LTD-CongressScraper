                       TAX PLAN WILL RAISE TAXES

  (Mr. CLAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, let me see if I can inject some truth into 
this.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the deficit-exploding Republican tax 
plan that rewards billionaires first, and then asks hardworking 
Americans to pay for it.
  The Trump Republican tax scam will raise taxes for millions of 
working families. It will kill jobs in the home construction industry. 
It will punish student loan borrowers. This reckless plan will repeal 
the deduction for State and local income and sales tax. I would remind 
my colleagues in the majority: If you vote ``yes,'' you are voting for 
a $900 billion tax increase on American families.
  This bill is not conservative. It is not pro-family. It is not pro-
worker. It will kill jobs and reward the wealthy and corporations at 
the expense of everyone else.
  Vote ``no'' on the GOP tax scam, and let's pass a real tax reform 
bill that puts middle class families first.
