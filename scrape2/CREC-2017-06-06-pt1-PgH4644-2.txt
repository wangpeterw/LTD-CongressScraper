                                 D-DAY

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, on this day, June 6, 1944, 73 years ago, 
the largest amphibious assault in history landed on the beaches of 
Normandy, known as Operation Overlord, which we know more commonly as 
D-Day.
  I rise today, 73 years later, to honor the thousands of Allied 
soldiers who lost their lives on the beaches of Omaha, Utah, Gold, 
Juno, and Sword, and those, as well, that lived to carry the battle, 
ultimately, to Berlin and win.
  General Eisenhower told his soldiers that ``the hopes and prayers of 
liberty-loving people everywhere march with you.'' Today we commemorate 
the operation which began the liberation of Europe from Nazi control 
and paved the way for the eventual Allied victory in Europe--and for 
all of us to remain vigilant to preserve that same precious and fragile 
freedom.
  As was said in the movie ``Saving Private Ryan,'' for all of us, 
``Earn this.''
