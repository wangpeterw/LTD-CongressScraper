                        ROLL CALL FAKES THE NEWS

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, a front-page story in Roll Call 
about Chief of Staff General Kelly is as misleading as you can get. It 
clearly is an intentional hit job.
  The headline read: ``Kelly's Antics Rankle Capitol.'' The article 
claims, ``GOP and Democratic Members are united'' in not wanting 
General Kelly to speak out. But only one Republican, known for his 
criticism of this administration, is quoted, compared to four 
Democrats. Of the four Democrats, three are current Members of 
Congress, and one is a former Clinton administration official.
  So much for balance, and so much for the article's unfounded claim. 
This is what passes for journalism these days. When you see stories 
like this one, you begin to understand why the President is right to 
use the term ``fake news.''
  I doubt General Kelly will be intimidated, and I hope he will 
continue to speak out.
