                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Merciful God, we give You thanks for giving us another year.
  We ask Your blessing upon the Members of this people's House as they 
reconvene for the second session. May they anticipate the opportunities 
and difficulties that are before them, and before so many Americans, 
with steadfast determination to work together toward solutions that 
will benefit their countrymen.
  Grant that they be worthy of the responsibilities they have been 
given by their constituents and truly be the people You have called 
them to be. May the walls of disagreement that have divided this 
Assembly be put aside and replaced by a spirit of respect and dignity 
and, where needed, cooperation.
  May Your spirit, O God, be in all our hearts and minds and encourage 
us to do the works of peace and justice now and always.
  May all that we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
