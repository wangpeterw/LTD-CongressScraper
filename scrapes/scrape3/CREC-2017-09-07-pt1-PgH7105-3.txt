            AMERICAN FAMILIES DESERVE ATTENTION AND SUPPORT

  (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about DREAMers 
today, and we will continue to hear that.
  Let us note that we are talking about inviting millions of people to 
send their children to the United States, millions from around this 
hemisphere who live in poverty and oppression, and we are saying: If 
you can get your kids to the United States, they are going to be taken 
care of.
  We have limited resources here, limited in the Federal Government. 
Our people of every race and every religion and every ethnic group that 
make up the American family deserve to know that we are caring about 
them--I am sorry--rather than the children in other countries that come 
here illegally.
  We can expect a flood of new young people if we legalize this, and 
they will be consuming the healthcare dollars. They will be consuming 
the education dollars that should go to American children.
  This is not being selfish by saying take care of your family first. 
The American family deserves our attention and our support. We should 
not be extracting resources, bidding down their wages, extracting the 
resources of education and healthcare for people who have come here 
illegally and invite more people to flood into our country.
  No, the DREAMers concept is a nightmare for American young people.
