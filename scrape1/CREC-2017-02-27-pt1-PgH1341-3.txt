                   SUPPORTING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, my guest for the President's speech 
tomorrow is my constituent, Debbie Trueblood. Debbie reached out to my 
office to support the Affordable Care Act because she knows firsthand 
the difference the law can make in people's lives.
  Debbie suffers from a rare, potentially life-threatening genetic 
condition. The only treatments for the condition are a handful of 
specialized drugs that can cost more than $100,000 per year.
  Before the Affordable Care Act, Debbie could have been denied 
coverage because of her preexisting condition, and she would have faced 
medical bills greatly exceeding her salary. Because of the Affordable 
Care Act, Debbie is able to afford the treatment she needs to work, 
support her family, volunteer in her community, and be of service.
  Repealing the Affordable Care Act without effectively replacing it 
would rob millions of people like Debbie not only of their access to 
health care but also of their ability to contribute to our great 
Nation.
