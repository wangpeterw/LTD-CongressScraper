                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1460

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk, and I ask for its first reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the 
first time.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1460) to provide for the modernization of the 
     energy and natural resources policies of the United States, 
     and for other purposes.

  Mr. McCONNELL. I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.
  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative 
day.
