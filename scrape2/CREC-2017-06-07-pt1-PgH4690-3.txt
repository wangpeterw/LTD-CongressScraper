    LORAL O'HARA IS A MEMBER OF 2017 NASA ASTRONAUT CANDIDATE CLASS

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, my hometown of Sugar Land, Texas, is bursting 
with pride. A few hours ago, at the Johnson Space Center, Vice 
President Pence announced that Loral O'Hara is a member of the 2017 
NASA astronaut candidate class.
  She is a native Texan. Her high school is in my neighborhood. She is 
a proud Clements High School Ranger, class of 2001. She has a 
bachelor's from a school in the former Republic of Texas, the 
University of Kansas, and a master's from Purdue University.
  Growing up with astronauts, I know they like to take lots of huge 
risks, and by that standard, Loral is the most qualified candidate 
ever. She is a private pilot, an EMT, a wilderness first responder, a 
surfer, a sailor, a skier.
  Currently, she works at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Center. That is 
perfect training for her because she will spend hours in the water at 
the Sonny Carter Neutral Buoyancy Lab outside the Johnson Space Center.
  Loral, you know how to come home in style like only a Texas woman can 
do. You are an astronaut. Welcome home.
