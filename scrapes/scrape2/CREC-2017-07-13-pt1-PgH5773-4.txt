                       LET'S GET ON WITH BUSINESS

  (Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have ever 
seen a bigger mountain made out of a tinier molehill in my 29 years in 
Congress than what is being made out of Donald Trump, Jr.'s, meeting 
with the Russian lawyer. It reminds me of the Wendy's ad several years 
ago that asked: ``Where's the beef?''
  I know that hindsight is 20-20 and holier than thou, but this is 
ridiculous.
  Do you really believe that Chelsea Clinton would have refused to meet 
with a Russian lawyer who she was told had evidence that would 
incriminate Donald Trump?
  Donald Trump, Jr., met with this woman for a few minutes, saw she had 
nothing, and nothing came out of it. No action was taken. Even Director 
Comey testified he had seen no evidence that even one vote was altered 
by anything the Russians did.
  They have been investigating this for months, and this is the best 
they can come up with?
  It is time to stop crying over the election and do something about 
some real problems.
