                  RISING TO SAVE LIVES PROTECTION ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to save lives.
  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the CR for its repetitiveness and its inability 
to save lives, frankly, the lives of DREAMers or the lives of those who 
depend upon the Children's Health Insurance Program.
  In the vulgar statement that was made by the White House, how 
shocking this week of Dr. King's birthday of the deafening silence of 
my Republican friends and the faith community, the broad-based faith 
community.
  Let me read from the network:

       The slave codes created servitude for natural life for 
     African laborers. 250-plus years slave labor of millions of 
     African and Black people was the foundation of the American 
     economy and global force that it eventually became. On the 
     eve of the Civil War, Black slaves were valued at an 
     estimated $3.5 billion--and that is scaled for modern 
     inflation--and none of the Black slaves were able to cash in 
     on that value.

  That is the vulgar statement about Africa from which many of us have 
come. And so I would argue that it is time, now, for this House to 
stand up for people such as those who are starving in Somalia, those 
who are starving in Sudan and Nigeria, those who have been called a 
vulgar word.
  Where is the morality of this Congress, the morality of this 
administration, the morality of this Nation?
  Enough is enough.
