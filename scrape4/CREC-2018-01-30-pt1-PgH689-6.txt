  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute

[[Page H690]]

to a dear friend, Justice William Cousins, who passed away a couple 
days ago at the age of 90.
  Bill was a former member of the Chicago City Council, called an 
independent alderman; a circuit court judge; and an appellate court 
justice who always sought fairness. He was a gentleman, a scholar, and 
a Harvard graduate. I commend him for his public service.
