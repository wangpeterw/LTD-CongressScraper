                    HONORING WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR.

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
one of our Nation's greatest leaders and, for me, in my young career, a 
mentor and good friend, William Coleman, Jr., who passed away earlier 
this year at the age of 96.
  Throughout his long career, Bill helped shape the future of our 
country in a past full of racial tension.
  In 1948, Bill became the first African American to serve as a law 
clerk on the United States Supreme Court, and helped draft the legal 
brief for the landmark 1954 case, Brown v. Board of Education.
  Bill later became our Nation's second African-American Cabinet 
official, serving as Transportation Secretary for Gerald Ford.
  I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his family, his loved 
ones, his former law partners, and his staff.
