He also served as the executive director of the Department of Military & Veterans Affairs and was a member of the Governor's cabinet.  He had responsibility for the Colorado National Guard's primary missions of national defense and State emergency response. In addition, he was responsible for supporting the missions of the Civil Air Patrol's Colorado  General Edwards received his commission in 1973, after graduating from the U.Air Force Academy, and earned his pilot wings in 1974 at Reese Air Force Base,  He served as an F-4 pilot and AT-38 Fighter lead-in instructor pilot at Osan Air Base, Korea, and Holloman Air Force Base, NM, respectively.  General Edwards joined the Colorado Air National Guard in August 1980. He has served in numerous assignments in flying and operations, as well as command positions at squadron, group, and wing levels--culminating as the adjutant general for  During his tenure as adjutant general, more than 6,000 Colorado National Guard citizen-soldiers and citizen-airmen have mobilized in support of overseas contingency operations.  He also oversaw the Colorado National Guard's record-setting response to some of the worst natural disasters impacting Colorado, including the High Park fire and the Waldo Canyon fire during 2012, followed by the Black Forest fire and historic flooding along the Colorado Front Range in 2013.  Furthermore, General Edwards was instrumental in bringing a new National Guard cyber protection team to Colorado, bolstering the State's cyber defenses. He also diversified the Colorado National Guard through the appointment of its first female general officer.  Over a period of 10 years, General Edwards significantly grew the Colorado National Guard's enduring relationships with the Republic of Slovenia and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan under the National Guard State Partnership  These military-to-military exchanges have supported combatant command security cooperation objectives, promoted regional stability, and increased partner capacity and interoperability.  General Edwards has also overseen the missions of the Civil Air Patrol's Colorado Wing, consisting of more than 1,600 volunteers. Under his leadership, the Civil Air Patrol took on a bigger role in State response, flying fire watch, and conducting flood damage surveys.  Colorado's Civil Air Patrol was first to fly support of the U.Army's on-base unmanned aerial systems operations.  General Edwards has flown over 4,600 mishap-free flight hours in a variety of aircraft to include the AT-38, A-7, C-21, F-4, F-16, T-37 and T-38.

I served in the military under the past five Presidents starting with Ronald Reagan and witnessed firsthand the erosion of our combat edge. When I joined the military, we out-trained our competitors with a 2-to-1 flying-hour advantage.

We don't want a close fight, but that is where we are at today.

As CSN program director, Cecilia worked tirelessly to connect Americans to Colombian communities affected by the war. She was inspired to help establish new chapters of CSN in locations ranging from the University of Wisconsin-Madison to central New York, connecting these communities through a ``sister cities'' program to rural Colombian communities facing violence during the Colombian civil war.  She led over 50 delegations of citizens, journalists, and public officials to Colombia so they could fully understand the effect of the civil war. After working with Cecilia and CSN to establish a sister community relationship between Dane County, WI and San Jose de Apartado, Colombia, I had the honor to accompany her on one of those delegations in 1993.  In addition to her public service through CSN, Cecilia was a member of the national board of directors of the Women's International League for Peace and She was also a member of the Latin American Subcommittee of the American Friends Service Committee--Quakers--served on the board of directors of the Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice, and, in October of 2015, received the Global Citizen of the Year Award from the Madison Chapter of the United Nations  Regardless of the cause or project, Cecilia approached everything with unparalleled strength, courage, and a sense of selflessness.

Ted committed his life to the pursuit of justice and equality. Ted and his late wife Dorothy were incredible pillars who had a great influence on me as I entered a life of public service.  Ted Shannon showed up. In service to his country, he became a civil affairs officer in July of 1941 during WW II, attached to the British 8th Army during the occupation of In his subsequent post, he served as executive officer for the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in  He showed up as a leader in education, whether it was in his role as a Ford Foundation higher education adviser for five Middle Eastern countries in Lebanon--the nation of his ancestors--or as a highly regarded UW-Extension faculty member and dean for more than three decades.  Ted Shannon showed up. Along with Dorothy and fellow travelers from the New Deal era, Ted supported progressive causes at all levels of government for more than half a century. I cannot recall an event, large or small, for a progressive organization where I did[[Page S3915]]not see Ted and Dorothy pitching in, providing leadership and encouragement no matter how challenging the cause.  He showed up as a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend. Ted met and married the former Dorothy Judge while at Yale pursuing his Ph.on the GI bill and shared his life with her until her passing in 2003. Ted was father to Tad, Sara, and Ted showed up as a hunting and fishing companion to son, Tad, and sage adviser on matters of food, music, languages, and world travel to Sara and He enjoyed outdoor adventures with his dear friend, Bill Ted, Dorothy, Bill and Connie Threinen were friends and compatriots in advancing beloved ideals and forward-thinking causes for decades. A few years after Dorothy's passing, Ted married second wife, Kate Foster, of Eau Claire and continued his life of service for another 9 years.  Ted showed up. He was a doer. He walked the talk. Ted's multifaceted legacy is perhaps best illustrated by the words of Cuban poet Jose Marti: ``Men of Action, above all those whose actions are guided by love, live forever.''

This bill includes additional operations and maintenance funding to support more combat training center rotations and needed investment in the facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization accounts, providing more training opportunities and better maintenance facilities to live, work, and operate in. However, readiness cannot be bought back in a year, and these targeted investments must continue.

6142,topic-id,480,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. I appreciate his leadership to get us here both on the Rules Committee and the Appropriations  Mr.Speaker, despite what you may hear in the media, this funding bill is a positive step forward for the American people and a big win for the Trump administration. I want to highlight a few reasons why.  First, delivering on President Trump's promise, this bill makes long overdue and much-needed investments in our military. The bill boosts military spending by $21 billion, which will help boost military readiness and fund the largest pay raise for our troops in 6 years.  Importantly, the bill finally rejects demands of Democrats to only increase defense spending if all other spending is also increased. This bill ends that harmful precedent.  The bill devotes important new funding for border security. In fact, it contains the biggest increase in border security funding in almost a decade. This will allow us to make improvements to the wall at the border, put more Customs and Border Protection agents on the ground, and end the disastrous practice of ``catch and release.''  The bill includes important pro-life protections to ensure taxpayer money is not used to fund abortions. Just as important, the bill does not contain a penny of funding for Planned I am going to say it again: there is not a penny in here for Planned  The bill includes important Second Amendment protections, increases funding to help fight crime, supports funding for Israel, provides money for missile defense, and sets aside additional resources to defeat  Even more, the bill cuts funding to the EPA, freezes funding for the IRS, and reduces the Federal Government's role in education.  Finally, the bill makes progress and priorities important to my folks in southwest For example, the bill fully funds three littoral combat ships, which are built, in part, by Austal USA in These ships are critical to the United States Navy and are necessary if we are to reach the 355-ship fleet that President Trump wants. This funding bill will ensure we continue to build these first class vessels in  The bill also includes a provision important to our red snapper fishermen. With the help of Senator Richard Shelby, we were able to secure a permanent expansion of State waters out to nine nautical miles.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is not perfect--no compromise ever is--but I commend President Trump in negotiating a good bill to begin the process of implementing the priorities the American people sent him and us to Washington to accomplish.  President Trump has called on Congress to pass this funding bill while we work to make even more progress in the upcoming fiscal year 2018 funding negotiations. I intend to do just that, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.  I am glad to support President Trump, this rule, and the underlying bill.

6307,topic-id,1699,"Mr.President, I want to preface my remarks today by asking that you convey to your wingman, Senator John McCain, our colleague, our best wishes and our hope that he is on his way to a speedy recovery and will be back here because we need him. We need his wisdom.  I want to thank Tim Kaine for the leadership that he and Senator Shaheen are showing to help us try to stabilize the marketplaces. Senator Hassan and I have talked a lot about this.  What do we do now? I think this is an opportunity. This is an opportunity here. I realize there is a fair amount of confusion as to which path to take and which way to go. I hope we don't waste this opportunity.  I sent a message to the new chairman of the National Governors Association and to the new vice chairman of the National Governors Brian Sandoval from Nevada is the new chair and the Governor from Nevada, previously the vice chair, and Steve Bullock from Montana is the vice chair. One is a Republican, and the other is a I sent them a message this morning saying that it would be good to hear from the They have been working on a bipartisan letter--they have been working on it for a while--and this is really the time it could make a positive impact.  We have three people sitting here--four of us--who used to be part of the National Governors I loved it, and I am sure Senator Kaine, Senator Hassan, and Senator Shaheen loved it as well. Here is what I suggested that the Governors may want to consider in their message:  1, urge us to hit the pause button. Hit the pause button. Let's just stop in place for a moment.  2, pivot soon--not in September, not in August, but now, like this week, pivot to stabilizing the exchanges.  3, return to regular order. Senator Kaine has already mentioned this. When I talked with Senator McCain last week a couple of times briefly, we both talked about the need for regular order. People have good ideas on healthcare; introduce them. Committees with jurisdiction, hold hearings. Witnesses, including Governors, should come before the committees of jurisdiction--a couple of committees in the House and in the Senate--and let's hear from the experts, and let's certainly hear from the Governors, who have to run these Medicaid Programs and have a lot of expertise in this area to offer us.  Then I would say, after the August recess, if we can actually do something real in stabilizing the exchanges, what a confidence builder that would be among us and, I think, around the country. It would be a great confidence builder.  The other thing I would mention is that when we come back after the August recess, don't just muck around and wonder what we are going to do; we should pull together in a bipartisan way--something we talked about doing a lot, but we don't often do it--to really do maybe a couple of things.  Let's figure out what we need to fix in the Affordable Care Republicans believe that Democrats feel it is perfect and nothing should be changed. Well, I don't feel that way. My guess is that most of our Democrats don't, either. No bill I have ever worked on was perfect. It can always be done better. The same is true with big programs like Medicare and Social Security, veterans programs, and so on. They can all be done better, and this is certainly the case as well. Let's fix the parts of the ACA that need to be fixed, and let's preserve the parts that ought to be preserved.  I would reiterate, speaking on behalf of some recovering Governors, including me, the Governors need to be heavily involved in this. I suspect that all of the former Governors who are on the floor with me today, when we were part of the NGA, we weren't on the floor--actually, I was on this floor any number of times because Governors had access to the floor--but we had many opportunities, many invitations to testify before Senate committees and House committees on a wide range of[[Page S4035]]issues. I think we brought value, and we need to hear from them today.  I want to go back and talk about how we go about stabilizing the exchanges. The first thing that would help would be for the administration to stop destabilizing them. That would be a big help.  Senator Kaine has led on legislation--and he has mentioned it, and I want to drill down on it just a little bit--that would provide reinsurance, much as we do in other ways in terms of the Medicare Part D drug program. Using reinsurance is a very common tool, and we can use it to help stabilize the exchanges.  How would it be used in our proposal? If this lady standing right in front of me were getting healthcare and her healthcare needs were expensive, under our reinsurance plan starting in 2018, 2019, 2020, the first $50,000 in her healthcare that she used in year one, 2018, the Federal Government--well, the insurance companies themselves actually would be on the hook for the first $50,000 of care she got. Between $50,000 and $500,000, under our proposal, the Federal Government would pay for 80 percent of that cost--80 percent of that cost. Between $50,000 and $500,000 would be on the Federal Anything above $500,000 would be back on the insurance company. That is what we would do for the next 3 years.  Starting in 2021 and going forward, the first $100,000 would be on the insurance company for the costs borne--created by an individual, and then between $100,000 and $500,000, 80 percent of that would be on the Federal Government, and after that, the rest of it is back again on the insurance company to pay for.  That is our proposal. We have a bunch of cosponsors on it, and we need some Republican cosponsors as well. It is not a Democratic idea. It is not a Republican idea. It is just a good idea that deserves bipartisan support.  Another thing we ought to do to stabilize the exchanges is what Senator Shaheen has proposed; that is, we have these CSRs, cost-sharing reductions. I think of them as subsidies to help subsidize people whose income is under a certain level; I think it is 250 percent of poverty. Folks who are in the exchanges getting healthcare coverage and whose income is under 250 percent of poverty currently receive some subsidies to help buy down and reduce the cost of their copays and their deductibles. It is not really clear whether that is authorized. It is not really clear whether that is being funded, but it has been done for a number of years.  The current administration has been saying: Well, we don't know if we are going to continue to do that.  There have been some States that want to go to court and say: You can't do that.  We need to pass a law and say that we are going to have these cost-sharing reductions and that the subsidies will continue to be offered.  The last thing we need to do is to make clear that the individual mandate or something as good as or at least as effective as the individual mandate is going to be around. For the administration to say: Well, we don't know if we are going to enforce the individual mandate--it just encourages young, healthy people not to get coverage.  We have to make it clear that the individual mandate or something as good as--it could be a proxy for it or maybe several things that work together that could be as effective as the individual mandate. If they don't work, maybe we could just have a default position that would be the individual mandate again.  We ought to have hearings on these kinds of things and discuss them and hear from all kinds of folks.  The other thing I want to mention is just that when I go around my State, my Lord, I have never heard people so interested in encouraging us. I think I am regarded in my State--along with Senator Coons and our Congresswoman, Lisa Blunt Rochester--I think we are regarded as bipartisan people. We are Democrats and proud to be We would like to work with Republicans, too, and I think that is part of being a recovering But on this subject, on healthcare reform, going forward, the people in my State don't want a Democratic victory. They don't want a Republican victory. Frankly, they don't want a Trump victory. They want a victory for our country. That is what they want. They want a victory for our country.

The bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives that continue our commitment to maintain military personnel and family readiness and address issues important to our troops. The provisions contained in this bill provide our warfighters, retirees, and their families the necessary pay and benefits to sustain them into today's highly stressed force.  To support these efforts, this bill establishes a fully funded by-law pay raise for all of our servicemembers overriding the President's ability to reduce the pay raise. After years of lower than by-law pay raise requests, it is critical that we continue to give our troops and their families the pay increases they deserve.                              {time}  2000  The bill increases the end-strengths of our Active Duty, National Guard, and Reserve forces, increasing mission readiness while reducing the stress and strain on the force and their families.  The bill further focuses last year's management reform of the Military Health System to provide clear responsibility for the delivery of healthcare services at military medical treatment facilities and for military medical readiness.  The bill also stops an ill-considered, cost-saving measure that would close several U.military hospitals overseas. We believe our servicemembers and their families should continue to have the best medical care possible wherever they serve.  It also continues to improve sexual assault prevention and response by adding a new provision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice specifically prohibiting nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, expanding Special Victims' Counsel training to include training on the unique challenges often[[Page H5539]]faced by male victims, and clarifying the process by which a designated representative can be appointed by a victim prior to a court-martial.

6141,topic-id,583,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  To respond to a few of my friend's points, Mr.Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with my friend, actually.  As he knows, I agree with his point that this should have been done many months ago, and could have been done, in my view, many months ago. We should have done this in I don't think we did the country or ourselves or the President any favors by delaying that. So my friend is right about that decision, and I hope we all learn a lesson from it.  I also agree with my friend that, because we delayed, the 2018 appropriations process will be extremely difficult and truncated. It will make work harder. We may find ourselves back here in a number of months asking for[[Page H3083]]some brief extension as we continue to work through our problems. I hope not, but my friend's observation on that point I agree with.  I want to disagree with my friend pretty strongly about his observation about the 160 riders that we decided in the negotiation not to press, and I want to explain why we decided not to press them.  Frankly, we don't need to press them anymore. Almost 160 of those were designed to limit or reverse rulings of the last administration--either rules or executive decisions. Well, Mr.Trump is now the President of the United States and he is going to have the ability to do almost all of those things on his own. He doesn't need legislative instruction from us. He will certainly get support as he works through that list with the executive branch, which he runs.  I also want to add, just to clarify, it is important to note that there is nothing in this bill that funds Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form. As a matter of fact, there is a family planning title and grants are awarded out of that title by the Department of Health and Human  Sometimes in the past, Planned Parenthood has received money in those grants. Now there is new management at the Department of Health and Human Services, so we will see how this goes. This Congress has never appropriated money directly to Planned Parenthood and, frankly, I suspect never will.  Finally, in defense of the President, I want to point out that we are adding billions of dollars to defense of this country, which is desperately needed because, frankly, his predecessor had allowed it to erode. That is because of the President's leadership.  We are making the most substantial investments in border security in a decade. That is because of the President's leadership.  Finally, we have broken this terrible one-for-one formula that the last administration imposed on us. In other words, to defend the United States of America, we had to spend more money domestically, whether we needed to or not, whether we could afford it or not. If it weren't for President Trump, that formula would still be in existence and we would be frittering away money in places where we don't need it and denying support to our troops and our forces in the field when they desperately need it. I am very grateful to the President for making that possible. Again, with his leadership, it could not have occurred.

6151,topic-id,605,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Before I go to my next speaker, I want to take a moment to respond to my friends.  Mr.Speaker, I actually came here to debate the appropriations bill, which is a great bipartisan compromise, but I am always happy to engage in the healthcare debate as well, if that is what my friends choose to do. I am happy to do it because I remember the conditions under which ObamaCare was passed.  I remember the promises that we would save $2,500 a family--not true.  I remember, if you liked your plan, you could keep it--not true.  I remember, if you liked your doctor, you could keep that individual--not true.  This was sold, frankly, on a tissue of fabrications and some predictions that were outlandishly false.  Those people who say this is a good system, come to my We are down to a single provider--one. That provider, by the way, I always say thank God for them, because they are losing money. We are down to one. Our rates are going up 69 percent.  So anybody who thinks this is a successful system should go look at it. If it were successful, my friends would probably still be in the majority instead of the minority. It has not been successful. The American people have, in election after election, rendered a verdict that this particular system is not meeting their needs, and it badly needs to be overhauled and changed, if not rooted out completely.  Frankly, again, as, I think, through the President's actions and what my colleagues in the leadership of my party are doing, I am very glad they are working overtime right now to try and make sure that we have something better for the American people than my friends delivered on the other side of the aisle when they had the opportunity to do so. It is not working.  I hope very much we have to cancel travel plans so the next day or two we can actually vote on this. I would be ecstatic to do that. So, again, I would be happy to debate that. When the time comes, we will. But I look forward to engaging in that debate because I am absolutely convinced we can do a lot better for the American people than we[[Page H3085]]did when ObamaCare was passed, and we can implement something a lot better for the American people than we did when it was rolled out. And we certainly can avoid some of the catastrophic consequences.  As for my friend's concerns about preexisting conditions, frankly, they are not going to be reversed, but I happen to live in a State where I trust my Governor and my legislature to make smart decisions. Frankly, I trust them a lot more than I do anybody in Washington, D.C., to understand what is going on in my I suspect most people in here actually trust their Governors and their legislature to be more in touch with the needs of their people than anybody in Washington, D.C., happens to be, so I am happy to see a devolution of decisionmaking from Washington to other parts of the country. As I read the Constitution, we call that federalism. It has worked very well for the American people for almost 240 years.

6160,topic-id,1947,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank my good friend. It is always a pleasure, honestly, to engage in debate with him because it is going to be spirited, but it is going to be civil. So I thank my friend for that.  And, frankly, when my friend points out that he and President Trump are actually on the same side for once, I think the second coming may not be very far. So we are all in a pretty good mood here.  But I do want to echo a couple of points that my friend made, and made, as always, with great skill. There is a lot in this bill that brings us together. This was a product of genuine compromise. We have Republicans in the House and Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate and Democrats in the Senate, and, obviously, the administration. It is really a five-corner negotiation.  I think we ought to step back a little bit and reflect that, in the course of that, while all those parties began with very different positions, and some verbal fisticuffs, as well, they actually moved closer together over the course of discussion. And that has effectively meant that we are going to have the first bipartisan, bicameral negotiation in this administration that has been successful.  I would hope it becomes a model for some of the things that lie in front of us, things like infrastructure, and like tax reform. I recognize we won't always agree. But, to me, this agreement shows that we can work towards agreements, if we will sit in good faith and compromise with one another.  I think the President, frankly, did a lot of good things from his point of view here. I think the additional money for our men and women in uniform, the raise in pay for those we have asked so much from, and who have never let us down, is something he can be proud of.  I think the additional money on the border, where we know we have a security problem, we may debate the best way to address that. That is fair enough. But that is an achievement that he deserves credit for.  And I think, frankly, breaking this artificial linkage of domestic spending and security spending was something that is really important. Sometimes we will actually need more domestically than, perhaps, we need in defense. But we are going to have to look at those things logically, not create artificial formulas. I actually fear sometimes my side might do that in reverse by demanding cuts in exchange for military spending when those cuts are, in themselves, not wise.  Finally, I look at things where we find a lot of common purpose here. My friend, Mr.Dent, mentioned a number of those. Things like more money for the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Disease Believe me, pandemics and bioterrorists don't care if you are Republican or Democrat, or Liberal or We have to maintain this effort. It is extraordinarily important.  I think, again, and my friends pointed out, we worked together to provide additional funds for early childhood, to provide additional money through programs like GEAR UP and TRIO, to help those who have never had an opportunity to go to college and succeed. And, frankly, things like the year-round Pell grant, that, again, as speakers from both sides of the aisle pointed out, are going to help students actually succeed and help them wrestle with the financial burden. So there is a lot in here to be proud of.  Now, our vote on the rule is always a partisan exercise, so I recognize that. But I am very proud that, after that vote, we will have substantial numbers of Members from both sides of the aisle voting together on something they worked on together and achieved. It will be sent over to the Senate, and I think we will see the same result there, and eventually to the desk of the President of the United States, and I think he can sign it with a great deal of pride and a recognition that: hey, occasionally, bipartisanship and negotiation actually work.  With that, again, I want to thank my very good friend for the debate. And I want to point out in closing that this is so much better than a continuing resolution. This is real governance at work. This is us working together, exercising oversight, and appropriately funding, and compromises on occasion, important functions for the American people.

The question of      consideration shall be debatable for 10 minutes by the Member      initiating the point of order and for 10 minutes by an      opponent, but shall otherwise be decided without intervening      motion except one that the House adjourn.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

6339,topic-id,726,"Mr.President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, that would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene a panel to develop a national strategy to recognize and support the more than forty million family caregivers in the United I am pleased that Senators Murkowski and Bennet have joined us as cosponsors.  The United States' population is aging. Every day, 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 years old. Americans 85 and older--our oldest old--are the fastest growing segment of our population. This is the population that is most at risk of multiple and interacting health problems that can lead to disability and the need for round-the-clock care.  At the very time that our population is aging, birth rates are declining. While the need for care and support is increasing, the numbers of professional and informal caregivers is shrinking. In the future, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers.  Families will likely continue to be the most important source of support for people with long-term care needs. We must do more to support the more than 43 million family caregivers in the United States who make remarkable sacrifices to care for their loved ones. While it is impossible to put a dollar amount to the value of the devotion, time, and services that these caregivers provide, it is estimated that in 2013 family caregivers provided $470 billion in uncompensated long-term care. This figure nearly equals the annual sales of the four largest United States tech companies combined.  Family caregivers provide tremendous value, and they also face many challenges. Caregivers experience high levels of stress and have a greater incidence of chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Caregiving can be an isolating experience. Last week, the Aging Committee held a hearing highlighting that social isolation is a serious risk factor for depression, anxiety, dementia, functional decline, and even death.  The average caregiver is a 49-year-old woman. She is caring for a 69-year-old relative living with a long-term physical condition. That relative is often a parent. She has been providing care for four years on average, spending 24.4 hours a week. She may be raising her own children and working full time.  Other caregivers are seniors. One third of family caregivers are age 65 or older, and even more susceptible to putting their own health at risk.  I am, therefore, introducing legislation with my colleague from Wisconsin that would lead to the development of a national strategy to recognize and support family caregivers. Titled the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage, or RAISE Family Caregivers Act, the legislation is based on a recommendation of the bipartisan Commission on Long Term It is modeled after a law that I co-authored in 2010 with then-Senator Evan Bayh that created a coordinated strategic national plan to combat Alzheimer's disease.  The RAISE Family Caregivers Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a National Family Caregiving Project to develop and sustain a national strategy to support family caregivers. The bill would create a Family Caregiving Advisory Council comprised of relevant Federal agencies and non-federal members. It would include representatives of family caregivers, older adults with long-term care needs, individuals with disabilities, employers, health and social service providers, advocates for family caregivers, state and local officials, and others with expertise in family caregiving.  The Advisory Council would be charged with making recommendations to the The strategy and plan would be updated to reflect new developments. The plan would include an initial inventory and assessment of federally funded caregiver efforts. It would then identify specific actions that government and communities could take to support family caregivers.  The Project would be funded from existing funding appropriated for the Department of Health and Human No new funding is authorized and it would sunset in five years.  Family caregivers are an invaluable resource to our aging society. Chances are that, sooner or later, we will all either be family caregivers or someone who needs one. The RAISE Family Caregivers Act will launch a coordinated, national strategic plan that will help us to leverage our resources, promote innovation and promising practices, and provide our nation's family caregivers with much-needed recognition and support. Our bipartisan legislation is widely endorsed by aging and disability organizations. I urge all of our colleagues to join as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-05-03-pt1-PgS2723.txt,2121,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,3.0,July

6310,topic-id,230,"Mr.President, reserving the right to object.  The Senator from New Hampshire has acknowledged that she had made this previous request last week. The Kaiser Family Foundation, among other publications, has clearly stated that the cost-sharing reductions she is asking for are paid directly by the Federal Government to insurance companies. Thus, when I call this an insurance company bailout, I believe that is literally true.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of these payments at $7 billion in 2017, $10 billion in 2018, and $16 billion by 2027.  So what my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, is proposing is an insurance company bailout in the tens of billions of dollars with no reform, throwing more money at a broken Affordable Care Act, which has been in existence 7 years now.  I know they would like to blame this on President Trump, who has been in office just a short time--about a half a year--but this is built into the very structure of the Affordable Care Act, and it isn't working.  I, personally, will not be part of any bailout of insurance companies without reforms. That is why we were trying to structure something under the Better Care Act, which unfortunately we haven't been successful with so far. We are going to keep on trying, but this is not the answer.

It is really a very truncated schedule this year, but they both did it. Again, it is kudos to both of them in terms of their leadership skills.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the 2018 Front and center in our deliberations in the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee on which I serve with Chairman Wittman, who is in his first term and did an outstanding job, was the build-up of our Navy fleet which has been a multiyear process of strategic planning.                              {time}  2015  In December of last year, the prior Navy secretary, Ray Mabus, who served in the prior administration, released an updated force structure assessment that laid out the requirement for increasing the Navy's fleet from 308 ships to 355.  Then, in January, Navy officials outlined a plan to get us on a construction plan to get us on a path to a larger fleet. In early May, the chief of naval operations emphasized that ``time is of the essence'' in growing the  The stage was set to get started on the larger fleet. That was why so many of us were surprised on May 23 and disappointed when the White House sent over basically a 308-ship budget for a 355-ship fleet.  I am proud to say that, on a bipartisan basis, we have done much better in this bill than the budget that came over. Among other things, the bill explicitly makes it the policy of our Nation to achieve a 355-ship We add five additional ships in 2018, for a total of 12, to get us moving to the larger fleet that the prior administration and the new administration know that we need.  One area I am particularly proud of is the area of undersea forces. Reflecting the urgent testimony of our combatant commanders, our panel once again led the way in forging an aggressive but realistic plan to grow our submarine fleet.  To achieve this, our bill authorizes multiyear procurement authority for 13 Virginia class attack submarines for the next 5 years. Not only would this keep us at the two-a-year level we have been on for the last few years, but would go even further by reaching a three-submarine build rate in the coming years.  The seapower portion of the bill does much more to support a range of priorities on the seas and in the skies, far too many to itemize here today.  I will just say that I am proud of the bipartisan contribution of all of our subcommittee members into the product before the House today, and, again, Mr.Wittman for his first year as subcommittee chairman.  In particular, I want to highlight the work of our subcommittee staff in[[Page H5541]]helping us craft the bill. I am joined here today by one of my staff, Stephen Clement, who has been working with us, but he is going to be moving on to better things. I want to publicly thank him for his outstanding work in terms of helping us get to the place we are here today.  In closing, I would urge my colleagues to support the Defense Authorization bill.

According to historical accounts from Mountain Home Air Force Base, the 366th Fighter Wing's roots trace back much further than 50 years, all the way to the activation of the 366th Fighter Group in 1943. The fighter group participated in action over France, ground support in the Normandy invasion, air attacks near Lo, France, and attacks and reconnaissance in the Battle of the Following World War II, the fighter group went through deactivations, reactivations, redesignations, and base reassignments before earning its nickname, the ``Gunfighters,'' in the 1960s, for its weapons innovation and effectiveness in accomplishing its missions in The wing became renowned as the Gunfighters after it mounted Gatling gun pods on its aircraft wings to improve short-range capabilities in battling enemy aircraft over The Gunfighters' effectiveness was recognized with a Presidential unit citation. The tenacity and ingenuity at the heart of the wing and its earning its Gunfighters moniker is an attribute we celebrate today.  While both the fighter wing and Mountain Home Air Force Base started taking shape in 1943, it was not until 1972 that the two combined when the then-366th Tactical Fighter Wing, later redesignated the 366th Fighter Wing, moved from Vietnam to its current location at Mountain Home Air Force Mountain Home Air Force Base reports that the base first opened on August 7, 1943. The base has since been home to many of our Nation's outstanding servicemembers, including the men and women of the 366th Fighter From accommodating the training of crews for a variety of aircraft to supporting combat, covert, and special operations missions, the base has a long history of remarkable contributions to defending Americans and allies both at home and all around the world.

I would like to draw special attention to some of this legislation's provisions that will further support our veterans and enhance our military's readiness.  Division L of the underlying bill provides supplemental funding to augment the appropriations that were provided to MILCON and the VA accounts, military construction and the VA accounts, last  Specifically, this bill will allow us to further address the opioid epidemic that has escalated within so many communities across the country and affected individuals and families from a broad range of backgrounds and professions.  The 2017 bill will provide $50 million in additional current-year funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve opioid and substance abuse prevention and treatment for veterans. Those funds will allow the VA to achieve full implementation of their responsibilities under title IX of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016.  I just raised this issue less than an hour ago with VA Secretary David Shulkin in this morning's hearing. He stressed the importance of these funds to stay ahead of this challenge and provide comprehensive treatments to our veterans. It is my hope that the lessons learned from this public health crisis will be remembered so that we can prevent similar episodes from occurring in the future.  In addition, the FY17 Consolidated Appropriations Act will support readiness and infrastructure improvements and facilitate future force structure growth by providing all our military services with the full amount requested for military construction efforts.  Mr.Speaker, I agree with so many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle that we need to make investments in our military readiness. I would like to stress that the investments in the infrastructure and military construction programs that support our troops at home and abroad are critical aspects of our overall readiness posture. This bill will move us in the right direction by addressing needs for both our Active-Duty and our National Guard and Reserve forces.                              {time}  1330  I would also like to talk about some other aspects of this legislation, too, in the underlying bill. Many pressing needs are addressed here.[[Page H3086]]  Specifically, we are talking about a very significant pay increase, a 2.1 percent pay increase for our troops. It is the largest pay increase in 6 years.  This legislation makes a substantial downpayment on our efforts, and the Trump administration's efforts, to enhance and increase military spending to address the various threats that we are seeing throughout the world.  I just returned from South Korea and Okinawa, Japan, and we have many challenges in Northeast Asia, that I won't go into here today. But we all know that we have some real obligations, particularly for our United States  I also wanted to mention, too, my good friend, Chairman He led the effort, along with Senator Roy Blunt, to increase funding for medical research, critical lifesaving medical research to the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion in this legislation, taking the funding level from $32 billion to $34 billion. And that is on top of what we heard in fiscal year 2016, which took us up $2 billion, as well, from $30 billion to $32 billion.  So the commitment of this side of the aisle to medical research, I think, is strong, and we are backing it up with our dollars. We had to set some priorities, and Chairman Cole did that in the labor health bill. He set those priorities, and we said: This is one of them. I am proud that we as Republicans are stepping up on medical research. I am also pleased, too, that many of our Democratic friends are supporting this in this effort as well.

And there are other areas, too. Pell grants made some great changes, too--year-round Pell grants for so many students who are struggling with college affordability.  I also want to point out, too, on border security, a downpayment has been made here as well. This legislation provides $1.5 billion additionally for border security. This will help us move closer to establishing greater operational control of our border, which is something I think we all agree needs to be done.  These are just a few of the provisions of this legislation beyond what I am responsible for--military construction and VA--that are worthy.  I would urge support of this bill. I would also like to point out that we did pass the Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill back in September on time. It is the first appropriations bill passed on time since 2009. I want to take a little credit for that.  But these other 11 bills that have been discussed here today need our support. We need to keep this government running. We have done it in a very thoughtful, bipartisan, measured way, and we have been very responsible. This bill needs to get to the President's desk immediately.

6102,topic-id,2577,"Madam President, I rise to speak against the Republican effort and what it appears to be thus far to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the process they are using to do it.  I just have to say, this is the least transparent process for a major piece of legislation I have seen in my 24 years in the Former Senate Historian Don Ritchie said that you have to look back before World War I to find another example of such a secret, partisan process for passing a major bill.  The Senate healthcare bill in fact is being written behind closed doors. There is no draft for public review. No Democratic Senator has seen the bill. Republican Senators all say they haven't seen the bill either.  When Republican Senators are asked what is in the bill, unless they are the 13 privileged ones, they say they have no idea. Everyone except the 13 Republicans drafting this bill has been excluded, and these 13 Senators represent just 10 States out of our 50. Health experts and health advocacy organizations have been shut out. No one representing doctors, nurses, patients, children, the elderly, hospitals, community clinics, or health plans is able to provide any feedback at all on how the bill would affect people.  Over the weekend, the Los Angeles Times reported that a coalition of more than 15 patient groups, including the American Heart Association, the March of Dimes, and the American Lung Association, tried to get a meeting with Senator McConnell or his staff and were told no. That is unbelievable.  Think of it. Think of the American Heart Association, the March of Dimes, the American Lung Association asking to meet with either the leader or his staff, and somebody says no. Do my Republican colleagues really believe that groups like the American Heart Association don't deserve an opportunity to weigh in on a healthcare bill when our healthcare system affects every single person in this country? Healthcare is the last subject that should be addressed behind closed doors, hidden from public view. Yet, apparently, Republicans intend to bring the bill to the floor without a single hearing. Senator McConnell wants to vote on a bill by next Thursday, I am told. That is 10 days from now. Well, if there is not going to be a hearing, we shouldn't vote. I think: no hearing, no vote.  It is important to point out the contrast between what is happening now and our consideration of the Affordable Care Act, known as There were 100 hearings, meetings, roundtables, and walkthroughs of the bill between the Senate Finance and the HELP There were 25 consecutive days and 160 hours of debate on the Senate floor. There were 300 HELP Committee amendments, including more than 160 Republican amendments.  Was our process in 2009 and 2010 perfect? No, it wasn't, but it was infinitely better than what is happening now. This process is such an affront to our democratic system of government.  Senator Harris and I represent We are the sixth largest economy in the world. We represent more than 40 million people. That is more than 22 other States combined.  Fourteen million Californians are covered by the Medicaid Program, the program the House bill says we are going to stop the funding for. Fourteen million Californians are more people than the entire population of 9 of the 10 States represented in the secret healthcare negotiations. Four million Californians gained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act--more people than the population of 4 of the 10 States represented in the secret negotiations. Despite the significant effects that any healthcare bill would have on California, both of its Senators have been shut out.[[Page S3572]]  I want to work to improve the Affordable Care I know there are challenges we need to address, and I want to be part of the process, but there is no opportunity to do so.  If the Senate bill is anything like the House bill, the effects would be devastating to my If the Senate bill is like the House bill, here is what it would do: It would take healthcare coverage away from 23 million working and middle-class families to finance a tax cut for the richest 5 percent of This is indefensible. There is no justification for giving millionaires a $50,000 tax break by taking healthcare away from our most vulnerable citizens. I don't know of any who are asking for it. It is some kind of blighted political agenda that you could leave the elderly and the sick untended, and it justifies a $50,000 tax break for a millionaire.  This would end Medicaid as we have known it for 50 years by cutting $834 billion. It eliminates protections for people with preexisting conditions. It defunds Planned It denies all Californians and New Yorkers--all of them--tax credits, unless the States change their laws requiring insurance companies to cover reproductive care, including abortion services. It is almost a blackmail provision.  I am going to talk more about the potential changes to Medicaid, known as Medi-Cal, because they are startling. Everyone needs to understand that the changes Republicans have proposed--and we think are proposing for the Senate bill--go much further than repealing the expansion of the program, which was a big part of the Affordable Care  It has been reported in the media that Senate Republicans are looking at changes to Medicaid that are similar to what is in the House bill. There are rumors that the Senate bill would delay the drastic cuts by a few years. But, regardless, when cuts to the program come, they will be devastating.  Whom does Medicaid provide healthcare for? It is not the wealthy. It is elderly people in nursing homes. It is pregnant women. It is children. It is people with disabilities, and it is low-income adults who typically work but don't get health insurance through their jobs.  Medicaid covers one in three Californians; that is 14 million people. It covers one in two children. It covers three out of five residents in nursing homes. It covers one in two people with disabilities.  Here is something the American people need to understand about Medicaid: The majority of Medicaid dollars are spent on elderly people and people with disabilities. They are the most in need, and they have the most serious health issues.  Let me give you one story. A woman by the name of Kristen from Sacramento wrote to us about her daughter Riley, who is autistic. Riley is covered by Medi-It provides critical services that allow her to lead a more normal childhood. Here is what the mother said:       When my daughter Riley was born we quickly learned that she      had difficulty with basic tasks like sleeping and eating.       She developed pneumonia multiple times and was continually      sick.       After turning three, she was diagnosed with autism. Riley      is now eight years old and is thriving thanks to Medicaid-     funded support programs like physical therapy, speech      therapy, and feeding therapy.       She is now verbal, learning to write, and reading above      grade level. She wouldn't be doing this well if it weren't      for I am counting on you to protect  Every community in California depends on Let me give you a few examples.  Members of both political parties go to Los Angeles to raise money. Forty percent of L.County is covered by Do you know how many that is? It is not a half a million. It is not a million. It is not a million and a half. It is not 2 or 3 million. It is 4 million people who could lose Medicaid funding.  Twenty-eight percent of San Diego is covered by Medi-Cal; that is more than 900,000 people. And 37 percent of Sacramento County is covered by Medi-Cal; that is 560,000 people. Half of Fresno County is covered by Medi-Cal; that is one-half million people.  I was in Fresno just a week ago. There is a wonderful children's hospital. The director of that hospital came over to me and was practically in tears. He said: We treat 300,000 children up and down this area of the State, and if we lose our Medicaid, we cannot continue to provide that treatment--if that takes place.  Fresno has 31 assisted living facilities for the sick, for the elderly, and three out of five beds in that facility are Twenty-seven percent of San Francisco County, my home county, is covered by Medi-Cal; that is 230,000 people. What Republicans, we have learned, may likely propose would end the Medicaid program as we have known it for more than 50 years.  Under current law, the Federal Government pays a certain percentage of all healthcare costs for Medi-Cal beneficiaries. We will likely see a phase-out of the current structure of the program that would amount to $834 billion, cut over 10 years, with 14 million people losing Medicaid coverage nationwide.  They will be in your State, Madam They will be in every State on the Republican side of the aisle, and I don't know how a civilized society or a Senate of the United States could do that to people.  The effects of this change could devastate access to healthcare for our most vulnerable citizens and crush State budgets nationwide if they try to replace those funds.  Bottom line, in my State, by 2027, California would need to find $24 billion to cover those who depend on Medicaid for their healthcare today.  What is going to happen with preexisting conditions? We all know that the ObamaCare legislation covers preexisting conditions, so if you have breast cancer, you can get coverage. But you could be charged $28,000 more per year if the preexisting condition of breast cancer isn't covered. It goes on and on like this. If you take away coverage for preexisting conditions and you have, as we have, 52 million people nationwide--including 6 million in California--who have preexisting conditions today, that will be a huge problem for them.  Let me give you one case of a woman from Hesperia, She wrote to us about her 37-year-old son. He has battled Crohn's disease for 28 years. Lisa writes:       My son was without insurance for 10 years because of his      pre-existing condition.  That was before       During this time the disease caused severe damage to his      small intestine. He was finally able to get insurance through      Covered California and received treatment.  That was after ObamaCare passed.       He had surgery to remove various blockages and scar tissue      and probably saved his life. I am so scared that his coverage      may be taken away.  How can we do that?  Sherry, from Sierra Madre, CA, wrote to me about her two sons. They both have preexisting conditions. She says:       As a single mother of two young men just out of college,      each with pre-existing conditions, I fear they will not be      able to afford health care under the GOP plan.       One son has Lyme disease and requires infusions every three      weeks.       This is a huge expense that is currently manageable under      my health care plan and has been a life-saver for him as the      Lyme impacted his immune system.       Under TrumpCare this treatment would probably not be      financially available for him. That would be devastating for      him.  Let me tell you about something we have found out about. I look at my phone calls, and we get a lot of calls. I know something is serious when we get more than 100,000 calls, and we did on this subject. These were largely people between the ages of 50 and 64, and they weren't in the group market. They were in the individual market, which means you go out to find your own insurance company and you pay the premium.  Under ObamaCare, there is a subsidy for these premiums if you earn under 400 percent of poverty; 400 percent of poverty is about $47,000 a year. If you earn under $47,000 a year, it is much easier to get healthcare. If you are at $50,000 a year, you exceed the 400 percent of poverty.  I am told by Covered California that the current premium in my city for someone 50 to 64 would be $800 a month. That is 20 percent of someone's income--20 percent of an annual income.  This is where the complaints are coming throughout the United States, and this is where we can make an easy fix. A number of us have submitted legislation to do just that. What it would do is take the subsidy, and instead of going off the cliff at $47,000 a year--so[[Page S3573]]that at $50,000 your premium costs 20 percent of your income--we changed it so that an individual would not pay more than 9.69 percent of their income toward the premium.  This is one example of how we could improve current law and, I believe, take away one of the biggest criticisms and fix it rather easily.  Here is another problem. I wish to share a story from Monica of Oceanside, These are real cases. She was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after gaining coverage through California's individual market. Her doctor told her she would have been dead, had she not been covered by her new plan. She had cared for her father 10 years prior to his death from Parkinson's disease. She didn't have access to employer-provided insurance and wasn't eligible for Medicaid at the time.  By the time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, she qualified for a plan through Covered She wrote: ``Without the ACA, I would not be alive to write this post.''  I wonder if that means anything to anyone on the Republican side of the aisle. No one comes forward; no one says what they would need. This is such a big issue. It affects every single one of us and every single one of our constituents.  Let me correct something. They also say: Well, ObamaCare is dead; it is imploding.  They say this to build support for repealing the law, but they are wrong. In California, which has worked hard to implement the law effectively, the marketplace to buy health coverage functions at a high level.  There are 1.5 million people signed up through the website Covered Enrollments have been stable, and there has been no uptick in healthy people leaving the insurance market.  The general consensus among experts is that the Federal healthcare market is not collapsing. Standard & Poor's said that ``2016 results and the market enrollment so far in 2017 show that the ACA individual market is not in a `death spiral.' '' So, please, stop saying that.  In closing, I would like to just say to my Republican colleagues: Don't do this. Don't write a bill in secret. Don't take healthcare away from millions of people to cut taxes for the rich. Don't undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions. Don't allow insurers to go back to the days of selling junk plans. Don't end We have known it for so long. It is working. It is covering poor and elderly all across this country.  Those of us on this side of the aisle want to make the Affordable Care Act better. We want to work to improve our system. We stand ready to work together on behalf of our constituents, but if our colleagues continue down this path, we will fight this bill with all we have. The stakes are too high not to.  Thank you. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-19-pt1-PgS3570-3.txt,1332,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,19.0,July

6131,topic-id,2033,"Madam Speaker, last week, as we are all too aware, a gunman opened fire on Members of Congress and staff assistants as they were practicing for the annual bipartisan baseball game to raise money for a Washington-based charity. Among those who were injured is my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Steve Scalise, the House majority whip.  As news of this event came in right before our weekly Nebraska breakfast, a 74-year tradition--by the way, a bipartisan tradition in which the entire Nebraska delegation gets together on a weekly basis and invites anyone from our home State to gather with us. As that was about to occur, I heard the news of the shootings. I felt bewildered, shocked, and numb.  As further reports came in from my colleagues throughout the morning, I heard that Steve was playing second base at the time of his shooting. He crawled from the infield, leaving a trail of blood.  Mr.Speaker, this isn't a movie. These are not distant figures. These are our friends and our colleagues, people who work right here in this institution. Representative Scalise and I frequently interact on the nuances of policy, and sometimes differences of policy. No matter what our disagreements--and believe me, there are hard differences even on one side of the political aisle. No matter what the differences might be, Steve always has worked with me in a cordial, professional, constructive, and, perhaps most importantly, gentlemanly manner. That is just who he is. So regardless of what anyone may think of his policies, of his political point of view, Congress, or the GOP, he did not deserve to be shot.  As noted by Senator Rand Paul, who was also at the practice, were it not for the courageous Capitol Hill Police officers who accompanied Representative Scalise to events, this would have been a massacre. Were it not for the first responders from the Alexandria Police Department and Fire and Rescue, many of those injured, for them it could have been much, much worse.  My heart goes out to Steve Scalise and the others who were injured in this tragic event.  However, my words cannot stop here. For years now, across multiple administrations and across party lines, we have seen accelerating political rancor in our country that goes way beyond normal partisan politics. It is hard to get your mind around some of the stuff that people write. It is awful. It goes beyond just pointed language. It is now so frequent, so violent, and so directly threatening that security personnel are working overtime to keep up with it.  Madam Speaker, you know this. Many good men and women of differing political perspectives work in the United States These are people who have accomplished important things in their own home communities and decided that their heart was calling them to serve in a broader capacity.                              {time}  1800  I fully recognize that Washington, D.C., can seem elitist and aloof, but as you know, Madam Speaker, Members of Congress are real people, with real families, from real places across our land. Sure, there may be a disproportionate share of lawyers in the institution, but there are also nurses, social workers, doctors, teachers, and small-business owners.  In fact, one of the doctors, Representative Brad Wenstrup, a friend of mine, happened to be at the baseball practice. He is an Iraq veteran and surgeon. He attended to Steve Scalise's gunshot wound, thankfully.  Above all, all of these persons are Nevertheless, there is a limit to what the human person, even a paid public servant, can absorb. We can take the violent words, but when it spills into violent action, it is too much. This country cannot continue to rip itself apart like this.  Madam Speaker, there is one additional difficulty here that needs to be unpacked. There is a real risk and vulnerability in what I call regularizing this response, in making it like a ``new normal.''  In fact, within only a few hours of the shootings, certain national media had begun to routinize the tragedy, as they returned to obsessing on the latest crisis du jour in Washington, as if nothing fundamentally destructive to all that we hold dear as Americans had just occurred. And why not? As the media tells us, the assassin was a ``troubled man,'' a ``lone wolf,'' with a ``history of violence'' and ``easy access to guns,'' who was likely ``mentally ill.'' Nothing unique to see here.  Madam Speaker, these were not our thoughts after the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan or the shooting of Democratic Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords of When President Kennedy was shot, I am told, it was as if the entire world came to a halt.  If we are now going to move beyond words and normalize the violent targeting of people just because they[[Page H5042]]choose public service, hold views that are different from our own, or speak in a style that is not to our liking, there is no country.  I find it particularly jarring that the widely praised theatrical assassination of President Trump at a rendition of Julius Caesar in New York City's Central Park--underwritten, by the way, by The New York Times--continues to go on.  Madam Speaker, violence is violence. When it is here and it is political, of course, it is particularly jarring.  Tragically, we also may be growing used to the idea of terror abroad. Although its root causes are different than those of domestic political attacks here on our own shores, the same thing is at stake: the very principles of civilization itself.  Madam Speaker, let me digress for a moment, because this is particularly notable.  After 9/11, crime all but vanished from the streets of New York In other words, the shock and the horror caused a community to rally together above any social discord in a spirit of true unity. We glimpsed that same spirit of solidarity as a nation when Obama bin Laden was finally confronted.  Just recently, a day after the terror attacks that rocked London a few weeks ago, Richard Angell, a patron in a restaurant that had been evacuated during the jihadist rampage, calmly returned to pay his bill. In explaining his generosity, Angell told a reporter, ``These people shouldn't win.''  The night before, several bartenders had risked their lives to defend patrons in that particular establishment with bottles, chairs, tables, anything they could find, as the terrorists tried to hack away their customers with large knives. More lives would have been lost were it not for their bravery.  Only a few weeks before that, at a concert attended mostly by young girls, a homeless man, Stephen Jones, who slept most nights near the stadium, helped several victims of that bombing to safety, even pulling nails from the faces of young children.  The resolve and courage in the face of barbaric violence harkens back to the passengers of United Flight 93 who sacrificed their own lives on 9/11 in order to take down a plane headed straight for Washington, D.C., probably for the White  While we appropriately recognize those who act with courage, the constant repetition of these scenes appear to be resulting, sadly, in what I call ``terror fatigue.'' We go about the same tired ritual: the requisite shock and horror; the 24-hour media coverage of victims, heroes, and families; and the inevitable autopsy of what went wrong. By this exercise, I am afraid we further enable what Hannah Arendt once famously wrote, ``the banality of evil.''  Against this backdrop, I think it is important and useful to pull back and contemplate the fundamental error in our analysis and approach. In the West, we have a blind spot. We want to believe that if we can only understand how a disordered person was raised, how his parents treated him, if he was an orphan or poor or misunderstood or abandoned or a victim of some real or imagined prejudice, then we can understand what makes him kill. Armed with this soft understanding, perhaps we can prevent further tragedy by ameliorating the conditions that we think gave rise to barbaric deeds.  In many discussions of unpredictable and random attacks on bystanders in Europe and America, we find a perverse unwillingness to accurately identify the true motivations of the perpetrators, lest we close the space to ``cure them'' of their zealotry.  In the current, highly polarized, oversensitized, and extremely volatile climate, it is risky to call a thing for what it is. Instead, again and again, we hear that these were just a few misguided individuals--another mental health problem, another aberration, another police problem; nothing to do with dark theology to notice here. Carry on. We must just accept this as a new normal.  What makes these particular vicious actors different? In a study, the Gallup organization basically finds that most people in the world want similar things. Most people in the world want a good job: to be able to take care of themselves; to be able to take care of their family; to be able to use the creative talents of their personhood, whether it be their intellect or their hands to make things for the benefit of others and, in turn, receive an income that they can support themselves with.  However, as one of my Muslim friends has noted, Petro-Islam has enabled and unleashed a narrow sect of men and women who often want for nothing. Several of the terrorists on9/11 were young men of both wealth and privilege, with world-class educations. They weren't motivated by the allures of Western secular materialism. They used those values to hide in plain sight. Rather, they were in the grip of a dark, violent theology. They were willing to die for its inherent irrationality.  This cannot continue. Even the Saudis, who have lived for too long with the hyper hypocrisy of buying off Wahhabists while shopping in Paris, recognize this is an unsustainable trend.  Madam Speaker, when I was in college, I remember the day when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was assassinated. It was a hard day for me. Shortly before, I had lived in that country on an exchange program. I received the bountiful gift of hospitality and an invaluable source of deep and reach cultural understanding.  Sadat died. Sadat gave his life because he made a reasoned choice to reach across the divide to find peace. In another courageous move, just a few years ago, in a little-known speech, the current Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, said: ``Is it possible that 1.6 billion Muslims should want to kill the rest of the world's inhabitants--that is, 7 billion--so that they themselves may live? Impossible.''  Quite a courageous statement.  At this moment, Madam Speaker, we are on the verge of wiping out ISIS militarily. But it is only the latest brand. We will only fully resolve the thinking that leads to the embrace of dark theology through a rebirth in reason, modeled through courageous leadership.  As we see in our battle against ISIS, when you call for evil to happen on social media, in Main Street media and in art, eventually someone in the real world takes it to heart. We must stop creating the rhetorical conditions and the media cover for this politically motivated violence or the grotesque twisting of mediums to encourage terror. There is no rationalization that can justify it. This is not about freedom of speech. It is about freedom from violence.  Ask yourself a question: Where would you like to live?

I am very grateful to my colleague Senator Kaine for his leadership on the HELP Committee and what he brings as a former mayor and  I rise today to join my colleague from New Hampshire in supporting her efforts to help lower healthcare premiums for middle-class Americans and to stabilize the insurance marketplace.  The Trump administration has been working to sabotage the individual market by playing games with cost-sharing reductions. Those cost-sharing reductions help lower out-of-pocket expenses, such as deductibles and copays, for individuals with health insurance plans in the marketplace. This legislation from Senator Shaheen is a commonsense measure that would work to prevent the instability and chaos being pushed by the administration.  I also join my colleagues in making clear that we are ready and willing to work across the aisle on priorities that will improve and build on the Affordable Care Act and bring down costs for people in New Hampshire and across the country.  Over the course of the last several months, we have seen that the partisan process Republican leadership has pushed with TrumpCare simply won't work. It is going to take a bipartisan approach in order to make progress, not a senseless repeal bill that would pull the rug out from millions of  I have seen firsthand that it is possible for Democrats and Republicans to come together in order to improve our healthcare system.

But Elizabeth is now in recovery, and she works at the SOS Recovery Community Organization in Rochester, helping others get the support they need. She said she owes her recovery to the insurance she has received through the Medicaid expansion and the Affordable Care  Elizabeth's story is a great example of the power of what is possible when we come together on bipartisan solutions to help improve the health of our people. This is the same approach we need to take in the Senate, and I believe there are areas for bipartisan cooperation that we should be working on in order to improve the Affordable Care Act.[[Page S4036]]  In addition to Senator Shaheen's legislation to stabilize the individual market and in addition to the legislation we have heard discussed by Senator Kaine and Senator Carper, there are other things we can do.  I believe it is critical that we take on Big Pharma and bring down the cost of prescription drug prices, including allowing importing safe and affordable drugs and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and I believe we should eliminate the existing income cliff in the Affordable Care Act which blocks many middle-class individuals from receiving premium assistance.  These are commonsense measures we should be taking now. People across our Nation have made clear, they don't want Congress to do a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act because it would have devastating impacts for them and their families.  I urge my colleagues to put the partisan gamesmanship aside. I join Senator Kaine, as a member of the HELP Committee, in asking for a hearing at the very committee which is supposed to set healthcare policy in this body so we can listen to the voices of constituents, of providers, of other stakeholders.

6140,topic-id,2284,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.Cole), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017. As you know, this $1 trillion omnibus will provide discretionary funding for most of the Federal Government for the remaining 5 months of fiscal year 2017.  Before moving to the specifics of the legislation, we need to get a few things straight. It bears repeating that the appropriations measures contained in this bill should have been passed months ago. While I am glad that we have arrived at this compromise, and the words of my good friend from Oklahoma, I certainly support with regard to the extraordinary work of the chairman and the ranking member, and their respective staffs, as well as all the appropriators, generally, and their staffs, they have done a good job with reference to the measure, as far as compromise is concerned.  But the fact remains that the bill is 7 months late. The House Committee on Appropriations is already hard at work for fiscal year 2018, and yet this body is still trying to fund programs for the current fiscal year. The root cause of this disarray does not lie with the Appropriations Committee but with the majority's leadership, or lack thereof, in this Congress and in the White                              {time}  1245  I also need to level another critique at my friends across the aisle who have time and again brought us to the brink of a government shutdown. We needed months of negotiations and three continuing resolutions to keep the government funded. Much of the time, poison pill riders gummed up the works. Among other things, the majority continuously tries to strip funding from women's healthcare organizations, slash environmental protections, and end protections for Federal employees through the appropriations process.  Well, here we are, Mr.Speaker, 7 months later, with a bill that does none of these things. Yet we do it again and again, lurching from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis. I said yesterday or the day before in the Rules Committee that we will be back here with a stopgap measure and repeat this same crisis routine that we have done for many of the years that I have had the privilege of serving in this body. Mr.Speaker, maybe next time we will skip the grandstanding and start off with a commonsense measure from the get-go.  This brings me to the bill itself. The measure includes $1.07 trillion in base discretionary budget authority, including $551 billion in base defense spending, $518.5 billion in base nondefense spending, $62.1 billion in overseas contingency operations defense spending, and $16.5 billion in overseas contingency operations nondefense spending. More than 160 partisan toxic riders were floated but kept out of the legislation.  Despite Donald John Trump's insistence on draconian cuts, the omnibus includes $1.2 billion in additional nondefense budget authority. It provides funding to alleviate Puerto Rico's emergency budget shortfall and their underfunded Medicaid program. It increases funding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion. It provides $1.1 billion in disaster assistance for regions affected by storms and flooding in 2015 and 2016, and it includes $900 million in humanitarian assistance to alleviate international famine.  Toward that end, with reference to famine in the world, we are witnessing a rising number of countries that are experiencing famine. Without identifying them all, it is estimated that some 20 million people in the world are at risk of dying from starvation. In this country, too many people are in a position of being hungry during the course of a day. In the land of plenty, we can do better.  In this vein, I was pleased to see the inclusion of language that will positively impact the district that I serve and every other district that faces the threat of natural disasters. Toward that end, my good friend from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. In the compromise measure, there are some things that will impact all of our districts, and that is, in my judgment, as it should be.  Additionally, I am one of few Members around here who continuously argues that Members should have earmark responsibilities so that they can be held accountable for things that are vital in their districts rather than allowing the bureaucracy to dominate that sphere.  The language clarifies a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, codifying the Department of Labor's views on lifting the work restrictions on insurance claims adjusters responding to disasters. When a natural disaster strikes, like a hurricane or a wildfire, insurance adjusters are there to help those affected piece their lives back together and get back on their feet. By ensuring that adjusters can quickly and readily respond to disasters, this codification helps them complete their important work.  I did say in the Rules Committee, and I have said for 20 years here, that this Congress needs a disaster relief committee that is constituted of all of the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction. It is not complicated. It is something that is done in other countries so that when these disasters occur--be they fire, flood, hurricane, tornado, or any disaster--we can respond more quickly than we do now, rather than allowing for the residual remains of the kinds of disasters that we experience in this country.  Just this past weekend, at least 16 lives were lost and many people were injured in tornadic activity in the States of Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas and floods in Missouri, and we need to respond to those.  Additionally, something else that I want to say that I consider to be important are the responsibilities of While I believe they do an extraordinary job with what they are allowed to work with, I don't know what it takes to get across to people that FEMA can only react when there are a certain number of people that have lost their homes. Please know this: when 1 person loses their home to a natural disaster, it is just as important as if 1,000 or 100,000 lost their home; and we,[[Page H3082]]this Congress, need to be able to respond to that 1 the same way we do to 1,000.  Furthermore, I was glad to see that the bill includes year-round Pell grants to provide 1 million students in this country with an additional average award of $1,650, and it permanently extends health insurance benefits for retired mineworkers.  I might add that that has been and will continue to be a bipartisan effort to provide for the health of those mineworkers. Hopefully, in spite of all the talk coming out of the White House, we may, one day, find a way to help those that have lost their jobs because of the industrial changes transition to good jobs.  But what is included in this bill is just as important as what is not. In his first major budget negotiation, Donald John Trump made many demands that were defeated. He requested $30 billion in additional defense spending and $3 billion to fund construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and is around crowing that there is money in this bill to do something about the wall, and there is not.  The President wanted policy riders to restrict sanctuary cities from receiving Federal grants. He wanted to defund Planned Parenthood and undermine health care. As I have already said, there were 160 riders that were floated here in this measure but are not included.  Rather than governing responsibly, Donald John Trump and the House Freedom Caucus have spent a good deal of time and energy pushing partisan interests, from repealing health care to gutting the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and successful programs like community development block grants. All of these programs are fully funded in this measure.  As the President gets cozy with authoritarian strongmen around the world and revisits the history of the Civil War--and for your information, Donald Trump, it was slavery that caused the war--Congress has stepped up and asserted itself, and I am glad.  I have said repeatedly that the legislative branch has given too much authority not to this President but to the one before him, the one before him, and the one before that one. We have continuously ceded our authority. So it is understood by virtue of this action and, I hope, future action that the legislature is an equal branch of our government, and we need to act like it.  Funding the government is one of the most important responsibilities Congress has. There are, undeniably, differences in policy priorities between Members in this body, Democrats and Republicans, and differences between Democrats and differences between Republicans in this body, but holding the Federal budget hostage is not the way to work through these problems. This measure is a responsible compromise that serves the interests of the American public, and that is what we came here to do.  My good friend from Oklahoma, last night in the Rules Committee, said that the people that win in this measure are the American people, and I agree with him. That is why I was even dismayed and, quite frankly, disturbed at the irresponsible comment that Donald John Trump tweeted yesterday morning that what this country needs is ``a good shutdown'' in  I made it a point, when we were in the Rules Committee, to ask the fine young gentleman that works with me to learn the context because I just can't believe that this man comes out and says that this institution needs to have ``a good shutdown.''  Donald John Trump, there is no such thing as a good shutdown.  The President champions a government shutdown not only to his but to his party's peril. The hardworking and working poor Americans are at peril with that kind of undertaking. He does so to the peril of our men and women fighting overseas, to the peril of working families and their health care, to education, and to safe, clean, and secure communities.  Donald John Trump may think he can run the country on Twitter while daydreaming of taxpayer-funded jaunts to his private golf club, but he needs to wise up. We don't need a good shutdown. We need a good leader. If he continues and isn't prepared to get serious, then he needs to get out of the way.  As my colleague Congressman McGovern said yesterday, rather than a shutdown, the President ought to shut his mouth. I will put it another way from the vernacular: zip his lip, put that Twitter off somewhere on the side and let birds tweet while he talks sensibly to the American people.  Maybe the President thinks that if the government shuts down people suddenly don't need to pay taxes and that national parks become free. Maybe he thinks that if the government shuts down--if we have a good government shutdown--every regulation suddenly stops and corporations are free to run wild without complying to clean water or clean air standards.  I don't know what he is thinking. I don't think anybody else around here knows what he is thinking. I am not even certain he knows what he is thinking. And to be honest, I would be afraid to see what is going on in his head.  But here is what I do know. According to the financial ratings agency Standard & Poor's, the 2013 government shutdown cost the United States--the American people--$24 billion. According to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers, it sidetracked the creation of as many as 120,000 jobs.  I hope you are listening, Donald John Trump, because these aren't alternative facts.  The furloughs amounted to more than 5.5 million days' worth of Federal employment lost spread across dozens of agencies. Businesses that relied on tourism lost out on more than a half-billion dollars. The Small Business Administration couldn't process some 700 applications for $140 million in small businesses loans.                              {time}  1300  According to the U.Travel Association, the 16-day shutdown cost $152 million per day in lost travel spending. According to CNBC, 2 weeks into the latest shutdown, the Internal Revenue Service reported a backlog of 1.2 million verification requests that could not be processed.  Mr.Speaker, we don't need a good government shutdown. We don't need a shutdown at all. We just got through a 7-month negotiation to keep the government open.  Naturally, the media picked up on the fact that Donald John Trump got virtually none of his priorities. When the report started to air, he threw a political temper tantrum and took to Twitter to undermine the compromise.  I will be honest at this point: it is nothing new, so it shouldn't surprise anyone; nor should the backlash that ensued or his sudden change of heart. In just a few hours, Donald John Trump went from condemning the deal and whining about the rules of the Senate to hailing it as a great compromise. I must have missed that chapter in his ``The Art of the Deal.''  So let's leave it at this: we need to do more, not less, to strengthen our communities and help working families. I urge President Donald John Trump to move past the campaign rhetoric and get serious.  I hope you are listening, sir, because you can put that in a tweet.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.

6166,topic-id,1418,"Mr.President, I speak today to bid farewell to Kimberly Kim has worked for the Senate Finance Committee as the chief oversight counsel for more than 6 years. Kim came to the Finance Committee after years of public service, and she leaves it to again answer the call to public service. While we are sorry to see her leave, I want to take a minute to note the important contributions she has made while on the Finance  She has coordinated oversight on virtually every conceivable topic within the ambit of the committee's jurisdiction. That work has included IRS, Medicaid and Medicare, Social Security, and trade compliance oversight.  While her work has been both bipartisan and exceptional, Kim is probably equally known to everyone here as the thoughtful baker.  Always cognizant of the little things, Kim made it her life's mission in the Senate to ensure every staffer and Senator had a cookie in their hand when they needed it most. Her mantra that there are only a few things in life a good cookie can't improve has spread like fresh flowers in a spring garden.  It is no wonder the first comment most of my staffers have made is ``who will make us cookies?'' after hearing that Kim is leaving. The most unfortunate thing, however, is that I am not sure there is anyone who can fill those shoes. Kim's cookies are perhaps the best I have ever had during my tenure in the Only my wife's lemon bars can compare, and I feel compelled to say that just to ensure I don't end up on the couch tonight.  I mean, my goodness, just talking about Kim's cookies is making me hungry. You just can't beat her peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies.  While Kim's attention to these little things have brought her considerable fame while she has worked here, there is little doubt in my mind that Kim's legacy extends far beyond her cuisine.  As just one example, Kim worked tirelessly through one of the largest investigations of the IRS that we have seen in recent memory. Kim's leadership ensured that our committee's analysis was both grounded in fact and integrity, and though it took several dozen months to complete, I don't believe there is anyone in this body that would dispute that report's precision, thoughtfulness, and earnestness.  She also has become known as the person who tackles complicated issues involving the Medicare and Medicaid Programs and develops creative, thoughtful policy solutions. That has been evident in her recent work on Medicaid over the past year and in her efforts to come up with solutions to the Medicare audit and appeals backlog, as well as the complicated and burdensome Stark rule. In each of these instances, Kim has engaged the impacted stakeholders and the relevant policy folks and come up with legislative ideas that are bipartisan. This is no small task.  It is this type of work ethic and reputable end product that makes Kim the type of person you hate to see leave, but you quietly rejoice that they are going to be the one helping steer the ship in the administration.  Truly, Kim's appointment as Principal Deputy Administrator for Operations at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, reflects this administration's desire to have quality individuals helping lead an agency facing daunting challenges. I don't think anyone would contend with the need for strong and informed leadership there. I can think of no one better suited for the position. I would like to take a few minutes to briefly reflect on Kim's experience to explain why I believe that to be true.  Before Kim came to the Finance Committee, she worked as senior counsel at Alston & Bird here in Washington, DC, advising clients on healthcare compliance and fraud and abuse issues. Prior to her work at Alston & Bird, Kim served 7 years as the director of the Medicare Program Integrity Group at For 5 years before that, Kim worked at the HHS Office of Inspector General as special counsel and director of external affairs and as a senior counsel negotiating False Claims Act settlements and drafting and monitoring corporate integrity agreements.  Just that work experience, in two administrations and a respected law firm, should be enough to qualify Kim for this important role, but I am not done. Kim also worked on authoring OIG's compliance guidance for individual and small group physician practices.  She received her J.with a concentration in health law from the[[Page S4135]]DePaul School of Law, an M.in legislative affairs and health policy from George Washington University, and her B.from Valparaiso  Kim has long been recognized nationally as an expert in healthcare compliance and fraud and abuse issues, but in 2016, that recognition culminated in her receiving the Healthcare Compliance and Ethics Professional of the Year award from the Society for Corporate Compliance and Ethics and the Health Care Compliance  While I am sure to speak for all of my staff and fellow Senators when I say that we will miss Kim, I think I can also say, with confidence, that we have the greatest faith in Yes, we will probably have strikes due to the absence of Kim's baked goods, and yes, our oversight and Medicaid efforts will not be the same without Kim, but this is important work we are all engaged in, and it would be wrong to bar our great country from the service of this wonderful and highly talented friend of mine.  Before I conclude, though, I would like to harken back to one of my favorite stories about  It was in the wake of the Lois Lerner debacle. Kim and her team spent more than a dozen months hashing out a highly detailed and important investigation that revealed quite a bit more than what we were initially expecting. In the end, Kim and her team interviewed more than 32 current and former IRS and Treasury employees and reviewed nearly 1.5 million pages of documents. The fruit of their labor was a staggering and included a four-part treatise on the IRS's processing of 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) applications for tax-exempt status. There were thousands of pages of appendices and hundreds of pages of report text.  Before the report was finalized, however, I wanted to be sure I had read every word. Aside from the hefty amount of reading, it also created problems because the text included confidential taxpayer information and only those with clearance could enter my office while I reviewed the text. Kim's humor, wit, and zealous optimism kept me alert and motivated throughout the investigation of those hundreds of pages, and while I have always cherished Kim's famous cookies, they never tasted better than they did then.  Now, I had always appreciated Kim, but in this instance, her commitment to detail and integrity really struck me. To ensure that the product coming out of the committee was a complete and accurate one, she went back to the IRS to confirm that the committee had all relevant documents. Only then did we discover the thousands of pages of missing emails which would become a critical part of the investigation. If it weren't for Kim's hard work and intellectual rigor, we would have never discovered this fact, and throughout the investigation, which was often heated and impassioned on both sides of the aisle, Kim was fair, honest, and worked hard to keep the inquiry bipartisan, something no other committee in Congress could do.  This and many other incredible memories of Kim will be with me forever, and words can't quite say how truly grateful I am to have Kim help me make all those memories these past several years.  Our work in the Nation's Capital can get ugly sometimes. It can be partisan. We often wonder whether we can still get good people to go into public service, but then we are reminded that there are good people in this town who repeatedly answer the call to public service. Kim Brandt is one of these--and she is one of the best. The Finance Committee, the Senate, CMS, and, in honesty, the United States of America is lucky to have her in these roles, and we thank her for her hard work.  I am going to miss you,  I want to wish Kim, her beloved pup Sherlock, and her family all of the best. I feel no need to hesitate when I say that we are all proud of you and will miss you dearly.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-24-pt1-PgS4134.txt,1351,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,24.0,June
6338,topic-id,1374,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the epidemic of suicide--a growing crisis that has devastated millions of families across our Over the past 8 years, the rate of deaths by suicide in our country has tripled. Let me repeat that. It has tripled, and the problem is particularly severe among young adults.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, for youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is now the third leading cause of death. In other words, more of America's youth die each year from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined.  This crisis shows no signs of abating. Consider that each day in our Nation, there are an average of over 5,400 suicide attempts by young people in grades 7 to 12. In my home State of Utah, the statistics are particularly alarming. Every 14 hours, a Utahn commits suicide, resulting in an average of 630 deaths each year. The problem is so acute that Utah now has the fifth highest suicide rate in the This troubling trend is particularly pronounced among Utah's youth. Even though Utahns from ages 10 to 17 comprise only 13 percent of the State population, they represent nearly 23 percent of all suicide attempts. Suicide is now the leading cause of death among Utah's teenagers.  To stem the tide of teenage suicide in Utah, I convened a roundtable discussion in Salt Lake City last December that included community leaders, healthcare professionals, high school principals, and parents from across the There we discussed proven methods that destigmatize mental illness, a critical first step in addressing the suicide crisis. We also discussed the links between bullying and depression.  In an effort to prevent teen suicide, the effect of bullying cannot be overlooked. A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that kids who are bullied are more than twice as likely to consider suicide. In my home State of Utah, dozens of community leaders have drawn attention to the pernicious effects of bullying. The foremost among them is Greg Hudnall, a nationally recognized expert in suicide prevention. Hudnall found that between 8 and 12 percent of all suicides are committed by young people who have been bullied. To discourage bullying and to help our teenagers who are suffering most, Hudnall led in the development of HOPE4UTAH is a dynamic peer-to-peer program designed to empower students in groups called Hope Hope Squads identify warning signs of depression in teenagers and offer help to those in need.  Wendy Nelson, principal of Utah's Syracuse High School, recently told me how Hope Squads have helped students at risk of suicide to connect with therapists that the school has made available on a regular basis. The high school has since partnered with a local community health center for help in addressing the need for help in this particular area and, of course, the need for mental health professionals in schools. This shortage of mental health counselors is a serious problem, not only in Utah but in schools across the It is a very, very serious problem.  In our December roundtable discussion, we learned that teen suicide is something schools, parents, and mental health professionals cannot address individually. Instead, a continuum of care must exist for each child from the first day of school to graduation. We must all work together to ensure that our children feel safe.  Educators play a vital role in maintaining an infrastructure of support for teenagers struggling with mental illness. Because educators are often the first to identify warning signs in vulnerable students, hundreds of teachers in Utah receive training in how to identify and respond to these signs. Once we know a teen is suffering, parents and mental health professionals can step in to provide ongoing care. Building community partnerships that involve everyone and that focus on evidence-based practices can save hundreds, if not thousands, of lives.  My main purpose in organizing the roundtable discussion was to find ways I could help prevent suicide on a national level. Increasing access to mental healthcare has been a fixture of my Senate service. Nearly 20 years ago, I convened the Senate Finance Committee's first hearing dedicated to mental health. More recently, I focused my legislative efforts on fighting prescription drug abuse, an epidemic that has only accelerated our Nation's mental health crisis. I played a leading role in passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and helped to draft the 21st Century Cures Act, which President Obama signed into law in Both bills take aim at the opioid epidemic that is ravaging entire communities across the  As a legislative body, we have set aside partisan differences in recent months to combat the opioid crisis as part of a broader effort to address growing rates of mental illness and death by suicide.  But there is more we can do to help. To begin, we need to provide better and more immediate access to counseling and mental health services. This is one of the main takeaways from last year's roundtable discussion. So often we hear that those seeking help are just one positive interaction away from giving life another chance. As Utah State Senator Daniel Thatcher said:       If you talk to someone, they live. If you connect them to      support, they live.  Laura Warburton, a Utah mother who lost her daughter to suicide, said that the day her daughter died, she had attempted to make one last call to her therapist and could not get through.  While this is a complex problem with no simple, immediate answer, there are steps we can take to help. Today, we are taking those critical first steps to prevent future tragedies from taking place.  In response to what I learned during the suicide roundtable in Utah, I have joined Senator Joe Donnelly in introducing the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act, a bipartisan proposal that will make it easier for Americans of all ages to get the help and treatment they need when they are experiencing suicidal thoughts. The current suicide prevention lifeline system and veterans crisis line are in desperate need of reform. Our bill will require the Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to study the current national suicide hotline system and make recommendations to Congress on how we can improve it.  Across our great Nation, there are millions of people, especially young people, who are alone and suffering in the shadows of depression. Many of them are bombarded by suicidal thoughts and have no idea where to turn for help. To make matters worse, the national suicide hotline number, 1-800-273-TALK, is not an intuitive or easy number to remember, particularly for those experiencing a mental health emergency.  Fortunately, the success of the 911 emergency system provides a model for addressing this problem. My bill will require the Federal Communications Commission to recommend an easy-to-remember, three-digit number for the national suicide prevention hotline. I believe that by making the national suicide prevention lifeline system more user-friendly and accessible, we can save thousands of lives by helping people find the help they need when they need it most.  In introducing this legislation, I wish to thank my fellow Utahn, Congressman Chris Congressman Stewart has been an invaluable partner in offering some of the most important measures of this bill. Additionally, I would like to thank the American Foundation for Suicide I also wish to express my appreciation for the support we have received from the Utah State Legislature, Utah's attorney general, and the Utah Department of Health Services, as well as several groups from the law enforcement community.  This proposal transcends party lines and stands to save thousands of lives.[[Page S2724]]We cannot delay this effort to prevent suicide. So I call on my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to act quickly to pass this bill. Your support for this legislation represents your commitment to preventing future tragedies. I ask all of you today, regardless of your party affiliation, to cosponsor this legislation. In doing so, you can help us help those who need our help the most.

6342,topic-id,535,"Mr.President, earlier this month, the Senate passed by voice vote the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. I recognize this bill is the result of a bipartisan compromise, and I commend Senator Tester, ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, for his efforts to find agreement on this particularly challenging issue.  Everyone in a position of public trust, particularly those serving at the VA, must be held accountable for their actions. Whistleblowers must also be protected so that misconduct can be brought to light. This balance between accountability and transparency is essential to ensure that the services provided to the public--particularly to veterans--are of the highest quality and that we can attract the best and brightest to Federal service.  Unfortunately, while the bill passed by Congress seeks to strike the appropriate balance, I remain seriously concerned about some of the bill's provisions which would expedite the process of terminating employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, by reducing current due process protections.  To ensure the integrity of the Federal civil service, it is essential that Federal employees have access to constitutionally protected due process rights. Specifically, the bill lowered the evidentiary standard for firing rank-and-file employees for misconduct from ``preponderance'' of the evidence, 50 percent or more, to substantial, 30 percent or more. Reducing due process protections for rank-and-file VA employees in this manner will make it harder for the Federal Government to attract the best and brightest to public service.  During the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee's consideration of the bill, I cosponsored an amendment offered by Senator Brown to strike the section of the bill lowering the evidentiary standard. Unfortunately, the amendment was not adopted. Going forward, I intend to closely monitor the VA's implementation of the act to see that these new authorities are not abused in order to retaliate against VA workers. Not only would this be unfair, but it would also exacerbate the Department's challenging retention issues.  I am also disappointed that this bill does not address the longstanding recruitment and retention issues facing the According to the VA, there are over 30,000 vacancies across the VA, including over 150 in Hawaii, for frontline medical personnel that this administration has not filled as of the end of January 2017.  The over 40,000 veterans in Hawaii who are enrolled in the VA healthcare system deserve the best healthcare and highest ethical and professional standards from those they depend on to provide that care. While we must ensure whistleblowers can come forward without fear of retaliation and those who violate the pub trust are held accountable, the VA cannot effectively carry out its mission without being fully staffed.  While this legislation was supported by VA Secretary Shulkin and makes some useful changes to improve accountability, we still have much work to do to ensure that veterans in Hawaii and across the country have access to the best healthcare we can provide.  Therefore, going forward, I will closely monitor the VA's implementation of this law to ensure that the changes made are not abused. I will also continue working to see that the staff vacancies in Hawaii and across the country are filled with qualified personnel.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3680-2.txt,1844,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,21.0,May

Major General Richardson has served our Army and our Nation for more than 30 years. She was a true professional--a dedicated soldier, leader, officer, spouse, and mother. Throughout her career, she commanded our great soldiers at many levels, deployed to combat numerous times in defense of our Nation, and was assigned to some of the most critical positions in our military. As the Army's Chief Legislative Liaison, Major General Richardson continues to provide outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on numerous critical issues of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and this  A native of Colorado, Major General Richardson was commissioned a second lieutenant of aviation upon graduation from Metropolitan State College in Her first assignment after flight school was in Korea with the 17th Aviation Brigade, where she served as a platoon leader, company executive officer, brigade staff officer, and company commander.

6306,topic-id,1696,"Mr.President, I also take to the floor to talk about healthcare. I appreciate my colleagues who are here, earnestly pleading with all of our colleagues to be about a process--Democrats and Republicans and the committee process that we have in the Senate--that does the work that we are supposed to be doing, which is listening to the American public and improving our healthcare system.  Let me tell you about my first meeting of the day. It was an amazing one. I had a mom, Rebecca, and her 5-year-old daughter, Charlie, in my office. They had asked for the opportunity to meet with me to talk about healthcare. Here is their story.  Charlie is just about 5 years old. She starts kindergarten in the Charlottesville public schools in She was born at 26 weeks, or about 14 weeks early. She weighed 1 pound and 11 ounces at birth. She went through the NICU and had great care. When she was released to go home, the doctors thought she would be fine, but within a couple of months, it was pretty clear that she had some significant challenges as she has the diagnosis of cerebral palsy, and she gets 80 percent of her food through a feeding tube. This family has many, many needs.  Charlie, from a cognitive standpoint, is very, very sharp and is excited about starting school, but she has significant needs. Her mother Rebecca said that Charlie is like the case study for why a repeal of the ACA would be a disaster. Charlie has a preexisting condition because of the CP and her challenges. Charlie has already hit all of the lifetime caps that would have rendered her unable to get insurance pre- In the hospital, because of her dramatically low birth weight, Charlie was the recipient of Medicaid funds that would be cut under the current bill. Charlie is currently the recipient of a Medicaid waiver, which will help her afford supplies for her feeding tube. When she starts kindergarten in the Charlottesville public schools, Charlie will be given an individualized education plan under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and some of those expenses are being compensated by  The preexisting condition, lifetime caps, and Medicaid cuts all affect this dynamic, young 5-year-old, who is as entitled as any of us to try to be all she can be. If we persist on the path that we are on now with regard to the bill that is being proposed, we will hurt families like these, and we do not need to do that. Instead, we can help them.  Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we know that Americans, like Charlie, who had preexisting conditions faced unfair barriers to accessing health coverage. There are challenges that we need to fix, but let's celebrate a few things. Since 2010, the rate of uninsured Americans has declined to a historic low. More than 20 million people have gained access and have healthcare coverage--many for the first time in their lives. Another statistic that is interesting is that the number of bankruptcies in our Nation has been cut in half. Pre-ACA, medical costs had driven up bankruptcies, but the ACA has brought the bankruptcy rate down. We have to move forward to make healthcare stronger, not to destroy it.  The Republican bill that is being discussed right now, because of its reductions of coverage, slashing Medicaid, and increases to premiums for seniors, would make the matter worse. The proposed amendment by the Senators from Texas and Utah has led insurance companies to come out and say that this will create a two-tiered system that will punish those with preexisting conditions. The latest plan, which was discussed this morning by the majority leader, would just be a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act with a promise that we would fix it in a couple of years. It has been scored by the CBO, and the CBO says that it would cause 32 million Americans to lose their coverage and would dramatically increase premiums. Yet we do need to find improvements, and we should be working on that together.  There have been some actions taken by this administration that have compounded challenges. In January, the President signed an Executive order that directed relevant agencies not to enforce key elements of the Affordable Care They terminated components of outreach and enrollment spending. The administration has also threatened to end cost-sharing reduction payments. These actions and additional inactions have created such uncertainty in the individual marketplace that rates have been unstable, and, in some areas, companies are not writing individual policies. The amendment I discussed earlier, from the Senators from Texas and Utah, would make these problems even worse.  There is a better way. There is a way forward, and I am here to just briefly reference a bill that Senator Carper and I have put on the table that we think will do a good job and should have strong bipartisan support. It is the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement  One of the ways to address uncertainty in the individual market is to establish a permanent reinsurance program that will stabilize premiums and will give insurance companies some stability so that they can stay in markets, but it will also enable those companies to write premiums at an average level and not have to take into account the high-cost claims. We think it could reduce premiums dramatically all over the country.  Now, the idea of reinsurance should not be controversial. We use it in other[[Page S4034]]programs--flood insurance, crop insurance, and Medicare Part A key part of Medicare that was achieved under the Bush administration includes a reinsurance provision. The Affordable Care Act had a reinsurance in its first 3 years, but it expired. That reinsurance helped to maintain stable premiums. This is an idea that is not a Democratic idea. It is an idea that is tested.  Senator Carper and I introduced the bill to the Senators on the Finance I am on the HELP We are just waiting for the opportunity to be able to present it and get a hearing for it. We ought to be able to work together on reinsurance, on the cost-sharing guarantees that Senator Shaheen has proposed, and on a variety of other ideas. Senators Cassidy and Collins have a bill in that uses auto enrollment, which is an interesting concept that we should be tackling.  I am just going to conclude and tell you how naive I am.  I was a mayor and a Governor before I got here to the When you are a mayor and a Governor, what you know is education and healthcare. We have a Governor here and a Governor here and a Governor here. We have four former Governors who are sitting on the floor. What you know is education, which was your biggest line item, and your second biggest line item is Medicaid--healthcare. I tried to get on the committee when I got to the Senate, and I was not put on the committee. I was very disappointed. For 4 years I tried to get on the HELP I got on it on January 3. I was so excited. Finally, I am working on something that I know about.  I got a group together of 13 Democratic Within 48 hours of getting on that committee, on January 5, I wrote a letter to my committee chair, Senator Alexander, a great committee chair, as well as to the Finance chair, Senator Hatch, and to the majority leader, Senator McConnell: If you want to fix healthcare, we are here to sit down with you right now and fix it. I was naive enough to think that, because I was on the HELP Committee, I might be included in a discussion about healthcare. We have had hearings in our committee--many hearings--on nominees, on pensions, on higher ed, on the FDA, but there has been one taboo topic on the HELP Committee since I got on it in We are not allowed to have a hearing about healthcare. We haven't had a hearing about the House bill. We haven't had a hearing about Senate proposals. We are being told that we are not going to have a hearing, that we are just going to rush whatever we do to the floor either on a House proposal, a Senate proposal, or a Senate repeal. We are going to completely skip the committee.  Now, you know a little bit about this committee. We have a doctor on the committee, Senator Cassidy from Our chair of the committee, Senator Alexander, was a He had a Medicaid He was the president of the University of He had a hospital. He had a medical school. He had physician practice groups. There are people on the HELP Committee who know something about healthcare. There are people on the Finance Committee, which covers Medicaid and Medicare, who know something about healthcare, but we have not been allowed to have a hearing about this. When you have a hearing, you bring people up to the witness table, patients like Charlie, who was in my office this morning, and doctors and hospitals. You ask them what works, what doesn't work, and what can be fixed. We haven't had the opportunity to hear from folks.  So why wouldn't we do exactly what Senator McCain said yesterday? Senator McCain said: We have gone about this the wrong way. We should be the U.We should take advantage of the Senate procedures and the expertise on the Senate committees, including staff expertise, and we should assign these various bills to the relevant committees and have hearings and then come forward with a proposal that will actually improve healthcare for this country.  I am completely confident that if we let the committees do the work they are supposed to do, we will find improvements that can get bipartisan support and that will help Virginians and help That doesn't seem too much to ask. I hope my colleagues will consider that, and I hope we will be engaged in those discussions soon.  With that, I yield the floor.

6069,topic-id,265,"Mr.Speaker, as NAFTA renegotiation approaches, I rise to call attention to the mammoth U.trade deficit with our NAFTA nation partners.  Our current deficit with NAFTA nations is $74 billion. This red on the chart translates into tens of thousands of lost U.jobs, all while wages are depressed for North America's struggling workers. Since NAFTA's passage, there hasn't been a single year of trade balance for this country. That translates into lost jobs.  Thus far, President Trump has failed to correct these trade deficits. In fact, the trade deficit this year has ballooned to more than $22 billion from the same period in 2016.  Balanced trade accounts in 5 years should be first on our agenda. My bill, the Balancing Trade Act, H.2766, requires the administration to address trade deficits of more than $10 billion with any nation.  As negotiations near, let's focus on key principles such as vigorously enforcing a first world rule of law; including labor provisions that allow workers across this continent to improve their standard of living and outlaw labor trafficking; enact environmental standards for human health and forge an agricultural labor agreement that helps displaced farmers; reform the unaccountable tribunals called Investor-State Dispute Settlements so that they work for people, not just big corporations; address currency manipulation; and, finally, stamp out the illegal drug trade that is plaguing this continent.

6305,topic-id,1482,"Mr.President, I want to thank Senator Shaheen for her leadership, and I am proud to be one of the cosponsors of her bill with her commonsense approach--which I believe is the one that will rule the day--to work together on changes to the Affordable Care Act that will help the American people.  I join my colleagues on the floor in sharing the concerns I have heard from so many people in my State and across the country about the bill that has been introduced by our colleagues. I also heard their desire to have us work together to bring down the costs of healthcare and to make fixes to the Affordable Care  Healthcare leaders in my State have come out strongly against the bill released last week because it would be devastating to the people of our State, especially in our rural areas--rural hospitals--and especially to our seniors who rely on Medicaid funding for nursing homes and assisted living.  Last night we heard that we will not be proceeding to that bill, and, instead, the majority leader wants to bring up repealing big parts of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. I just want to remind my colleagues that the Congressional Budget Office has already looked at this repeal without a replacement, and it is just as bad. Instead of 22 million people losing their insurance by 2026, the CBO has estimated that about 32 million would lose insurance under the repeal approach, and premiums would double. So this repeal effort doesn't help the host of Minnesotans who, according to the Minnesota Medical Association, would be harmed by what they call draconian Medicaid cuts.  It doesn't help our children's hospitals. I met with several last week, and they were very concerned that Medicaid cuts would wreck their ability to provide healthcare to our kids. This was something, by the way, that I heard repeatedly on the Fourth of During the parades, people would come out of the blue, out from the sides of the streets, mixed in with the hot dogs and American flags, and there were these families--predominantly families with kids with disabilities--and they would bring children over to meet me and would say how important this Medicaid funding is for their entire family. I remember that once, when the mom brought her child over with Down syndrome, all of the people on the parade route, on that block, cheered for that family.  We know that we are all in this together, and we know that what happens to one family could, next year, happen to another family. You can have a child with a disability. You can suddenly have a disease that could be debilitating to your family's finances. Basically, we never know what is going to happen to our health or to the health of our family members. That is why we have health insurance, and we must make sure that it is affordable.  In addition to that, we have had the CEOs of our healthcare system stand up and say that these approaches would lead to major job losses in our As I mentioned before, for seniors, AARP has said that, in my State, nearly half of all of the adults who receive tax credits under the Affordable Care Act are 50- to 64-year-olds and these subsidies would be eliminated under the repeal bill. This could make healthcare unaffordable, especially for the more than 350,000 people in my State who are aged 50 to 64 who have preexisting conditions.  Now, it does not have to be this way, as Senator Shaheen has so articulately pointed out. I know that several of my Republican colleagues have said that they cannot support legislation that would take away insurance for tens of millions of Americans, and I agree. Instead of making these kinds of draconian cuts and moving backward, I think we have to move forward to actually help make healthcare in America better and more affordable.  We can and we should make changes to the Affordable Care The day it passed, I said this is the beginning and not the end. You simply cannot have a major piece of legislation like that and go for years without any significant changes. That is just not how it has worked with major legislation in the past, but every time we have tried to make changes, we have heard back that we have to repeal it. Maybe the result of all of this chaos in the last month has been that people have finally come to realize what the American people want, as Senator Shaheen has pointed out, as well as what is the best policy, and that is to make changes.  I support Senator Shaheen's Marketplace Certainty Act because it would stabilize the individual market and protect and expand the vital program that reduces out-of-pocket healthcare costs for consumers. I also support the bill of Senator Kaine of Virginia, who is here with us today, and Senator Carper, which is the Individual Health Insurance Marketplace Improvement Act, which reestablishes a Federal reinsurance program. By the way, this idea of reinsurance is something that our Republican legislature in Minnesota just passed on a State basis and is supportive of. So I see these as not just some pie-in-the-sky ideas. I see these ideas as things that we can work on across the aisle.  I just want to end by talking about some of my ideas, many of which have bipartisan support. Again, I throw them in a package of things that we could be working on. I have a bill that would harness the negotiating power of 41 million seniors who are on Medicare in order to bring drug prices down. Right now, by law, Medicare is banned from negotiating prices with all of[[Page S4033]]those seniors. Think of the better bargain that those seniors could get if their marketing power were unleashed.  Senator McCain, the Presiding Officer's colleague, and I have a bill to allow Americans to bring in safe, less expensive drugs from Canada, which is, by the way, very similar to the American market. As I have often noted, we can see Canada from our porch in We see right across the border the kinds of prices they are able to get. Senator McCain and I and several Republicans voted for a similar measure, and we think we should be allowed to bring in less expensive drugs from Canada and, perhaps, from other countries. You could also tie to it a trigger, if there is no competition or if prices have ballooned like they have for 4 of the top 10 selling drugs in this country.  Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow for the importation of safe drugs from other countries when there is not healthy competition.  Senator Grassley and I have a bill to stop something called ``pay for delay,'' which is when big pharmaceutical companies pay off generics in order to keep their products off the market. It would be $3 billion in savings for the U.Government by just passing that, and I would challenge my colleagues to vote against something as simple as that.  Lastly is the CREATES Act, and Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Lee, and I have that bill, which makes sure that we get the samples so that we can get generics on the market, create more competition, and bring prices down.  This debate is about the patients of a nurse practitioner who provides psychiatric care in my  She wrote to me:       Please, please, do all you can to prevent these people from      losing the health insurance coverage for medical and mental      healthcare that is so vital to their lives.  In Minnesota, one-third--32 percent--of the funding for our State's mental health agencies comes from Medicaid, and across the country, Medicaid expansion has helped 1.3 million people receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse issues.  This debate is about the mom in Minnesota who has private insurance and who has colon cancer. She is working full time, raising two school-age boys and going to chemo every single week. She said she fears she will not be able to afford the care she needs to stay alive.

6210,topic-id,208,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in support of H.2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This bill is the result of mindful deliberation and absolute dedication to our Nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. I am proud to be standing here with fellow members of the Armed Services Committee and speak to the merits of this legislation.  In particular, the acquisition reforms in this bill will help get proven, advanced equipment in the hands of servicemembers faster and for a better price. This bill brings much-needed innovation to the way defense acquisition personnel spend taxpayer dollars and the way commercial businesses engage with the U. It prioritizes oversight of service contracts. This type of contract accounts for over 50 percent of DOD contract expenditures, which up to now was unclear and unanalyzed. It will help secure a better value for precious dollars spent through reforms in the contract auditing process.  The small-business industrial base is a critical part of DOD procurement. Our small businesses have a unique ability to strengthen our contracting process by driving innovation and competition in the marketplace. It is important that we create opportunities for these contractors and strengthen entrepreneurial development programs and help eliminate barriers of entry and diversify our industrial base.

6108,topic-id,433,"Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Smucker for yielding. I really appreciate his leadership. I thank Congressman G.Thompson from Pennsylvania as well for his leadership. It is an honor to be here.  Madam Speaker, in recent years, global economic trends have led to an ever-growing skills gap. While unemployment has fallen to 4.4 percent in my home State of Illinois, there is still a widening gap between the jobs that are open and the skills workers need. This has become apparent as I have traveled throughout my district listening to community representatives, businesses, parents, students, and higher education officials discuss the local state of the economy.  I have been particularly concerned with the feedback I have received from businesses, who continue to report that there is a gap between the talent and skills they need in employees and what they can actually find. Shortages in skilled fields like machinists, technicians, operators, cybersecurity, and healthcare are impairing their ability to grow their businesses.  There is much Congress can do to improve the skills of our labor force, which is why I was proud to partner with my good friend and fellow member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, Congressman G.Thompson, in introducing H.2353.  Our bill reauthorizes the Carl Perkins grant program through fiscal year 2023 and gives States and local governments the tools to better equip workers for higher paying middle class jobs in the 21st century.  The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act addresses one of the underlying causes of the skills gap: what is being taught in classes does not necessarily sync up with what is needed to get a job. H.2353 requires a strong buy-in from local businesses in developing State plans.  With more local stakeholders involved in the process, it will better equip students with the technical skills they need to find success in local in-demand careers.  Finally, I believe it is important that we start to shift the culture surrounding career and technical education. Every student, no matter his or her career goals, should participate in some form of career education. I believe that every student needs to graduate, not just with a diploma but with another piece of paper, namely an offer letter.  Some students will find success in a traditional 4-year college program; others, however, will learn the skills they need through a 2-year community college or on-the-job training.  I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure its passage, and I look forward to sending this bill to the President later this year for signing.

6116,topic-id,975,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank Representative Smucker for holding this Special  Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, I rise to highlight the importance of career and technical education for our Nation's workforce. I really appreciate all of the comments that the gentleman just mentioned, and I concur.  Madam Speaker, across Rhode Island, I continue to hear from employers struggling to find skilled workers to fill open jobs in fields such as manufacturing, IT, and other trades.  Hundreds of thousands of high-skilled, high-paying jobs are right now unfulfilled in our country, and this number is continuing to grow. Especially as we hear about bringing jobs back from overseas, manufacturing, just by way of example, has changed dramatically. These factories are no longer the old, dirty, noisy manufacturing factories of old that, say, our fathers or grandfathers were used to. They are now all high-tech. You see robots doing a lot of the manufacturing that require both programming and sophisticated knowledge how to run this advanced equipment.  So the jobs are coming back, but they are coming back in different ways, needing different skills. And right now we need to ensure that our workforce is equipped with the tools to meet the demands of the economy to close our Nation's skills gap. We can do this by better aligning education and industry.  Our students, Madam Speaker, should be learning the skills they need to succeed in growing economic sectors. This is one of the most important investments that we can make in our Nation's future.  The Governor of Rhode Island, Governor Raimondo, likes to say: We need to give our workers the skills that matter for jobs that pay.  In the Ocean State, the newly opened Westerly Education Center right now is working to promote CTE, providing a range of courses to help Rhode Islanders to meet the current and projected needs of the region's economy. The Westerly Education Center effectively brings together higher education, industry, and community partners to ensure students of all ages are prepared for workforce opportunities in Rhode Classes range from industry-specific skills training to courses in critical thinking, management, and also soft skills.  CTE courses, Madam Speaker, are in demand. Approximately 12.5 million high school and college students are enrolled in CTE across the But Federal investment in this area has decreased, actually, since 2011, and the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act hasn't been authorized since 2006. I am hoping that we are going to be able to see this act reauthorized very soon.  Perkins is the primary Federal investment in CTE, and the most important thing that we can do to support CTE across the country, to support students and businesses across the country, is to reauthorize this legislation. It needs to be updated for our changing economy, and funding for CTE programs must be increased to support growing programs across the  Last Congress, I know that the House overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act, and I call on my colleagues to do the same in this Congress as well. It was, in some ways, a rare moment of bipartisanship in the Congress and a great example of how we can work together. Hopefully, that will lead to other things as well.  H.2353 recently passed unanimously by the Education and the Workforce Committee, and it is, again, the product of an inclusive and thoughtful process. I commend the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee and the ranking member and all of the members on both sides of the aisle for working so closely together--again, a very complicated piece of legislation that passed unanimously out of committee.  So, again, I thank my fellow CTE Caucus co-chair as well, Representative Thompson from Pennsylvania, for all of his great work on this bill. He is a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and he is the co-chair of the CTE We work in lockstep on these matters. It has been a pleasure to work with him. I am grateful for his leadership, along with many other colleagues.  It makes many necessary updates to Perkins, with an emphasis on training students for the skills that they will need in high-growth economic sectors. The bill contains several important reforms, including increasing collaboration between education and industry, expanding student access to apprenticeships, supporting career counselors, and aligning State performance indicators with local labor markets, among other things.  Unfortunately, at a time when it is more crucial than ever to invest in CTE, the President's budget has proposed, though, a budget for fiscal year[[Page H4809]]2018 that cuts Perkins State grants by 15 percent. That is more than $168 million across the country. In Rhode Island, that Perkins funding cut would mean a cut of more than $800,000. If enacted, the President's budget would not only slash a crucial investment in our students, but it would deeply hurt businesses.  If we want businesses to come back to the country from overseas, if we want to relocate those jobs here, we need to make sure that we have the workforce that can actually do the jobs that would be available and that are, in fact, available right now.  This is the time to invest in workforce development, not undermine it. Demand for CTE is growing from students and industry, and our economy desperately needs it.  Madam Speaker, in closing, let me just say that I encourage my colleagues to prioritize It matters for your constituents, and it yields big returns for our States' economies and for our Nation's economy as a whole. Put simply, providing workers with the skills necessary to thrive in the economy is essential to our economic prosperity. It is the right thing to do, giving our workers the skills they need for jobs that pay.  ",CREC-2017-06-08-pt1-PgH4805-2.txt,1668,REMEMBERING CECILIA ZARATE-LAUN,2017.0,8.0,July

6111,topic-id,576,"I thank Mr.Smucker for yielding to me.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about education and workforce preparedness.  Prior to serving in Congress, I dedicated my 35-year career to workforce education, helping people develop skills necessary to get a job and start a career path.  There is something about the pride that comes when someone builds the skills necessary to start a career. Their whole world changes when they see what they can achieve and the difference that makes for their family.  I ran for Congress with the desire to make that opportunity possible for all Americans; to help all Americans succeed, as I and so many others in this Chamber have.  For some people, pursuing their desired career means a 4-year college degree. I have also seen that that is not the right path for many others. Yet, too often, those that wish to pursue careers in technical areas lack the skills to gain the employment and access the skills training necessary to move forward.  This leads to a problem we have all heard of, the skills gap. People, young and mature, are unable to find jobs because they lack the necessary skills, and employers are unable to find qualified staff to fill their jobs.  We are seeing this repeatedly in my home State of Several companies that have been awarded incentives to grow and expand through the Michigan Strategic Fund have had to dial back planned expansions due to hiring challenges. The Pure Michigan Talent Connect website lists nearly 100,000 open jobs and positions across a range of industries. Businesses simply cannot find qualified individuals to fill their open jobs. It threatens our Nation, and we must address it.  In efforts to assess the needs of our education system over the last 5 months, I have met with students, administrators, teachers, and employers throughout my congressional district. Every single employer I have met since I started office have told me the same thing, believe it or not. They need more employees with the skills necessary, the core technical skills necessary, to contribute in the workforce. Despite expensive and extensive recruitment efforts, they can't find them. It is creating a real problem.[[Page H4807]]They are turning down work and turning down opportunity and growth across this Nation and in my district because they cannot find skilled employees.  Schools in my community recognize this problem, but too often their hands are tied, needing to ensure that students meet arbitrary standards and testing metrics. Here is the irony: rather than ensuring that they are prepared for employment in the community, we worry about test scores.  School leaders throughout my district have asked for one thing: more flexibility to offer choices to students and families to develop skills to meet the needs of employers and, frankly, the needs of the 21st century.  The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act would give additional flexibility to the community that education leaders are asking for. It will also allow States to better accommodate the local workforce needs. Schools, parents, employers, and teachers have made it clear: career and technical education can be improved by making it more relevant to students and employers, ensuring programs are accountable, involving all stakeholders, and granting more flexibility.  The bipartisan Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act achieves those goals. I am proud to support it as one step to expand the educational opportunities in choice in this country.

That is understandable, but might we, for the purpose of this discussion, also acknowledge the following: real national defense also means providing health security for members of American families. That is part of the balance that we should be recognizing.  The priorities on the other side are the following: they are going to turn the issue of preexisting condition back to a voluntary nature at the State level.  As one who comes from local government, we should recognize the following: every time there is an economic downturn, you can be certain that Governors are going to use the money that was intended for health care to balance the budgets, and they are going to call it good management.

And we are going to make this an option of the States to decide? This is going backwards on the issue of health security.  But that is not enough, as we know.

The previous question that Louise Slaughter and I are going to offer is the following:  We would prevent any of this legislation that is proposed that would be considered harmful to the consumers, as the Republican bill is. Americans need assurance about health care and, by the way, some predictability.  During my time of service here, I have seen how difficult it is to do health insurance. I think there is only one person in Washington, by the way, who said: Who knew health insurance could be this complicated?  Well, for those of us who have served here for any extended period of time, I can assure you, we all knew that health care was complicated in terms of delivery and economic consequence.

6228,topic-id,551,"Mr.Speaker, a few weeks ago, the President tweeted the[[Page H4859]]word ``covfefe.'' We still don't know what it means, why the President tweeted it, or if it was simply an innocent typo, something we are all guilty of making. But what is more important than the creation of a random, now infamous, word in a tweet is that the President deleted the post less than 12 hours later. This is just 1 of 18 tweets the President has deleted since his inauguration, and, each time, the question is raised whether or not he can legally do that, because when the President deletes a tweet, it is equivalent to him destroying a record.  That is why I have introduced the COVFEFE Act, Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for It is a silly name, but a serious issue. By expanding the Presidential Records Act to include social media, it would ensure that all tweets posted by the President from his personal account are archived and preserved and would finally answer the question on whether or not the President can delete tweets.  Although the bill's name is a little tongue-in-cheek, the focus of the legislation is more important now than ever. If the President is going to take to social media to make sudden public policy proclamations, we must ensure that these statements are documented and preserved for future reference. As Sean Spicer has said, each @realDonaldTrump tweet should be taken as an official White House statement.                              {time}  1015  Tweets are powerful, and the President must be held accountable for every post, from commenting on NATO, to the Paris Agreement, to his Muslim travel ban, and his response to the devastating terror attack in And on Monday, we learned that the appellate court cited the President's tweet in ruling against the travel ban.  The President's frequent unfiltered use of his personal Twitter account as a means of official communication is unprecedented, and we must respond accordingly. Sometimes it takes a creative acronym to drive attention to a much larger issue.  This is the second bill I have introduced this Congress to address the lack of transparency in the administration. Back in March, I introduced the aptly named ``Mar-a-Lago Act'' to require the White House visitor logs, or visitor logs from any other location where the President conducts official business, to be made public to the American people.  Unlike the Obama administration, the current administration stated they are unwilling to do so. For these reasons, it is critical that we push commonsense policy that promotes government accountability and transparency, because in order to maintain public trust in government, elected officials must answer for what they do and say. That includes 140-character tweets and records of who has the President's ear at the White House, Trump Tower, or his southern Florida home. If regaining the public's trust is the first step, then taking action to maintain that trust for the long term is the next.  Standalone transparency legislation is absolutely necessary, but it is not enough. We must stop treating transparency and accountability as peripheral issues and proactively incorporate them into everything we do.  Going forward, I will continue to promote efforts to increase public access to the Federal Government and ensure that all elected officials are being held accountable for their words and their actions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-13-pt1-PgH4858-2.txt,1967,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,13.0,May
6312,topic-id,1017,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Mr.Patrick Shanahan to serve as the 33rd Deputy Secretary of The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on his nomination on June 20, and he was voted out of committee by voice vote.  Mr.Shanahan was born and raised in the State of He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Washington and then a master's degree and MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Mr.Shanahan then embarked on a 30-year career at the Boeing Company, where he rose to the most senior echelons of management, working on both the company's defense and commercial programs. Most recently, Mr.Shanahan served as the senior vice president for supply chain & operations.  The Deputy Secretary of Defense is one of the most important positions within the entire national security system. The Deputy serves as the number 2 official at the Department of Defense, as well as the Department's Chief Management As the second in command to the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy oftentimes is assigned a broad spectrum of responsibilities which require strong management skills.  The Department currently faces challenges on multiple fronts. For more than 16 years, our military has been consumed by two prolonged wars against violent extremist groups like As a result, the military has faced a generational fight which has sapped readiness and precluded our military personnel from training for full spectrum operations. However, violent extremist groups are only one of the many challenges facing our country.  The past several years have seen the rise of near-peer competitors, most notably Russia and Russia has been a resurgent force bent on disrupting Europe and undercutting our own Nation and our Presidential election process. China continues its saber-rattling in the Asia-Pacific region by undermining the freedom of navigation and using economic coercion of its smaller, more vulnerable neighbors. When we factor in the destabilizing actions of North Korea and the long shadow of Iran, it becomes urgently clear that we need strong leadership at the Department of If Mr.Shanahan is confirmed, he will need to contend with all these challenges. It will not be easy and hard decisions on policy and strategy will need to be made.  Perhaps one of the hardest decisions facing the Deputy Secretary of Defense is the allocation of budget resources within the In an ideal world, a cogent defense strategy that takes into consideration the multitude of concerns facing our Nation would inform how the Department invests resources in weapons platforms and advanced technologies to confront these challenges. However, the reality is that the spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act determine the level of funding for most of these budget decisions.  The current budgetary crisis is compounded by the fact that the President's most recent budget request adds much needed funding to defense activities, but it shortchanges nondefense spending accounts in order to increase spending for our military. Furthermore, the budget request fails to recognize that the BCA budget caps are law. If these spending levels are enacted, the President's budget request would trigger sequestration, effectively wiping out increased defense spending with mandatory across-the-board cuts.  This would be the worst of all worlds. Not only would we be giving the money on the one hand and taking it back with the other hand, but it would not be in any systematic way. We would be making cuts to readiness. We would be making cuts to personnel. We would make cuts to all sorts of things which are much more valuable than some programs which would receive an additional cut.  Unless we resolve ourselves to act--which is going to take a bipartisan effort to repeal the BCA--we can't effectively fund not only the Department of Defense but every other Federal department. That is one of the great challenges Mr.Shanahan will face. Indeed, these multiple challenges will require strong leadership and the ability to make tough decisions. Mr.Shanahan has developed a strong reputation during his tenure at Boeing as someone capable of taking on challenging programs, fixing problems, and turning them into successes.  When I met with Mr.Shanahan to discuss his nomination, he emphasized that the public sector needed to work closer with the private sector to get more cost-effective results while ensuring our warfighters have the best equipment at their disposal. It is that kind of leadership that the Department of Defense needs as our Nation faces as diverse an array of threats and challenges to our national security as at any point in our history.  Based on Mr.Shanahan's qualifications and experience, as well as his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe he is fully qualified for the job. Therefore, I will vote in favor of his nomination to be the next Deputy Secretary of Defense, and I trust he will do his best to lead the men and women who ably and courageously serve this  On a final note, if confirmed, Mr.Shanahan will be relieving Bob Work, who has served this Nation ably and selflessly for most of his life. Bob Work served in the U.Marine Corps for 27 years, rising to the rank of colonel. In 2009, he was confirmed as Undersecretary of the Navy, where he shepherded the service through many challenges for the next 4 years.  He tried to return to the private sector, but in 2014 he was then nominated and confirmed as Deputy Secretary of Bob Work was the continuity in the Defense Department through three Secretaries of He stayed more than 6 months into the new administration in order to aid Secretary There is no task, no matter how difficult or how big or small, that Bob Work would not devote all of his energy to until it was resolved.

6285,topic-id,436,"Mr.President, I would like to congratulate and honor a Vermont resident for his outstanding commitment to ensuring transparency between the Federal Government and the American public. Mark Schlefer of Putney, VT, played an integral role in the creation of the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, that came into effect in 1967. Since its incorporation, FOIA has given the American people the right to request to access records from any Federal agency and has required agencies to post certain categories of information and frequently requested records online.  Mr.Schlefer was inspired to join the legal group that drafted FOIA after working with a shipping client, Pacific Far East Line, which was denied tariff documentation to stop at the Mariana Islands by the Federal Maritime Mr.Schlefer was upset to find that the Federal Maritime Commission was not required to provide an explanation of the justification behind the rejection.  Along with two other lawyers who came across similar situations with government agencies, Mr.Schlefer helped to draft the legislation for After years of working on the bill and convincing both Members of the House and the Senate to support the legislation, it was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on July 4, 1966.  FOIA helped pave the way for greater government transparency. Increased transparency restores faith in governance by holding government officials accountable to the American people. A truly transparent government roots out systemic waste, fraud, and abuse. It is clear that we need to maintain the transparency and accountability of government to the people it is meant to represent. I strongly believe that, as a democracy, we must strive to make our government as transparent as possible and that citizens should be able to obtain information from the government in a reasonable fashion.  Without FOIA, much of the U.Government would still be closed off to the American people. This legislation has been an inspiration to other governments and has served as a model throughout the world for opening government information to the public. Since FOIA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, similar Freedom of Information laws have been passed in all 50 States and 93 other nations.  Mark Shlefer has demonstrated an extraordinary level of commitment to ensuring the American people had access to more information throughout the Federal Since its initial enactment, all three branches of the Federal Government have recognized the FOIA as a vital part of our democracy. I heartily applaud Mr.Schlefer for leading the way to a more transparent government. I have no doubt that his outstanding life work has had a significant and positive impact on people and their governments throughout the world.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-26-pt1-PgS2549.txt,1010,1230,2017.0,26.0,July

Just last week, the Senate approved a package of Russia sanctions that would lock in existing sanctions, give Congress the ability to review any sanctions relief, and implement tough, new sanctions to punish Mr.Putin and his allies for meddling in our election.  The importance of this legislation is reflected in the overwhelming bipartisan vote of 98 to 2.

I believe, if he studies the Department regulations, he will come to the same conclusion many of us have; that a special counsel is merited.  For those reasons, I will be voting for cloture this evening and voting for his confirmation.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-24-pt1-PgS2475-2.txt,1036,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,24.0,June

6070,topic-id,5732,"Mr.Speaker, this is one of those things I partially do, I think, as therapy. About once every other month, I ask for a block of time to try to take a bunch of very complex numbers and try to find ways to put them on boards and demonstrate them.  I am going to take a little divergence just for a moment or two, in response to some of the things I have heard today. We are actually going to focus on debt and deficit and what is actually demographically driving them, what is really happening in this country, and what is going to drive all public policy in our life.  You have had a handful of things said about the ACA--many people know it as ObamaCare--and our replacement. I know some of the things that the Senate is working on.  There is a math problem--and it is very simple--in the individual market. So if you hear someone turn to you and say, This is about healthcare for everyone or this is employer-based, or Medicare, it is not.  In my congressional district, less than 2 percent of my population actually purchased in the individual market. So you have to start putting this in perspective.  Here is your math problem. Because the prices kept moving up and the deductibles kept becoming larger and larger, half of our population--that 50 percent that only uses 3 percent of healthcare dollars--stopped buying.  I came across a number earlier this week--I haven't had a chance to vet it, but it was in a publication--saying that, of the 18- to 30-year-old population that would be in the individual purchasing market, only about 17 percent of them were actually buying the insurance.  So those of you who do math, you start to understand what happens in a world where half the population that really uses very little healthcare services doesn't buy a product and those who are purchasing it are those who are the high users of it.  Remember, 50 percent of all healthcare dollars are used by 5 percent of the population. So you start to see it is this hockey stick curve that shoots up. That is the math problem that is trying to be fixed.  In the last 3 years, if you are from Arizona, you have had a 190 percent price hike in the mean plan and you have a single choice. So if we are going to be intellectually honest, should we hold our brothers and sisters around here to their own words and their own promises? You remember the promises a few years ago about keep your doctor, $2,500 discount, lots of choices, lots of options, well, in Arizona, your prices have skyrocketed, you didn't get to keep your doctor, and you now have a single choice.                              {time}  1745  That is the reality of the math. Sometimes it is just so hard sitting here when you hear people just pulling things out of the air, and then you go to the bill and say: But I can't find that.  And you get these weird logic trains that if this happened and a meteor hit here and this and that. At some point we need to be honest with the American people saying it is a math problem. This is not about removing costs from the healthcare system. It is actually moving around, how you fairly distribute the cost of it.  This summer now we are starting to work on it, just like we voted on about an hour ago a piece of legislation that starts to remove cost out of the system. It is these future pieces of legislation, like the tort liability bill that was just passed out of the House here, that will actually start to drive down costs.  Remember a really important conceptual idea: in 1986, there was a law passed here, signed by President Reagan, that said you cannot deny an American health services if they show up at the emergency room, if they show up at the hospital.  So if you actually look at the number of procedures in society in the last 30, 31 years, pre-ACA, after the ACA came into effect, what we see in the future, we haven't removed procedures and costs. We have just moved the money around.  All right. So what is happening in our country? Do you remember when the President introduced his budget, what, about 6 weeks ago, 2 months ago, and the gnashing of teeth and the wailing and the crying?  We have a math problem, and it is based on demographics. We are going to see this multiple times in these slides. I am one of them. I am at the very tail end. I am a baby boomer. There are 76 million of us who are baby boomers, who are heading towards retirement. That demographic curve is changing the cost structure of government.  On the slide you see next to me, this is 9 years from now. Remember, we are[[Page H5290]]working on, what, the 2018 budget? So actually less than that. This is what the world will look like in 2026.  Do you see the Social Security being 24 percent of all spending? Do you see Medicare being 19 percent of all spending? Do you see interest on the debt?  If you start to add up everything, you have to understand the world we are in is we are heading toward a time where three-quarters of spending--actually, even more than that are what we call mandatory. They are formulas. You get this benefit because you turned a certain age. You get this benefit because you fell under a certain income. You get this benefit because you served in the military.  But what so many of us talk about as being government is becoming tiny. In 2026, which is not that long from now, 11 percent of the budget is going to be defense; 11 percent of the budget will be nondefense. So that is your parks, that is your medical research, that is your education. That is this branch of government. That is all the branches of government. So 22 percent will be what we call discretionary. It is what I get to come down here and vote on because everything else is run by a formula.  So if you are someone who comes to me and says: I really think we should be going to I really think we should be doing this type of healthcare research. I really think we need this money in education.  I agree they are all incredibly important in our society. Are you going to help me find a way to reform what we call mandatory spending, entitlements?  Entitlements--because of the aging of our population--is the primary driver, are consuming every incremental dollar.  In a decade, this government will be spending $1 trillion more, and every dime of that will functionally have gone into entitlements. We will have gone 10 years where what we call discretionary spending--you know, these little two parts here--has stayed flat for a decade.  This huge growth in government is actually in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Certain other entitlements are things you get because you fell below a certain income, and interest on the debt. Until we are actually honest about this--because it is so dangerous for a political person to even say the words ``Medicare''--we have to look at the numbers and understand the trust funds are bleeding.  If you really want to protect our brothers and sisters and protect retirees, some of these are things we should have done a decade ago. And we keep avoiding them because so often Washington cares more about the political up side of attacking each side from even mentioning what is going on demographically and in these numbers.  We are going to try to run through a bunch of these slides. Some of them, I apologize, when you blow them up on the big printer, they are going to get a little fuzzy, but we are going to just try to walk through these numbers. Hopefully, they will make some sense.  Why is this slide up?  This one is really important.  When you get down to the very last bar chart, do you happen to notice something? You notice how they basically touch each other.  That is 2027.  How many years from now--how many budget years from now?  So about 9 budget years from now.  Do you see the lighter blue?  That is Social The gray is the Then the Then you get up to net interest. Then you see the green at the very top, and that is other mandatory.  Oh, heaven. Do you understand what that slide is telling you?  That is saying, in 9 years, just the mandatory spending consumes all revenues, meaning defense will be on borrowed money, meaning almost everything you think of as government--once again, the Park Service, medical research, education--will be on borrowed money.  At that point we are going to be borrowing probably a little over $1 trillion a year every year, and it gets worse and worse.  I am incredibly blessed. I have a 20-month-old, and since the blessing of her coming into my life and my wife's life, I think constantly: In the time I am spending here in Congress, what am I handing to her?  Because right now the game is we spend it today, we consume it today, and we are going to let our kids and our grandkids pay it back.  How does this become ethical?  Yet if you listen to the speeches that happened on this floor today, it was speech after speech of: We want more money for something.  At the same time--this is important--do you know how much we are going to borrow today?  We are going to borrow over $1.6 billion today.  I have 1 hour to speak here to you. Hopefully, if we are all blessed, I won't go that long.  So $1.6 billion divided by 24. Sixty-six million dollars an hour.  Start to divide that and just think about that is just the borrowing side of spending, because we are going to spend about $11 billion today on a $4 trillion-plus budget. So just understand that this is where we are going. This is already baked into the cake. This is the math.  It is time for almost revolutionary thoughts on we need to look at the budget holistically. That means no longer having this little silo over here of this is discretionary, this is mandatory; and if you even talk about mandatory, you lose your political office.  In many ways, this one is sort of doing the same thing but letting you see what is happening on the debt side.  Now, why is the debt side so incredibly important to also focus on?  We have to pay interest on it. We are borrowing money from your retirement, from the Union retirement, from the State retirement, but we are also borrowing money from a thrifty family in China, and we owe interest on it. We also make ourselves, as a nation, much more fragile to the world markets.  We have been incredibly lucky the last few years of these stunningly low interest rates.  How many of you actually believe the interest rates when you look at a 10-year instrument today that I think was at 2.2 and believe that is normal?  If we actually just moved back to nominal interest rates, our interest would grow very quickly in the next couple of years to be greater than our entire defense budget.  As you look at this slide, look out to 2026, many years from now, except it is not that long from now. Do you see the green bar up there?  That is total debt. That total debt is starting to crash in on $30 trillion.  A bit of trivia. You often hear the differential people say: Well, there is public debt and there is publicly issued debt, and then there is debt where we borrow from the trust funds. And many of the economists really only score debt that is sold in the open markets.  I understand that is the practice, but there is something that is intellectually lazy, because we still owe the money back to the Medicare trust fund, to the Social Security trust fund. It has been a while since I checked this, but I think last year I checked, and we were paying a 3.1 percent interest spiff. So we pay a higher interest rate for borrowing those moneys out of those trust funds.  Do we have an obligation to pay that back?  Of course we do. But for the intellectually lazy, it is just so much more comforting to say: Well, let's just not look at that because, if we look at that, we are already over 100 percent of debt-to-GDP when we put in those dollars we have loaned to the general fund. Let's just call it that.  Let's move on to the next one. If you look at this slide, you notice there is starting to be a theme here. I am trying desperately to get my brothers and sisters in this body to understand the greatest threat to our society is the money we are spending that we actually don't have a way to pay for. If you actually look at demographics and where this debt curves, it just blows off the charts.  This is an interesting little slide. This is a CBO slide for 2027. When you actually look at it saying: What does the world look like if mandatory-- Do you see the blue?  That is mandatory and defense spending. Because many people say: Look, we are going to spend on defense.  We will be down to only--11 percent of this budget will be things you think of as government. Everything else will be entitlements or defense.[[Page H5291]]  Just as a perspective, we did this slide just so you could sort of see. I hear candidates running for office say: We are going to take care of waste and fraud, and that will balance the budget.  Really? When only 11 percent of the budget in just a few years will be everything that isn't mandatory or isn't defense?  You have got to understand the scale.  This one is a little hard to read. I am going to reach over to it and play with my pen.  When you actually look at this, what I am begging of you also to understand is--I think this is the 2016 year--we spent actually a bit over $3.9 trillion, but we only took in $3.3 trillion.  You see the nature of the differential?                              {time}  1800  And when you start to look at, first off, the beige there in the upper, we have been really blessed with incredibly low interest rates. So at a time where we should have actually been having an interest bill that would have been approaching a few hundred billion, we had less than $250 billion.  Now, the dear Lord and the interest markets have been very, very kind to us. When you actually look at the curve, so much of the spending, once again, is what we call mandatory. But if you actually look at--we will call it the rust over there, something most people don't understand. I am going to reach over and point to what is the individual income tax portion. What most people don't understand is the individual income tax is the majority of the income to this country that is not intended for one of the trust funds.  If you actually look at the corporate income tax, it has been going up, but it is still a fairly small sliver. Now, why did that change? And so often I will get people that bring me charts and say: ``David, 25, 30 years ago, the corporations paid so much more.'' Well, also, 25, 30 years ago, there was this new concept of pass-throughs: LLCs and partnerships.  So what happened is many things that used to be corporations in the fifties, sixties, seventies, up and through the eighties, at the end of the eighties there was this revolution where States all over said: Hey, why don't we create these pass-through entities; they're more tax efficient.  How many of you actually have had an LLC? Well, that is a pass-through entity. But that is where you actually see the shift of corporate taxes going down and individual taxes going up. It is not that corporations all of a sudden start escaping taxes. It is their taxes now were actually booked as individual income. Just to understand, so when you see those charts, you have got to be able to sort of process and think that through.  This is sort of important to understand where the taxes are. But, do you see that circle there, that 40 percent of the entire curve? That is payroll taxes. That is the income that goes into your unemployment, your Social Security disability, your Social Security, your Those are revenues that are specifically for either your retirement future, if you have a break in your employment, or, God forbid, you become permanently or temporarily disabled, with Social Security disability having its definition of what temporarily disabled is.  Just to understand, those are our revenue sources.  Then you will see the little slivers on the bottom, and some of that is tariffs and some of the other fees that come in, partially through trade.  I know, sometimes these slides are a little hard to see, so we actually blew a couple of them up. The idea here was just so you could actually see the total revenues.  Now, this is for 2017, so this is our projection of what is going on this year.  And my wife, right about now is when she would typically start texting me and saying I am putting everybody to sleep. But I am married to an accountant, so that could explain why we have no friends.  That is the payroll taxes.  Do you see the far side? Let's call it turquoise. That is the individual income tax. That is why those of us on the Ways and Means Committee, when we are actually working on tax reform, many of us believe we have to sort of do an organic, a unified budget or a tax reform proposal that actually does everything from what you see here, corporate, which actually is much of our job engine, over to the individual, which is also now a huge portion of our job engine.  Do not let someone just talk about lowering rates and not also understand that what you see on the individual side may be what you pay as a worker, but also, if you are an employer but you are organized as an LLC or partnership or pass-through, you are also on that side, just to know it is out there.  Now we get to some of the more fun stuff.  You were just looking at some of our revenues. We already know that this year, if you use the President's budget--or Office of Budget and Management--we are about $600 billion short. If we use that of the Congressional Budget Office, we are, let's just call it, $550 billion short, meaning we are spending that much more money than we are taking in.  But, once again, let's actually just look at where we are spending the money. So the turquoise, Social Security, Medicare, and other health programs, so Medicare and National defense is this. Then come over here. This is everything else, and this is interest.  So, last year, we spent about $245 billion in interest. This year, we are still blessed with incredibly low interest rates. We are only expecting about $266 billion in interest. Still stunning amounts of money. But the little white area is what most people will think of as government.  So if you look at last year--and the nice thing about using this one is it is booked. We know what it is. We took in $3.3 trillion; we spent $3.9 trillion. You already start to see the structural difference.  So, if you actually start to come over here, now this is much better than it was a few years ago. The problem is, in this fairly strong economy, it is closed, and now, demographically, it is about to start to move away from us. This is the line you always have to constantly think about.  If that is my revenues and I drop my line down, you have to start understanding that everything beyond that line is borrowed money. Just visually, I have always found this easiest when you actually start to show different groups saying: ``Look, this is just where we are at.'' And then you will stand up and say: ``Hey, why don't we do this? Tell me what I can cut because you want a balanced budget this year.''  All right. Understand the math. If we are going to borrow $600 billion, that is most of defense.  How about the other side, everything else we call discretionary? We could actually eliminate all of it and, believe it or not, you still don't have enough money to cover the borrowing. So, if you are borrowing $600 billion this year, I believe that is greater than all of the nondefense spending in the government this year.  So let's actually start going through a little bit more where we are at and what is actually about to happen. The frustrating thing here is we have a number of charts that we have worked on about why we have been so off on our economic growth projections. If you go back a couple of years ago, we had these fairly rosy pictures where we were going to be, yet the country has not grown nearly fast enough.  We are hoping this year, with the new administration, you are actually starting to see economic growth that will take care of a lot of these sins. I think GDP now, as of a couple of days ago, the Atlanta Fed's calculator was at about 2.9 percent of You would like to be substantially higher, but if we could hold 2.9 through the rest of the year, we will take it because it is so much healthier than where we have been the last few years.  Why this is important is, I just want to show, the Congressional Budget Office's baseline for 2017, $559 billion more spending than we are taking in. But I am going to reach way over here and say, hey, what does the world look like 10 years from now? Ten years from now it is saying the annual shortfall, the annual borrowing, will be 1.4--actually, let's be accurate--$1.408 trillion.  So just the borrowing in 9 budget years will be greater than all of the discretionary spending of this year.[[Page H5292]]And it is growth in entitlements; it is growth in mandatory spending.  Why isn't that what you hear behind these microphones all day long? I have to believe that those of us who get behind those microphones, we love our kids and we love our grandkids, but this is absolute decimation of the future.  And do not blame the parts of the government that we vote for, the discretionary, because the math doesn't show that. When you actually take a look at this, you see the darker and the lighter. The darker is defense, the lighter is nondefense.  One more time, I know this is sort of geeky. But if you actually look from 1996 to 2001, yes, we have had certain economic upheavals; we have had an attack on our country. But if you actually look at the percentages of gross domestic product, which is how so many economists sort of look at our spending and say, ``Hey, you are spending 3 percent over here of your GDP on defense,'' it is pretty much identical where we were last year as to where we were 10 years or 20 years earlier.  So, once again, what is exploding on us? Well, if you want to break it down, if you actually look at the different categories--and we are only going to do this slide for a second--the different categories will have stayed almost flat in the discretionary area for 10 years.  So what is happening in our society? We are getting older. Something I thought was just fascinating because I have a great interest in the reality: We knew people were going to be turning 65. We knew baby boomers were going to be turning 65 for how many years? This body knew we had 76 million of our brothers and sisters who were born in an 18-year period that would be moving into their time with their earned benefits, and we did what to prepare for it? So we are now about our fifth year into the baby boomers retiring, and we are now beyond the inflection point.  If you went to school many years ago and you sat in a demographics class, they talked about, oh, in the 2000s, there is going to be this time where you are coming up against this inflection where the spending is going to explode.  You are going to see a couple of slides in a moment where I am going to show you what has happened now where, when I was a child, for every $4 spent for children, $1 was spent for seniors. Today, that is reversed. There is some math difference in there and there is some population difference, but that is where we are at.  This is an interesting slide. You do understand, as a nation, we functionally have zero population growth without immigration. In about 25 or 30 years, the country of Nigeria will have more population than the United So when you hear someone talk, saying, ``Well, I am uncomfortable with trade,'' they have got to understand, if we need consumers for our products, we need to be finding these countries that are going to have lots of young people, and they are our future markets.  We in the United States are moving down. I think our average age this year is 37.2, and that will continue to go up for about the next 25 years.  I just put this up because it is fascinating seeing where the young people are going to be in the world, and we need to start thinking about, if we are getting older as a society, how do we still use our intellectual prowess, our creativity, our manufacturing prowess to make things that are desirable to growing populations, and let's make sure we have built a world and environment here where we can sell things to them.                              {time}  1815  Because if we don't, we don't have the market ourselves. We are not going to have enough young consumers. So you have got to take that into reality.  Once again, this one is a tough chart. It is on here just basically to understand what is happening in the world. What is incredibly fascinating is many Americans see China as our primary competitor, and in many products they are.  On high-value products, countries like Germany, actually, are more of a competitor. But do you see this line here, this collapse? That is the Chinese demographics. If you understand that line, you understand a lot of things that China is doing around the world in trying to buy assets that produce income so they will actually have an income stream to start paying for their senior population.  The United States is this dark here, and you will see--here is where we are at. We are sliding. But look at how many of our trading partners also are in the same demographic curve. It is just worth understanding that when you see many of us who lean towards being free traders, we are looking for where there are populations in the world that we can go sell things to. I am an American; I want to sell you something.  Now, within the Nation, just fascination, if year 2000 the average age in the United States was 35.3, 16 years later, we are 37.9, that is a huge shift. I know that may not seem like a big difference when you start talking about two-and-a-half some points. That is a big shift in 16 years on average age.  But also what is fascinating is for those of us out in the West, we will actually be somewhat younger than the middle of the country and back I am blessed to be from Maricopa County, Arizona, the fastest growing county in the country. Come visit us. But it is also to understand that this aging of America also is going to require different societal needs, and different States are going to have very different approaches.  If you actually look at a State like Utah, it remains fairly young. Some of our States back East actually get quite old and are going to actually have very different societal needs.  This is the mandatory spending chart. I actually wanted to spend just a moment over here on some of the percentages. This one I know is really hard to read, but if you actually start to look at the second part over here, ``discretionary,'' do you see all of those little tiny percentages? This is where a lot of our discussions get very disingenuous around here.  We will have people coming behind these microphones almost acting like their hair is on fire because some dollars have been removed from this agency, or dollars are going to be removed from this spending program, and the unwillingness to understand the scale that we are talking about. It is just real simple.  If that is every dollar of discretionary spending plus defense, and every dollar of mandatory, the mandatory is what, two-and-a-half times bigger? So if you are going to have a discussion of spending priorities, are we going to be a mature enough group to actually deal with the reality where the dollars are at? I promise, we are down to the last couple of these.  So the share of the budget outlays, and this one is more--I am not being judgemental on this. It is just more of a thought experiment. This is actually from the Urban Institute, which it is always interesting to see a Republican using charts from the Urban This is a couple of years old, and the chart now is actually more aggressive. I just couldn't get the newest one printed.  Do you see this little edge right here? This is sort of the Federal spending. Ten percent is going to children. Forty-one percent of the spending goes to seniors. It is just a thought experiment. We want to honor and keep our commitments to the earned entitlements, but the reality of the demographics keep moving up, and as we keep those commitments, the pressure on everything else is going to get much more cantankerous, much more cranky, much more difficult.  We have a saying in our office: It is always about the money. Some of the disharmony you hear around here is going to get louder because, as you have already seen, the trillion-dollar engine over the next few years that consumes the next trillion dollars is all mandatory spending, is all demographics. So that is just another thought experiment.  Every once in while we will get the people who come to us and say: Hey, David, why don't you remove this program or that program? One more time, we are borrowing--so much for my writing--$1.6 billion every single day. And that is just the borrowing side, and we are spending close to $11 billion every single day.  So on occasion, you will get a group that comes in and says: David, we want you to get rid of all foreign aid, but we want to make sure you still protect[[Page H5293]]Israel, and we still want to help the countries that are trying to help us deal with narcotics.  And you start to get down and say: Okay, so you want us to cut half of the foreign aid budget?  Okay, great. Well, that would be about 14 days of borrowing--not spending, borrowing. Because remember, we are borrowing $1.6 billion every day. And there becomes the intellectual problem where you will get an individual who comes in and says: David, just take care of the waste and fraud. And there is waste and fraud out there, and we are going to have to do it. And we are going to have to be much more disciplined in the adoption and the use of technology.  But a lot of that language is gimmickry until you have someone who is willing to step up and actually just talk about the demographics that are our  So think about this: I will have stood behind this microphone--let's just pretend it is an hour. Do you feel like you got $66 million worth of speechifying? Because we are borrowing $66 million a minute, $1.6 billion a day, and it is just not that.  One of the reasons this is such a powerful chart--and this is from a private organization that does the U.debt clock. You do realize, the majority of debt in this country is borrowed.  There was an article in Politico a couple of years ago that did this brilliant job. If you actually think about this, all of the student loans, all of the mortgages that have Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, SBA, all of these things, it was somewhere around 63 or 64 percent of all debt in the United States, you and I as taxpayers guarantee.  The unfunded liabilities in Medicare itself over the 75 years, many actuaries have over $100 trillion. So when you see us fussing with each other down here, it is almost always about the money. And until we are willing to start talking about these numbers that are spinning out of control, the fussing is just going to get more and more angry until we step up and deal with the reality of what is driving our future, and that is demographics.  Mr.Speaker, with that I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-28-pt1-PgH5289-2.txt,1994,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 244, HONORING",2017.0,28.0,June

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act would result in more than 32 million people losing their insurance coverage by 2026. Premiums would roughly double in the individual marketplaces. I urge my Republican friends not to go forward with this misguided approach.  The idea that they can repeal the healthcare bill now and give us a new bill in 2 years or whatever period of time is in the bill just doesn't pass the smell test. If we haven't seen an alternative to the Affordable Care Act in the last 7 years, there is no reason to believe that our Republican colleagues are going to be able to produce a bill in 2 years when there is chaos in the marketplaces.  There is a better way forward for the Senate and for our country. During the Fourth of July recess, Majority Leader McConnell said that if he can't secure the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he is prepared to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats on legislation to repair and strengthen the law.  I believe that bipartisanship is the best way to get something done. That is what I tried to do when I was Governor of New I worked closely with our Republican legislature, and we got things done. It should not be a last resort for what we are doing; it should be the first resort. It should be what we do to build a foundation for policy in this country.  I am hopeful that following the floor consideration of whatever the majority leader decides to do on healthcare--and, hopefully, it is going to get defeated--we will move forward with the majority leader's fallback plan, which I believe should be the starting position. We need to start fresh with regular order to craft bipartisan legislation that builds on the strengths of the Affordable Care Act, that builds on what is working and fixes what is not working. As we have been hearing at townhalls and in countless messages from our constituents, this is exactly what the American people want us to do.  There is remarkable consensus in this country that the Republican leaders' bill is the wrong approach. An ABC/Washington Post poll on Sunday found that by a more than 2-to-1 margin, Americans prefer the Affordable Care Act to the Republican leaders' bill. Their bill is strongly opposed by hospital associations, by healthcare providers, by the health insurance industry, and by nearly every patient advocacy group, including the American Cancer Society and the American Heart There is no reason to think that just repealing the Affordable Care Act is going to make that any better.  On Saturday, the New Hampshire Hospital Association, the New Hampshire Medical Society--our physicians--and the New Hampshire AARP joined together in opposition to the bill. They noted that more than 118,000 Granite Staters--nearly 1 in 10 people in New Hampshire--would lose healthcare coverage under the Republican bill, and that number is even greater if we just repeal the Affordable Care Their joint statement urges Senators ``to start over and create a new version of legislation that protects coverage for those who have it and provides coverage for those who need it most.''  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint statement by these groups be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Concord Monitor, July 15, 2017]  Our Turn: Protecting Patients Must Be the First Goal of Health Care                               Legislation           (By Todd Fahey, Stephen Ahnen and James Potter)       The New Hampshire Hospital Association, New Hampshire      Medical Society and AARP New Hampshire have joined in      opposition to the Better Care Reconciliation Act currently      under consideration in the U.      Our three organizations oppose the BCRA because it would      erode health protections for millions of Americans and expose      them to increased costs and health risks. We believe that any      health care legislation should have the goal of protecting      patients first.       We are concerned that the BCRA would reduce funding for      Medicare by cutting nearly $59 billion over 10 years from the      Hospital Insurance trust fund, which would hasten Medicare's      insolvency and diminish the program's ability to pay for      services in the future. This would affect hospitals, doctors      and consumers by reducing revenue and making it more      difficult to provide services to Medicare patients. To put a      sharper point on the issue, New Hampshire hospitals are      projected to receive approximately $1.5 billion less in      Medicare reimbursements over the next decade, reductions that      were enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to help pay      for the coverage expansions that have occurred. To maintain      those spending reductions while millions of people lose      health insurance coverage is simply not feasible.       The BCRA threatens protection for people with employer-     sponsored health coverage by weakening consumer protections      that ban insurance companies from capping how much they will      cover annually or over a person's lifetime--leaving people      vulnerable to costs that could be financially catastrophic      for them.       In addition, the bill cuts more than $700 billion from      Medicaid by creating a capped financing structure in the      Medicaid program. This could lead to cuts in provider      payments, program eligibility, covered services or all three,      ultimately harming some of our nation's most vulnerable      citizens and dramatically impacting providers' ability to      serve patients and communities who depend on them every day.      It has been estimated that this would result in over $1.4      billion in reduced federal spending on Medicaid in New      Hampshire over the next decade. Where would New Hampshire      turn to find the resources necessary to care for our most      vulnerable citizens?       According to the CBO, the BCRA will leave 22 million more      people uninsured, including more than 118,000 Granite State      residents who were able to secure vital health coverage      through the Affordable Care Act, making it more difficult for      our most vulnerable to receive the services they need to stay      in their homes. Without health coverage for, and therefore      access to, critical health services, patients will seek care      in emergency rooms, ultimately raising uncompensated care      costs for hospitals throughout New Hampshire and increasing      cost-shifting to New Hampshire businesses.       We believe that the Better Care Reconciliation Act needs to      be viewed through the eyes of patients and the caregivers who      take care of them, and should make protecting health care      coverage for our most vulnerable citizens a higher priority.      We remain opposed to the BCRA and urge the Senate to start      over and create a new version of legislation that protects      coverage for those who have it and provides coverage for      those who need it most.       We appreciate the efforts of both of our senators to      protect access to affordable health care for all Granite      Staters, and we urge them to continue to work toward      bipartisan solutions that will cover more people, not less,      and reduce health care costs, including insurance premiums      and the high cost of prescription drugs.

6304,topic-id,614,"Mr.President, I strongly agree with these New Hampshire groups. After spending 6 months trying to pass the deeply unpopular, deeply flawed bill to repeal the law, shouldn't we welcome a bipartisan effort to improve the law? I believe the answer to that is yes, and the place to begin is by taking urgent action on a matter where most of us agree, and that is providing certainty to health insurance markets in order to hold down premium increases. In their 2018 rate request filings, insurers say that large increases are necessary because of the uncertainty surrounding the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and because the Trump administration refuses to commit to making cost-sharing reduction payments--those payments that go to insurance companies so they can help their consumers with[[Page S4032]]the cost of health insurance, making sure that more people can get health insurance. Well, we now have an opportunity to end this uncertainty by putting the repeal behind us and authorizing a simple bill to authorize regular appropriations for the cost-sharing reduction payments.  The current instability in the ACA marketplaces is a manufactured crisis, and Congress can put a stop to it very quickly. That is why I have introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which is a bill to permanently appropriate funds to expand the funds for and to expand the cost-sharing repayments. It does two things: It guarantees that these payments are coming, and it is going to cover more people to help. I am pleased to be joined by 26 Senators who have already cosponsored this bill. We can end this artificial crisis. We can immediately restore certainty and stability to the insurance markets, and, in turn, we can get the time we need in order to come together in a bipartisan way to improve this law to build on what is working and to fix what is not.  We have a number of these commonsense measures, and this is one that has been embraced, not just by Democrats but by key Republican leaders, including Chairman Lamar Alexander and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, who have urged that these payments be continued. As Chairman Brady put it, the payments are needed ``to help stabilize the [health] insurance market and help lower premiums for Americans.'' He added: ``Insurers have made clear the lack of certainty is causing 2018 proposed premiums to rise significantly.''  We have heard from our constituents at home. We have heard from doctors, nurses, hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, nursing homes, patient advocates, insurers, and those constituents who were in the statement I asked to be printed in the They are pleading with us to set aside our partisan differences and work together to repair the Affordable Care  Again, we know what we can do. It is not just the Marketplace Certainty Act; there are other bills that have been introduced that can fix the uncertainty in the markets and allow us to address other issues with the law.  Bipartisanship should be the Senate's first resort, not the last resort. An excellent place to start is by coming together right now to permanently appropriate funds for the cost-sharing reduction payments that keep health coverage affordable and to look at some of the other commonsense measures that are going to be talked about by my colleagues, like Senator Klobuchar, who will be coming to the floor. She has legislation that would help us deal with the high cost of prescription drugs, which is one of the things that is driving the increasing costs of healthcare. We need to pass these commonsense measures, and we need to do it now.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.

6309,topic-id,923,"Mr.President, I am really pleased to have been joined by my colleagues to talk about the importance of addressing healthcare for all Americans, especially my colleague from New She and I have been touring the State for months now, talking with people in hospitals, with patients, with physicians, with providers, with people with substance use disorders, with providers who are providing treatment for people with substance use disorders, with people all over New Hampshire about what we can do to make sure people get healthcare when they need it.  That should be the goal of this body. It should not be throwing people off their healthcare, which a repeal of the Affordable Care Act would do. It would throw 32 million people off their healthcare.  We can address the instability in the marketplaces. We can do that pretty quickly. Senators Kaine and Carper talked about reinsurance, something which has worked very well for the first 3 years of the Affordable Care Act, and the reason it doesn't work now is because they have stopped. That is why we are seeing some of these rate increases.  We can address the uncertainty by being clear that we are not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by addressing those cost-sharing reduction payments. The ACA already stipulates that CSR--those payments which reduce the costs of copays and deductibles--are to be made pursuant to 31 U.S.1324.  My bill provides for payments to be made jointly from a permanent appropriation rather than subject to the year-to-year whims of the annual appropriations process. The Marketplace Certainty Act removes all bases for any further questions about what is already clear from a fair reading of the Affordable Care Act as a whole; that both those CSR payments and the advanced premium tax credit subsidies are to be funded from the same permanent appropriation.  I see my colleague from Texas on the floor, and I am sure he is going to object to the unanimous consent request I am going to be proposing in a couple of minutes. He objected last Thursday when I asked for unanimous consent to pass the Marketplace Certainty Act, and he justified the objection by asserting that the cost-sharing reduction payments are--I think he called it a bailout of the insurance companies. That is an inflammatory term, and I think we ought to be careful with how we use it because the truth is, the cost-sharing reduction payments are in no way, shape, or form a bailout. They are orderly payments built into the law to go directly to keep premiums, copays, and deductibles affordable for lower income In fact, those same payments were included in the bill Majority Leader McConnell just said he is not going to go forward with, the Republican bill. It included those very same cost-sharing reduction payments. I think they were included because there was a recognition that these are important to help address the cost of healthcare for all  As I said earlier, we have had statements by the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Lamar Alexander, talking about that these payments should be continued. We have heard from House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, who said we need to continue these payments to help stabilize the insurance market. It is the uncertainty that is causing the current problem, and we could address that today--this week--if people were willing to work together.  As Democrats, we have come to the floor to say we want to work together. We think we can address the challenges we face with the Affordable Care We can do it in a bipartisan way. I know we can because Tim Scott and I have done it. We passed a bill several years ago by unanimous consent, which basically gave States the ability to control group size for people and for companies in the marketplaces so I know it can be done, and I know we could do it today if there were a willingness on the part of all of our colleagues to work together. That is what the American people want. They don't want 32 million people thrown off their health insurance. We don't want rural hospitals to close in New We don't want nursing homes to close. We don't want people to be thrown out of their nursing homes.  I was up in northern New Hampshire at a nursing home over the weekend, where I talked to a group of women in their eighties and older. One woman said to me: You know, I worked my whole life. I paid my taxes. I did everything I was supposed to do. I sold my house so I could get into this nursing home so I could qualify under I got rid of all my assets. Now they are telling me I am going to get thrown out? She said: What would I do? I have no place to go. I have no family to help me.  People don't want that. What they want is for us to work together, to help fix healthcare so people can get what they need when they need it.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration of 1462; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.

We see the unemployment rate today. We know this is a problem today and will continue to be a problem.  My background is in construction. We owned a construction firm. We had about 150 employees. Our biggest problem always was finding qualified people to fill the spots that are available. At the same time, I saw the opportunities that were available to people who decided to take up a career in construction. It is not, as many people think, neither construction nor manufacturing nor many jobs that require technical trade skills today. Construction uses technology, and it is not a dirty job that people once thought it was. The manufacturing is the same way. At the same time, there are great-paying jobs, family-sustaining jobs available in these fields.  I think we need to do a better job of enlightening, essentially, the opportunities and talking about the opportunities that are available through career and technical education.  To your point again, Congressman, there is no better way to help people out of poverty than to connect them with a good-paying job and the self-worth that is achieved from finding a job.

I think I will have one more speaker, who is on the way. As I wait for him, Mr.Wilson talked about some of the schools in his area that have been doing a great job in connecting people, training people, educating people for the kind of jobs that are available in our workforces.  Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District is home to Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, and it is an incredible story and similar to stories of many of the other institutions that are providing career and technical education.  There was a job fair recently at Thaddeus Stevens College, and for just a few hundred graduates, there were about 450 companies essentially competing for those individuals, competing to fill spots they had. So it goes without saying that the placement rate at many of these schools--I know certainly at Thaddeus Stevens College--is almost 100 percent placement rate. They have a problem, in fact, sometimes keeping people until graduation because students are offered jobs even before they graduate, and they are hired away.                              {time}  1730  Some of the students coming out of Thaddeus Stevens College are earning, on average, $45,000 annually. We have the Marcellus shale drilling in our area, welders, some of them are earning up to six figures, $100,000 or more in the first or second year of employment. So, again, the kind of jobs that we are talking about here are great-paying, family-sustaining jobs.  My district is also home to Reading Area Community College and the Pennsylvania College of Health Sciences, both of which offer CTE programs. We have spoken with, as a part of leading up to this bill being introduced, their faculty, students, and staff about how some of these programs can be improved.  Harrisburg Area Community College has a campus in my district in They do something that I think we will be seeing more of and should be seeing more of: they run an innovative apprenticeship program. They brought together private businesses that work with the school to help prepare skilled workers to fill available jobs. It is a very innovative program. The program has been very, very successful.  Future initiatives there include expanding the program into our local high schools to ensure that graduates are college or career ready. It is an opportunity that I think we have across the country.  If you look at some other models, some of the European countries--for instance, I just had a long, extensive conversation with the Swiss Ambassador about the apprenticeship program in  Here, we often think of apprenticeship in what we may refer to as blue-collar workers, construction and manufacturing. In Switzerland, I was told that they have apprenticeship programs in up to 230 careers. So it is bankers and insurers. Many, many different companies are taking advantage of the apprenticeship program there.  It gets to the student debt problem that we hear so much about. Here, students are earning a degree. In an apprenticeship program, students are earning a degree while earning dollars, so it sort of does away with that, if you think about it. You are earning dollars as you are learning. So it is a great model that I hope to see more of here.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.Langevin).

The NDAA also authorizes an increased end strength for the Army at a cost of $4 billion, again, simply adding it to the top line. Certainly, our troops deserve a pay raise, but the question that must be asked is: Where is the money coming from? And on what basis are these decisions being made?  Congress has not received a strategic plan from the Pentagon that would inform us on how large the military needs to grow.

While the SSIA extension would be an important temporary fix, Congress must make a permanent fix to the offset.  We cannot continue to allow surviving military spouses to suffer from our inaction.

6206,topic-id,305,"Mr.Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which increases readiness and ensures that those who serve our Nation are fully equipped, trained, and supported.  As the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am especially proud of the oversight regarding stronger cyber warfare capabilities, safeguarding technological superiority, enabling our Special Operations Forces around the[[Page H5540]]globe, providing resources and authorities to counter terrorism and unconventional warfare threats, and energizing programs and activities that counter the spread of weapons of mass destruction.  Our achievements in cybersecurity carry three broad themes: First, the bill increases congressional oversight of cyber operations by including a bill introduced by myself, Ranking Member Langevin, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith that ensures Congress is kept fully informed of sensitive military cyber operations.  Second, we bolster international partnerships for cyber warfare to counter aggressive adversaries, including efforts to counter and mitigate adversarial propaganda efforts and information warfare campaigns.  Third, the bill continues to build and enhance our U.cyber warfare capabilities and activities.  Furthermore, Mr.Chairman, this bill reinforces counterterrorism and unconventional warfare capabilities by fully resourcing U.Special Operations Command's programs and activities and increasing congressional oversight of intelligence activities.  Finally, I would like to thank Mr.Rogers, chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, for including language that supports the decision for a future East Coast missile defense site.  I would like to thank Mr.Coffman, chairman of the Military Personnel Subcommittee, for including portions of my bill, the Lift the Relocation Burden From Military Spouses  Before I conclude, I would like to thank Chairman Mac Thornberry for his leadership, as well as my subcommittee ranking member, Congressman Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, for his bipartisan energy and cooperation on all of these issues.

6187,topic-id,1091,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I am proud to bring before the House H.2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. It was reported favorably by the House Armed Services Committee at 11:59 p.m. on June 28, 2017, by a vote of 60-1. Now, that vote is an indication of the bipartisan support that exists to support our troops and to fulfill our obligations placed on us by the  Mr.Chairman, I think it is always helpful for us to remind ourselves of the authority by which we undertake our responsibilities. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress has the power and the responsibility ``to raise and support . . . To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of land and naval Forces,'' and, of course, ``To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.''  The members of our committee and our staff take those responsibilities very seriously. This year, we seek to carry them out in a world which is as dangerous and complex as any of us have ever seen. One example from the news of the day is the alarming progress North Korea is making towards having an intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry nuclear weapons to our homeland.  Now, we have, of course, a number of tools to use, including diplomacy and sanctions, but there is no substitute for military power, and I believe we must develop and deploy more of it to be ready to deal with these growing threats.  So the bill before us today substantially increases money for missile defense so we are more capable of protecting our homeland against those ballistic missiles. It also increases funding for key munitions and for intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance so we can have better visibility on what adversary is doing.  It increases the end strength for the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, just as they requested. And it funds more joint exercises with key allies in the It boosts our shipbuilding budget to get more ships into the water faster, and also cheaper.  So, just as an example, Mr.Chairman, each of those items is important for dealing with this growing threat coming from North Korea, and we could sit here and go through a similar sort of discussion when it comes to Iran, or the provocative actions of Russia and China, or the terrorist organizations of various shades.  Of course, we cannot guarantee that the capabilities that we will vote on in this bill will be available by the time the crisis comes for, unfortunately, Mr.Chairman, we are still dealing with defense budgets that were cut by more than 20 percent at a time when the threats around the world were growing. So we can't guarantee that these capabilities will be available when we need them.  But what we can guarantee is, if we don't fund these things now, they will not be available when we need them, so that is the priority given to this bill.  Mr.Chairman, exactly 1 month ago, on June 12, Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford testified before our committee. And I would like to read just one paragraph of the Secretary's testimony where he was comparing what the military was like when he left it and when he came back as  Secretary Mattis testified: ``Four years later, I returned to the Department and I have been shocked by what I have seen with our readiness to fight. For all the heartache caused by the loss of our troops during these wars, no enemy in the field has done more harm to the readiness of our military than sequestration. We have sustained our ability to meet America's commitments abroad because our troops have stoically shouldered a much greater burden.''  Four years later, shocked, more harm by sequestration than the enemies in the field, and it is only because our folks are so incredible that they have born an increasing burden. That is what the Secretary testified.  Mr.Chairman, we have, indisputably, the finest military in the world, but it is also indisputable that it has been severely damaged by continuing resolutions, by sequestration, and by failure of the executive and legislative branches to adequately support the men and women out there on the front lines. We have an urgent need to begin to repair and rebuild our military.  And I also believe, Mr.Chairman, it is fundamentally wrong to send men and women out on dangerous missions without providing them the best equipment, in the best shape, with the best training that our country can possibly provide. This bill, if followed by matching appropriation, takes a significant step toward meeting that objective, to support those troops.  It also makes major reforms in the way the Pentagon does business. Among other reforms, it enables the military to buy commercial products through online sites such as Amazon, Staples, and We require life cycle maintenance costs to be considered at the beginning of a program, as must intellectual property rights, to maximize competition in the maintenance and repairs. Oversight into service contracts has increased, and there is much more, of course, in the bill.  Mr.Chairman, this bill is the vehicle by which we usually, for 55 years, at least, fulfill our responsibilities under the Constitution that I mentioned, to provide for the common defense. I believe that is the first job of the Federal  I want to just express my appreciation to each of the members of our committee. Each of them has contributed to the product before us. Each of them takes their responsibilities under the Constitution very seriously; no one more so than the Ranking Member, Mr.[[Page H5535]]Smith of We don't always agree on the judgment calls about issues, but I have no doubt that he and all the members of the committee try to do what is right for the country and put the interests of our troops first.  That is exactly the attitude that we must follow, I think, on the floor over the next 3 days as we go through the amendments which we will consider.  I also want to express appreciation to the committee and personal staff who have worked on this bill.  It has been a challenging year for a variety of reasons, but, as I started, I will finish. I am proud of this product. I hope it will gain the support of the entire  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-07-12-pt1-PgH5534-3.txt,1155,VENEZUELA,2017.0,12.0,May

6199,topic-id,176,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to make two points.  Number one, President Barack Obama was inaugurated in January 2009. The first national security strategy he submitted was in May of 2010, a year-and-a-half later. So I don't think it is completely unreasonable that we haven't yet gotten the national security strategy from the new administration.  Secondly, the pay raise for the troops is based on the statutory formula which is related to the cost of living. That is where it comes from. And it seems to me to say, no, you don't really get what the formula says you deserve, is not appropriate.  Now, the administration did not request it, and the criticism from some is that we should not provide it. I think if the formula is wrong, we should change it, but if the formula says that is how much the cost of living has gone up, we should provide it.

6214,topic-id,527,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Chairman, as usual, the gentleman from Washington makes a number of good points.  We absolutely need to have national security based on a strategy and fund that strategy. There are many of us who would argue that is not what has happened in recent years.  I would just point out it was not only President Obama, but also President Bush and President None of them provided a national security strategy in the first year that they were in office. I have tremendous confidence in Secretary Mattis, among others on the national security team. I believe they are looking at these issues and will provide us with a strategy.  The gentleman is also absolutely correct when he points out that the Defense Authorization bill is only one step in the process. There are many more steps to come.  I think we will have a budget on this floor to vote on shortly. I also expect that we are going to have appropriations to vote on at some point in the coming weeks. I also believe that we are going to have the opportunity to vote on dealing with the sequestration caps, which, by the way, the administration and I think most of us in the House and I presume most in the other body as well are in favor of doing away with because they have not been successful in accomplishing the goal for which they were put in place.  So there are clearly many more debates to have on other days. What we have this week on the floor before us is the Defense Authorization bill. And it is our obligation to authorize the things that the military needs.  I want to go back to the point that Mr.Banks made a few minutes ago. These are life-and-death decisions. Our hearts break, our prayers go out to the families of the 15 marines and the one sailor who lost their lives Monday of this week in the plane crash in Mississippi, just as our hearts go out and our prayers continue for the family members of the seven sailors who lost their lives off of Japan a few weeks ago.  What it reminds us is exactly what Mr.Banks said: this is a dangerous business, even on training mission, even on routine deployments. The men and women who volunteer to serve our country to protect us and to secure our freedoms deserve the very best our country can provide them. That is the goal of this bill: support the men and women who serve us and to further the national security of the United  You have heard from both sides of the aisle about many good things that are in this bill. We are going to go through a lot of amendments over the next several days.

6326,topic-id,727,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the new FDA Commissioner, or, more specifically, the role that the agency must play in tackling one of the biggest health crises of our day, one that I have personal experience with. Unless we act decisively, this crisis will only grow in terms of the staggering human and economic costs in the future.  That crisis is the Alzheimer's epidemic in this The reason I am[[Page S2884]]talking about Alzheimer's is it is truly a terrible condition that affects patients, their families, and communities across the I learned firsthand about Alzheimer's disease when my mother was robbed of many of her Golden Years at a relatively early age, in her seventies.  Currently, more than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, including an estimated 160,000 in my own State of North Estimates project the number of Alzheimer's patients to grow to 16 million by 2050, with an annual cost of more than $1 trillion to the healthcare system.  Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United It is a current and growing problem. It is the only top 10 disease for causes of death that cannot be prevented. It can't be cured. We can't even slow the pace of the disease. Simply put, we need a war on Alzheimer's disease like we have on cancer.  As a country, we must take the fight to this awful disease. This should be one of our highest priorities, to support the discovery and development of new medicines for the millions of patients who currently have Alzheimer's and the millions more who may develop it in the future. We need medicines to slow the progression of the disease. We need medicines to reverse its affects. We need medicines to cure Alzheimer's disease. One day, we need medicines to prevent it in the first place.  That is where the FDA comes in. The new Commissioner must make Alzheimer's an urgent priority. Obviously, the science of developing new medicines and technologies is complicated under any circumstances. Those challenges are only compounded by the fact that we still do not fully understand the disease, its causes, or how to stop it, but the FDA does hard things and they often do them very well.  The new Commissioner must ask tough questions of the agency: Are they doing everything they possibly can to encourage the development of safe and effective new drugs for Alzheimer's? Are they using all the tools at their disposal and using them flexibly to advance this goal? Do they have the right policies to be facilitators of and not barriers to important efforts to innovate in this space?  I recently visited with Gottlieb in my office and was pleased to hear the battle against Alzheimer's is a mission-critical item for him. I assume that pervades the I want to be clear. I do not know the answers to the questions related to FDA's specific regulatory policies related to Alzheimer's.  I think those determinations are best left to scientific and medical experts, but I know the status quo, the current standard of care, and the set of FDA-approved treatment options is not enough for patients or our Inaction is not acceptable. America is at its finest when we come together to do big things. Now is the time to commit to stopping the suffering and death from Alzheimer's.  The FDA cannot do this alone. This is an all-hands-on-deck kind of battle, but FDA will play a critical role in tackling this vital public health priority. I was pleased to vote for Gottlieb's confirmation yesterday. I look forward to working with him to ensure that we are doing everything we can to defeat Alzheimer's. For those of us who have been and will continue to be Alzheimer's caretakers, I hope we will see a cure in our lifetime. Those who are afflicted by the disease deserve it. It is a fiscal crisis we can avert. With the right focus by the FDA and this Congress, I am absolutely convinced this is a disease we can take the war to and win the war in our lifetime in the near future.  I encourage the FDA and all of my Members to stand in battling this terrible disease so we can end it once and for all.  I yield the floor.

6217,topic-id,1468,"Madam President, I come to the Senate floor every year around this time to discuss an important incident in the history of Rhode Island largely overlooked in the history books, certainly overlooked in consequence to its importance.  We have to understand that we Rhode Islanders have always had a pretty fierce independent streak. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was founded by Roger Williams and others fleeing the harsh ideological conformity of the Massachusetts theocracy. Our 1663 charter, describing the colony as a ``lively experiment,'' is the first formal document in all of history granting to a political entity the separation of church and state, along with unprecedented freedoms of speech.  Rhode Island was the first colony to declare its independence from Britain, on the Fourth of May, 1776--2 months before the rest of you did on the Fourth of July--and we were the last colony to join the Union, waiting for an independent Bill of Like I said, an independent streak.  Colonial Rhode Islanders chafed at the inequities of British rule, especially the disruption of our liberty at sea. We are the Ocean Living and working on the water has always been a Rhode Island way of life. As tensions with the American Colonies grew, however, King George III stationed revenue cutters, armed Customs patrol vessels, in the waters of Narragansett Bay to prevent smuggling, enforce the payment of taxes, and impose British sovereignty.  In 1764, after a British ship called the HMS John stole goods from Newport merchants, a group of Rhode Islanders seized control of Fort George on Goat Island in Newport Harbor and fired cannons on the vessel.  In 1769, the HMS Liberty, a sloop confiscated by the British from none other than John Hancock and repurposed as a Customs vessel, was boarded, scuttled, and burned by a mob of angry Rhode  In 1772, on a dark night, a band of Rhode Islanders destroyed the HMS Gaspee, one of the most hated imperial ships, drawing what the Rhode Island abolitionist Frances Whipple McDougall called, in 1884, ``The first blood in the Revolution.''  The Gaspee and its captain, Lieutenant William Dudingston, were known for destroying Rhode Islanders' vessels, seizing their cargo, and flagging down ships to harass, humiliate, and interrogate the As historian Steven Park describes in his new book, ``The Burning of His Majesty's Schooner Gaspee: An Attack on Crown Rule Before the American Revolution,'' the Gaspee was an unwelcome, even hated, presence in Narragansett Rhode Island Deputy Darius Sessions complained to Joseph Wanton, in March 1772, that Lieutenant Dudingston had ``no legal authority to justify his conduct, and his commission . . . [was] more of a fiction than anything else.''  When British authorities assured Governor Wanton that Dudingston was there to protect the Rhode Island colony from pirates, the Governor replied that he didn't know whether Dudingston was protecting them from pirates or was the pirate himself.  On June 9, 1772, all this tension came to a head. On this day, Rhode Island Captain Benjamin Lindsey was en route to Providence from Newport in his ship the He was ordered by the hated Gaspee to halt for inspection. Captain Lindsey refused, and he raced up Narragansett Bay--despite warning shots fired at the The Gaspee[[Page S3282]]gave chase to the Hannah, and Captain Lindsey, who knew the waters of Narragansett Bay far better than Dudingston did, steered his ship north toward Pawtuxet Cove in Warwick, right over the shallows off of Namquid Point--known today as Gaspee The lighter Hannah was able to shoot over those shallows, but the heavier Gaspee ran aground and stuck firm in a sandbar in a falling tide. The British ship and her crew were stranded and would need to wait many hours before a rising tide could free them.  Wasting no time, Captain Lindsey sailed up to Providence, and with the help of the respected merchant and statesman John Brown, rallied a group of Rhode Island patriots at Sabin's Tavern, in what is now the East Side of Together, after suitable refreshment, the group resolved to end the Gaspee's menace in Rhode Island waters.  That night, 80 or so men shoved off from the wharf under a moonless sky, with their faces blackened and their oarlocks muffled, paddling eight longboats down Narragansett Bay toward the stranded The longboats silently surrounded the Gaspee, and the Rhode Islanders shouted for Lieutenant Dudingston to surrender his ship. As Daniel Harrington recounted in the Providence Journal, ``Captain Abraham Whipple spoke first for the Rhode Islanders, summoning Dudingston: `I am sheriff of Kent County, [expletive]. I have a warrant to apprehend you, [expletive]; so surrender, [expletive].' It was a classic Rhode Island greeting!''  Surprised and enraged, Dudingston refused and ordered his men to fire upon anyone who attempted to board the Gunshots struck out in the night, and musket balls hit Lieutenant Dudingston in his groin and his arm. The Rhode Islanders, outnumbering the British, swarmed onto the deck and commandeered the ship. Brown ordered one of his Rhode Islanders, a physician named John Mawney, to tend to Lieutenant Dudingston's wounds.  After properly plundering the lieutenant's quarters, the patriots removed the British crew to land and returned to torch the Ultimately, the flames reached the powder magazine, and the resulting blast echoed across the bay as the dreaded Gaspee blew to smithereens.  When word got back to the King, he was furious, and he offered huge royal rewards for the capture of the rebels who had done this deed, but, strangely enough, no Rhode Islander would step forward to finger the perpetrators. You have to admire, under that kind of pressure, that with 80 people who had gone down in those longboats, not one Rhode Islander would spill the beans.  Word spread throughout the Colonies of this incident and of the Crown's brand of justice. Samuel Adams wrote a letter in the Providence Gazette on December 26, 1772, that read, in part:       A court of inquisition, more horrid than that of Spain or      Portugal, is established within this colony, to inquire into      the circumstances of destroying the Gaspee schooner; and the      persons who are the commissioners of this new-fangled court,      are vested with most exorbitant and unconstitutional power.      They are directed to summon witnesses, apprehend persons not      only impeached, but even suspected! And . . . to deliver them      to Admiral Montagu, who is ordered to have a ship in      readiness to carry them to England, where they are to be      tried.  The Reverend John Allen delivered at the Second Baptist Church in Boston a Thanksgiving sermon on the Gaspee Affair that was distributed in pamphlet form throughout the His words helped rouse the spirit of independence of this fledgling He said:       Supposing . . . that the Rhode Islanders, for the sake of      the blood-bought liberties of their forefathers, for the sake      of the birthrights of their children, should show a spirit of      resentment against a tyrannical arbitrary power that attempts      to destroy their lives, liberties and property, would it not      be insufferably cruel (for this which the law of nature and      nations teaches them to do) to be butchered, assassinated and      slaughtered in their own streets by their own King?  Well, schoolchildren's history books tell a tale of Bostonians who dressed up in funny outfits and climbed onto a British boat and pushed bales of tea into the harbor, but not enough schoolchildren know of the bravery of the Rhode Islanders who, more than a year earlier, fired the first shots and drew the first blood in the quest for American independence. It is a fine thing, I am sure, to push tea bales off a boat. We blew the boat up, and we did it more than a year earlier.  Rhode Islanders are justifiably proud of our role in our rebellion. We have made a tradition of celebrating the Gaspee incident with the annual Gaspee Days celebration and parade through An independent study group at Brown University is adapting the tale of the Gaspee into a virtual reality educational experience so you can put on the goggles and reenact the experience of the Gaspee, marrying Rhode Island history with cutting-edge technology to engage middle and high school students in this history.  Someday soon, children across the country may be able to join Captain Whipple and John Brown and step into a virtual longboat, coast down a virtual Narragansett Bay, and watch the sky over a virtual Rhode Island, alight with the fire of revolution.

6100,topic-id,1559,"Madam President, the American people have spent the last several weeks hearing that the Senate will vote on its new version of TrumpCare by the end of the month. It is now June 19, and the American people are still in the dark about this bill. There is no text. There is no legislative analysis of this bill and no scoring of what the financial ramifications are. The American people--and much of this Senate--are in the dark. We are in the dark about how much costs are going to rise, in the dark about how many people are going to lose insurance, and in the dark about whether a preexisting condition will once again be used as a weapon against them by insurance companies.  If news reports are to be believed--and that is all we have right now--a vote on this massive proposal affecting the lives of virtually all our people is days away. No one outside of a group of 13 men--all Republicans--knows what is being considered. In my view, this is as stark an example of legislative malpractice as I can remember.  It is time for Americans to get loud, to do their part, and to make sure their voices are heard on an issue that is so personal and so vital to our people and their families.  If and when this bill hits the floor, the debate is going to go by very quickly. By the standards of the Senate, it will be over in a flash. So this afternoon, I want to be direct with a few key points for those across this country to remember over the next two weeks.  First, the Republican healthcare plan is going to raise costs for the typical If you are an older person nearing retirement--55, 58, 61--you are going to get hammered with an age tax. You are going to be forced to pay several times as much as a younger person for health insurance.  Under the House TrumpCare bill, 64-year-old seniors of modest means are going to see their premiums shoot up by 800 percent. I would like to hear somebody try to explain to a lifelong trucker or to someone who has spent decades cleaning offices to put food on their family's table why that is an improvement in American healthcare.  These are older people who already struggle to make ends meet, and they have been told for the last 7 years that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act is going to lower their healthcare costs. Now they face the reality of TrumpCare, which says that they will somehow have to spend the bulk of their income on health insurance and, in some cases, it will take up nearly all of it.  It is not just older people who face this age tax that will see their costs rise. TrumpCare cuts middle-class tax benefits for healthcare that were put in place under the Affordable Care Act, particularly in rural areas. That means premiums are going to be a much bigger burden on typical middle-class families.  The Republican healthcare plan ends the air-tight, loophole-free guarantee that protects Americans from being discriminated against for a preexisting condition. Working adults--30, 40, 50 years old--who thought they were home free with employer-sponsored insurance, under this bill could, once again, face some of the worst insurance company abuses, including annual and lifetime limits on benefits.  One new report says 27 million Americans could get hit by annual limits and 20 million could face lifetime limits.  Here is what this means: A 35-year-old, for example, who develops cancer could bust that cap in a hurry. If you have to go through expensive surgeries and chemotherapy, busting those caps could mean facing decades--decades--digging out from medical debt.  Second, TrumpCare is built around the $800 billion attack on Today, Medicaid comes with a guarantee: If you walk an economic tightrope, are sick or injured, you will get the care you need. You can't be denied benefits, but slashing the program by hundreds of billions of dollars ends that guarantee because States are going to have to cut benefits. The best way to understand the consequences of that plan is to look at seniors who need nursing home care.  The Medicaid nursing home benefit helps pick up the tab for two out of three nursing home beds in America because, the fact is, growing old in America gets expensive. You can do everything right through a lifetime of hard work, scrimping and saving, putting off vacations or big purchases to be financially prudent, but still, a lot of people go through their savings. That is when Medicaid steps in for seniors to help cover the cost of nursing homes and other long-term care. One year in a nursing home now costs more[[Page S3571]]than $90,000, on average. That is two or three times as much as a year of college education. If TrumpCare slashes Medicaid so deeply that seniors are in danger of losing the nursing home benefit, how are families, fighting hard to pay their own bills, going to be in a position to take care of older loved ones?  Of course, Medicaid does a lot more than cover nursing home care. Thirty-seven million kids are enrolled in Medicaid, a vital source of support for kids and adults with disabilities.  Medicaid is the only lifeline that thousands and thousands of Americans fighting opioid addiction have to be able to put their lives back together. No community anywhere in this country has escaped the opioid epidemic. Since Medicaid was expanded under the Affordable Care Act, it has been leading the fight against the opioid epidemic by improving access for millions of people for treatment of mental health and substance abuse orders, but with the Republican plan's enormous cuts, thousands of people could lose their best shot to recover from addiction and lead healthy lives.  Finally, what is especially unfortunate about this legislation is the process for writing this bill. It is being written behind closed doors, no input from across the aisle and particularly from the American people.  I serve as the ranking member on the Senate Finance Our committee has authority over hundreds of billions of dollars in payments for Medicare, Medicaid, and tax credits. We haven't had any hearings. We haven't seen a bill. There is not the traditional process of a committee markup to consider legislation. We are also the committee that on a staff level, always has tried to work back and forth between Democrats and Republicans to try to find common ground, but with the majority leader keeping the process locked behind closed doors, Chairman Hatch and I, along with all of the Democrats and most of the Republicans on our committee, have simply been cut out.  Back in the runup to the Affordable Care Act--the one that President Obama was involved in, in 2009--the Finance Committee held more than 50 hearings and roundtables, and we walked through carefully the healthcare reform bill. When the legislation was introduced, it sat online for 6 days before it was voted on in the committee, 564 amendments were posted online, more than 130 amendments were considered during the markup, more than two dozen Republican amendments were adopted, and the bill passed on a bipartisan basis.  Again, let me highlight: More than two dozen Republican amendments were adopted in the Finance As of now, there will not be a single Democratic amendment adopted in the Finance When the legislation went to the floor, the Senate spent 25 consecutive legislative days on healthcare reform--the second longest consecutive session in history.  That is how the legislative process ought to look: The committees do the hard work in the open, gather input from the American people, have a chance--Democrats and Republicans--to work together. That is not what is happening on This is a bill shrouded in secrecy and the public is kept in the dark. There aren't going to be any hearings on the impact it is going to have on the millions of people who rely on Medicaid for health insurance, no hearings on what it means if you have all these loopholes in the guarantee of protection Americans now have against discrimination for a preexisting condition, no hearings asking how a 64-year-old of limited means is supposed to deal with an age tax that swallows up most of their income. When the Senate Republican healthcare bill hits the floor, there will be a very short debate before time expires and the final votes are cast.  I am going to close by saying now is the time for Americans to be heard on healthcare. It is the time for Americans to speak out. For those who have a story about how TrumpCare will affect their family, you can share it on my website at wyden.senate.gov or you can use the hashtag ``America Speaks Out.''  I intend to be back on the floor with my colleagues, and many of us will be here often in the hours and days ahead, but I want to close by way of saying political change doesn't start at the top and then trickle down. Political change is bottoms up, as Americans across the country speak out and speak loudly. Now is the time to do that because this debate is coming fast.  I yield the floor.
