              HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM ``RYAN'' OWENS

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, on January 29, 2017, U.S. Navy Chief Special 
Warfare Operator William ``Ryan'' Owens was killed during a raid in 
Yemen. At the age of 36, he gave the ultimate sacrifice in order to 
protect our great Nation. He is survived by his wife and three young 
children.
  This week I introduced a bill which would rename the Chillicothe, 
Illinois, post office in honor of Ryan's life and service as a Navy 
SEAL. My office and I worked closely with the U.S. Postal Service, the 
U.S. Navy Congressional Liaison Office, Central Illinois Gold Star 
Families, and, most importantly, Ryan's family. All of us were 
determined to make sure we got this right. His wife ultimately made the 
decision to name the post office after Ryan in Chillicothe, a town in 
my district, where Ryan graduated high school.
  This effort has the backing and bipartisan support of the entire 
Illinois delegation, and it is our hope that the post office will 
forever remind the community of their hometown hero and his commitment 
to serving our country.
  While we can never fully repay Chief Owens and his family for the 
sacrifices he made, renaming the post office in his honor is a small 
effort to thank him for his service and his dedication to protecting 
America.
  He and his family are forever in our hearts and prayers.
