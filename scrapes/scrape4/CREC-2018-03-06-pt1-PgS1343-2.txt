                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, You are our refuge. Give us wisdom to live so we never 
disgrace Your Name. Provide our lawmakers with power and insight to 
accomplish Your will on Earth as they look to You for help. Please 
become for them their shade by day and defense by night. As they 
acknowledge that You alone are the source of their strength, surround 
them with the shield of Your favor, and direct their steps.
  Lord, we also ask You to bring a spiritual awakening to our Nation 
and world, prompting people to experience the transformative power of 
Your mercy and grace. Arise, O God, and defend Your purposes in these 
grand and challenging times.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
