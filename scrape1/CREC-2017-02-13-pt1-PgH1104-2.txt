         NO TRAFFICKING IN OUR CITY, OUR STATE, OR OUR COUNTRY

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Houston recently hosted the exciting 
Super Bowl LI. As Texas welcomed people from across the United States, 
the message was clear: no trafficking, not in our city, not in our 
State, not in our country.
  As exploiters and buyers roamed the streets looking for prey, Mayor 
Turner, the Department of Homeland Security, and local law enforcement 
were prepared to jail traffickers and rescue victims.
  Well, Mr. Speaker, 183 sex buyers and nine traffickers were arrested; 
76 victims were rescued. The local news showed the faces of the 
arrested traffickers and buyers across the bottom of Houston television 
screens. The days of hiding in plain sight are over.
  I am proud of all the work by Houston, the NFL, local law 
enforcement, all worked together to track down traffickers and buyers 
during the Super Bowl, making the game a huge success.
  As the game moves to Minnesota next year, those in the slave trade 
need to know the law will be ready to capture them.
  And that is just the way it is.
