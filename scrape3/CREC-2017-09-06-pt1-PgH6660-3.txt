                         TRIBUTE TO BOB REDFORD

  (Mr. ESTES of Kansas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ESTES of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Bob 
Redford, who founded the Walnut Valley Festival in the Fourth District 
of Kansas back in 1972, and served more than 40 years as its president. 
Bob Redford passed away in December of last year.
  Bob Redford's dedication to live music resulted in this legendary 
event, which is one of the longest running music festivals in U.S. 
history. For 46 years, pickers and music lovers have journeyed to this 
special place on the Kansas plains to celebrate life with music.
  Bob Redford gave so much to the community in Cowley County and 
dedicated years of service to leading and promoting this iconic 
festival that has become known as Pickers Paradise.
  There is no place on earth like the Walnut Valley Festival, which is 
home to national and international instrument championship contests and 
where thousands return year after year to experience outstanding live 
music, in the grandstands, performed by world famous musicians, along 
with legendary campground jams.
  Bob Redford's legacy lives in the community of musicians and music 
lovers from around the world, who will gather next weekend in the pecan 
grove along the Walnut River in Winfield, Kansas, for the 46th Annual 
Walnut Valley Festival.
