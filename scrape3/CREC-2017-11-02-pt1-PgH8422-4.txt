American Revolution, the Mercer Museum and Fonthill Castle, Libertae, 
The Open Link, YWCA Bucks County, and the Central Bucks County Family

facilitated by these organizations is a tribute to both these nonprofit 
leaders and their members.
  Bucks County is made a better place because of the amazing people we 
have committed to our nonprofit community. We thank them for giving 
their time, their energy, and their passion in serving a cause bigger 
than themselves.
