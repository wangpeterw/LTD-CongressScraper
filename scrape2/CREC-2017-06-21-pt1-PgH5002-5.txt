                    HONORING ELSIE FIGUEROA JOHNSON

  (Mr. HOLDING asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Elsie 
Johnson, who passed away last week at her Raleigh home.
  Elsie was born in Puerto Rico to Gilbert and Maria Figueroa, and it 
was there during World War II that she met her husband, Carl Johnson, a 
North Carolinian and a U.S. Navy sailor stationed at Roosevelt Roads 
Naval Base.
  Elsie and Carl lived the American Dream. Together, they started a 
small business, a motor shop, which grew into a franchise automobile 
dealership in New Bern, North Carolina, and, under the leadership of 
their son, David, now spans dealerships from Maryland to Florida. David 
learned from his parents the value of hard work and excellent customer 
service.
  Elsie was a woman of incredible faith in God. She was strong, wise, 
and honest. Mr. Speaker, she made a difference and she leaves a legacy.
  May God bless her family.
