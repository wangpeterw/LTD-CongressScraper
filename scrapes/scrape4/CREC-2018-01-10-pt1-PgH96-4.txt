CONGRATULATING CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
                          LANDSCAPING STUDENTS

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the landscaping students at the Central Pennsylvania 
Institute of Science and Technology for their fourth consecutive first-
place win at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.
  CPI students again took home the top prize this year in the 
agricultural education landscape exhibits. In total, eight schools 
entered this competition at the Farm Show, which is the Nation's 
largest indoor agricultural event.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the following students who are a part of 
the winning team: Charlee Marshall, Alexis Witherite, Landon Wagner, 
Jarod Williams, Robert Ficarro, and Calen McCool.
  The students have learned from CPI's horticulture and landscaping 
instructor Joe Luther. Just a couple of weeks ago, Mr. Luther was named 
the National Career and Technical Education Teacher of the Year.
  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Career and Technical 
Education Caucus, I am most proud of these CPI students and Mr. Luther 
for being four-time first-place champions at the Pennsylvania Farm 
Show.
  I congratulate them, and I know that they will continue this fine 
tradition of being the team to beat at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.
