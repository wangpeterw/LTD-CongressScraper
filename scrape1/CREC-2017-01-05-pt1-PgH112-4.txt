              WEST VIRGINIANS WANT THEIR VOICE TO BE HEARD

  (Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we are about to vote on 
the REINS Act, which will hold our agencies accountable to the people 
of America. I am a proud cosponsor of this regulation, this 
legislation. If a regulation has a high economic cost, then the people, 
through Congress, have to approve it before it goes into effect.
  The REINS Act is one of several bills we will be considering this 
week to stop business as usual in Washington. We will be saying ``no'' 
to the overregulations of the last 8 years, ``no'' to the radical anti-
coal agenda that has closed coal mines and cost my State of West 
Virginia thousands of jobs, ``no'' to a Federal Government that won't 
even come to West Virginia to hear how their regulations affect us.
  West Virginians have had enough. They want change. They want their 
voice to be heard. They want to work hard and put food on their table.
  I am here to stand up for West Virginians: families, miners, and 
small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support the REINS Act.
