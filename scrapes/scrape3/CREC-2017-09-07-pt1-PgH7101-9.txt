                 HONORING GREG BRUNT OF CATAWBA COUNTY

  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order to honor a Catawba 
County native.
  Mr. Greg Brunt has won more than 100 medals in the Special Olympics 
and serves as an inspiration to the wider Catawba community and, in my 
opinion, the Nation.
  Mr. Brunt's road cannot have been easy. He has overcome challenges 
that many Americans don't have to face. Instead of giving in, Mr. Brunt 
gives back. As a swimming instructor to younger students, Mr. Brunt 
teaches children the value of practice and perseverance.
  Mr. Brunt has earned many Special Olympic medals, and has aspirations 
of being in the Catawba County Hall of Fame. Though I am not a voting 
member of the board, Mr. Brunt would have my vote.
  Additionally, I was thrilled to learn that Mr. Brunt is a man of 
faith, who attends Corinth Reformed Church, and that his favorite song 
is ``Amazing Grace.''
  When I think of the amazing accomplishments Mr. Brunt has achieved, I 
cannot help but think, how sweet the sound.
  I wholeheartedly congratulate Mr. Brunt on all of his many wins, and 
wish him continued success.
