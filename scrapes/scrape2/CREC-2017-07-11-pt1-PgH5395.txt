                PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUCCESSFUL G20 SUMMIT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump's 
success during his overseas trip to Poland and the G20 summit in 
Germany makes it clear that America is once again the clear leader of 
the free world.
  In Poland, the President reaffirmed that Western nations will stand 
together against threats to our security and our way of life. His 
remarks focused on his strategy of peace through strength--increasing 
defense spending, confirming our commitment to NATO, and promoting 
American energy as an alternative to Russian sources in Eastern Europe.
  During the G20, President Trump made it clear that, under his 
leadership, America remains committed to blocking the funding of 
terrorism and extremism, empowering women across the world, affirming 
the right of nations to defend themselves, and pledging to end unfair 
trade. Additionally, working with other foreign leaders, he 
successfully negotiated a cease-fire in Syria.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Sadly, Canada has 
forgotten the 26 Canadians murdered on 9/11 by awarding millions of 
dollars to a confessed terrorist who killed U.S. Army Sergeant First 
Class Christopher Speer, putting American families and Canadian 
families at risk.
