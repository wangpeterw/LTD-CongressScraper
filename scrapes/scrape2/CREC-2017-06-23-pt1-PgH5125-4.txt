         CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION COVERS MANY INDUSTRIES

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House 
unanimously approved the Strengthening Career and Technical Education 
for the 21st Century Act, to give Americans who enter the workforce the 
skills they need to succeed.

  I was proud to sponsor that bill with Congressman Raja 
Krishnamoorthi. It will help all Americans across all sectors and 
industries because all education is career education.
  As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Agriculture, I want to talk about food service careers.
  Earlier this spring, I had the opportunity to visit the DC Central 
Kitchen right here in our Nation's Capital. DC Central Kitchen feeds 
the most vulnerable among us, but it fights hunger differently: it 
offers skills-based education, empowerment, and career opportunities 
that allow people to finally be free from hunger and poverty.
  The CEO there said, ``You can't feed your way out of poverty,'' and I 
wholeheartedly agree. DC Central Kitchen feeds the hungry, but also 
teaches people the skills needed to find employment in the hospitality 
industry. That is a CTE program: helping people find jobs that pay 
living wages and obtain lasting careers.
  Now, that is something we can all get behind.
