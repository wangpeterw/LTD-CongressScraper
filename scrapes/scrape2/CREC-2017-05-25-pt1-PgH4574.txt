              CBO SCORE OF TRUMPCARE PAINTS A DIRE PICTURE

  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, the new American Health Care Act CBO score 
released yesterday reinforces that this bill is devastating to the 
American people: 14 million more will be uninsured within just one 
year, and 23 million more will be uninsured over a decade.
  This analysis paints a dire picture. It confirms that TrumpCare will 
shift the burden of costs onto our seniors, millions of hardworking 
families, and patients with preexisting conditions. Those hit hardest 
are exactly the people who need care the most, all while giving tax 
breaks to millionaires and billionaires.
  What is more, this analysis debunks the gimmicks Republican leaders 
tried to sell us, saying the bill would do no harm to those with 
preexisting illnesses. In fact, patients with preexisting conditions 
will have less coverage, be forced to pay more, and even be priced out 
of the market, just as we expected.
  This is far too great a toll on the American people, and we must do 
better.
