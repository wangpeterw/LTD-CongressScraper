                         THANKING ALL VETERANS

  (Mr. CORREA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, all gave some, and some made the ultimate 
sacrifice. This Saturday is Veterans Day, a day we pause to honor the 
brave men and women from our communities who have served our country. 
Veterans represent the best in America. Veterans embody loyalty and 
honor by always putting their fellow soldiers and country before 
themselves.
  Veterans prove this determination in getting the mission done. This 
country has made a promise to every person who puts on that uniform. 
You stand for us, and we will stand for you. Their mission was 
protecting us. Our mission in Congress is to protect them.
  To all of our vets, thank you for your service. Thank you for serving 
our country.
