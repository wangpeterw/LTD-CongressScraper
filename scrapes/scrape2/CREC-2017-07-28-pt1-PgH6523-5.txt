                     WELCOMING PASTOR SCOTT POLING

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Hultgren) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today pleased to welcome Pastor 
Scott Poling, who graciously delivered our opening prayer in the House 
this morning.
  For more than 20 years, Pastor Scott has faithfully led the 
congregation at Harvest New Beginnings Church in Oswego, Illinois, 
where my family and I attend.
  His passion for evangelism and outreach is contagious. Those touched 
by his ministry have seen firsthand his energy and passion for people 
around the globe.
  When he is not running ultra-marathons or playing tennis, he spends 
time expanding the church's international ministry, and has equipped 
African pastors with the leadership skills to carry God's truth into 
their congregations.
  Scott and his wife, Carla, are celebrating 26 years of life-giving 
marriage, along with their five beautiful children.
  Pastor Scott, we praise God for how your ministry has affected so 
many, and our legislative work is blessed by your prayers over us 
today.
