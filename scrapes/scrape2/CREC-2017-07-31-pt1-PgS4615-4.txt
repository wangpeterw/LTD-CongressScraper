                        TRIBUTE TO CONOR POWERS

 Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity to express my appreciation to Conor for his hard work as an 
intern in the Senate Republican Policy Committee. I recognize his 
efforts and contributions to my office as well as to the State of 
Wyoming.
  Conor is a native of New York. He currently attends Boston College, 
where he is studying political science. He has demonstrated a strong 
work ethic, which has made him an invaluable asset to our office. The 
quality of his work is reflected in his great efforts over the last 
several months.
  I want to thank Conor for the dedication he has shown while working 
for me and my staff. It is a pleasure to have him as part of our team. 
I know he will have continued success with all of his future endeavors. 
I wish him all my best on his journey.
