                 SIKH AWARENESS AND APPRECIATION MONTH

  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate California's Sikh 
American Awareness and Appreciation Month and to recognize the 
contributions that Sikh Americans have made not only in California, but 
throughout the country.
  This community originally came from Punjab, India, like other 
immigrant groups from all over the world, to have a better life for 
themselves and for their children.
  In 1910, the Sikhs had become a cornerstone in California 
agriculture's Sacramento, Imperial, and San Joaquin Valleys. In 
addition to sharing the rich culture and the contributions that they 
have made to our economy, they are farmers, businessowners, physicians, 
and in all walks of life.
  Sikh Americans stand with all Americans in their patriotism and 
values. Beginning with World War I, Sikhs have served in all of the 
American wars. Sikh communities promote the values of diversity, 
equality, freedom, justice, and giving back to our country.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and 
celebrating the many contributions of Sikh Americans, which have made 
us a stronger nation and play an integral role in the health of the San 
Joaquin Valley and our Nation.
