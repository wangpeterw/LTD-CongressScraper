                      HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LILLIAN COX

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I work for the Texans in Meadows Place. They 
are led by Mayor Charles Jessup. The locals call Meadows Place the best 
square mile of small-town America.
  Meadows Place has a secret. Shhhhh. Every man who lives there is in 
love with the same woman. We all love Lillian Cox.
  Lillian turned 110 on February 22. In 352 days, I am taking Lillian 
out for her 111th birthday. She will put on a nice dress, a necklace, 
and earrings. I will take her to the Live Oak Grill, where she will 
have the fried catfish she loves so much. I will have the chicken fried 
steak. And we may go dancing, if I can keep up with her.
  Lillian, happy 110th birthday. I will pick you up at 5 p.m. on 
February 22, 2018.
