                HONORING THOSE WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM

  (Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember those 
who fought and died for our freedom, to thank the brave men and women 
who today defend our freedom, and to recognize the sacrifice of all 
their families.
  Pennsylvania has produced some of the greatest examples of valor and 
bravery the world has ever seen. It is home to pivotal moments in 
American history, like Gettysburg, Valley Forge, and the Battle of Lake 
Erie. Pennsylvania's sons have stormed the beaches of Normandy. They 
have liberated the oppressed from fascism and communism, and they have 
sought out terror in the depths of Afghanistan and Iraq in order to 
protect our way of life.
  Memorial Day is coming up this weekend. We will all enjoy time with 
our families and friends, but we must always remember that is only 
possible because of the brave men and women who gave what Abraham 
Lincoln called the ``last full measure of devotion,'' and those who 
protect us today.
