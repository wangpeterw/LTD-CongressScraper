                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Almighty God, all power and authority belong to You. You even rule 
the raging of the sea.
  Guide our lawmakers as they strive to serve Your purposes for their 
lives in this generation. May they acknowledge You as the source of 
their strength, finding their security in the wisdom and love of Your 
unfolding providence. Make our Senators a shining example of 
trustworthy and responsible stewardship. Use them to strengthen the 
moral fiber of our Nation and world. Lord, give them a renewed sense of 
reverence and wonder that You have chosen them to serve You and 
country.
  We pray in Your gracious Name. Amen.
