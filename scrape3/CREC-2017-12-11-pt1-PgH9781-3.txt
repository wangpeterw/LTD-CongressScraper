                      RECOGNIZING WILLIAM ADAMCAK

  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
life of Mr. William Adamcak, who passed away on November 23, 2017, at 
98 years of age.
  Mr. Adamcak was a true patriot and an American war hero, serving in 
World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. He received the 
Purple Heart for his service in D-day during World War II. Even though 
he and the rest of the Allied forces faced heavy Nazi resistance, Mr. 
Adamcak led his men through the infamous Omaha Beach and into the 
French uplands, where they dug foxholes.
  Huddled in their foxholes, they faced heavy mortar attack from the 
Germans. But through Mr. Adamcak's bravery, training, and leadership, 
he led his men to a successful completion of their mission.
  Mr. William Adamcak was a living legend and hero, and I could not be 
more honored to recognize this man from the Greatest Generation on the 
House floor today. He will truly be missed.
