   REPUBLICANS NEED TO PRODUCE A BUDGET SO WE CAN SERVE THE AMERICAN 
                                 PEOPLE

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this House needs to get the job done for the 
American people and make sure that we operate by regular order. That 
means we want to pass bills here so that we can operate the Government 
of the United States, whether it is the Department of Defense, the 
Small Business Administration, or across the range of departments and 
agencies. But you can't do that well unless you have a budget.
  Now, the Republicans control this House, the Republicans control the 
Senate, and the Republicans control the White House. They should be 
able to agree among themselves to pass a budget; and then when, as an 
appropriator, we pass our 12 appropriation bills, we are given a number 
and we mark up those 12 bills and we don't go over budget.
  But guess what. The Republicans can't produce a budget.
  Later this week, we are told the Military-Veterans Affairs 
appropriation bill will be marked up in committee and money will be put 
in that bill. The problem with that is, if we put the money in that 
bill, how do we know that we will be able to have money left over for 
the other 11 bills to fund seniors' Meals on Wheels or the 
infrastructure bill that people are talking about?
  We have a real problem. The Republicans need to do the job and 
produce a budget so that we can serve the American people as they 
expect us to do.
