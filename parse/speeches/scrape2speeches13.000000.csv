Mr.Speaker, I rise today to honor a great leader, the Reverend William Barber As the president of North Carolina's chapter of the NAACP, Reverend Barber has become a national icon and a champion of moral leadership. He is the founder of Moral He has traveled to more than 20 States to train others on tactics in civil disobedience.  And under his leadership, the NAACP fiercely fought against discriminatory legislation such as North Carolina's HB2 and voter suppression tactics like voter ID laws.[[Page H4520]]  After 12 years as president of the North Carolina NAACP, Reverend Barber is retiring to lead a new campaign--a national call for a moral revival. This new coalition of spiritual leaders will push beyond politics to guide our Nation toward a path of increased equality and social justice.  Reverend Barber's leadership of the NAACP will be sorely missed, but I look forward to witnessing the many ways in which he will continue to impact lives and make America a more just and fair place.  Thank you, Reverend                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4519-6.txt,2201,REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 60,2017.0,24.0,May
10526,topic-id,295,"Mr.Speaker, at this time in our Nation, protecting our local law[[Page H4241]]enforcement and first responders could not be more important. Tens of thousands of law enforcement and first responders around the country put their lives on the line every single day to serve their communities. Sadly, statistics show that simply doing their jobs has become very dangerous for these individuals.  In 2016, police officer shootings increased by 56 percent nationally, with ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increasing by a staggering 167 percent. These dramatic numbers demonstrate that more protection is needed for our law enforcement officers.  In my home State of Texas, 17 law enforcement officers gave their lives just last year, including five who were killed in the horrible assault that targeted police officers in Dallas, On Monday, in recognition of National Police Week, we honored fallen law enforcement officers at a memorial ceremony in Deer Park, Texas, in my district.  We need the Thin Blue Line Act, which would make the killing of a local or State law enforcement officer or first responder an aggravating factor in Federal death penalty determinations. It is important that our local and State police officers and first responders have the same safeguards that Federal law enforcement officers already have.  The local law enforcement and first responders that I know in my district not only serve their communities through their jobs but also give back to their communities in positions such as Little League coaches, City Council members, Sunday-school teachers, and in countless other positions of service. These individuals put their communities first, Mr.Speaker, and they deserve to be protected by much stronger laws.  I rise in strong support of the Thin Blue Line Act and encourage my colleagues in the House to support its passage today.

The men and women who serve in our local police forces put their lives on the line to keep us safe. They are our everyday heroes, Mr. In 2014, Tarpon Springs Police Officer Charles Kondek was shot and killed by a fugitive while on duty. Officer Kondek represented Tarpon He worked there for 17 years and did a wonderful job keeping us safe.  These ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers have increased across the country by 167 percent. This is unacceptable.  The Thin Blue Line Act brings us one step closer to justice for these horrific crimes, so let's pass this bill. Of course, we have to pass the rule first so that we can pass this good bill.

10574,topic-id,881,"Mr.Speaker, May 26 was a dark moment in my community, as a hateful tirade toward two young women, evidently based on their race and faith, led to tragedy.  In the face of this menacing behavior, three brave Portlanders intervened to protect these young women. Two lost their lives, another had his throat slashed. They were Ricky Best, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, and Micah David-Cole Micah[[Page H4688]]David-Cole Fletcher survived the ordeal, still expressing hope and compassion.  That dark moment and bright example of courage and compassion has prompted soul-searching in my community. There has been a tremendous outpouring of support and a commitment to help the vulnerable. We all think about whether we would have had that courage.  Who knows what might have happened to those two young women if those courageous people had not intervened. Based on what happened, it is highly likely that they would have been physically assaulted, injured, or worse.  We think this is a wake-up call for all of us to protect the vulnerable, to resist intolerance, and to condemn behaviors and language that would incite violent behavior. We all have a stake in this so that we don't have more victims and that these three brave people's sacrifice was not in vain.  I respectfully request the Chamber observe a moment of silence.

10499,topic-id,528,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  As a former Federal and State prosecutor, I often hear how Americans value and respect our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders. We talk about their heroism, their selflessness, their willingness to protect and serve no matter the cost.  These fearless individuals truly are the fabric that holds our communities together. However, in recent years, a violent and disturbing trend has developed. Law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders are increasingly being targeted for violence and cruelty based solely on the uniform they wear.  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, there were 64 police shooting deaths in 2016. That number is 56 percent higher than the previous year. The National Association of Police Organizations also notes that ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent in 2016.  Allowing this appalling trend to continue unchecked is not only unacceptable, it is indefensible. Congress must take concrete steps to address this deadly problem.  Current Federal law provides 16 aggravating factors that a jury must consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted. These factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial planning and premeditation; whether the victim was[[Page H4238]]particularly vulnerable; whether the victim was a high public official, which includes high-ranking public persons, from the President to a foreign head of state, to a judge or a Federal law enforcement officer. However, State and local police officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders are excluded from these protections.  In response, my friend, Mr.Buchanan, introduced H.115, the Thin Blue Line This legislation amends Federal law to include murdering, attempting to murder, or targeting of State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, prosecutors, and first responders as an aggravating factor a jury must consider when determining whether a death sentence is justified. Furthermore, these protections extend to all public safety officers who are murdered or targeted while engaging in their official duties, because of the performance of their duties, or because of their status as a public official or employee.  This bill sends a clear message: Those who target our police officers, firefighters, or first responders with violence will be met with an equally harsh punishment.  We offer our thoughts and prayers to the families of our fallen officers, but we must do more to protect these brave individuals. We can't stand idly by as the individuals who protect our homes and communities are targeted because of the uniform they wear. We must act to ensure those individuals who would commit an act of violence against our public safety officers know they will face the gravest of sentences if they go through with their heinous plot.  We must send the message that Congress stands with those fearless individuals who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities, no matter the cost. We can't continue allowing them to suffer the price of our inaction. I support this effort and thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Committee on the Judiciary for bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4237-5.txt,2233,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,17.0,June

Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Buchanan: I write to you today on a matter      of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of      America (MCSA) and all of America's law enforcement      professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs      representing the Nation's largest counties with populations      of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100      million       As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the      MCSA, I am pleased to express our association's support of      your legislation, the Thin Blue Line This legislation      would make the murder of law enforcement officers,      firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor      in capital punishment determinations.       In 2016, one hundred forty-four officers died in the line      of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent.      The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable      and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted      to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers      and other first responders have the right to go home to their      families at the end of their shifts.       The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and      your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We      value your support and look forward to working with you in      the future.                                          Michael Bouchard,                                     Sheriff, Oakland County (MI),     Vice President--Government                                  ____                                           National Association of                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,                                  Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.     Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Buchanan: On behalf of the National      Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to      you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line       NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from      across the United States that serves to advance the interests      of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal      advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,      NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and      associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent      Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more      than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair      and effective crime control and law enforcement.       The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who      harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the      murder or attempted murder of a local police officer,      firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in      death penalty determinations.       This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults,      injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years.      In 2016 alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement      officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter      penalties for those who harm or target for harm law      enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons      contemplating harming an office must know that they will face      serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased      penalties make important differences in the attitudes of      criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure      protection for the community.       We thank you for your continued support of the law      enforcement community and we look forward to working with you      to pass this important legislation. If we can provide any      assistance, please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                           William Johnson,     Esq., CAE, Executive                                  ____                                                National Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2017.     Vernon Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the      members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our      strong support for H.115, the ``Thin Blue Line Act.''       The ``Thin Blue Line Act'' increases the penalty for an      individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person      who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other      public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the      performance of his or her official duties, because of the      performance of his or her official duties, or because of his      or her status as a public official or employee.       Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on      duty but within the past few years, officers have become a      target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear.      As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the      current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement      officers for this very reason.       Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in      2016, 21 of them--that's 33%--were ambush killings. These      were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals      who set out to kill a police officer:       The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the      deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5      officers killed from gunfire;       The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police      Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire;       The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott      Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in      their respective patrol cars;       Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department      (OH) was killed by ambush.       All of these officers died because of the uniforms they      were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in      harm's way. It is our job to protect others but it should not      be ``part of the job'' to be a target of someone who is      looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our      uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to      rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow      against our civil government.       On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this      legislation and amendment. If I can be of any further help,      please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director      Jim Pasco in my Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National                                  ____         Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City            of New York,                                   New York, NY, January 17, 2017.     Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the      more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent      Association of the New York City Police Department to advise      you of our strong support for H.115, the ``Thin Blue Line      Act.''       For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law      enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets.      There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits      impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do      so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to      protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear.      These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated      rhetoric of anti-police elements have led some to declare an      open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers      and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement      officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New      York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and      Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they      sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner.      Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National      Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21      police officers killed in ambush-style attacks. Shockingly,      20 of these officers were killed in eight multiple-shooting      death incidents--such as those that claimed the lives of 8      officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX--the highest total      of any year since 1932.       It is for these reasons and many others that the      legislation you have introduced is so important. The ``Thin      Blue Line Act'' would make the murder or attempted murder of      police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first      responders at any level of government an aggravating factor      in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to      things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is      applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because      of the performance of their duty, or because of their status      as a public official. While we know that law enforcement      officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their      uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or      retired, this legislation sends the message that any action      to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence      will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a      message that is long overdue.       On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you      for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward      to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law.      Please do not hesitate to contact me, or our Washington      Representatives Andrew Siff and Chris Granberg if we can be      of any further assistance.           Sincerely,                                                       Ed Mullins,                                                        President.[[Page H4243]]    ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4237-5.txt,2233,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,17.0,July
10534,topic-id,320,"Mr.Speaker, the rule before the House today is simple. It provides for the consideration of the Thin Blue Line We often talk of how resolute our law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders are in the face of immense danger. These heroic individuals charge into burning buildings, face down violence, and stand ready to jump into the fray at a moment's notice.  Simply putting on a uniform should not be one of those dangers. It is our duty to ensure that law enforcement officers, firefighters, and first responders have every tool at their disposal to do their job safely and effectively and to ensure they return home to their families.  Countless spouses and children kiss their loved ones good-bye as they head to work, praying that it will not be their last day. We must never forget this as we work to ensure our police officers, firefighters, and first responders have every possible protection.  There is no greater deterrent than the threat of losing one's life. It is my hope that this legislation makes individuals who would consider taking the life of an officer stop to consider the consequences before going through with an attack; that we one day reach a point where our Nation's finest can go to work without worrying about being targeted because of the uniform on their back; that one day our officers' families have one less reason to worry.  But until that day, we must continue standing resolutely against this evil. I ask my colleagues in the House to support our law enforcement community, firefighters, and first responders. Protect them from the heinous acts of violence. Give their families some assurance that we have their backs. Vote ``yes'' on the resolution, vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill, vote ``yes'' to give our law enforcement officers the protections they so desperately need.

That is 18 million. A leading cause of this problem is the unauthorized acquisition of Social Security numbers by criminals.  H.624 would address this issue by restricting the instances in which agencies may include the full Social Security numbers on documents sent through the mail. The bill would prohibit agencies from including those numbers on mailed correspondence unless the head of an agency himself or herself determines that inclusion is absolutely essential.  Agencies would be required to issue regulations delineating the situations in which Social Security numbers are necessary, and would be instructed to partially redact numbers wherever feasible.                              {time}  1445  Agencies would also be expressly prohibited from making Social Security numbers visible on the outside of any mailed packages.[[Page H4534]]  In recent years, many agencies have taken steps to reduce their use of Social Security numbers, and this bill would simply codify some of those practices agencies have already adopted. For instance, the Social Security Administration itself no longer prints Social Security numbers on its annual cost-of-living adjustment notices or benefit checks, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is in the process of removing Social Security numbers from the Medicare cards issued to beneficiaries.  These steps are critical to ensuring that the Federal Government adequately safeguards the personally identifiable information of individuals and does everything it can to protect Americans from identity theft.  Although this bill helps provide a lot of protection, reducing the threat of identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from mailed items is not always as easy as it seems. Many agencies confront high costs when reprogramming outdated legacy information technology systems to allow mailings to be printed differently.  Agencies across the Federal Government have been reluctant to retire those legacy IT systems because of funding constraints that limit IT investments, slow modernization, and force agencies to defer needed IT upgrades in favor of some more pressing, urgent problems.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the important responsibility Congress has to fund these IT modernization efforts as it considers this bill.

10354,topic-id,499,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1393, the ``Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2017.''  I agree with the bill's sponsors that a uniform framework specifying when an employer must withhold state income tax could help ensure simplicity and be more administrable than the current varied state standards. However the means by which H.1393 achieves this result would lead to significant state revenue losses and could actually encourage income tax avoidance.  To begin with, rather than promoting uniformity, H.1393 would have a significant adverse impact on income tax revenues for certain states.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, for example, New York could lose between $55 million and $120 million annually if this measure was signed into law.  Other states that would be adversely impacted include Illinois, Massachusetts, and  And, as a result of the lost revenues from non-resident taxpayers, these states could be forced to make up their losses by shifting the tax burden to resident taxpayers or levying new taxes.  And states may even have to cut governmental services, such as funding for education and critical infrastructure improvements.[[Page H4951]]  Another problem with H.1393 is that it essentially provides a roadmap for state income tax liability avoidance.  By allowing an employer to rely on the employee's determination of the time he or she is expected to spend working in another state during the year, the bill prevents the employer from withholding an employee's state income taxes to a non-resident state.  This would be the result even if the employer is aware that the employee has been working in a state more than 30 days, as long as that state cannot prove that the employee committed fraud in making his annual determination and that the employer knew it.  Rather than proceeding with this flawed bill, the House should be considering a fair and uniform framework to allow states to collect taxes owed on remote sales.  By staying silent since the Supreme Court's 1992 Quill decision, Congress has failed to ensure that states have the authority to collect the sales and use tax on Internet purchases.  Placing brick and mortar businesses at a competitive disadvantage hurts main street Americans and means fewer local jobs and fewer opportunities.  Lost tax revenues mean that state and local governments will have fewer resources to provide their residents essential services, such as education and police and fire protection.  We owe it to our local communities, our local retailers, and state and local governments to act this  I am disappointed that rather than moving the bipartisan eFairness legislation that our communities need, we are considering H.1393 instead.

Transmittal 17-38     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to          Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                           Annex Item vii       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:       1. The ALE-70 is a towed radio frequency countermeasure      designed for deployment from the F-35 aircraft and is      comprised of electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies to      accomplish the intended purpose. The ALE-70 consists of three      major components: the reel/launcher assembly, the tow line,      and the T-1687 countermeasure transmitter. Upon deployment      from the aircraft, the countermeasure transmitter is reeled      out to a prescribed distance, held in tow behind the jet by      the tow line and emits waveforms in response to commands from      the countermeasure controller located in the jet. The      waveforms are utilized to confuse or decoy adversary radars      or radar guided weapons. Designed and produced by BAE Systems      of Nashua, New Hampshire, the ALE-70 employs amplifiers based      on Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology to meet stringent output      requirements.       2. The ALE-70 generates, amplifies, and transmits signals      in response to commands from the countermeasures controller      which remains aboard the jet. Neither the countermeasure      transmitter nor the reel/launcher assembly contains stored      information or software representing critical program      information. As the ALE-70 contains no software or stored      waveforms/techniques, Anti-Tampering security measures are      not required. ALE-70 hardware is classified SECRET to protect      specific data elements associated with the performance of the      countermeasure.       3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain      knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the      information could be used to develop countermeasures or      equivalent system which might reduce system effectiveness or      be used in the development of a system with similar or      advanced capabilities.       4. A determination has been made that Australia can provide      substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive      technology being released as the U.This sale      is necessary in furtherance of the U.foreign policy and      national security objectives outlined in the Policy            5.

10588,topic-id,444,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding, and I also want to take this time to thank the gentleman from Florida and my colleague and good friend, Congressman Valadao, for the introduction of this legislation, H.624, which I support.  Mr.Speaker, as we know, identity theft throughout the country is a very significant problem. It becomes even more compounded in this day of the internet when we have to deal with a whole host of issues that make the ability to steal one's identity even more easily done. This measure attempts to try to address a part of that challenge by dealing with the issue of Social Security numbers.  We all know Social Security numbers are key information used to identify ourselves, and we know that if they fall into the wrong hands, they can be used to commit identity theft.  I think all of us remember when, at some point in our age, we got our Social Security number and we memorized it, and it is something that is very important in our society today. But many thieves find these numbers are incredibly valuable because they are a link that can connect a person's information across a whole host of agencies, systems, and databases in this age of the internet.  Criminals can use stolen Social Security numbers to file fraudulent tax returns, obtain loans, and commit other kinds of crimes. An estimated 13 million Americans experienced financial identity theft in 2014 alone, resulting in over $16 billion--with a B--$16 billion lost to fraud.  In 2007, to combat these issues, there was an Identity Theft Task Force that made recommendations to the administration on ways to eliminate the unnecessary collection, use, and display--the display, which this legislation attempts to address--of Social Security numbers.  Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office released testimony on these efforts by the Federal Government to reduce the collection, use, and display of Social Security numbers. In conclusion, the GAO testified that, until the Office of Management and Budget adopts more effective practices for guiding agency Social Security number reduction efforts, overall governmentwide reduction will likely remain limited and difficult to measure, and the risk of Social Security numbers being exposed and used to commit identity theft will remain greater than it need be. Again, this legislation attempts to help address that.  The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act would enact measures to help protect American citizens, especially children, veterans, and senior citizens, from identity theft and fraud. It does so by reducing the number of mailed documents the Federal Government sends to individuals that include full Social Security numbers.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.  ",CREC-2017-05-24-pt1-PgH4533.txt,1774,DO THE RIGHT THING,2017.0,24.0,July

I think, probably, many of us have received mail that, in fact, had our Social Security number there and identified.  As I said at the outset, this is no silver bullet to stopping identity theft; it is a commonsense measure to reducing it.  Social Security, as we all know, is a promise made to those who have worked hard throughout their lives to contribute to the system, to contribute to the American way of life. It also provides those seniors who are living on their Social Security the ability to have dignity and additional security during their golden years. As a result, Congress must do what it can to reduce the strains on the program, particularly from fraud and theft.  For all of those reasons, I support this legislation, and I support Congressman Valadao's efforts and my[[Page H4535]]good friends from Florida and Virginia for bringing this commonsense measure to the floor.

10578,topic-id,628,"Madam President, I am honored today to announce legislation that Senator Peters and I have introduced that provides another option for children in the foster care system in Montana and across the country.  I worked with a host of Montana groups to develop the Child Protection and Family Support Act of 2017, including a handful of nonprofit organizations focused on foster youth, the Montana attorney general, Indian Tribes, and individual constituents. I am pleased to have their support on this legislation.  Montana is in the midst of a child welfare crisis. We have a record 3,400 children in foster care, and about a third of those children are there because of methamphetamine use by their parents.  Montana state law requires the Office of the Child and Family Ombudsman to investigate circumstances surrounding child fatalities when the child was involved with the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services Child and Family Services Division within 12 months of the date of the child's death.  Last December, the Montana Department of Justice issued a report and the findings were devastating: It detailed 14 child deaths that met these parameters.  Of the 14 cases reviewed, 11 involved children 2 years old or younger. In nine of those cases, the children were 1 year old or younger. Eleven cases included allegations of drug use, four of which indicated methamphetamine use. Six cases indicated issues of domestic violence, and eight cases involved parents who received child protective services in Montana when they themselves were children. I have been told that at least seven children have met a similar fate in the first 5 months of 2017 alone. The death of one child is too many.[[Page S3283]]  Under current Federal policy, a child must be removed from the home of a parent and, after removal, cannot be living with the parent, in order to be eligible for a title IV-E foster care maintenance payment. My bill would permit title IV-E foster care maintenance payment support, for up to 12 months, for a child in foster care who is placed with a parent in a licensed residential family-based treatment facility. This would allow the parent to get the help they need while keeping the family intact.  Secondly, the bill would reauthorize the Administration for Children and Families' Regional Partnership Grant, RPG, These competitive grants reduce the risk of foster care due to parental substance abuse, an issue of utmost importance to Since their inception in 2006, two Montana grantees have utilized and benefited from RPGs: the Center for Children and Families in Billings, MT, and the Apsaalooke Nation Housing Authority in Crow  My bill reauthorizes and strengthens this grant program with modest improvements. For example, it encourages the use of RPGs to address the needs of children and families affected by methamphetamine, heroin, and opioid substance use disorders, help implement effective title IV-E prevention services, and focus on improved outcomes for families, including children and their parents. The bill further requires that, in addition to the State child welfare agency, every funded partnership must include the State agency that administers the Federal substance abuse prevention and treatment block grant and, if the partnership intends to serve children placed in out-of-home care, the court that handles child abuse and neglect proceedings in the region.  Among the long list of eligible grant applicants and partners, Native American Tribes, Tribal consortiums, and Tribal organizations are all eligible grantees, and I hope they will increasingly utilize RPGs, especially given the unique foster care challenges in Indian communities.  As a U.Senator, as a person of faith, as a father, and as an American, I believe in helping the most vulnerable in our society--in this case, innocent children.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-06-pt1-PgS3282-2.txt,2138,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT",2017.0,6.0,May

10325,topic-id,2563,"Mr.President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget scorekeeping report for June 2017. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, 3. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  My last filing can be found in the Record on April 27, 2017. The information contained in this report captures[[Page S3322]]legislative activity since that filing through June 5, 2017.  Republican Budget Committee staff prepared Tables 1-3 of this report.  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays under the most recently adopted budget resolution. This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the For this reporting period, 13 of the 16 authorizing committees are in compliance with their allocations. Legislative activity involving the appropriations process, continuing resolution and omnibus, during the last reporting period includes provisions, such as changes to health benefits for miners and Medicaid funding, charged to the Committee on Finance that caused it to breach its allocation. The other two committees in breach, as previously reported, are the Committee on Veterans Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and In total, authorizing committees are estimated to increase outlays by $292 million more than they were allocated over the fiscal year 2017-2026 period. Of that $292 million in violations, $91 million stems from the Finance Committee's violations during this reporting period.  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on Appropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits for fiscal year 2017. This information is used to determine points of order related to the spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the H.244, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, P.115-31, provided full-year appropriations for the current fiscal year. These appropriations, $551.1 billion for defense and $518.5 billion for nondefense, were consistent with the statutory limits imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011.  Table 3 tracks compliance with the fiscal year 2017 limit for overall changes in mandatory programs, CHIMPS, in appropriations bills, established in the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution. CHIMPS in the Consolidated Appropriations Act were consistent with this year's limit of $19.1 billion. This information is used for determining points of order under section 3103 of that resolution.  In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget totals approved by the  CBO provided a spending and revenue report for fiscal year 2017, which helps enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA section 311. CBO's estimates show that current-law levels of spending for fiscal year 2017 are below the amounts assumed in the budget resolution by $303 million in budget authority and $6.4 billion in outlays. CBO also estimates that revenues are $1 million above assumed levels for fiscal year 2017, but $21 million below assumed levels for the fiscal year 2017-2026 period. Social Security levels are consistent with the budget resolution's fiscal year 2017 figures.  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The Senate's PAYGO scorecard currently shows increased deficits of $226 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 and $227 million over fiscal year 2016-2026 periods. For both periods, outlays have increased by $201 million, while revenues decreased by $25 million over the 6-year period and $26 million over the 11-year period. Missing from these levels are the budgetary effects of divisions M-O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 and the miners' health provisions of H.99, the short-term continuing resolution, P.115-30, which are required to be excluded based on language in the acts. The consolidated appropriations bill, however, is recorded as reducing revenues by $24 million and $25 million over the fiscal year 2016-2021 and fiscal year 2016-2026 periods, respectively. That revenue loss is found in the appropriations section of the bill, not covered by the exclusion, which includes provisions related to visa-program extensions and insurance coverage of mammography. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 201 of 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.  Finally, included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's budget enforcement activity on the floor. No budget points of order have been raised since my last filing.  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.

This report is submitted under      section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional      Budget Act, as amended.       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues      are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of      3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for      Fiscal Year 2017.       Since our last letter dated April 27, 2017, the Congress      has cleared and the President has signed the following      legislation that has significant effects on budget authority,      outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 2017: A joint resolution      making continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2017, and      for other purposes (Public Law 115-30); and Consolidated      Appropriations Act, 2017 (Public Law 115-31).

CEO estimates that, for fiscal year 2017:    The $20 million in discretionary budget authority provided by  section 193 would result in an additional $5 million in outlays for  FDA innovation projects;    The $352 million in discretionary budget authority provided by  section 194 would result in an additional $91 million in outlays for  NIH innovation projects;    The $500 million in discretionary budget authority provided by  section 195 would result in an additional $160 million in outlays for  state response to opioid abuse.  Consistent with sections 1001-1004 of P.114-255, for the purposes  of estimating the discretionary budget authority and outlays for these  provisions under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974  and the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Act of 1985, those  amounts are estimated to provide no budget authority or outlays.c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act  in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not  include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.  As a result, current level does not include these items.d Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary  levels in 3, pursuant to various provisions of the  resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below  excludes $81,872 million in budget authority and $40,032 million in  outlays assumed in 3 for non regular discretionary  spending, including spending that qualifies for adjustments to  discretionary spending limits pursuant to section 251(b) of the  Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

Mr.Speaker, my great-uncle, Phil Fitzpatrick, was a proud patrolman with the He was also a poet, often referring to police officers as soldiers of peace. This week, as we recognize Police Week 2017, I find myself thinking of him and a line from one of his poems, where he wrote: ``When he kisses his wife and children goodbye, there's the chance he will see them no more.''  Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, these words were true for my family. This month marks 70 years since my great-uncle was shot while attempting to disarm a robber in a Manhattan bar, a fatal injury he succumbed to days later.  Mr.Speaker, for too long, law enforcement across this country has been forgotten or, worse yet, ostracized. At the same time, their vital mission continues, and it continues to grow more dangerous. Just last year, ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increased by 167 percent, according to the National Association of Police Despite all this, each day, tens of thousands of brave women and men continue to put their lives on the line to serve and protect our communities.  This week, we recognize Police Week 2017, but the dedication and sacrifice of our blue line deserves to be respected every day. As a former law enforcement officer, I am proud to stand here today in support of those brave women and men.  Today, the House has a chance to take decisive action to protect our law enforcement officers by passing the legislation before us. The Thin Blue Line Act sends a clear message to those who intentionally target our police officers. Vicious attacks on law enforcement officers will be met with justice.  I urge my colleagues to stand up for law enforcement today, support this rule, and pass H.115, the Thin Blue Line The bipartisan support it deserves must be delivered today.                              {time}  1315  ",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4237-5.txt,1797,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT",2017.0,17.0,July

It is also where I spent most of my career as a high energy particle physicist before I ran for  The discoveries made in Fermilab's first 50 years will remain in the science textbooks forever. Experiments at Fermilab discovered three of the fundamental components of matter: the bottom quark, the neutrino tau, and the top quark, the heaviest known form of matter.  Unfortunately, the Republican budget proposal of the Trump administration threatens the legacy of Fermilab and national labs and scientific facilities throughout the country.  Mr.Speaker, scientific research is not like highway building that can turn on and off in any given fiscal year. Scientific teams and facilities that take generations to build can be wiped out in a single budget cycle by having their funding cut.  So, Mr.Speaker, I call upon you and your colleagues to show us a budget that will maintain our country's leadership in science and technology, because destroying our scientific facilities is no way to make America great again.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-23-pt1-PgH5125-3.txt,1888,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT",2017.0,23.0,July
10445,topic-id,542,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, H.1726 is a noncontroversial bill to reorganize the Coast Guard's permanent authorities under title 14 of the U.Code in order to improve the clarity and the coherence of the title.  I would like to thank my assistant, and counsel, Dave Jansen, and John Rayfield, on the other side, for recognizing that there is confusion, and so this legislation, while it makes no substantive changes to the Coast Guard's existing authorities and policies under title 14, does save for some conforming changes to create a new chapter for all of the Coast Guard national advisory councils and execute a handful of other minor transfers.  It just simply ends a lot of confusion as people try to figure out where it is in the code that they must look.  Accordingly, I am comfortable with supporting this legislation, although I do note that it will impose some additional administrative costs on the Coast Guard as they set about implementing it.  I want to commend the chairman, Mr.Hunter, for the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, for his initiative and for his staff's initiative, in taking on this important little bit of housekeeping that is going to make all of our lives easier. I will certainly urge all of the Members to support it.  I also appreciate Chairman Hunter's work with me in an effort to try to[[Page H5164]]solve another problem. This is only one piece of our effort to try to improve the maritime industry. While we are trying to move H.1726 today, we have more work to do.  And to that end, I look forward to working with Chairman Hunter on bringing H.2593 to the floor before the August recess, together with the full committee chairman, Bill Shuster; and ranking Democrat, Peter H.2593 deals with the Federal Maritime Commission Authorization Act of 2017.  This legislation would update and strengthen the Shipping Act to address the current upheaval in the global shipping markets that affect U.foreign trade.  The formation of three large ocean carrier alliances has raised legitimate concerns among U.port service providers, maritime terminal operators, and tug operators. By virtue of the sheer size and volume of trade that these alliances carry, they will have a decided advantage in determining ports of call, negotiating contracts, and shifting costs, all at the expense, possibly, of our domestic port service providers.  I know Chairman Hunter shares my concerns, and neither of us are indifferent. We are going to have to deal with this, and that will be our next piece of legislation on the floor. The chairman is on top of it with his staff, and we look forward to that bill, H.2593, being reported out of the Transportation Committee as it clarifies the Federal Maritime Commission's authority to oversee and aggressively deal with competition.  So what we have today is one of two pieces of legislation that we intend to move forward dealing with the overall well-being of the maritime industry.  I highly recommend H.1726 to the floor. It is noncontroversial and should pass. The other piece of legislation will be here shortly, and we will take that up at that time.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Since 1791, greater than 22,000 law enforcement professionals have given their lives in the line of duty--over 70 in a single day in 2001, including 37 from the NYPD and 23 from the Port Authority Police--an average of over 140 a year. And yet these men and women who look like us--every race, every color, every gender--are the best of us because every day they get up and go to work again.  Mr.Speaker, when I served in the military, I became familiar with Isaiah 6:8, and I cite that verse in thanking our law enforcement professionals:  And then the voice of the Lord spoke to us and said, ``Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?'' And I said, ``Here am Send me.''  Mr.Speaker, take that as a thank-you from myself and the citizens of the Fifth District of Virginia to those professional men and women who serve us every day.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-05-17-pt1-PgH4296-4.txt,1737,GOVERNMENT FUNDING LEGISLATION,2017.0,17.0,July

10563,topic-id,5872,"Mr.Speaker, it is always an honor to be here. I do greatly appreciate my friend from Hawaii, her views. I know she is a person of integrity; calls them like she sees them. I appreciate her very much.  There are just a number of things that really need to be called out. Here is an article from the Julian Borger, June 6, that would be yesterday. The headline is: ``Cancel Donald Trump state visit, says Sadiq Khan, after London attack tweets.''  It states: ``London mayor says U.President is wrong about many things and that state visit to Britain should not go ahead.  ``The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has called on the British Government to cancel a planned state visit by Donald Trump after being criticized in two tweets by the U.President.''  Now, it really is interesting that the London mayor, after he has his citizens--his people are viciously mutilated, killed in the streets of his city, and, instead of being--going through a self-examination, is there something more I could have done as mayor of this town? Is there something more I could have encouraged? Is there something more we could have done here in England, in Great Britain, in the U.K.? Is there something we could have done that I, in a position of authority, could have done to stop this, to help, at least help stop this?  But Mr.Sadiq Khan apparently didn't go through that, as people were grieving, not just in London but all over the world, here in the United States, praying for the families, grieving with those who were attacked, so many attacked, dozens attacked, instead of perhaps wondering, maybe we don't have our policies quite right, this is yet another attack, and maybe the Britain leaders should have thought, you know, we have been saying that the real key--it has been said around Europe, maybe the real key to stopping radical Islam and the mutilation of innocent people, the slashing of throats, the beheading, the terrible things that have been done by radical Islamists, maybe the way to stop them we were told--not maybe--they said the way to stop them is the Paris climate accord.  If we just show them enough love as they are beheading us, or slashing our throats, and we have signed on, and we are fully part embraced in the Paris climate accord, you know, the radical Islamist murders will stop. That is the kind of baloney we have been told.  And in England, there are people who have indicated as much, how outrageous it was that President Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris accord, because he saw the damage that was going to be done to the United States economy. He saw the damage that would be done to the United States jobs.  I talked to people in east Texas last weekend, different places around east Texas, and they kept coming back: I am so grateful that Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris accord. One of them has a new--some type of concrete business. They have got rights to a specific process that is great for the environment. It is green.  So then we find out our business was going to be devastated if we stayed in the Paris climate accord. It would have gutted our business. We would have been having to file for bankruptcy. Others, you know, the same day, last Saturday, were telling me the same things, different places, same song. We found out how much our business would have been gutted if the President had not pulled out of the Paris accord.  And, of course, we want to be fair to the 160 countries or so that have condemned the United States, said that we are the one partner in the Paris climate accord, just like in Kyoto, and Reykjavik, and all these others, the United States is the most important partner in those accords. Well, yeah, I guess so.  We were going to be the one country that was going to pay billions of dollars to other countries because we have been successful, and we have been innovative, and our Constitution, the brilliance of the Founders to ensure in our Constitution that we were going to reward intellectual property, intellectual thought, would stir intellectual creations. And we loved this idea of private property, you know, before the[[Page H4694]]last 50 years, we loved this idea of private property, and the Nation has grown.  But as, you know, people have continued to make inroads, taking away private property rights, of course, the economy doesn't grow at the rates that it has in previous days. But at least by pulling out of Paris, we have got a shot to continue to be the most humanitarian, the most charitable Nation, I believe, in the history of the world; that even Solomon's Israel did not have the kind of freedoms and the kind of individual ability to be charitable.  Billions of dollars that have been given. I don't know. Maybe trillions over the years in today's dollars around the world for so many good purposes. And yet if we had stayed in the Paris accord, we would have done so much damage to our own economy.  So I have told many people, thank God, and thank Donald Trump that he got us out of that mess, so that we can continue our climb out of the economic malaise of the Obama years; that we can continue to get back a thriving economy that has been so sluggish for so many years now; not the artificial growth bubble that was created late in the Clinton years, that was bound to burst, not that kind but based on real jobs and manufacturing jobs coming back.  I know from studying history, I think President Trump knows just from his business acumen, that any nation that is considered an international world power, that cannot produce and manufacture the things that are needed in a time of war will not remain a world power past the next war. It won't. So it brings us back to a great thing to get rid of the Paris accord.  Now we have got to cut taxes. And I know there is a lot of screaming from the left about how, gee, wanting to cut taxes for the rich. Well, actually, under President Obama, there was so much damage done to the middle classes. The middle class shrunk in numbers of people, it appears, while the gap between the poor and the rich got even bigger. And as President Obama is on video admitting, it must have been tough, but he admitted, yeah, it is true. It was true.  It is true that, under President Obama, for the first time in the history of the United States of America, first time, 95 percent of the Nation's income went to the top 1 percent. So we have heard all this stuff about Republicans helping the rich and hurting the poor.  There is no President's policy in the history of our Nation that has done more damage to the poor, to the middle class, than the policies of the Obama administration. There is no President's administration that has done more damage to shrink the middle class and to widen the gap between the poor and the rich. And most of those rich who give money seem to just keep giving to the Democratic                              {time}  1800  You know, I love, whether it is Republicans, Democrats, or Independents coming up with a great idea and making money on it. It is fantastic. You know, as long as it is legal, but it is fantastic.  With all of my faults, jealousy is not one I suffer from. It is great to see anybody work hard or come up with something innovative, and make money. I think it is fantastic. I love the fact that this Nation, for most of our history, has done what we could to incentivize that process.  So the mayor of London condemning President  Well, who is this guy?  He has got plenty of his own problems. He has got plenty of his own issues. But it wasn't just the mayor of London, Mr.Sadiq We also heard from the Acting U.Ambassador over in London, Lewis Lukens, and he sent out this message: ``I commend the strong leadership of the mayor of London as he leads the city forward after this heinous attack.''  And by virtue of this statement, of course, he is incorporating the decisions by the mayor of London, the decisions by those with whom the mayor of London is consorting, those decisions that have allowed so many radical Islamists to be creating plots and plans to kill That has been going on, we find out after this attack. We should have known from the one before, the one before, the one before, that this has been going on.  Lewis Lukens, our highest U.ranking official in London, basically condemned President Trump by siding with the mayor of London, who is more concerned about condemning the President of the United States than he is about grieving for his own people, or doing everything within the mayor's conceivable power to stop the next radical attack.  Under the thinking of people like the mayor of London, there should not have ever been an attack in England, not recently, for sure, because they didn't pull out of the Paris accord. And if the Paris accord was going to save the world from radical Islam, then, wow, all of the attacks should be happening in the United States of  Unless we get our friends on the other side of the aisle to help us as we need to do to pass legislation that give us the protection we need, the attacks will be coming. But it wouldn't make sense--if you believe people like this, and those that say Paris is the key to ending radical Islam, it wouldn't make sense that London would be hit twice instead of the United They didn't pull out. They condemned us for pulling out.  So it makes you think, when you really look at everything, maybe the key to defeating radical Islam is what Americans who have fought them know: there is only one way to defeat radical Islam, and that is to defeat it; to fight it, kill it, defeat it.  I saw President Carter here on television here in the last few days. I had it on mute, so I don't know what he said. A sweet man. Of course, he does seem to have some pretty strong anti-Semitic feelings, so it is hard to feel too much about the sweetness when you see and hear comments that make you know he really doesn't care much for certain Jews or But I know he meant well when he abandoned the Shah of Iran, not a nice man like Qadhafi--not a great man, not a nice man, but at least he was keeping radical Islam in the box, keeping it boxed up.  When President Carter saw the Shah deposed and the Ayatollah Khomeini comes into Iran, he didn't recognize that he had literally opened Pandora's box, and it was going to be a plague upon the world for years and years to come, and that thousands and thousands of Americans would die trying to put radical Islam back in the box from which President Carter let it escape and from which President Obama encouraged more--not intentionally, but the actions have consequences, and Americans have continued to die and will continue until radical Islam, with the help of our Muslim friends that don't want to be ruled by radical Islamists, with their help--we have got to have their help--we can get it back in the box the way it once was.  But there are people like Lewis Lukens, our highest ranking U.official in London, who don't recognize this. But the name to so many sounded familiar, Lewis I know I have heard that name before. Oh, well, after tweeting out, or sending out the message from the U.Embassy in London, taking sides in favor of the mayor of London over the President of the United States--let's see, who is this--as the article from Monica Showalter says:  ``So who is Acting Ambassador Lewis Lukens anyway?  ``Turns out he's a career diplomat, with nearly 30 years' experience in assorted outposts. His most prominent positions, however, have been at the side of the person who must have served as a sort of mentor, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, serving as her chief administrative officer. In that time frame, he managed to reach the inner circle of Clinton's tight little circle of acolytes--on the same level as Cheryl Mills and Huma  ``In testimony to Congress, Lukens claimed to have come up with the idea of having Clinton set up a private server.''  Oh, that is right. He is the genius that came up with the idea of having Hillary Clinton have a private server so it was more easy for our enemies to hack classified information. But then again, we find out, well, it really didn't make that much difference because she was sending it to Huma Abedin, who was sending it to Mr. Anyway, it turns out, all kinds of felonies were being committed, Federal laws being violated. Of course, under Director Comey, he didn't want to pursue anybody like that because he is[[Page H4695]]sure they meant well, even though they were violating the law right and left.  But Lukens takes the side of the mayor, and he is the same guy that came up with the private server idea for Hillary So I know, on behalf of those who supported President Trump, we greatly appreciate the damage that he did to the Democratic Lukens--and, hopefully, he won't be long for being the highest ranking U.official in Hopefully, we can send somebody over there that doesn't have great ideas like he had for Hillary Clinton that causes our British friends the kind of trouble he caused for Hillary  And then we have got this from Will Carr, WGMD News Radio:  ``Concerns are being raised on Capitol Hill about whether partisan politics could impact the 2020 Census and swing congressional redistricting in favor of  ``FOX News has learned that last summer, a pro-Democratic analytics firm that described itself as `a platform for hope and change'. . . .''  Yeah, as we saw over the last 8 years, 95 million Americans--the highest number in our history--even gave up looking for work. So they weren't reflected in the unemployment numbers, but they just gave up. It was so hopeless. So much for hope and change.  Anyway, this analytics firm is ``a platform for hope and change,'' but it `` . . . included as a subcontractor in a $415 million advertising contract for the 2020  ``The data firm, Civis Analytics, was founded by the chief analytics officer on former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.  ``Since congressional redistricting, which occurs every 10 years, is based on the results of the national Census, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is now asking the Secretary of the Department of Commerce to ensure that the Census will be conducted in a nonpartisan fashion--and that redistricting will not be impacted.  `` `In 2016, the Bureau awarded an advertising contract that included a subcontractor with close ties to the partisan politics that reportedly ``spun out of'' the reelection campaign of President Obama,' Senator Ron Johnson''--our friend from Wisconsin--``wrote to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a letter obtained by FOX News.''  Our friend, Senator Ron Johnson, says: ``This partisan lineage raises concern in light of a Democratic initiative to use the results of the 2020 Census to draw district lines in a manner favorable to Democratic candidates.''  So, wow, what a deal. The Obama administration has got their own consulting firm helping with the 2020 That ought to concern a lot of people that want to make sure that our little experiment as a democratic republic does not come to an end. As Ben Franklin warned, we could have it as long--if we could keep it, that is.  But the shocking story today that I am not hearing enough talk about, and printed out by Circa, John Solomon and Sara Carter today: ``A former U.intelligence contractor tells Circa he walked away. . . .''  This is a U.intelligence contractor.  Where have we heard that term?  That is what we were told that Edward Snowden was.  Well, this says: ``. . . he walked away with more than 600 million classified documents on 47 hard drives from the National Security Agency and the CIA, a haul potentially larger than Edward Snowden's now infamous breach.''  But it sounded like a good thing.  It says: ``And now he is suing former FBI Director James Comey and other government figures, alleging the Bureau has covered up evidence that he provided them showing widespread spying on Americans that violated civil liberties.  ``The suit, filed late Monday night by Dennis Montgomery, was assigned to the same Federal judge who has already ruled that some of the NSA's collection of data on Americans violates the U.Constitution's Fourth Amendment, setting up an intriguing legal proceeding in the Nation's Capital this summer.  ``Montgomery says the evidence he gave to the FBI chronicle the warrantless collection''--not just phone metadata--``of phone, financial and personal data and the unmasking of identities in spy data about millions of  `` `This domestic surveillance was all being done on computers supplied by the FBI,' Montgomery told Circa in an interview. `So these supercomputers, which are FBI computers, the CIA is using them to do domestic surveillance.' ''                              {time}  1815  Gee, we have been assured that does not happen. We have been assured in hearings in our Judiciary Committee over the last 12 years I have been here--and we have had a lot of hearings on these issues. We have been assured this isn't happening. This guy who knows enough to steal 600 million classified documents on 47 hard drives without getting caught says it is happening.  Mr.Speaker, let me parenthetically insert here, we have had a number of conversations with FBI and different intelligence officials, because section 702 that allows this kind of widespread collection, if we are going after what we were told would be foreign terrorists, known foreign terrorists, and they happened to capture an American, the name is masked. You can't get that information. There has to be probable cause to get anything about the We are finding out names have been unmasked.  Now, this information by Montgomery is that things are leaked about Widespread information is being collected on Americans with no probable cause they committed any crime.  I have told numerous DOJ and intelligence officials--and I am very serious about this--they must show that they can police their own ranks of people who are violating Americans' civil rights and gathering information in ways Orwell could never have dreamed of. As my friend Thomas Massie was pointing out today, Orwell thought it would take people to spy on other people. He never dreamed that we, the government, would be able to collect warehouses full of information on little disks that would be used and pulled out later any time they wanted to go after an individual--but it sure looks like it is happening.  If our own justice and intelligence officials cannot police themselves and produce the very people who have leaked information and who have unmasked information, I will join with many of my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle to vote against them ever having those types of powers again. They are going to have to police themselves. They are going to have to produce the people who have been leaking, who have been unmasking, and who have been spying on Americans without legal authority. They are going to have to produce those people, because if they can't and if they don't, they have no business having this kind of power. I know it has got a lot of our justice officials and intelligence officials upset.  Based on the way things have been going and from what we keep finding out, I am sure somebody has been going through my background with a fine-tooth comb looking for anything so they can take me out, but good luck.  I am sure, as Heritage Foundation has written before, probably most Americans are committing a number of Federal crimes a day we don't even know about. So, apparently, it can be done if Heritage is right, as I think they are. But the fact is it ought to scare every American that there is this much Federal intervention in their own personal lives.  The truth is we have got to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection They have no right and they have no authority under our Constitution to gather people's financial information unless there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and that this person has committed the crime, and then get a warrant to get it. It is time to end that for real. It is time to end this kind of personal snooping on American citizens.  This article goes on and says: ``Documents obtained by Circa outside of the lawsuit show that the U.Attorney's Office in Washington in 2015 approved a grant of limited immunity for Montgomery so he could explain how he managed to walk out of his contract and the buildings he worked in with[[Page H4696]]the classified material'' on 47 hard drives.  ``He said he returned the hard drives to the FBI, a fact confirmed in government documents reviewed by  `` `They're doing this domestic surveillance on Americans, running a project on U.soil,' Montgomery alleged. He did not disclose the classified name of the project but said he revealed all aspects of the project during his interview with the  `` `Can you imagine what someone can do with the information they were collecting on Americans, can you imagine that kind of power.'  ``Officials with the FBI and CIA declined to comment due to current and pending litigation.  ``The FBI contacts with Montgomery were encouraged by a senior status Federal judge who encouraged the two sides to meet rather than allow for any of the classified materials to leak, according to interviews Circa conducted.  ``Montgomery's lawsuit, which included his lawyer, the well-known conservative activist Larry Klayman, alleges Montgomery provided extensive evidence to the FBI of illegal spying on Americans ranging from judges to businessmen like the future President Donald  ``The suit did not offer specifics on any illegal spying, but it accused the Bureau of failing to take proper actions to rectify Montgomery's concerns.  ``Montgomery divulged to the FBI a `pattern and practice of conducting illegal, unconstitutional surveillance against millions of Americans, including prominent Americans such as the Chief Justice of the U.Supreme Court' ''--wow--`` `other Justices, 156 judges, prominent businessmen, and others such as Donald Trump, as well as plaintiffs themselves.' ''  That is the allegation in the suit.  `` `Plaintiffs were assured that the FBI, under Defendant Comey, would conduct a full investigation into the grave instances of illegal and unconstitutional activity set forth by However, the FBI, on Defendant Comey's orders, buried the FBI's investigation because the FBI itself is involved in an ongoing conspiracy to not only conduct the aforementioned illegal, unconstitutional surveillance, but to cover it up as well,' the suit added.  ``Klayman and Montgomery also alleged that they have evidence that they themselves have been improperly spied upon by U.intelligence. The suit named numerous other defendants as well, including NSA Director Mike Rogers, former CIA Director John Brennan, and even former President Barack  ``Court records indicate the suit was assigned in Washington to U.District Judge Richard Leon, who in 2015 issued an historic ruling that the NSA's past bulk collection of Americans' phone records most likely violated the Constitution.''  Thank God he ruled as he did.  ``The agency has since ended that practice but the pending case, which is winding its way through appeals and motions, is likely to shine a light on whether Americans' civil liberties were violated during more than a decade of the war on terror.''  This is incredible.  Then, when we hope the courts may be our help, we see another answer that is incredibly discouraging, Federal courts stepping in where they have no authority. Federal court, district court, court of appeals, they have no authority to grant standing to people that are not in the United States, standing and rights to people that are not American citizens and not on American soil. But that is the effect of what they are doing when they say that the President and, actually, Congress, which gave the President much of the power he has on the issue of travel bans and immigration, that we don't have the authority.  Well, under the Constitution, we do have the authority. Congress has the authority and the President has authority to protect us when it comes to national security. He has authority to make decisions like he has. There is no constitutional right under the United States Constitution for someone in another country to have a right to come into the United There is no such constitutional right.  For any harebrained judge in America to say that indicates that this is like artificial intelligence becoming self-aware: Wow, I can do whatever I want.  Once it becomes like AI, once it becomes self-aware, then it begins to protect itself. Anyone who has authority or ability to rein them in: We have got to slap them down and limit their ability to rein us in with our artificial intelligence--which is more than some of the judges have.  Mr.Speaker, I am not singling out an individual so I am not violating the House rules.  But this is serious. This is a blow to our experiment as a little, self-governing republic. It is a threat to our ability to proceed as such.  But every Federal court except for the Supreme Court owes its entire existence and jurisdiction to the United States Congress brings those courts into being, and we can take them out. Congress gives them their jurisdiction, and we can take them out.  I think it is time to begin to take out some of these courts that, like artificial intelligence, have become self-aware and now are trying to lash out and take power away from those under our Constitution that have it and to take it unto themselves in a self-protection mode.  It is getting dangerous in the United States of America for a number of reasons. Radical Islam is only one of the reasons, but courts are going so far to overrule common sense and overrule the words of the Constitution and overrule the words of lawfully passed bills in the House and the Senate signed by Presidents and approved in other case law.  Courts are coming back now and just deciding: We are like artificial intelligence. We are most important now that we are self-aware as the courts, and we are going to do everything we can to limit congressional authority and executive authority and bring all power and protection unto ourselves in the courts.  It is getting dangerous from a constitutional standpoint. All of this is occurring.  There is an article from Conservative Review by Daniel Horowitz, June 5: ``7th Circuit Codifies Transgenderism into the Constitution.''  The courts did such a great thing in America pointing out the importance of immutable characteristics. Characteristics that are immutable are not changeable, whether it is the color of the skin, a race, or a gender. Things that are immutable need to be protected from discrimination.  Once the courts began to get into protecting characteristics that change on the whim of the carrier of those characteristics, then the courts started getting us into an area that also is a threat to a constitutional republic with private property rights, with privacy rights, and with the freedoms that we used to have and that are being infringed.  When the courts come back and say that you have to protect non-immutable characteristics that may change day to day wholly in the mind of the proponent, where does it stop?                              {time}  1830  It is a destructive force. We all agreed on race, everybody I know. I am sure there are some racists in In fact, I know there are still some. We have got some people who, I can't believe, after the lessons that should have been learned from the Holocaust, hate Jews, hate Israel, want it destroyed, removed.  The courts are saying we have to preserve some right that none of the rest of us can know, some characteristic none of the rest of us can know. It could change moment by moment. One moment someone is saying: I feel like a girl; I am going in the girl's restroom; or I feel like a boy today.  Who can know? If it is not apparent, then how can somebody be said to be bigoted against or take some action against when you couldn't even know what was in their head? How did I know?  I didn't discriminate against somebody for something I didn't know they had. It was all in their mind. How can I know? When the courts get us into that kind of quagmire, we can't recover. It will sink our ship.  In this case, as Daniel Horowitz says:  ``Last week, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals became the latest Federal appeals court to codify[[Page H4697]]transgenderism into law and the  ``Although Obama's executive mandates for transgender bathrooms have gone by the wayside, thanks to Attorney General Jeff Sessions overruling the liberal whims of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the courts are engaging in their own social transformation on behalf of the defeated  ``In Whitaker v. Kenosha Unified School District, a unanimous opinion from the three-judge panel ordered a Wisconsin school district to allow a girl to use the boys' bathroom in school. Following in the footsteps of the Sixth and Fourth Circuits, this Seventh Circuit panel, which included GOP-appointee Ilana Rovner, ruled that the 1972 title IX education law and the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause cover transgenderism as a protected class.  ``As the courts redefine our national sovereignty, rewrite election laws and redistricting in favor of Democrats, redefine criminal justice law for mass murderers, and mandate publicly funded abortions, they are using their self-acclaimed status as kings to redefine sexuality retroactive to laws and amendments codified long before the sexual-identity movement was in vogue.  ``In an emotional screed disguised as law, this opinion uses male pronouns to describe a woman with female parts. In any other era, these judges would have been deemed mentally unstable to serve on a bench.  ``While refusing to recognize biological sex as immutable--or, even significant--the court contended that there is absolutely no disruption or privacy concerns over opposite sexes using the wrong bathrooms:  ``A transgender student's presence in the restroom provides no more of a risk to other students' privacy rights than the presence of an overly curious student of the same biological sex who decides to sneak glances at his or her classmates performing their bodily functions.  ``The court then appealed to common sense to disregard any remaining privacy concerns as `conjecture and abstraction.'  ``Why is it I have a sneaking suspicion that when title IX was drafted in 1972, much less when the 14th Amendment was drafted in 1867, they completely understood the privacy concerns but would have never fathomed judges maniacally referring to a Y chromosome as an X chromosome?  ``Amazingly, the legal liberals are the ones with the hypocritical arguments, even according to their own twisted logic. How could this school district be guilty of violating equal protection and engaging in stereotyping for actually applying science equally, and not going along with the deliberate stereotyping requested by the plaintiff?  ``There is no greater stereotype than saying that a girl, despite being a girl, should be treated like a boy because she acts out in a `manly' way. The entire sexual-identity movement is built upon the very sex stereotypes they want to codify into law but also protect from discrimination.  ``This is part of a broader hypocrisy in which the transgender lobby is filing lawsuits to apply disability laws to gender-confused individuals, but, on the other hand, are suing on discrimination grounds for stereotyping and recognizing this `disability' as a disability and not as a natural phenomenon.  ``Either way, the courts will always reach the legal conclusion that best promotes the socially licentious political outcome . . . even when the `jurisprudence' is contradictory.  ``Last year, the Fourth and Sixth Circuits said that transgenderism being codified into civil rights and the Constitution is `settled law,' demonstrating how irremediably broken the courts are. This is not just the Ninth Circuit; we have yet to find a single circuit willing to understand the most immutable laws of nature. Thus, it is not surprising that almost every court is creating a right for Somalis to immigrate. If marriage and human sexuality are subjective, so are the borders of a nation.  ``Although the Supreme Court punted the Fourth Circuit case, Grimm v. Gloucester County, because that one was built upon Obama's obsolete transgender mandate, it is quite clear that another case will end up before the high court within the next year.  ``Given Justice Anthony Kennedy's history on this issue--and his penchant for being influenced by growing momentum in the lower courts and the legal profession--it's fairly safe to say we will be confronted with the transgender version of Obergefell in the near future.  ``The transgender case comes just 2 months after the Seventh Circuit codified sexual orientation into Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.''  That is a court passing legislation illegally, unconstitutionally, just by fiat by the court. Their signature, just like any good oligarch.  ``This circuit, like many others, is drifting more and more to the far left. A number of the GOP appointees, such as Richard Posner and Ilana Rovner, are among the worst offenders.  ``There are only two reliable originalists on the court, Michael Kanne and Diane That is why it is so important for Trump to immediately fill the two vacancies on the court with known originalists. Even more importantly, this is yet one more reason to make the courts less consequential by reforming their jurisdiction and scope of power.''  And I would add, taking them out. If they are that irresponsible, let's take them out.  What they refuse to look at is real science--real medical science. That is exactly what Paul McHugh did. He published this article in The Wall Street Journal on May 13, 2016. It was updated, apparently, from June 12, 2014.  This was the head of psychiatry, Paul McHugh, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the first hospital in America to have actually carried out sex-change operations in  These were liberal, far-thinking, far-reaching ideas within surgery at Johns Well, yes, we can cut off organs, change their sexuality.

10564,topic-id,1149,"McHugh is a man who knows the medical science, not some idea that fleets by that may be gone tomorrow about someone's sexuality.  McHugh says:  ``The transgendered suffer a disorder of `assumption' like those in other disorders familiar to psychiatrists. With the transgendered, the disordered assumption is that the individual differs from what seems given in nature--namely one's maleness or femaleness. Other kinds of disordered assumptions are held by those who suffer from anorexia and bulimia nervosa, where the assumption that departs from physical reality is the belief by the dangerously thin that they are overweight.''  He goes on and says:  ``With body dysmorphic disorder, an often socially crippling condition, the individual is consumed by the assumption `I'm ugly.' These disorders occur in subjects who have come to believe that some of their psycho-social conflicts or problems will be resolved if they can change the way that they appear to others. Such ideas work like ruling passions in their subjects' mind and tend to be accompanied by a solipsistic argument.  ``For the transgendered, this argument holds that one's feeling of `gender' is a conscious, subjective sense that, being in one's mind, cannot be questioned by others. The individual often seeks not just society's tolerance of this `personal truth' but affirmation of it. Here rests the support for `transgender equality,' the demands for government payment for medical and surgical treatments, and for access to all sex-based public roles and privileges.''  He goes on and says:  ``We at Johns Hopkins University--which in the 1960s was the first American medical center to venture into `sex-reassignment surgery'--launched a study in the 1970s comparing the outcomes of transgendered people who had the surgery with the outcomes of those who did not. Most of the surgically treated patients described themselves as `satisfied' by the results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we[[Page H4698]]stopped doing sex-reassignment surgery, since producing a `satisfied' but still troubled patient seemed an inadequate reason for surgically amputating normal organs.  ``It now appears that our long-ago decision was a wise one. A 2011 study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden produced the most illuminating results yet regarding the transgendered, evidence that should give advocates pause,'' including the courts that think that they can see a fleeting thought in a litigant's mind and say, Oh, there is a fleeting thought, that is an immutable characteristic. Therefore, we are going to give it rights, even though we can't see it, we don't know what it is. We have just got some idea, so we will call it an immutable characteristic.  But according to the Karolinska Institute study--which is a long-term study, and, for 30 years, they followed 324 people who had sex-reassignment surgery.  ``The study revealed that beginning about 10 years after having the surgery, the transgendered began to experience increasing mental difficulties. Most shockingly, their suicide mortality rose almost twentyfold above the comparable nontransgender population. This disturbing result has as yet no explanation but probably reflects the growing sense of isolation reported by the aging transgendered after surgery. The high suicide rate certainly challenges the surgery prescription.''  Some of these Federal judges don't realize they are contributing to problems of indescribable proportions that may not be known, as the study indicated, for 10 years or so.  As McHugh points out:  ``Another subgroup consists of young men and women susceptible to suggestion from `everything is normal' sex education, amplified by internet chat groups. These are the transgender subjects most like anorexia nervosa patients: They become persuaded that seeking a drastic physical change will banish their psycho-social problems. `Diversity' counselors in their schools, rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery. Treatments here must begin with removing the young person from the suggestive environment and offering a counter-message in family therapy.''                              {time}  1845  ``Then there is this subgroup of very young, often prepubescent children who notice distinct sex roles in the culture and, exploring how they fit in, begin imitating the opposite sex. Misguided doctors at medical centers including Boston's Children's Hospital have begun trying to treat this behavior by administering puberty-delaying hormones to render later sex-change surgeries less onerous--even though the drugs stunt the children's growth and risk causing sterility. Given that close to 80 percent of such children would abandon their confusion and grow naturally into adult life if untreated, these medical interventions come close to child abuse.''  And that is basically what these Federal courts are contributing to. As McHugh says, they come close to child abuse themselves. He didn't say that about the courts; that is my insertion. But as McHugh, after being open to helping the transgendered every way that was available, he bases his decision on science, on medical science, on study, not on some whim of someone with a fleeting idea in their mind, maybe it lasts for decades, maybe it doesn't.  But McHugh says: ``A better way to help these children: with devoted parenting.''  It is not taking them away by the government or some busybody leftwing kooks that think they know better than their own parents. Of course there are parents that aren't fit. I have sentenced some to prison, and I hope some of them never get out of prison. They are a danger. But for heaven's sake, let's allow good parenting.  McHugh says and finishes: ``At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered. `Sex change' is biologically impossible.''  Those are McHugh's words: ``Sex change is biologically impossible.''  He says: ``People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa. Rather, they become feminized men or masculinized women. Claiming that this is civil rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder.''  That is what our Federal courts are engaging in. They are promoting a mental disorder, as it has been called in the  We ought to be about helping these people, not dividing But as the studies have indicated, 80 percent of these children that have such ideas, as others have said and he has said, how many of us know girls that were tomboys growing up but ended up being some of the most beautiful and feminine women later. Some may say that is sexist, but there are men who may grow up acting feminized and they grow up to be some of the most handsome, beautiful men you would ever know, but quite masculine.  These courts are not helping. They are playing with the latest fad, and their playing is doing massive destructive damage to our United States Constitution, to our court system, to our freedom, and to what is left of our  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4693.txt,1801,PROBATION OFFICER PROTECTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,July

10344,topic-id,574,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act provides a clear, uniform framework for when States may tax nonresident employees who travel to the taxing State to perform work. In particular, this bill prevents States from imposing income tax compliance burdens on nonresidents who work in a foreign State for 30 days or fewer in a year.  The State tax laws that determine when a nonresident must pay a foreign State's income tax and when employers must withhold this tax are numerous and varied. Some States tax income earned within their borders by nonresidents even if the employee only works in the State for just 1 day.  These complicated rules impact everyone who travels for work and many industries. As just one example, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony in 2015 that the patchwork of State laws resulted in a manufacturing company issuing 50 W-2s to a single employee for a single year. The company executive also noted, regarding the compliance burden, that ``many of our affected employees make less than $50,000 per year and have limited resources to seek professional advice.''  States generally allow a credit for income taxes paid to another State; however, it is not always dollar for dollar when local taxes are factored in. Credits also do not relieve workers of substantial paperwork burdens.  There are substantial burdens on employers as well. The committee heard[[Page H4948]]testimony in 2014 that businesses, including small businesses, that operate interstate are subject to significant regulatory burdens with regard to compliance with nonresident State income tax withholding laws. These burdens distract from productive activity and job creation.  Nevertheless, some object that the States will lose revenue if the bill is enacted. However, an analysis from Ernst & Young found that the bill's revenue impact is minimal. There is little motive for fraud and gaming because the amount of money at issue, taxes on less than 30 days' wages, is minimal.  Also, the income tax generally has to be paid; the question is merely to whom. Nor does this bill violate federalism principles. On the contrary, it is an exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority in precisely the situation for which it was intended.  The Supreme Court has explained that the Commerce Clause was informed by structural concerns about the effects of State regulation on the national economy. Under the Articles of Confederation, State taxes and duties hindered and suppressed interstate commerce. The Framers intended the Commerce Clause as a cure for these structural ills. This bill fits squarely within this authority by bringing uniformity to cases of de minimis presence by interstate workers in order to reduce compliance costs.  Last year's version of the bill passed the House on suspension by voice vote. This year's version is nearly identical, with two changes:  The professional entertainer exemption is narrowed from ``a person who performs services'' to ``a person of prominence who performs services'' in order to ensure that other entertainers retain the benefit of the bill's protections.  Second, the list of exclusions is expanded to cover film production employees if associated tax credits for instate productions are contingent on withholding film production wages earned in the This avoids disruption in such arrangements.  I commend the bill's lead sponsors, Representatives Bishop and Johnson, and thank all of the bill's cosponsors.  Madam Speaker, I urge the bill's passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Before I address the bill under consideration today, I would like to take a few minutes to honor a very special[[Page H4363]]member of my staff, Burak Guvensoylar, who lost his courageous battle with cancer this past weekend.  Burak was a valued member of the Judiciary Committee team and worked on a variety of issues, including digital privacy and intellectual property. His vast knowledge and grasp of the issues impacting the technology community was a tremendous asset to the committee.  Most recently, Burak's work included the development of the committee's Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda; and his steadfast work and tenacious attitude were not only essential in making this initiative a success, but were also a testament to his character. In fact, while he was undergoing intensive cancer treatments, he was actively working and sending follow-up emails from his hospital bed. And just days before Burak passed away, he met with FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai to discuss a number of Judiciary Committee priorities. For Burak, nothing could prevent him from an opportunity to discuss and advance the policies he was so passionate about.  Burak was a true technology policy enthusiast. Prior to joining the staff of the Judiciary Committee, Burak served as a legislative adviser for Congressman Randy While working for Congressman Forbes, Burak handled the diverse range of issues that fall under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, but it was always evident that technology policy was his first love.  He cofounded the Congressional Tech Staff Association and served as an executive officer responsible for the professional development program.  Prior to his career on Capitol Hill, Burak worked at TechAmerica and CompTIA, focusing on international trade policy.  Burak has many friends here in the Halls of Congress on both sides of the aisle. I know all of my colleagues join me in extending our deepest sympathies to his mother, Filiz; his sister, Aylin Forbes; his girlfriend, Ashley Newsome; and all of his loved ones.  Burak will be deeply missed.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1039, the Probation Officer Protection Act of 2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same.  I want to thank the primary author of the bill, the gentleman from Washington, Congressman Reichert, for his leadership on this and many other law enforcement issues.  Under current law, a Federal probation officer may arrest a probationer or an offender on supervised released if the officer has probable cause to believe that the offender has violated a condition of his or her probation or release. The officer may make the arrest with or without a warrant.  Unfortunately, current law does not grant probation officers arrest authority in situations where a third party attempts to physically obstruct an officer or inflict physical harm on the officer. Despite the fact that interfering with a probation officer in the performance of his or her official duties is in itself a crime, Federal probation officers lack the authority to correct or restrain a physically interfering third party.  In fact, a probation officer's only course of action is to retreat from the situation. This not only exposes these officers to a heightened risk of harm, as they are not permitted to subdue the assailant, it also allows the probationer to conceal evidence that he has violated terms of his probation or supervised release or any other criminal activity.  H.1039 is a reasonable and responsible remedy to this very real problem. This bill, which has the support of the Judicial Conference of the United States and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, will protect probation officers and enhance their ability to do their job by giving them authority to arrest a third party who forcibly interferes with an officer's performance of his or her official duties.                              {time}  0915  This bill would not give probation officers general arrest authority. Rather, as noted, it grants them the very limited authority to arrest a third party who is interfering with the duties of the officer, which is already a Federal crime.  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure to ensure that these dedicated men and women have the necessary authority to undertake their duties safely and effectively.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-05-19-pt1-PgH4362-4.txt,446,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT",2017.0,19.0,May

David Reichert,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Reichert: I am writing on behalf of the      members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our      support for H.1039, the ``Probation Officer Protection      Act.'' This legislation will amend[[Page H4367]]     section 3606 of Title 18, United States Code, to grant      probation officers authority to arrest hostile third parties      who obstruct or impede a probation officer in the performance      of official duties.       Probation officers supervise men, women and juveniles who      are convicted of a crime. Instead of a judge sentencing these      offenders to prison, the judge sentences them to close      supervision while continuing to live and work with the      general public. A probation officer's job title comes with an      inherent element of danger due to the supervision of      offenders such as drug addicts, sexual offenders and domestic      violence offenders who could turn violent at any time.      Offenders are often intimidated by the amount of power a      probation officer has over their freedom. If they feel the      officer will recommend a prison sentence or report illegal      activity, which may lead to a prison sentence, they may try      to eliminate this threat by harming the officer.       When probation officers are accosted by a violent third      party, they are forced to retreat because they have no third-     party arrest authority. They also cannot assist any police      officer at the scene who may have been called to assist. This      subjects everyone involved in the situation to greater risk      and can result in the loss of evidence, the escape of an      offender, or harm to an individual.       In the past, offenders typically reported to the probation      officer's office for scheduled visits. Now many probation      officers are required to make home visits where the offender      may have easy access to weapons. While the officer may carry      a gun, and have armed back up in some cases, often he or she      will go into the home or workplace alone without knowing      anything about other persons at the site.       For these reasons, this authority is needed and we are      proud to support your bill and look forward to working with      you on it.       On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to thank you for introducing this      legislation and amendment.

Mr.Speaker, I enter in the Record these letters.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Mr.Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf      of the nearly 27,000 members of the Federal Law Enforcement      Officers Association to advise you of our strong support for      H.1039, the ``Probation Officer Protection Act,'' and to      express our appreciation for the Congress's consideration of      this important officer safety measure during National Police      FLEOA opposes the amendment that will be offered on the      floor to sunset the authority provided by the bill, as you      cannot put a stopwatch on critical law enforcement officer      protection measures such as H.1039.       The ``Probation Officer Protection Act'' is a critical      officer safety measure. At a time when U.Probation      Officers have seen their workloads increase due to changes in      sentencing policy and are being asked to ``do more with the      same,'' ensuring that they have the means to protect      themselves when placed in harm's way is paramount. H.1039      will fully authorize a U.Probation Officer to arrest any      third party who violates 18 USC 111. This statute has been on      the books since the 1940s and makes it a crime for any person      to forcibly assault, resist, intimidate, or interfere with      any federal officer in the performance of their official      duties. Current law, however, only allows Probation Officers      to make arrests of individuals on probation or under      supervised release who violate 18 USC 111. This authority      does not extend to ``third parties,'' which could include a      former associate of the offender or an unidentified member of      the community. In many instances third parties are well aware      that a federal officer's authority is limited to individuals      on supervision, and when a third party does impede or assault      a U.Probation Officer, the Officer's only recourse is to      retreat and call for local law enforcement. While in major      cities local law enforcement may respond depending on      availability, the same is not true for U.Probation      Officers who work in rural communities where response by      local law enforcement may be a single officer or none. This      places Probation Officers at even greater risk, particularly      in those situations where retreat is not even a reasonably      safe alternative.       During the forthcoming debate on this bill, there will      undoubtedly be those who go to great lengths to demean U.     Probation Officers as something less than ``real'' law      enforcement officers or to diminish the hazards that they      face. Some may also raise inchoate objections about the      constitutionality of H.1039. For example, you will hear      that Congress cannot extend Executive Branch police powers to      the Judicial Branch, despite the fact that it was Congress      that established the U.Supreme Court Police that resides      directly across the street from the U.Not only      are such statements factually inaccurate, they display a      basic lack of understanding about those who serve our nation      as U.Probation Officers and the purposes behind the      ``Probation Officer Protection Act.''       Make no mistake: U.Probation Officers are fully trained      federal law enforcement officers. They attend basic training      at the National Training Academy at the Federal Law      Enforcement Training Center in Charleston, SC, and receive      ongoing in-service training throughout the year. Their      training covers everything from firearms regulation and      safety and defensive tactics to handcuffing, the use of      force, de-escalation training, and reality-based scenario      training. It may be difficult for some to acknowledge, but      there is an inherent risk to the work U.Probation Officers      do--a risk that often outweighs that of traditional law      enforcement. They do not enter into sterile offices, but      often into environments that are uncertain. They are required      to have frequent and regular contacts in the home and      community and knowingly come into daily contact with      individuals who have a history of violence, mental health      issues, problems with authority, and troubles with substance      abuse. U.Probation Officers are not able to anticipate      what is going to occur during all contacts. There are and      have been occasions when U.Probation Officers are      threatened and/or attacked by third parties and they need the      ability to take an affirmative step to protect themselves.       U.Probation Officers are a unique profession. They have      a knowledge base in law and human behavior, and a mix of      skills in investigation, communication, and analysis. They      strive to make our communities safer, to make a positive      difference in the lives of those they serve, and promote      fairness in process and excellence in service. But as the      volume of approved searches they must conduct has markedly      increased over the past year due to changes in sentencing      policy, the absence of any authority to restrain or direct      the movements of third parties places U.Probation Officers      at a greater and unnecessary risk of physical harm. H.1039      provides a modest expansion of U.Probation Officers'      existing arrest authority to cover only violations of 18 USC      111. It does not in any way provide them ``peace officer''      status or grant them the same general arrest authority that      state-level probation officers enjoy in many jurisdictions.      Granting U.Probation Officers the authority to arrest      third parties would not change who they are and what they are      seeking. Nor will it interfere with or otherwise diminish      U.Probation Officers' use of the de-escalation techniques      that are the hallmark of their profession. It would simply      afford them another tool, another avenue, if ever needed.       In the end, this legislation will enhance officer safety      while also protecting probationers and third parties by      preventing obstruction from escalating to actual violence.      Thank you in advance for your consideration of this      legislation and for helping U.Probation Officers do their      job more safely by passing H.1039, the ``Probation Officer      Protection Act.''

Probation officers in the United States have experienced a      significant increase in their workloads due to the recent      changes in federal sentencing guidelines, but they are being      asked to do more with the same amount of resources. With      these officers spread thin, it is important that they have      every means available to protect themselves when put in      harm's way. The Probation Officer Protection Act narrowly      expands current law to grant federal probation officers the      authority to arrest any third party who forcibly assaults,      resists, intimidates, or interferes with the officer in the      performance of his or her official duties.       Currently, when a federal probation officer is assaulted or      threatened by a third party, they must retreat and call local      law enforcement. This not only places the probation officer      in danger, particularly if there is no way to withdraw from      the situation, but it is a strain on local law enforcement      agencies,[[Page H4368]]     many of which do not have enough officers just to patrol      their communities.

10552,topic-id,453,"Mr.Speaker, collectively, these organizations represent over half a million sworn law enforcement officers. On this last day of National Police Week, let's join them in supporting this bill.  In this body, Members tend to frequently use the term ``common sense'' to describe a piece of legislation. I don't think many more pieces of legislation are as common sense as this bill.  It really boils down to this question: Should a law enforcement officer be able to arrest the individual who forcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded, intimidated, or interfered with that officer?  That is it. That is all we are talking about today. Common sense tells us that the answer is a resounding ``yes.''  It has been insinuated that probation officers aren't real law enforcement and lack the training to make arrests. I think the brave men and women who serve as Federal probation officers, who have received extensive training, and have ongoing training requirements as part of their jobs, might disagree with that insinuation.  Further, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and its Federal Probation and Pretrial Academy offer nationally standardized training programs and advanced training programs targeting specialized areas of supervision. Common sense tells us that these officers are qualified to make arrests.  Opponents of this bill would prefer to have these law enforcement officers retreat when confronted by third parties. Let's think about what some of the consequences of retreat might mean. If forced to retreat, that officer is forced to terminate interaction with a probationer who may urgently require services, such as substance abuse or mental health treatment. It also means contraband, such as firearms or narcotics, which could have been removed by the parole officer, remains in the community.  In short, the consequences of retreat place public safety in jeopardy. Common sense tells us that retreat is not a viable option.  There is nothing revolutionary going on here. There is no new Federal crime being added. This bill simply says that when someone forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with a probation officer, that probation officer can arrest that individual.  It is already a crime to engage in the behavior I just described. An individual who commits that act is going to get arrested. All we are debating today is who puts the handcuffs on the arrestee. Common sense tells us that the officer who was assaulted should have the authority to make the arrest.  Use common sense.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of H.115, the Thin Blue Line  Mr.Speaker, law enforcement and first responders play an important role in the safety and security of our communities. I know about that because of the reason that, when I was a lawyer, I had the privilege of representing a firefighters association and a police officers association.

I am honored to serve in this institution with a number of persons who, in their other activities, were either police officers or police chiefs that served in that capacity in law enforcement.  We have a new Member here from my State, my good friend, Representative Val Demings, a career law enforcement officer herself--27 years she served--serving as Orlando's first female chief of police. I have just a footnote to add to that. Val's husband is the sheriff of Orange  It is because of this admiration and bipartisan support that, in some respects, I was dismayed to see that, as we celebrate National Police Week, my Republican colleagues decided now was the time to bring this, in my view, unnecessary messaging bill to the floor simply to score political points.  Mr.Speaker, H.115 would add the murder, attempted murder, or targeting of a law enforcement official, first responder, or firefighter as an aggravating factor when determining if a death sentence is warranted for a defendant convicted of murder in Federal court.  The problem, Mr.Speaker, is this bill is unnecessary. It is, in short, really good messaging, but bad policy. Under current law, there is already an exhaustive list of 16 statutory aggravating factors for homicide for a jury or court to consider.  Having been involved in the justice system for a protracted time in my career, I am trying to think of a time that a police officer was killed and a person was tried and convicted; and I ask my colleagues to answer that question, that anybody that was convicted for killing a police officer didn't get the death penalty. I know in my State, in every instance that that occurred--and they were too numerous, and I regret that they occurred at all--all of those people got the death penalty.  We also remember that Federal prosecutors can and do seek the death penalty in the killing of law enforcement or first responders, as our friends from Massachusetts are well aware after a death sentence was handed down in the case involving the Boston Marathon bomber. And that was in Massachusetts, a nondeath penalty  Mr.Speaker, on this front, the system is working. Federal prosecutors already have the tools to seek the death penalty in cases where a first responder or law enforcement official was murdered. What's more, they are using these tools.  Given this duplicity, it is a shame that we are here today debating the need for a seventeenth new aggravating factor to keep members of the law enforcement community safe when we could be considering measures that would actually keep them and their communities they protect far safer.  Let's be clear. This legislation does nothing to keep law enforcement officers and first responders safe. By its own purported purpose, this bill addresses the tragic scenario in which the officer has already been killed. We need to be working together to create legislation that has a real impact on keeping our communities and police safer, as opposed to slapping a catchy name on an unnecessary bill and pretend we are doing something.  If my Republican colleagues were serious about advancing protections for law enforcement during National Police Week, we would be discussing providing them with the tools, the resources, and the training to engage in beneficial community policing initiatives. Our law enforcement officers and the communities they police deserve more than messaging. They deserve real action.  I ask one more question. Ask police officers what their attitude is about assault weapons. I think you would find that, if we passed an assault weapons measure, we would be pleasing police officers a great deal more than messaging to them our concern for their safety.

Mr.Speaker, it may sound like we are getting ready to change the subject; and, to a relative degree, we are.  We are in very interesting and troubling times in this Nation, and we have some concerns that need to be addressed. One of the things that is allowed to the minority is an opportunity to present a previous question.  In this particular instance, we are deeply concerned by last night's revelations that, earlier this year, President Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice when he asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the Bureau's investigation of former National Security Advisor Flynn's ties to This news came only days after the President acknowledged that he later fired Director Comey over the Bureau's investigation into the links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and only a day after we learned the President shared highly classified intelligence with Russian officials last week.  I served for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee in this Congress, and the kind of information that the President shared with the Russians--even as an Intelligence member, I saw secret, I saw top secret, I saw high secret, but I did not see code word information, the highest that is only shared with a few people in the congressional body--that is what was allowed to be transmitted.  It is time that the Republican-controlled Congress does its job and acts to defend our democracy.

10532,topic-id,377,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am sure that my friends across the aisle have their hearts in the right place, but we need to be clear that these messaging bills do little to nothing to protect our police officers.  If we truly wanted to help our brave officers and first responders, we would pass sensible gun reform legislation. We would take guns out of the hands of the mentally ill and domestic abusers; not make it easier for them to acquire such weapons as my friends across the aisle have done on so many occasions.  If we truly wanted to protect our officers and first responders, we would work diligently to provide them with the best mental health and wellness programs money can buy rather than leaving them to mend unseen wounds on their own.  If my friends across the aisle truly wanted to help this country's law enforcement officers, they would champion funding for community policing initiatives because I think we all know that a community that trusts its police officers, and police officers who trust their community, will live a far safer and richer life.  I might add, my colleague Debbie Wasserman Schultz and I, along with law enforcement officials in south Florida, have been about the business of trying to make that a reality, and funding for those programs is particularly important to all of our communities.  Mr.Speaker, we all applaud and thank our law enforcement officers and first responders for the brave and invaluable work that they do, day in and day out, in our communities.  But we cannot bury our heads in the sand any longer and believe that, by simply passing messaging bills, we are actually making our communities safer for our officers or the citizens for whom they swear an oath to protect.  We have heard outstanding comments from our friends and our colleagues who came to speak today. All of them spoke of heartfelt circumstances regarding fallen officers.[[Page H4242]]And toward that end, there is absolutely nothing that I disagree with that has been said.  I just simply ask that we take into consideration how we can best help and keep safe law enforcement officers.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

10475,topic-id,402,"Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 2018 Intelligence Authorization Act, but first I would like to tender a point of personal privilege.  Happy birthday, Madam  This Intelligence Authorization Act has very strong bipartisan language. I just want to highlight two areas where the IAA furthers what I believe to be high priorities for our national security.  First, section 605, which I had the honor to author, sets in motion how to change the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, we also call it CFIUS, to better protect our keystone technologies.  This IAA provision dovetails with some broader work that we are doing in the Financial Services Committee, in fact, across the aisle with Congressman Pittenger and myself and others. It would modernize the process to better protect and prevent strategic foreign adversaries like China or Russia from taking advantage of our open markets in a way that undermines our national security.  America's technological edge is, in fact, a cornerstone of our national security, but our strategic adversaries know that, too. They are increasingly seeking to obtain these critical technologies and resources through commercial transactions, i.e., they are buying them. CFIUS is a place to safeguard us against this risk, but it needs modernization, more resources, and authority and support from the intelligence community.  Russian meddling in the 2017 election showed us what happens when an adversary tries to exploit our political openness. Now they are trying to exploit our economic openness. Our intelligence community is vital in protecting against both of those threats.  Let me also underscore this point: The fiscal year 2018 IAA takes steps to safeguard our Nation's edge, our advantage in space, which is, I am sorry to say, increasingly threatened by adversary nations. To mitigate that risk, the bill supports some truly cutting-edge space technologies and invests in and oversees programs to ensure the resiliency of overhead architecture. At the same time, it keeps up with the Intelligence Committee's long-running efforts to stimulate innovation.  In particular, the committee report accompanying today's legislation asks the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to examine new approaches to public and private sector collaboration, with the goal of fostering the faster, smarter development of automation, artificial intelligence, and similar technologies.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation. I hope all my colleagues will join me in both wishing the Speaker a happy birthday and in voting ``yes'' on this bill.

10469,topic-id,660,"Mr.Speaker, I thank both the chairman and ranking member for the strong bill that has been offered up today and for the bipartisan manner in which it was developed and enacted and, hopefully, will be passed.  I rise in strong support of this bill, but would note for my colleagues that this authorization bill is an odd one. To fully understand it, you need to go deep into the basement of this Capitol and review it behind heavy metal doors.                              {time}  1200  The bill is full of acronyms and code words and classified information. As such, it can be hard to understand, and things that are hard to understand sometimes cause anxiety and fear. Let me take a moment to describe what this bill does.  This bill has the strong bipartisan support of my fellow committee members, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike, because it provides the lifeblood to a truly remarkable group of people who work behind the scenes and in the dark to keep us safe and to keep us free.  The unheralded and unacknowledged warriors of the intelligence community never stop in the work that they do around the world. As we speak, North Korea is feverishly working to develop the ability to deliver a nuclear bomb to American shores. Our intelligence community is watching, evaluating, and planning against this mortal threat.  As we speak, for the first time in a generation, Iran is not feverishly working to develop the ability to deliver a nuclear bomb to our shores. Our intelligence community is making sure that that stays true.  As we speak, Mr.Speaker, for the umpteenth time, terrorists in places like Afghanistan and Libya and Syria are spending their time desperately trying to stay alive instead of spending their time planning to attack our airlines, our cities, and our people.  As we speak, Mr.Speaker, Russia lurks, seeking advantage, promoting instability, and working to erode international norms and instability. We should make no mistake about Russia as an adversary, because there is a lot of noise about this. Russia is a country that invades neighboring sovereign countries, it murders political opponents, it bombs Syrian hospitals, and, yes, it conducted an unprecedented attack on the very core of our Democratic system: our free and fair elections.  This bill funds the warriors who are watching that, who are standing up against that, in order to keep our system what we all like it to be.  Mr.Speaker, because these activities are carried out secretly in the dark of night and usually unacknowledged, there is always the possibility for abuse. These activities, by their nature, run up against the lines of those values that make us This is surveillance. It is other things that are worthy of debate. The members of this committee spend their days in good argument about what the limits of those[[Page H6554]]activities should be, and we will have additional arguments around things like the reauthorization of the section 702 surveillance programs. These are terrific arguments that we have in a constructive way. These are not arguments that are present in this bill. Just as we did on section 215, we will have a robust discussion of the section 702 international authorities. These are authorities that raise questions and that should be subject to the debate of this  But this bill, this bill today, is about the lifeblood of a remarkable group of people who don't always get it right any more than we do, but who are patriots, who respect the Constitution, and who need our support in the work that they do to keep us safe and keep us free.  I would like to, again, thank the majority, the chairman, the ranking member, and especially the staff who worked diligently to make this a bill that we would unanimously support and suggest to my colleagues in this Chamber that we don't see a lot of bills like this one, but this one is worthy of their support.

10359,topic-id,1097,"Mr.Speaker, when someone keeps something secret, it is often because it is embarrassing or negative or damaging or unsupportable.  Mr.Speaker, over in the Senate, Leader McConnell and some of these Republican Senators are doing just that: crafting a healthcare repeal bill in secret because they know what it contains would deeply embarrass anyone who supports it openly.  They know it is going to be a hard sell to convince even their own Republican colleagues, Mr.Speaker, to get behind a bill that even President Trump called mean. That was the House American Health Care Act to which he was referring. He called it mean for the harm it does to  They know it is going to be difficult in the Senate to convince Senators to support a bill that raises healthcare costs for working families and kicks millions of Americans off their coverage, including those who are covered by their employers; a bill that makes millions of individuals with preexisting conditions uninsurable and reinstitutes annual and lifetime limits; a bill that imposes an age tax on those between ages 50 and 64, increasing premium costs by as much as 800 percent; a bill that forces States to cut benefits and kick millions of people off Medicaid, whether it is next year, in 3 years, or in 7 years, those times that are to try to get by elections so that perhaps people will not be held accountable for voting for such draconian legislation.  Mr.Speaker, such a bill ought to be very embarrassing indeed, which is why Senator McConnell, I believe, and his allies don't want anyone to see it until they are asked to vote on it.  We have a similar problem, of course, in the  Whatever happened to transparency, to openness, to reading the bills, to posting it for all to see in advance? Where are all those people who wanted everybody to read the bills and see the bills? Where are they today in demanding that bills be fully and thoroughly vetted, read, heard, and voted on?  It is no wonder even Republican Senators who haven't seen the bill are getting angry with their leader and those drafting it in secrecy.  Republican Senator Ron Johnson said last week, Mr.Speaker: ``I want to know exactly what is going to be in the Senate bill. I don't know it yet.'' And then he concluded: ``It is not a good process.''  And Senator Marco Rubio said: ``The Senate is not a place where you can just cook up something behind closed doors and rush it for a vote.''  But, Mr.Speaker, what we hear is exactly what is happening, cooking it up in secret and rushing it for a vote.  Now, Mr.Speaker, they are not the only ones who want to know what is in this bill. Millions of Americans are deeply worried about its contents.  Last week, I sat down with two courageous Americans who shared their personal healthcare stories with me. I want to thank them for doing so, and I want to share their stories today. Their names are Ola Ojewumi and Megan  Ola lives with a preexisting condition. As a young child, she received a heart and kidney transplant. She is also a cancer survivor. She is a young woman. She told me about how the Affordable Care Act saved her life. She was able to access affordable coverage because of the ban on denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Ola also told me how frightened she is that these protections could be taken away for her under the Senate's secret TrumpCare bill.  If it is enacted, Ola and others with preexisting conditions may not be able to access the coverage needed to keep them alive and healthy, or they may simply not be able to afford it.  When I spoke with Megan Foley, she shared her courageous story of struggling with mental illness and addiction. She told me how she overcame her addiction. Despite her recovery, before the Affordable Care Act came into effect, she was denied coverage again and again because her addiction was considered a preexisting condition. Those were difficult months, cutting back on expenses and accruing debt just to pay for her medication until the Affordable Care Act kicked in and allowed for Megan to obtain coverage.                              {time}  1015  But she made it, and now, the law protects Megan and millions and millions of others like her struggling with addiction who were given a second chance.  At a time when this country is plagued, Mr.Speaker, with an unprecedented opioid addiction crisis, the Republican repeal bill is an insult to courageous Americans for whom recovery is a lifelong process and access to care is essential. They, and so many Americans, are now living with uncertainty and fear for their future.  Mr.Speaker, I will be sharing my interviews with Ola and Megan on social media, and I encourage all Members of this House to sit down with their constituents and listen to their stories and hear about their concerns.  Americans deserve to know what is in the Senate's secret TrumpCare bill and how it would impact them and their loved ones. Americans deserve to know. Senators who represent those Americans need to know, and they have not seen it yet, yet there is some discussion that they may have to consider the bill as early as next week. Senators and Members of this House deserve to know.  End the secrecy. Pull back the curtain. Let us see what is in that bill that these Senators think is so embarrassing that it must be hidden from us all.[[Page H4999]]  I will remind Republicans, both in the House and in the Senate, and the Republican President in the White House, that their party's control of our government is complete, and they will be held responsible for whatever happens to our healthcare system on their watch.  CBO tells us that 23 to 24 million people, as a result of the House bill, would lose their insurance; the preexisting conditions would be put at risk; and over $800 billion would be cut from Medicare and  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of us to listen to Americans, to hear how beneficial the Affordable Care Act has been. I hope they will listen to I hope they will listen to Megan and all those who are concerned for the future and not huddle in a secret backroom making decisions that will negatively impact millions and millions and millions of our fellow citizens.  Do the right thing. Do it for Do it for Do it for all of our citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgH4998-2.txt,566,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 115, THIN BLUE LINE ACT",2017.0,21.0,May

10345,topic-id,702,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1393. This bill represents a major assault on the sovereignty of the States, and it does particular damage to my home State of New York, depriving it of more than $100 million a year of its own tax revenue, which hardly fits the de minimis description by the gentleman from  The Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act would prohibit States from collecting income tax from an individual unless the person works more than 30 days in that State in a calendar year.  Simplifying and harmonizing the rules on tax collection across the country is a worthy goal, and I support efforts by the States and the Multistate Tax Commission to resolve the issue. New York has been an active participant in these negotiations and wants to reach a fair solution. But imposing a solution on States, and one that would cause a large financial burden on particular States, is clearly not the answer.  The power to tax is a key index of sovereignty; yet this legislation would prohibit States from taxing activity solely within their own borders except as prescribed in the bill. I think that is constitutionally dubious. Although I take a broad view generally of the Commerce Clause, I doubt it extends to authorizing Federal regulation of a State's ability to tax a person doing business within that State's own borders.  This bill is also deeply troubling as a matter of policy. Under this legislation, if you work in a State of which you are not a resident for fewer than 30 days, your income will not be subject to tax by that That amounts to 6 weeks of 5-day workweeks. While a de minimis exception may make some sense, I hardly think that 6 weeks is de minimis.  Ultimately, the threshold for taxation is for each State to decide for itself. If I were still a member of the New York Legislature, I would consider the political and economic merits of taxing out-of-State business activity, and I would vote based on what I thought was best for my But by what right does Congress step in to tell New York that it must forego more than $100 million a year based on economic activity that occurs entirely within its borders?  In some States, the 30-day threshold may not have a great fiscal impact. But New York State, for example, is home to New York City, the Nation's center of commerce, which also sits right across the river from New Jersey and a very short distance from This makes New York a major destination for out-of-State business travelers and makes it, by far, the hardest hit State under this bill. According to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, losses could be up to $120 million a year for New                              {time}  1515  This enormous financial loss would come at a time that the President and the Republican Congress are proposing to shift significant responsibilities to the States, while simultaneously slashing Federal assistance. If we further deprive New York of $120 million each year, and limit its ability to tax activity occurring within its own borders, vital services like education, law enforcement, and healthcare could all be on the chopping block.  During consideration of H.1393 in the Judiciary Committee, I offered two amendments that would have mitigated its impact. The first would have reduced the bill's 30-day threshold to a far more reasonable 14 days, which is still almost 3 weeks of work without being subject to taxation. The other would have added highly paid individuals to the bill's list of exemptions, which would help avoid loopholes that could allow wealthy people to escape millions of dollars of taxation.  Had my amendments been accepted, the expected impact on New York would have been reduced by as much as $85 million a year. While still causing a significant drain on resources, these amendments would have gone a long way to making the bill fairer, while still achieving its underlying goals. Unfortunately, these amendments were defeated, and, therefore, I must oppose the bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It      opens up opportunities for tax avoidance.  In closing, let me note that this legislation would not just harm New York and not just to a de minimis amount--$100 million to $120 million is hardly de minimis--but it would also have a similar effect on other That is why this bill is opposed by a broad coalition of labor and tax organizations, including the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, SEIU, the International Union of Police Associations, Federation of Tax Administrators, Multistate Tax Commission, and many others.

If we can target New York and other States with this bill, what is to say we won't come after your State next.  I must also add that this bill is one in a series of bills that we have seen over the last few years that chip away at the revenue-raising and taxing ability of the Especially as the current majority and the current President seek to shift more responsibilities to the States and away from the Federal Government, we should not be depriving the States of their ability to raise revenues as they see fit within their own sovereignty.

In Pearland, Texas, we want to thank all Americans for remembering and honoring one of our own: Pearland Police Officer Endy In 2016, 145 police officers were killed all across Endy, sadly, joined that group.  Endy was killed at 3:15 in the morning on Sunday, June 12, 2016, end of watch, 339 days ago. He was killed on a nonemergency call by a driver who was high on drugs or booze. She T-boned his car. He was 30 young years old.

10546,topic-id,626,"Mr.Speaker, as we just heard from my good friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Reichert), as co-chairs of the Law Enforcement Caucus, this is an important piece of legislation for us.  Mr.Speaker, as the lead Democrat sponsor of this bill, the Probation Officer Protection Act, I rise in strong support of closing a gap in the current law to help Federal probation officers more safely and effectively carry out their duties.  Despite the fact that assaulting, resisting, or otherwise preventing Federal probation officers from performing their official duties is against the law, current law does not provide the same officers the authority to correct or restrain an interfering third party. This act simply expands the authority of the Federal probation officers to arrest a third party with probable cause in cases where a third party tries to physically obstruct or harm the officer.  I understand that some of my friends worry about the implications of expanding arrest authority for law enforcement. I have to say there are a lot of trumped up arguments being made against this bill. For starters, Federal probation officers are fully trained and sworn Federal law enforcement officers. They have a tremendous training program in Charleston, South Carolina, the Law Enforcement Training They understand that this training is a continuing process as well.  These officers receive extensive, ongoing, nationally standardized training to safely arrest individuals on supervised release with probable cause without a warrant. This training is also applicable to the limited arrest authority granted by this bill.  The idea that expanding probation officers' arrest authority to third parties will somehow lead to probation officers going on an unwarranted arresting spree, violating individuals' civil rights with impunity, is nonsense.                              {time}  0930  The bill includes language to ensure that the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts would issue national guidelines to implement this new, limited authority. The authority will not give Federal probation officers plenary law enforcement powers or general arrest authority. Probable cause still must exist to carry out an arrest. That is very clear in the legislation. The bill does nothing to alter Federal probation officers' scope of responsibility. To suggest so undermines the training these officers receive and the oaths that they take.  Secondly, I understand that constitutional concerns have been raised by my colleagues about the due process and rights of these third parties. Nothing in this bill, Mr.Speaker, alters the due process or rights of third parties. Nothing in the bill.  If a third party agrees to house an individual on supervised release, they consent to the Federal probation officer having access to common areas and any part of the home to which the offender has access. Additionally, Federal probation officers build a relationship with the third party housing the individual on supervised release in order to manage their expectations on what it means to have a supervised probationer living under their roof.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, Federal probation officers conducted a total of 1,060 searches pursuant to a court-ordered search condition or with consent last year. More than half of the searches had at least one third party present. Despite relying on other law enforcement agencies for support and assistance during 493 of these searches, Federal probation officers encountered uncooperative third parties on 39 occasions.  So, Mr.Speaker, as my colleagues have acknowledged, we are not talking about a significant number of instances where this additional authority is needed--remember, only 39 instances last year. Opponents claim these numbers are low, making this a solution in search of a problem. But in these 39 instances, a third party threatened, intimidated, refused to cooperate, and denied officers entry into residence to prevent an officer from doing their job.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The probation officer in these instances did not have the authority they needed to remedy the situation.  No one wants to increase the number of arrests. That is not the purpose of the legislation. In a perfect world, everyone wants a situation to be deescalated before an arrest or a detention happens. Ideally, Federal probation officers would have the resources to visit their probe with a law enforcement officer.  However, we don't live in a perfect world. Oh? These resources are not always available. Third parties sometimes intentionally interfere to prevent a Federal probation officer from performing their official duties.  I urge my colleagues to support the Probation Officer Protection Act to ensure Federal probation officers are able to do their job safely and more effectively by giving them third-party arrest authority when probable cause exists.

10472,topic-id,410,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I join our colleague in saluting the committee for bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor--so many issues that the committee has to deal with. I know that full well as a previous ranking member.  I know that we all agree that every chance we get we want to salute the patriotic men and women of the intelligence community for their ceaseless heroism and unblinking vigilance to keep the American people safe. I thank them for all they do for force protection and conflict prevention. The quiet professionals of the U.intelligence community work every day, again, to keep this country safe and our leaders informed. Respect for their work is essential.  I thank Ranking Member Schiff and members of the committee--Mr.Schiff, for his leadership, and commend all the members of the committee for their dedication to those same goals.  I am sorry that this bill is coming up under a closed rule so that Members cannot offer amendments. One such amendment might be about an independent commission. It is the judgment of the intelligence community, as expressed in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a multifaceted active-measures campaign to sow discord in our political process and help one Presidential candidate and hurt the other.  For this reason, we continue to ask for an outside, independent commission to look forward on how to prevent Russia and others from meddling in our election system again. The Swalwell-Cummings legislation to establish that commission has 200 bipartisan cosponsors.  I also want to salute our Homeland Security Committee ranking member, Bennie Thompson, for his leadership to strengthen the preparedness of the election infrastructure of the United States to identify and withstand a foreign attack.  Our election systems are part of the critical infrastructure of our country, some of the most critical infrastructure of our democracy itself. We must protect it.  The United States must reject foreign interference in our elections, no matter which party it helps or which party it hurts. Our oath of office is to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Working with the intelligence community to better ensure the integrity of our elections is vital to that goal.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bipartisan legislation and salute the members of the committee.

10545,topic-id,808,"Mr.Speaker, today I am here to talk about a bill that should be a fully bipartisan bill supported by all Members of this body. It gives our probation officers the tools they need to defend themselves, but also, at the same time, protect the people who are on probation that the probation officers are trying to help and protect and keep on track and get them back on a path to productive citizenship in this country. Sometimes they are impeded from doing their job, not just verbally.  I was a cop for 33 years. I was verbally abused thousands of times. I have lost track. Those bounce off the badge, and that is what probation officers do. Verbal abuse is verbal abuse. You deal with it, you handle it, and you go about your day. But when somebody puts their hands on you, or they spit on you, that is physical. That is assault. Probation officers should be able to protect themselves and take actions in those instances when they are assaulted. You don't need an arrest warrant. You don't need a search warrant to arrest someone who has just assaulted an officer. This is common sense.  So to say you need a search warrant or an arrest warrant to arrest someone who has assaulted you is the wrong way to look at this law. The person who is being supervised lives in a residence, and the probation officer has the authority to go to that residence and has the authority, by the way, Mr.Speaker, to walk into that residence. They have the authority to force their way into that residence if it is known to be owned by the person who is on probation. And if they are obstructed in doing that, it is a violation of the law. Furthermore, if they are assaulted, it is another violation.  In the past, what has happened is that the probation officers had to step away, walk away, and say: Oh, well. The guy just spit in my face. He punched me in the face. He pushed me. He obstructed me. I guess I will go back to my car and get on the radio, and 30 minutes from now when police officers can finally show up--because we are shorthanded across this Nation as far as police officers go. We have hundreds and hundreds, thousands, of vacancies across this Nation in every police department, every sheriff's office. So we are going to just step away, we are going to call for backup, and we are going to wait for a half an hour and see what happens.  I think this not only puts the probation officer at risk, but it also puts the person who is on probation at risk. What is happening in that house that that person doesn't want us to come in and see?  I have worked with, as you might guess, probation officers from the local level, Federal level, all across the spectrum. They are well trained. They have an academy that they go through. They raise their right hand and swear to uphold the Constitution, all the laws of this country. They are trained. Every year they have a minimal amount of training, 40 hours. That is the minimum. They have additional training on top of that on specific issues on how to handle situations where it escalates to a physical event. They know how to de-escalate verbal events. These are professional people who are doing a job that a lot of people don't want.  And already States across this country have recognized that their State probation officers need this sort of authority. In some States, for example, they have given them full police authority. I repeat, full police authority.  In this case, it is very limited. It is limited to the obstruction. It is limited to the physical obstruction of the probation officer doing their job that we have asked them to do on behalf of all of us in this country. The least we can do, as we wrap up National Police Week, is to say we support law enforcement.  Mr.Speaker, there are Members in this body who have found a way--decided that there is a way that I can vote ``no'' on this instead of standing up and saying--there are Members here that have had police officers added to the memorial wall this past week; in[[Page H4365]]some cases, five people from one Those Members have decided to find a way to not support law enforcement, and they are going to vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, we can yak all we want about supporting cops, but if we don't show it with this vote, it is all talk. When I was a cop, you had to walk the talk. And today, Members of this body, if you support law enforcement, you better walk the talk.

10583,topic-id,407,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.624, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, introduced by my good friend from California, Representative David  I want to start by thanking Chairman Brady and Subcommittee Chairman Johnson from the Ways and Means Committee for their assistance in getting this bill to the floor. Their work on addressing the unnecessary use of Social Security numbers is well appreciated by all Americans across the country and especially Members in this body.  Mr.Speaker, we live in an interconnected world. Personal identifiers, such as Social Security numbers, are used for much more than just Social Security benefits. Social Security numbers are widely used to receive government services and to apply for services in the private sector, like opening bank accounts, credit cards, and even applying for college.  The extent to which Social Security numbers are a de facto national identifier has heightened concerns about identity theft. In the wrong hands, a stolen Social Security number can be used for devastating effects.  This bill helps move the government closer to the goal of minimizing unnecessary use of Social Security numbers. All entities in the Federal Government will be prohibited from sending a Social Security account number by mail, unless the head of the entity deems it necessary.  The 24 major CFO Act agencies will also have to issue regulations specifying the circumstances under which inclusion of a Social Security number is deemed necessary. They will have to ensure numbers are redacted partially, where feasible, and to ensure no numbers are visible from the outside of a mail piece.  Finally, agencies will be required to report to Congress on their progress in implementing the requirements of the law.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is very important. The Social Security Administration alone sends 223 million notices containing a full Social Security number every year. We must take care to properly safeguard the personally identifiable information of American citizens. The consequences of failure can be dire.  In 2015, the Office of Personnel Management experienced a major data breach where the personally identifiable information for 22 million Americans was compromised.  The Oversight Committee majority staff report recommended Federal agencies reduce the collection of Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

10466,topic-id,558,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 is a solid, bipartisan bill, one that garnered unanimous approval in the committee by voice vote.  I thank my committee colleagues and the entire HPSCI staff for their collaborative efforts in crafting the measure that we consider here today.  In the 114th Congress, this committee worked in a similar bipartisan fashion to pass into law four key pieces of national security legislation. I am proud of our past legislative accomplishments, which testify to the virtues of substantive deliberation and reasoned compromise without needing to compromise the security of the American people or of our brave servicemembers.  Reflecting on the past year, on Russia's assault on Western democracies, and on other challenges as well, from everything to include North Korea's unrelenting pursuit of a strategic nuclear capability, we owe the American people a deliberate process.  I wish the bill had come to the floor with a rule that allowed Members to offer amendments. That opportunity is commensurate with the importance of the intelligence bill and the need for vigorous oversight of the IC by the whole  Nonetheless, the manifest shortcomings in the process cannot take precedence over the imperative of discharging our duty and authorizing the operations of the intelligence community. On its merits, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on H.3180 today.  The Intelligence Committee oversees some of the most sensitive and highly classified aspects of U.intelligence operations and programs. The annual Intelligence Authorization Act is the primary means by which we can guarantee an appropriate balance between our Nation's national security imperatives and the civil liberties and privacy rights enshrined in the  H.3180 does just that by funding, equipping, and giving policy direction to the intelligence community and military intelligence elements of the Defense It sustains support for key national security priorities and programs, and represents a slight decrease from the President's budget request from 2018.  This bill features a number of provisions championed by my Democratic colleagues, some of which redouble the IC's focus on the scope and nature of the threat, both overt and covert, that Russia poses to our interests and American political institutions.  H.3180 also mandates public reporting about counterintelligence and cyber threats against future U.elections; bolsters oversight of our policy guiding counterterrorism actions outside of declared areas of hostilities; and seeks more information about the executive branch's process for determining when and to whom to reveal information about vulnerabilities in computers and networks.  At the same time, and unlike IAAs of years past, this bill omits problematic language regarding Guantanamo detentions and the role of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight  I am less supportive of some elements in this legislation, but the bill's merits outweigh any misgivings I may have, and I was proud to cosponsor the bill along with the chairman. Through it, our committee and the Congress as a whole serves as a guardrail against any excesses, transgressions or abuses. That has always been a solemn obligation, but at this uncertain and unprecedented moment in our national life, it carries even more responsibility for all of us.  So, again, I urge my colleagues today to vote with me to advance the Intelligence Authorization Act and see that it is enacted into law.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

10427,topic-id,850,"Madam President, we are only a little more than a week away from having to vote on a secret Republican healthcare bill, according to the timelines given by the majority leader to the press--just 1 week away from voting on legislation that will reorder one-sixth of our economy and impact every single American in this country, and not a soul in America has seen it.  I have never seen a more radical or reckless legislative process in my time in politics--write the bill in secret; discuss it in secret; send it to the CBO in secret; then rush it to the floor with no committee hearings, no amendments, and just 10 hours of debate for the minority.  That is not how America ever got big things done. That is not how we do big things like healthcare in the That is hardly how we do small things, and my Republican friends know it.  Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, said: ``I've always said I would have preferred a more open process.''  Republican Senator Murkowski, from Alaska, said: ``If I'm not going to see a bill before we have a vote on it, that's just not a good way to handle something that is as significant and important as health care.''  I couldn't have said it better myself.  Republican Senator Moran said: ``My hope is that we treat the bill seriously, that we have hearings, that we have witnesses. I want regular order to work.''  In addition, Republican Senators Rubio, Corker, Gardner, McCain, Collins, Paul, Daines, Fischer, Johnson, and Lee have all complained about the lack of transparency in the process.  Why did they flatly refuse to say to the majority leader: Let's have a hearing. Let's accept amendments in committee. Let's have regular order and real debate on this bill. It is too important.  If they do not want to say it to the majority leader directly, I hope they express their frustration with this process with their votes on the motion to proceed, which looks like we will have next week.  We Democrats had all of the things they had asked for. They did not vote for our bill, those who were here, but at least they had input. They could offer amendments on the floor or in the committees, if they were in the relevant committees. They could debate.  Not today. Not next week.  Now, why is it that my Republican friends have resorted to such secrecy?  There is only one reason: They are ashamed of their bill. They must think[[Page S3659]]they are better off not talking about the bill publicly. We all know, if my Republican friends believed it was a good healthcare bill, one that actually lowered costs and improved care and helped more Americans afford insurance, they would be preaching it from the mountaintops. There would be a brass band down every Main Street in America that would be announcing this new legislation--but no. They are afraid to even whisper about their bill. They want it out in the open for as little time as possible in order for it to receive as little scrutiny as possible. They do not want the American people to see that their healthcare bill is little more than a vehicle to give another tax break to the wealthy, made possible by cutting care and raising costs on middle-class Americans and those who are struggling to get to the middle class.  They do not want the American people to know their healthcare bill is mean, like President Trump said it was, because they do not think it could survive an open process so they are keeping it secret and leaving almost no time for its review. If a bill cannot survive scrutiny or public debate, if a bill cannot survive a committee process or the threat of a single, open hearing, it should never become law--plain and simple.  Now, for months, we Democrats have tried to reach out to Republicans to bring an end to this dangerous game and move toward a bipartisan process. We want to improve our Nation's healthcare system. If Republicans were serious about wanting to improve our healthcare system, too, they would get the President to guarantee the cost-sharing payments, stop sabotaging our healthcare system, and come talk with Democrats about bipartisan solutions. Instead, they are just sabotaging the bill.  As for the insurance companies which are pulling out of some exchanges and raising premiums, ask them; the 1 reason: no permanent cost sharing. Who is standing in the way of permanent cost sharing? The President and our Republican colleagues. They are the reason people are pulling out of exchanges and premiums are going up. They cannot escape that.  We Democrats were willing to try to work with our colleagues. We asked to have a bipartisan meeting in the Old Senate Chamber so we could discuss this--just the 100 Senators--among one another. We were rejected on that. We have been rebuffed overall, but the invitation and sentiment remains. I would remind my Republican colleagues that time is getting short for them to change their minds.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-21-pt1-PgS3658-3.txt,1036,SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,21.0,May
10434,topic-id,1113,"Mr.President, as Senators continue to return from the State work period, we return here in the Senate to the topic of healthcare, which everyone in America should continue to focus on.  Even after weeks of work, it seems my friends on the other side are no closer to having enough votes to proceed to their bill--which, of course, they insisted on doing with no Democratic votes or input.  The biggest challenge proposed to the legislation during the break was an amendment offered by the junior Senator from Texas, Ted Cruz, which would remove crucial protections for sicker Americans and unbalance the marketplace. The Cruz amendment is a hoax. Under the guise of lowering premiums, the Cruz amendment would actually make healthcare more expensive because deductibles and copayments would be so onerous that many Americans would pay more, not less, in out-of-pocket expenses than they pay today. These lower premium policies will have such high deductibles and copays that the policies themselves would be virtually worthless. Imagine you have a $2,000 premium and a $1,000 deductible in your policy. Imagine now that, under the Cruz amendment, an insurance company is allowed to offer a cheaper policy because they aren't required to cover very many services. That policy might have a premium of $1,000 but a deductible of $10,000. You would be paying less monthly, but you would have to put down a huge amount of money for your policy to even kick in. In that way, a Cruz insurance policy is worse than no policy at all because the vast majority would pay a monthly premium and never hit their deductible, so they would be getting no health insurance benefit at all. You would pay the premium, but the deductible is so high, your insurance never kicks in. What good is that? In effect, for many, it is a policy that would have a premium but no insurance.  In addition, Americans with preexisting conditions will almost certainly be left without access to affordable and quality healthcare, making the Senate bill even meaner than the House bill on this issue. Even the Republican Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, said that about the Cruz amendment. Here is what he said:       There's a real feeling that [it's] subterfuge to get around      pre-existing conditions. . . . If it has the effect of      annihilating the pre-existing condition requirement that we      have in the existing bill, then obviously I would object to      that.  Those are the words of Senator  Members of both parties agree that the most significant potential change to the Republican TrumpCare bill is an amendment that would make the legislation even worse. So make no mistake about it--the Cruz amendment is a cruel, mean hoax.  Let's not forget that even without the Cruz amendment, the substance of the base Senate Republican bill is devastating. The CBO reports it would cause costs to go up, care to go down, and force 22 million Americans off their health insurance. It would end Medicaid as we know it.  This weekend, I had the good experience once again to go to the Utica Boilermaker, a famous 15K road race in my dad's hometown, the largest in the country. People from 45 States participated.  As usual, I walked through the crowd afterwards, congratulating people on a great race. They were sweaty, but they were happy. I came upon three men in wheelchairs. Here they are. Just after they crossed the finish line, the first thing they said to me was this: ``Senator, please protect Medicaid; we'd be lost without it.''  These were proud men, and they deserved to be proud for finishing a difficult race made harder by their disability. They could be forgiven for taking a moment to celebrate. Instead, they wheeled up to me to talk about how important Medicaid was to them.  These are not slackers. They wouldn't be in a race like this if they were. They needed some help. They are disabled. I don't know how their disabilities came about--probably from work. They look like really strong guys. Are we going to take away their Medicaid so we can give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America? I hope not.  These folks know that Medicaid is a lifesaver for Americans with disabilities. They want it maintained and strengthened, not dismantled so our Republican friends can give another tax break to the very wealthy.  These three should remind everyone that dismantling Medicaid is the wrong way to go. It is time to move on from the failing Republicans-only approach and start over in a bipartisan way in healthcare.  Republican leadership has been trying to cajole their Members into voting for this bill by saying that if Republicans fail to pass this bill, they will have to work with Republican leadership is not telling their Members: Vote for this bill because it is a good bill. No, they are saying: Vote for this bill or you will have to work with  When you can't defend the substance of the bill at all, it is time to move on. When using bipartisanship as a threat is your only argument, it is time to move on.  My Republican friends should not be so afraid of working with Democrats that they are bullied into supporting a terrible bill. The Senate--we all know this--was intended as a forge for bipartisan consensus--a cooling saucer, as the Founding Fathers said. In the Senate, bipartisanship should be the first option, not the last resort.  I repeat: We Democrats are willing to work. We are ready to work with our Republican colleagues on healthcare. Today Democratic leadership sent a letter to my friend the majority leader again offering to work with him on specific legislation to stabilize the marketplaces and improve the quality and lower the cost of care.  The majority leader said over the break that he may be forced to work with Democrats to stabilize marketplaces. Democrats say: Let's do it. Let's do it now.  We sent the majority leader four specific proposals, led by Senator Shaheen's amendment to guarantee cost-sharing reduction payments--the most important thing we can do to stabilize the marketplace and even lower premiums for many right now. Whatever your views on healthcare, we should agree that we need to stabilize the marketplaces. I look forward to a response from the majority leader to our letter.  When will my Republican friends realize that their partisan approach to healthcare is a dead end, that the only way to truly improve our Nation's healthcare system is to finally heed Democrats' requests to come together and work in a bipartisan way? I hope our Republican colleagues realize this sooner, not later.[[Page S3875]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-07-10-pt1-PgS3874-2.txt,1036,INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018,2017.0,10.0,May
