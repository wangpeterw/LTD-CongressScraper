              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRVIEW BAPTIST CHURCH

 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and 
honor Fairview Baptist Church in Spartanburg, SC for their 100th 
anniversary, which will be celebrated on June 24, 2018. Fairview 
Baptist Church was established in 1918 by a group of residents of the 
Fairview community, known also as the Flatwoods, under direction of 
Rev. C.M. Ellis and nine charter members. Starting with only 40 members 
100 years ago, Fairview Baptist has since grown to include hundreds 
from the Spartanburg area, while still remaining a welcoming and 
devoted place of worship in the community.
  I acknowledge and celebrate the church's 100 years as a congregation 
faithfully serving the people of Spartanburg.
