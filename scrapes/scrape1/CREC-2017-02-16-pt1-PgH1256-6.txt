                     OBAMACARE IS FAILING PATIENTS

  (Mr. BUCSHON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, many of us have come here to the floor to 
share with the country and our colleagues statistics and data 
demonstrating how ObamaCare is failing patients. We have shown the 
numbers related to skyrocketing premiums and deductibles and reduction 
of patient choice.
  Today, I want to share what my constituents are saying about their 
firsthand experiences with ObamaCare. From comments we have received:
  My deductible went from $250 to $2,500.
  Our deductible skyrocketed to double the amount we were paying. Plus, 
it provided fewer options.
  Our premiums have skyrocketed. We had few options from plans. We had 
to switch doctors.
  We own a pharmacy. We see many with high premiums who can't afford 
the very things they need.
  Cost of insurance keeps going up. It has never gone down.
  I don't have insurance. It is too expensive, and I have kids to feed.
  Mr. Speaker, the status quo under ObamaCare is unacceptable. It would 
be irresponsible and unethical not to act.
  Our plan, House Republicans, will bring families relief by repealing 
and replacing the Affordable Care Act with reforms that lower costs and 
expand access to quality affordable health care to all of our citizens.
