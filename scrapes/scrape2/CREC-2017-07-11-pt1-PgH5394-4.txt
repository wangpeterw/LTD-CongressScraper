                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving and gracious God, we give You thanks for giving us another 
day.
  We pray for the needs of the Nation, the world, and all of creation. 
Bless those who seek to honor You and serve each other and all 
Americans in this House through their public service. May the words and 
deeds of this place reflect an earnest desire for justice, and may men 
and women in government build on the tradition of equity and truth that 
represents the noblest heritage of our Nation.
  These July days are busy, and the work to be done in the people's 
House is complicated--and very important. Bless all Members with a 
surfeit of energy, wisdom, patience, and firm resolve to do their best 
work for the benefit of all Americans.
  May Your blessing, O God, be with us this day and every day to come, 
and may all we do be done for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
