                  CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM

  (Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Children's Health Insurance Program that so many of our vulnerable 
young people depend on for their healthcare coverage. Across the 
country, 8 million young people use CHIP, more than 300,000 people in 
Illinois alone. But their coverage and, consequently, their health and 
future are now in jeopardy because this House has failed to reauthorize 
the program for the first time in 20 years. Yesterday marked 100 days 
since the authorization lapsed.
  Before the new year, Congress temporarily extended limited funding, 
but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is already warning 
that some States won't have funding to make it through the month of 
January.
  It is beyond shameful that this House can pass trillions of dollars 
in tax breaks for those with the most security but not see its way to 
provide health insurance for the children most in need.
  This is a vital program. This is a popular program. This is a program 
that traditionally enjoys bipartisan support. There is no reason to 
continue to extend the uncertainty.
  I urge my colleagues to act and reauthorize the CHIP program as soon 
as possible to offer much-needed stability to families and their 
children depending on this coverage.
