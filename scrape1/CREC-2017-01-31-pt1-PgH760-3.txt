                   WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY?

  (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I, like millions 
of Americans, have been watching over the last 10 or 11 days, and 
especially this past weekend, shaking my head and wondering just what 
is happening in our country?
  This is not who we are. I can't tell you the number of people that I 
spoke to this weekend from all walks of life, all backgrounds, who have 
said this phrase: ``I can't believe I am really seeing this in 
America.''
  Mr. Speaker, I can understand why, in light of Brussels, Paris, San 
Bernardino, I can understand why many of my fellow Americans are 
scared. I share their concern. But let's be clear: this illegal, un-
American executive order signed on Friday does absolutely nothing to 
protect us. It makes us less safe. It was a wonderful gift to ISIS, and 
it must be repealed.
