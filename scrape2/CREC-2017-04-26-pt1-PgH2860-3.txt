                       FIX THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 53 percent of Americans disapprove of 
President Trump's service to this Nation in this first 100 days. I 
didn't say Members of Congress. I didn't say party. I said 53 percent 
of Americans disagree, and I understand why: a healthcare promise that 
did not come to fruition; families are now looking, with his potential 
bill, to higher healthcare costs for our working families; 24 million 
more Americans are off of insurance.
  What about the age tax for hardworking Americans? Americans 50 to 64 
years old will be paying upwards of $12,000 to $14,000 for their 
premium.
  The last insult is to those hardworking Americans who now receive 
Medicare by deleting, depleting, taking away, and destroying $100 
million from the Medicare trust fund.
  There is no other answer. There is no other answer than disapproval, 
because why would anyone who leads this Nation destroy the very health 
care, the very arm of opportunity and rest that Americans have when 
they become sick?
  I think the disapproval is probably too low. Let us fix the 
healthcare system. Let us not destroy it.
