               RECOGNITION OF LOS BANOS POLICE DEPARTMENT

  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the men and the 
women of the Los Banos Police Department as Heroes and Heroines of the 
Month for California's 16th Congressional District, part of the people 
whom I have the honor and pride to represent.
  These men and women tirelessly serve our community and truly are 
remarkable in embodying their motto: Pride in Service, Integrity in 
Action--Pride in Service, Integrity in Action.
  But the pursuit of excellence is not without cost. We know that they 
risk their lives every day on a 24/7 basis.
  Earlier this summer, two Los Banos police officers, Kristifer Hew and 
Aaron Pinon, were shot in the line of duty. I am happy to report that 
both officers are making spirited recoveries, but the risk police 
officers face every day to keep us safe cannot be overstated. So we 
salute them and their families.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Los 
Banos Police Department Heroes and Heroines of the Month for 
California's 16th Congressional District, as well as recognizing all of 
America's law enforcement officers. We can never ever thank them enough 
for their dedicated service as they protect all of America throughout 
our Nation.
