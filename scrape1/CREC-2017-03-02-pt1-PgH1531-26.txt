           By Mr. GOSAR:
       H.R. 1341.
       Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 18, the Necessary and Proper 
     Clause
       In 2011, the United States District Court for the District 
     of Columbia held in Bluman v. FEC that ``It is fundamental to 
     the definition of our national political community that 
     foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to 
     participate in, and thus may be excluded from, activities of 
     democratic self-government.'' Bluman specifically addressed 
     and prohibited political campaign contributions to U.S. 
     elections. In 2012, the United States Supreme Court affirmed, 
     holding that the prohibition in 2 U.S.C. 441 (e) on campaign 
     contributions by any ``foreign national'' was narrowly 
     tailored to achieve a compelling government interest. Given 
     that the Stop Foreign Donations Affecting Our Elections Act 
     supplements the intent of these rulings and the 1966 law that 
     banned such contributions, it is both within the scope of 
     Congress's power and is thus constitutional.
