                PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP FULFILLS PROMISES

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, last night President 
Donald Trump spoke to a joint session of Congress and to the American 
people in a powerful and positive address.
  From day one, President Trump committed himself to fulfilling the 
promises he made to the American people, and last night he outlined his 
bold agenda. I was grateful to hear his plans to repeal regulations, 
reduce taxes, create jobs, repeal and replace ObamaCare, and promote 
veterans.
  As the chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on 
Readiness, I appreciated his determination to rebuild our military by 
providing them with the resources they need to promote peace through 
strength.
  The President's speech received an overwhelmingly optimistic 
response, with nearly 60 percent of viewers having a positive reaction. 
Additionally, 70 percent of the viewers said the President's policies 
would move the country in the right direction.
  I look forward to working with the President and Speaker Paul Ryan to 
achieve the bold, positive vision for American families.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Congratulations to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his wife, Lola, 
a great team for America.
