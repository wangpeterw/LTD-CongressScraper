                               TRUMPCARE

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, today a number of us were able to go to 
the children's hospital here in Washington, D.C., and met two 
miraculous families, children with complex, chronic diseases. With the 
love of their parents, one could not tell they were different from any 
other child, yet they had horrific and difficult medical conditions.
  Those parents were middle class working families, and said that, 
without Medicaid, the half a million dollars of healthcare that keeps 
those beautiful children alive and leads them to a pathway of a life of 
love would not be possible.
  I am glad that the Senate TrumpCare bill has been stopped in its 
tracks, the same bill that the CBO has said will cause 49 million 
Americans to lose their insurance in 2026.
  There is no pathway to reform this bill. There is no White House 
meeting, no Presidential cajoling and shooting deals back and forth. 
These are lives of Americans, and as long as it takes, we will fight to 
the end to stop the demolition of the Affordable Care Act, which most 
Americans, over 50 percent, want the Affordable Care Act.
  Stop the foolishness.
