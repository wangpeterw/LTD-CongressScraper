                                 ______
                                 

   SENATE RESOLUTION 172--DESIGNATING MAY 2017 AS ``OLDER AMERICANS 
                                MONTH''

  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Flake, Mr. Nelson, Mr. 
Rubio, Ms. Warren, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Burr, Mr. 
Blumenthal, Ms. Cortez Masto, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Whitehouse) 
submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 172

       Whereas President John F. Kennedy first designated May as 
     ``Senior Citizens Month'' in 1963;
       Whereas, in 1963, only approximately 17,000,000 individuals 
     living in the United States were age 65 or older, 
     approximately \1/3\ of those individuals lived in poverty, 
     and few programs existed to meet the needs of older 
     individuals in the United States;
       Whereas, in 2017, there are more than 47,800,000 
     individuals age 65 or older in the United States, and those 
     individuals account for 14.9 percent of the total population 
     of the United States;
       Whereas approximately 10,000 individuals in the United 
     States turn age 65 each day;
       Whereas, in 2015, more than 9,300,000 veterans of the Armed 
     Forces were age 65 or older;
       Whereas older individuals in the United States rely on 
     Federal programs, such as programs under the Social Security 
     Act (42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) (including the Medicare program 
     under title XVIII of that Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and 
     the Medicaid program under title XIX of that Act (42 U.S.C. 
     1396 et seq.)), for financial security and high-quality 
     affordable health care;
       Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et 
     seq.) provides supportive services to help individuals of the 
     United States who are age 60 or older maintain maximum 
     independence in the homes and communities of those 
     individuals;
       Whereas that Act provides funding for programs, including 
     nutrition services, transportation, and care management, to 
     assist more than 11,000,000 older individuals in the United 
     States each year;
       Whereas compared to older individuals in the United States 
     in past generations, older individuals in the United States 
     in 2017 are working longer, living longer, and enjoying 
     healthier, more active, and more independent lifestyles;
       Whereas more than 5,300,000 individuals in the United 
     States age 65 or older continue to work as full-time, year-
     round employees;
       Whereas older individuals in the United States play an 
     important role in society by continuing to contribute their 
     experience, knowledge, wisdom, and accomplishments;
       Whereas older individuals in the United States play vital 
     roles in their communities and remain involved in volunteer 
     work, mentoring activities, the arts, cultural activities, 
     and civic engagement; and
       Whereas a society that recognizes the success of older 
     individuals and continues to enhance their access to quality 
     and affordable health care will encourage the ongoing 
     participation and heightened independence of those 
     individuals and will ensure the continued safety and well-
     being of those individuals: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates May 2017 as ``Older Americans Month''; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to provide 
     opportunities for older individuals to continue to flourish 
     by--
       (A) emphasizing the importance and leadership of older 
     individuals through public recognition of the ongoing 
     achievements of the older individuals;
       (B) presenting opportunities for older individuals to share 
     their wisdom, experience, and skills with younger 
     generations; and
       (C) recognizing older individuals as valuable assets in 
     strengthening communities across the United States.
