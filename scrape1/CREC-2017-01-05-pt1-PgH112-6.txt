REPEALING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR HEALTHCARE 
                 SYSTEMS AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COMMUNITY

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Affordable 
Care Act. It is a promise to the American people that we must keep. It 
guarantees access to affordable, high-quality health care as a right 
for all Americans. Backing out of this commitment is irresponsible, 
inexcusable, and reprehensible.
  As a Member from a congressional district that houses some of the 
largest hospitals in the country, health is a crucial issue for my 
constituents. Under the ACA, millions of Americans now have access to 
affordable health care through individual marketplaces and Medicaid 
expansion. Children in New York can remain on their parents' plan 
through the age of 29. An insurance company cannot discriminate against 
patients with preexisting conditions.
  Repeal will be detrimental to our healthcare systems and medical 
research community. Without a plan to

replace the ACA, Republicans are openly gambling with the health care 
of millions, many of whom will be affected, like the elderly and 
disabled who cannot afford to return to the old system of skyrocketing 
costs.
  I will fight for those Americans who rely on the ACA, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same.
