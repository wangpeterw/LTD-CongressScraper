                    OBAMACARE HURTING TEXAS FAMILIES

  (Mr. CARTER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CARTER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare is hurting Texas 
families, as the Speaker knows. The law has led to higher costs, fewer 
choices, and less access to the quality health care that is what the 
American people deserve.
  Currently, over 70 percent of the counties nationwide have two or 
fewer insurers. Texas could see as much as a 48 percent rate increase 
in 2017. This is proof that ObamaCare is failing.
  Hardworking Americans and their families have been begging for an end 
to the ObamaCare burden. It is up to this House to provide one.
  House Republicans have forged a new path to patient-centered health 
care. Our plan looks out for the most vulnerable and allows for 
Americans to choose a plan that best suits their healthcare needs.
  I am committed to repealing the broken promises of ObamaCare and 
replacing them with health care that works for Texas families.
