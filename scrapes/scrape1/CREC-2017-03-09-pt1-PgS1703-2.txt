                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord, the lover of our souls, we praise Your Holy Name.
  Today, fill the hearts of our lawmakers with utter trust in You, 
providing them with faith to persevere in well doing. Renew their 
spirits and so draw their hearts to You that they will find delight in 
their labors as they strive to please You.
  Lord, give them the wisdom to maintain a perpetual contentment for 
the blessings You provide them each day. May they never take for 
granted Your compassion, kindness, and mercies. Strengthen and support 
them in all of their endeavors, using them as instruments of Your peace 
and love.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
