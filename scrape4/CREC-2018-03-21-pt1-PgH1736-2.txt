      RECOGNIZING THE 24TH ANNUAL VERA HOUSE WHITE RIBBON CAMPAIGN

  (Mr. KATKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against domestic 
violence and sexual abuse.
  Domestic violence affects people from all backgrounds. Regardless of 
race, religion, and socioeconomic background, domestic abuse touches 
all aspects of our community.
  According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 
20 people per minute are assaulted by an intimate partner. We must work 
together to stop this.
  Central New York is home to Vera House, a wonderful organization that 
works to prevent and respond to domestic and sexual violence. This 
month, it kicked off its 24th annual White Ribbon Campaign in central 
New York. This campaign raises awareness for the need to put an end to 
domestic violence and sexual abuse.
  Throughout the duration of the White Ribbon Campaign, thousands of 
central New Yorkers, such as myself, will be wearing a white ribbon or 
a white wristband to stand in solidarity against abuse.
  I urge my House colleagues to join me in wearing a white ribbon to 
demonstrate a personal pledge to work towards preventing violence 
against men, women, and children.
