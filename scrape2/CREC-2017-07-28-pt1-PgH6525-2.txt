                  HONORING FOOTBALL PIONEER TOM FLORES

  (Mr. SOTO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a resolution for Tom 
Flores urging he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
  Tom Flores had an outstanding and successful career, both as a 
quarterback and as a head coach. This resolution pays tribute to his 
inspiring athletic talents.
  Flores became the first Hispanic starting quarterback in professional 
football history and played on two Super Bowl-winning teams. Also, he 
was the first Hispanic head coach to win two Super Bowls, a feat he 
accomplished on two separate teams, and he became the first Hispanic 
manager in the National Football League. He left with an impressive 
lifetime record and an 8-3 playoff record.
  Tom has been a trailblazer for Hispanics in the NFL and has motivated 
a generation of new players by showing they can compete and win. Let's 
enter this trailblazer into the Hall of Fame.
