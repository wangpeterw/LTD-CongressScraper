        CONGRATULATING KELECHI IBEZIM ON BECOMING AN EAGLE SCOUT

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kelechi Ibezim, a high 
school senior from Glen Ridge, New Jersey, for becoming the first 
African-American Eagle Scout in Troop 55 of the Northern New Jersey Boy 
Scouts Council.
  This young man is a resident of my district. Along with others in his 
troop, Kelechi led the effort to build an outdoor classroom at the 
Montclair Child Development Center. The center serves underprivileged 
children and focuses on teaching them social skills.

  Kelechi has spent time painting schools, volunteering for nonprofits, 
and serving as treasurer of the youth branch of the Montclair NAACP. He 
plans to pursue a career in business or law once he graduates from 
college.
  Mr. Speaker, Kelechi is just one of the many examples of young people 
in my district making Black history every day. I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Kelechi on receiving his Eagle Scout ranking.
