                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Gary Studniewski, St. Peter's Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Almighty God, we give You praise and thanksgiving for the United 
States of America, birthed on the American creed that You have endowed 
every person with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. We know that true liberty nor happiness is 
possible without recourse to Your divine will.
  Bless the Members of this governing assembly with the wisdom of 
discerning Your will concerning our national affairs and help them 
exercise their powers at the service of the rights of each citizen.
  Bless this House and the country it serves with Your protection and 
peace, You who are source of peace, now and forever.
  Amen.
