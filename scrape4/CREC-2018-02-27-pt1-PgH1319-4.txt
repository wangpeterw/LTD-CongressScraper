                   MISSILE DEFENSE FUNDING FOR ISRAEL

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I am filing a bipartisan 
bill to ensure our ally Israel has adequate missile defenses.
  Threats to Israel come from Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Assad regime in 
Syria, Hamas in Gaza, and Iran. Each has an arsenal that can target 
Israel. The U.S. and Israel recently signed an agreement that the U.S. 
would provide Israel with $500 million a year in missile defense 
funding and that Israel can seek additional support when the two 
nations agree exceptional circumstances exist.
  My bill would codify this law. This would affirm Congress' 
recognition that the $500 million is a floor, not a ceiling, and signal 
Congress' intent to provide more funds where conditions on the ground 
justify it. My bill reflects the view that the term ``exceptional 
circumstances'' should be interpreted in a reasonable and not overly 
restrictive manner. Providing Israel with additional missile defense 
funding could deter Israel's foes from launching an attack and help 
prevent conflict. The goal of my bill is to preserve the peace and to 
ensure that Israel prevails if its enemies choose the path of war.
