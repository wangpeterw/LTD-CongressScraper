                            VOTE EXPLANATION

 Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for 
rollcall vote No. 197, the motion to invoke cloture on McCain-Reed 
amendment No. 1003, as modified, the substitute to H.R. 2810, the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. Had I been present, I 
would have voted yea.
