        SUPPORTING IMMIGRANTS GRANTED TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS

  (Mr. BROWN of Maryland asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of every 
immigrant who has been granted temporary protective status in my 
district and across the Nation. We have nearly 23,000 in Maryland, the 
sixth highest in the country, and 4,000 in my district, one of the top 
five districts in the country.
  Many people with TPS fled countries such as Haiti, El Salvador, 
Somalia, and Syria, ravaged by armed conflict or environmental 
disasters. For over 20 years, they have raised their families here in 
the United States. They are our neighbors and our coworkers. Their kids 
attend our schools. TPS holders have been woven into the fabric of our 
communities.
  Earlier this week, those from Nicaragua were told they will be 
deported. Those from Honduras are next. Deporting people and giving 
them mere months to pack their bags after 20 years in the United States 
is cruel and isn't who we are as Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, as the Trump administration puts the lives of thousands 
in legal limbo, I urge my colleagues to ensure TPS holders can stay and 
pursue an earned path to citizenship.
