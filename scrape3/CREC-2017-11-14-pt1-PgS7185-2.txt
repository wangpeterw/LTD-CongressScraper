                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal Lord God, as the waters fill the sea, let America be filled 
with people who know You. Help our citizens to live for Your honor. 
Increase our faith, hope, and love, that we may receive Your promises.
  Lord, be merciful to our Nation, for You are our hope. Today, inspire 
our lawmakers with the music of Your wisdom, that they may bring hope 
out of despair and joy out of sadness. Teach them to celebrate even in 
the darkness because You are the God who saves us. Give us all the 
strength to not become weary in doing what is right, knowing that in 
due season a bountiful harvest will come.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
