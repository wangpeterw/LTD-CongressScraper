     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Agency Customer 
     Experience Act of 2017''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
       (1) the Federal Government serves the people of the United 
     States and should seek to continually improve public services 
     provided by the Federal Government based on customer 
     feedback;
       (2) the people of the United States deserve a Federal 
     Government that provides efficient, effective, and high-
     quality services across multiple channels;
       (3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Federal employees 
     provide excellent service to individuals, however many parts 
     of the Federal Government still fall short on delivering the 
     customer service experience that individuals have come to 
     expect from the private sector;

[[Page S7067]]

       (4) according to the 2016 American Customer Satisfaction 
     Index, the Federal Government ranks among the bottom of all 
     industries in the United States in customer satisfaction;
       (5) providing quality services to individuals improves the 
     confidence of the people of the United States in their 
     government and helps agencies achieve greater impact and 
     fulfill their missions; and
       (6) improving service to individuals requires agencies to 
     work across organizational boundaries, leverage technology, 
     collect and share standardized data, and develop customer-
     centered mindsets and service strategies.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
     all agencies should strive to provide high-quality, 
     courteous, effective, and efficient services to the people of 
     the United States and seek to measure, collect, report, and 
     utilize metrics relating to the experience of individuals 
     interacting with agencies to continually improve services to 
     the people of the United States.
