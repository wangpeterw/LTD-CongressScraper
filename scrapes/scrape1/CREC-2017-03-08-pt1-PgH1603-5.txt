                       OPPOSING REPEAL OF THE ACA

  (Mr. PANETTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the plan to 
repeal the ACA. A recent analysis of this plan concludes that 10 
million people would lose their health insurance. That is mainly due to 
the fact that the plan would stop Medicaid expansion and shorten the 
Medicare trust fund.
  Many people in my district would be affected by this plan. 68,000 of 
my constituents are covered by the Medicaid expansion, 23,000 
constituents receive assistance to afford health insurance through the 
exchange. If the ACA is repealed and the new plan implemented, 
thousands of my constituents, my neighbors, and my friends would lose 
their coverage.
  But don't just take my word for it or my constituents' word for it. 
Let's ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to look at the 
plan carefully and to give a report as to who and how many people it 
will affect. If you are going to take on something that affects so many 
Americans, then America deserves to know how our health care and our 
lives will be impacted by your plan.
