    SENATE RESOLUTION 234--RECOGNIZING THE SAILORS AND MARINES WHO 
   SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES FOR SHIP AND SHIPMATES WHILE FIGHTING THE 
DEVASTATING 1967 FIRE ONBOARD USS FORRESTAL AND, DURING THE WEEK OF THE 
  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC EVENT, COMMEMORATING THE EFFORTS OF 
                           THOSE WHO SURVIVED

  Mrs. ERNST (for herself, Mr. Cotton, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. 
Warren, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. King, Mr. Cruz, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. 
McCaskill, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. 
Tillis, Mr. Reed, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Hirono, Mr. 
Peters, Mr. Sasse, Mr. Perdue, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Strange, and Mr. 
Heinrich) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Armed Services:

                              S. Res. 234

       Whereas, in 1967, the ongoing naval bombing campaign 
     against North Vietnam from Yankee Station in the Gulf of 
     Tonkin was the most intense and sustained air attack 
     operation in the history of the United States Navy;
       Whereas, in June 1967, USS Forrestal and Carrier Air Wing 
     Seventeen departed Norfolk, Virginia, for duty in the Gulf of 
     Tonkin;
       Whereas, on July 28, 1967, during an underway 
     replenishment, the crew of USS Forrestal reluctantly onloaded 
     volatile bombs that were not intended for carrier use in 
     order to meet the combat requirements for strikes the next 
     day;
       Whereas, despite safety precautions taken by the crew, a 
     devastating fire erupted on USS Forrestal after--
       (1) an electrical surge in a parked aircraft caused the 
     aircraft to fire a Zuni rocket that ruptured a fuel tank on 
     another aircraft; and
       (2) the burning fuel ignited a chain reaction of 9 bomb 
     explosions on the flight deck;

       Whereas the explosions destroyed multiple aircraft and tore 
     massive holes in the armored flight deck of USS Forrestal, 
     and burning fuel dripped into the living quarters of the crew 
     and the below-decks aircraft hangar;
       Whereas, for 18 hours, Sailors and Marines on USS 
     Forrestal, assisted by others from accompanying destroyers, 
     fought to bring the fire under control while hospital 
     corpsmen navigated the mangled flight deck and tended to the 
     wounded; and
       Whereas, the fire onboard USS Forrestal ultimately--
       (1) left 134 men dead and 161 men severely injured;
       (2) destroyed more than 21 aircraft; and
       (3) caused USS Forrestal to terminate its support to the 
     fight in Vietnam and return to Norfolk, Virginia, for 
     repairs: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes that--
       (A) if not for the heroic actions of the crew of USS 
     Forrestal, the consequences of the fire would have been far 
     more devastating to the Sailors and Marines onboard and the 
     aircraft carrier itself; and
       (B) the selfless sacrifices of those who came to the rescue 
     of fellow shipmates and USS Forrestal represent, and are 
     consistent with, the highest traditions of the United States 
     Navy;
       (2) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the USS Forrestal 
     fire; and
       (3) expresses gratitude to the Sailors and Marines who 
     served aboard USS Forrestal for their faithful service.
