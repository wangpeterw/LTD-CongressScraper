                  RESTORING THE RULE OF LAW IN AMERICA

  (Mr. MESSER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government's first duty is to 
protect its citizens. For too long, dangerous gangs like MS-13 have 
exploited our Nation's immigration laws and made our communities less 
safe. Hoosiers are tired of it, and it is well past time to crack down 
on this illegal activity and restore the rule of law in America.
  Today, the House passed a commonsense reform that does just that, 
ensuring violent gangs are kept off our streets. The Criminal Alien 
Gang Member Removal Act would allow law enforcement to detain and 
deport criminal alien gang members who pose a serious threat to our 
safety.
  Instead of waiting on another tragedy, U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement could remove these criminals before they have a chance to 
harm innocent Americans.
  The bill would also prevent these criminals from ever entering the 
United States again. It is really just common sense. This bill will 
make America safer, and it is worthy of our support.
