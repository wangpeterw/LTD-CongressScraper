                       NEWARK COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Newark Community 
Solutions for its continued work on reducing crime and strengthening 
connections between courts and the community.
  Newark Community Solutions works with young people who are at risk of 
being victims or perpetrators of gun violence. They provide job 
training, counseling, and peer mentorship. The organization also 
develops support networks for crime victims and provides mental health 
counseling for veterans and schoolchildren to avoid expulsion.
  Mr. Speaker, Newark Community Solutions produces real results, and 
they are felt throughout Essex County. In cities throughout my 
district, we are seeing safer streets, reduced incarceration, and 
improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.
  The program at Newark Community Solutions can be a model for cities 
throughout the country. Newark Community Solutions shows that, by 
investing in the community, we can build a foundation for sensible and 
thoughtful criminal justice reform.
