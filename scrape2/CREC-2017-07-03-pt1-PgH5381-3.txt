                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God, You created us endowed with freedom. We give You thanks for 
giving us another day.
  On the eve of America's national holiday, may all citizens be mindful 
of the wonder of our Nation's inception. Men and women of goodwill, 
from various backgrounds and sections of the colonies, from disparate 
faith traditions, came together in prayer, and united by a vision of 
political and economic autonomy, courageously placed their lives, their 
liberty and their fortunes on the line to found these United States.
  May all Americans be renewed in their commitment to our 
representative government. May each American citizen expect of 
themselves intelligent participation in the political process, so that 
the Members of Congress they elect might be statesmen and -women who 
are able to represent the interests of their constituents while also 
faithfully honoring their oath to defend the Constitution in doing what 
is best for our Nation.
  In all the celebrations on this weekend, may all that is done be for 
Your greater honor and glory. Amen.
