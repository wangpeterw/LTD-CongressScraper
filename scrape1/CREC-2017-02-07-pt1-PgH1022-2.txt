                          WELCOME HOME, ALYSSA

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with hope, thanks, and renewed 
faith. I am joyful because of a young lady from home, Alyssa Ferguson. 
She was born on January 7, 2002.
  Two days after her 12th birthday, Alyssa was told that she had a 
tumor the size of a baseball in her brain. She did not flinch; she 
fought--six brain surgeries, three rounds of radiation, and nine rounds 
of chemotherapy.
  On January 26, our angel used her wings to fly to God. She always had 
those wings the entire time she was with us here on Earth. She used her 
dying wish to have a water well dug in a small town in Africa. 
Extraordinary.
  If you close your eyes, you can feel Alyssa's spirit.
  Welcome home, Alyssa.
