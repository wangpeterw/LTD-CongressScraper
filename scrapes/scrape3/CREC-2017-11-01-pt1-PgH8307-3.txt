                            OPEN ENROLLMENT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, beginning today, millions of 
Americans have the opportunity to buy or change their healthcare plan 
through the Affordable Care Act exchange.
  The open enrollment period ends December 15, so consumers need to act 
now. We only have 45 days to shop around, receive assistance from local 
organizations, and make a final decision. But many people may not know 
that because the Trump administration has taken several administrative 
actions to undermine the ACA.
  Cutting the open enrollment period in half, to slashing advertising 
and outreach funding by 90 percent, to announcing a shutdown of 
healthcare.gov on Sundays during open enrollment and other sabotage 
efforts, the Trump administration and the Republican majority have 
tried to restrict the access to healthcare for Americans.
  I encourage every American who needs health insurance to visit 
healthcare.gov and get covered. Financial assistance is available, and 
about 80 percent of the enrollees who pick plans on healthcare.gov will 
be able to get insurance for $75 a month or less.
