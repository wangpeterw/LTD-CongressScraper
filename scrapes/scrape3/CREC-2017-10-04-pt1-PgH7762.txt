               HOW TO BECOME A BETTER AND STRONGER NATION

  (Mr. COSTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to spotlight the statement of 
Lieutenant General Jay Silveria, the superintendent of the United 
States Air Force Academy, made after an incident involving racial 
slurs.
  His speech made three clear points:
  First, the appropriate response for horrible language and horrible 
ideas is a better idea.
  Second, we currently have the opportunity to think about our defining 
values as Americans and to stand firm on our values.
  Lastly, if you cannot treat someone with dignity and respect, then 
you need to get out.
  Lieutenant General Silveria is a role model. I stand here to share 
these words because we in Washington need to hear and heed them. We 
must think about who we are as a nation and we must stand firm in our 
values. After all, we are Americans. Our values have always defined us.
  So we simply cannot accept the words and actions of those who do not 
treat others with dignity and respect. We must respond to horrible 
language and hateful ideas with better ideas and a strong resolve to 
rise above hate. This is how we become a better and a stronger nation.
