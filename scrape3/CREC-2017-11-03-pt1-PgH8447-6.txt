         CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF GIVING BACK TO McHENRY COUNTY

  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 50 years of community 
service rendered by the United Way of Greater McHenry County.
  Members of the community came together in the fall of 1966, with the 
primary purpose of raising funds in order to help deserving 
organizations achieve their goals.
  In that first year alone, United Way raised more than $21,000. This 
money went to funding organizations such as the Salvation Army and the 
American Red Cross, which remain faithful partners today.
  By 1977, the United Way's importance was rapidly increasing 
throughout the community, as they created new partnerships with several 
agencies.
  In fact, the United Way of Greater McHenry County became the fastest 
growing United Way of its size in the country. During their 25th 
anniversary year, they delivered more than $1.1 million to local 
organizations and have continued that record over the years.
  I am grateful to celebrate this 50-year milestone with the people of 
United Way of Greater McHenry County as they continue to help our 
neighbors help each other.
