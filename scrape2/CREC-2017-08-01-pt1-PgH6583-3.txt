                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Skyline Wesleyan Church, San Diego, 
California, offered the following prayer:
  Bless the Lord at all times. Let His praises continually be in our 
mouth. Magnify the Lord and let us exalt His name. Taste and see that 
the Lord is good. Blessed is the Nation that leans upon Him. They that 
seek the Lord shall not want any good thing. But the face of the Lord 
is against evil doers. The righteous cry, and the Lord hears them and 
delivers them from all their troubles.
  Blessed is the Nation whose God is the Lord who looks from Heaven 
upon all the people of the Earth. No king is saved by a multitude. The 
horse and chariot is a vain thing for safety. Neither shall it deliver 
any by its strength. The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear His 
name. Come, ye children, hearken unto me, and let us fear the Lord 
together.
  In Jesus' name, we pray.
  Amen.
