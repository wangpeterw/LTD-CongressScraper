                  HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. JIM MELIUS

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life 
of Dr. Jim Melius, who passed away on January 1.
  Possessed of a technical expertise and a fierce sense of justice, Dr. 
Melius was a tireless advocate for people who, due to no fault of their 
own, were exposed to toxic and deadly substances in the workplace. He 
was a powerful force in our efforts in helping thousands of western New 
Yorkers get long overdue relief for suffering caused by their unknowing 
exposure to uranium at long-shuttered plants like Linde Ceramics, 
Hooker Chemical, Carborundum, and Bethlehem Steel, where, today, over 
$300 million in compensation and medical bills have been paid out to 
former employees. With a calm and steady demeanor, he gave instant 
credibility to any fight. He was a tremendous resource and he was a 
good man.
  While our fight to provide full and fair relief for all of these 
citizens continues, we will never forget this fighter for all the Cold 
War warriors.
