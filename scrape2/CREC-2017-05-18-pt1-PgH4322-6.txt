                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week. I rise 
today to honor the brave men and women in blue who sacrifice their 
safety every day to keep our families and communities safe.
  Each day these Americans go to work willing to put their lives on the 
line for the security of their fellow Americans.
  We often hear the remarkable stories of our law enforcement officers. 
These men and women work long hours and late shifts, often being called 
into work and called away from their families. These are the people who 
risk their lives to protect our very neighborhoods, schools, 
communities, while asking nothing in return.
  These professionals exhibit the greatest love of all, and that is to 
offer their lives to protect another.
  I pray for those who have lost their lives, like Sergeant Greg 
Meagher, a 33-year veteran of the Richmond County Sheriff's Office who 
lost his life earlier this year in the line of duty. We will never 
forget his ultimate sacrifice.
  Our safety depends on these amazing people, and I am proud to honor 
them here today.
