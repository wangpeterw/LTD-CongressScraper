        SUPPORTING THE PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION ACT

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I, along with all of our American citizens, 
recoil today at the senseless and evil mayhem and killing that went on 
in Las Vegas. We pray for the families of those whose lives were lost, 
as well as those who are injured and suffering right now.
  I, along with, I am sure, many Americans, recoil at senseless abuse 
of innocent animals that we love and we enjoy. But I wonder how many of 
us also recoil at the senseless abuse and murder of innocent babies in 
the womb.
  I stand here today to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act, H.R. 36. I support it because it is backed by science. 
It protects the unborn from suffering. It saves innocent lives. It 
promotes American values, values that made this country great, that 
understand the sanctity of life and the beauty of our creator's 
evidence in this world today in human beings.
  I ask my colleagues to join with me and many others this week as we 
support H.R. 36, and we say to our creator and our God: Thank you for 
innocent life itself, and may it be preserved and protected.
