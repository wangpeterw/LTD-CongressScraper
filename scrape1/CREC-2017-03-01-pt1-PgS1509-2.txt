                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of wonder, beyond all majesty, You are worthy of our praise. 
Today, on this Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, give us the wisdom 
to reflect on our mortality and to examine our lives. Use our Senators 
as ambassadors of peace, reconciliation, and justice. May they work to 
remove malice, envy, revenge, deception, and bitterness.
  Lord, inspire them with Your presence until their faith in You is 
visible and contagious. May they bear witness to Your love even when 
their motivations are misunderstood by their detractors. Give them the 
gifts of integrity and authenticity in their relationships with You and 
with one another.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
