                    HURRICANE HARVEY BRINGS NEW LIFE

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Harvey's hammering 
floodwaters crept closer and closer to their home, Annie and her 
husband, Gary, became nervously anxious because, you see, Annie was 
pregnant and needed to get to the hospital.
  But the 2-mile drive to the hospital was no longer possible due to 
high rising water. So they called 911, but the lines were busy. Both 
doctors in training, the Smiths started preparing for a home delivery. 
Finally, a call to Annie's school brought a rescue team to their door. 
But the waters were still high and moving fast.
  Risking their own lives, numerous neighbors and firefighters formed a 
human life chain, passing Annie along in the raging floodwaters to a 
high-water truck. A few hours later, Annie brought new life--Adrielle 
Smith--into the world.
  That is the thing about Texas, Mr. Speaker, we help each other. That 
is what makes us Texas strong.
  Congratulations to the Smiths on the birth of their hurricane 
daughter, Adrielle.
  And that is just the way it is.
