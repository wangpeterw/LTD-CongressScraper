                     NOMINATION OF COURTNEY ELWOOD

  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, one final matter, today we will 
confirm Courtney Elwood, the nominee for general counsel at the Central 
Intelligence Agency. As Chairman Burr pointed out at her hearing, Ms. 
Elwood has an impressive legal background. She graduated from Yale Law 
School before clerking under Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the 
Supreme Court, and she served as a former advisor to both Vice 
President Cheney and President Bush, as well as to the Attorney 
General.
  In her role at the CIA, Ms. Elwood will be providing sound legal 
advice to Director Pompeo, ensuring accountability at the Agency as a 
whole, and overseeing a number of priorities that are key to supporting 
our Nation's intelligence community. Her nomination has already earned 
bipartisan support. I am sure that once she is confirmed, she will 
serve our country well in this new role.
