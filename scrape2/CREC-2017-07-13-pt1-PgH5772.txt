                      VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER

  (Mr. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge a tragic incident 
that occurred today in the Second District.
  Early this morning, a man drove his truck into the side of the Bay 
County Government Center and caused a fire that resulted in his death. 
My district office has an office in that building. Thankfully, no 
workers or visitors were injured in the incident, and all of the 
district staff are safe.
  It is a sad day to witness someone so troubled take such an action 
and, ultimately, their own life. While there is still much to learn 
about this person's motivations and the reasons behind this attack on a 
public building, we should all remember that, no matter how inflamed 
our passions, violence is never the answer.
  Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking the first responders and the 
law enforcement officers who are addressing this incident, and please 
join me in a prayer for the Bay County community as they come together 
to respond to this tragedy.

                          ____________________
