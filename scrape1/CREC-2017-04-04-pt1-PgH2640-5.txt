                RECOGNIZING MONTH OF THE MILITARY CHILD

  (Mr. MARSHALL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of April as 
the Month of the Military Child. I have the

utmost respect for the families of the military's men and women; 
specifically, the children of our Nation's military, who are the 
bedrock of military families. These children make sacrifices--
relocations, new schools, and the absence of a parent on deployment--
and they deserve our gratitude.
  Due to the unique circumstances the children are put under, I stand 
before you today to commend the children of those currently serving in 
my district at Fort Riley in Kansas, and the children of those serving 
around the Nation. I call on my colleagues to provide continued support 
of our military children and families whose sacrifice is not always 
recognized, but certainly is revered.
