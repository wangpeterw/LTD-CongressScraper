  SENATE RESOLUTION 271--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL 
                   COMMUNITY GARDENING AWARENESS WEEK

  Ms. DUCKWORTH submitted the following resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:

                              S. Res. 271

       Whereas countless families in the United States live with 
     hunger every day and do not have access to fresh produce in 
     their neighborhoods;
       Whereas community gardens conserve limited resources and 
     promote sustainability;
       Whereas community gardens provide an important and 
     nutritious source of fresh produce donations for local food 
     pantries and social service agencies;
       Whereas community gardens enable individuals to gain 
     control over the quality, variety, and cost of their food 
     supply;
       Whereas community gardening encourages individuals of 
     diverse cultural and economic backgrounds to work together, 
     foster a better sense of community, and improve the quality 
     of their lives;
       Whereas community-based youth and school gardening programs 
     encourage personal self-esteem and healthy attitudes toward 
     learning;
       Whereas community gardening and greening projects provide a 
     catalyst for neighborhood and community development;
       Whereas community gardens reduce city heat and preserve 
     open spaces for present and future generations;
       Whereas community gardens and other green spaces--
       (1) provide a more livable environment in municipalities 
     throughout the United States; and
       (2) present a positive local image to the residents of, and 
     visitors to, a community;
       Whereas community gardens help provide local food banks 
     with fresh produce for individuals in need; and
       Whereas the last week of September 2017 is an appropriate 
     week to designate as ``National Community Gardening Awareness 
     Week'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of 
     National Community Gardening Awareness Week, including--
       (1) raising awareness of the importance of community 
     gardens and urban agriculture;
       (2) improving access to public land for the development of 
     sustainable food projects;
       (3) encouraging further growth of community gardens and 
     other opportunities that increase food self-reliance, improve 
     fitness, contribute to a cleaner environment, and enhance 
     community development; and
       (4) supporting cooperative efforts among Federal, State, 
     and local governments and nonprofit organizations--
       (A) to promote the development and expansion of community 
     gardens; and
       (B) to increase the accessibility of community gardens to 
     disadvantaged population groups.
