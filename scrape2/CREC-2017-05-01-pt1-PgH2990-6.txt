                          TELL ME IT ISN'T SO

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, a few of us were at the United Nations 
this morning and this afternoon, and what we heard most was the 
importance of empowering women in developing countries who have 
experienced violence, sexual violence. Tell me it isn't so that the 
President of the United States has discontinued Let Girls Learn, 
fostered and supported by Mrs. Obama, which is an important key element 
of the Peace Corps, which is attempting to help these girls learn and 
empower them.
  Tell me it isn't so that the President of the United States, not 
recognizing the Constitution and freedom of speech, is trying to expand 
or change the libel laws that if you don't like what they say about you 
as a politician, you can undermine and you can charge First Amendment 
privilege, First Amendment press, and others with a violation of those 
laws.
  Tell me it isn't so that America is going back on her values and her 
commitment to helping people around the world, particularly vulnerable 
women and children, and, of course, denigrating the First Amendment and 
the freedom of the press. Tell me it isn't so.
