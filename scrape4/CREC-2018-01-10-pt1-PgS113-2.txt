                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our Savior, help our lawmakers to see eternity beyond time, 
remaining loyal to You in all things. Awaken in them a desire to 
represent Your purposes in our Nation and world. Give them grace, O 
God, to love and to even pray for those who would strive to hurt them. 
May nothing blind them to Your truth, as You lead them through the 
night of mortality to the light that never fades. Lord, keep them calm 
in the quiet center of their lives, so that they may find serenity in 
life's swirling stresses. And Lord, fill us all with Your peace, as we 
strive to understand others as we would wish to be understood.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
