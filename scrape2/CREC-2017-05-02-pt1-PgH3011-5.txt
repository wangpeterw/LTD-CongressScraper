                         KAPPA DAY ON THE HILL

  (Mr. CLAY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, more than ever before, we need leaders from 
across the Nation to raise our voices, elevate our awareness, and come 
to Washington, as stated in the First Amendment, to petition the 
government for a redress of our grievances.
  Now, more than ever, we need the people most affected by the 
decisions that are being made in this hallowed place, the people's 
House, and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to make sure that this 
representative government is indeed being held accountable for both its 
actions and inactions.
  On this special day, I am proud of my brothers in Kappa Alpha Psi 
Fraternity, and I am honored to welcome them back to Washington for 
their annual visit.
  I stand with my brothers to ensure that we never forget how our 
decisions on issues like health care, education, housing, jobs, voting 
rights, and even the use of military force are more than just political 
or policy judgments. They have life-and-death consequences for real 
people in the communities that we represent and across this great 
country as well.
  I thank my Kappa brothers for their steadfast friendship, support, 
and devotion to advancing freedom and equality for every American.
