        NORTH KOREA MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS AGGRESSIONS

  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, it has been a generation or two since the 
horrors of communism were routinely on the news and mentioned in our 
schools: people killed running for freedom from East to West Berlin, 
the Soviet Union's gulag archipelago designed to crush dissent and the 
human spirit, and Mao's brutal rule in Red China that killed millions.
  This week, a new generation of Americans witnessed the barbarity of 
the evil of communism. I extend my condolences to the family and 
friends of Otto Warmbier, whose funeral was held yesterday.
  Kim Jung Un and his North Korean thugs may believe Otto's torture and 
death somehow empowers them. They are wrong. President Reagan foretold 
that communism will end up on the ash heap of history, and that is 
where Kim is headed.
  But Otto has a different legacy. One of Otto's friends told me his 
spirit could not be crushed and, unlike the communist thugs of North 
Korea, Otto's spirit will live on, especially in those who loved him.
  Mr. Speaker, North Korea must be held accountable for Otto's death 
and other transgressions. Last month, the House passed the Korean 
Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act. The Senate should pass 
this legislation and get it to the President quickly so we can begin to 
put maximum pressure on this outlaw regime.
