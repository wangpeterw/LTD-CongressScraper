                    CONGRATULATING MANVEL MAVERICKS

  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, sometimes life matters by the inch. Last 
month, for the Manvel Mavericks, their dream came down to 12 inches--1 
foot. That is how close they came to winning every football game they 
played in 2017, including the Texas 5-A Division 1 State Championship.
  Was Manvel disappointed when they lost?
  Heck yes.
  Did we shed some tears?
  Heck yes.
  Are we more proud than ever of our guys?
  Hell yes.
  That pride comes from how they played, win or lose. An example of our 
pride is next to me. That is our team listening to our senior 
quarterback, Kason Martin's final words as a member of the Mavericks. 
Kason's words rang true then, and they ring true for all eternity.
  He said: I'm forever Manvel. I don't care what the scoreboard says. 
We are the champions. Hoka Hey.
