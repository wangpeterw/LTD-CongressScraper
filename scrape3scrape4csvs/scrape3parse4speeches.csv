145,topic-id,474,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, today I must ask a question of this Chamber: What makes America great?  Do we measure greatness by the strength of our economy or by the size of our military?  Is greatness defined by export prices and profits of corporations?  You see, Mr.Speaker, I don't think that is the case. I believe that we are a nation built upon a set of unshakable values. It is our ability to uphold these values, not the rise and fall of the stock market, that will ultimately define our greatness.  One of our values is this: if you work hard, set goals, and refuse to give up, you can fulfill your dreams. As Americans, this value is engrained into all of us. We repeat it each and every day, and we tell our kids to follow their dreams, or tell them that they can be anything that they want when they grow up.  We say these things, Mr.Speaker, because we believe them. We believe that hard work pays off. We believe that dreams can come true.  Yet, on September 5 of this year, President Trump ignored these American beliefs when he ended the DACA program. That decision told nearly 800,000 young people in this country that their hard work didn't matter and that their dreams of pursuing success might not pay off in the end.  These young DREAMers, who are as American as any of us, go to school here, they have jobs here, they raise families in our communities, and they serve in our military.  This is why each and every day we fail to pass the Dream Act, we call the values that make our country great into question. If we fail to pass this bipartisan legislation, then we are no longer a nation where hard work pays off.  I will be forced to explain that to DREAMers in my district. I will have to tell Minerva, who paid her way through college, that she will have to give up her dream of medical school. I will have to explain to Leticia that, despite becoming the first in her family to attend college, she will not be able to fulfill her dream of serving others as a social worker.  You see, Mr.Speaker, these are real young people with real dreams. They deserve a real answer. They put in the work, they have done everything they can to build lives in this country, and we need to come together to make sure that we uphold our values and allow them to continue those lives here.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can bring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote immediately. This country is great because we uphold our values. Mr.Speaker, it is time that we prove that.  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8609-4.txt,2229,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,8.0,November
100,topic-id,867,"Mr.President, healthcare is on the minds of the American people. According to the Washington Post, in the elections in Virginia yesterday, it was by far the biggest issue in voters' minds. Maine expanded  In my home State of Tennessee, because of the Affordable Care Act's structure, premiums have gone up 176 percent over the last 4 years and another 58 percent, on average, for 2018 is predicted.  Tennesseans, like millions of Americans, are going through open enrollment and have sticker shock when they see the prices of the health insurance they might buy, and the 178 million people who are getting their insurance on the job--that is 60 percent of us--know they might lose their job, they might change their job, and they might be in the individual market themselves and might find themselves exposed to these skyrocketing premiums and the chaos that results from them.  This is especially difficult for Americans who have no government subsidy to help them buy insurance. In 2016, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, there were about 9 million of those  There are 350,000 people in Tennessee who buy insurance on the individual market. That means they don't get it on the job. They don't get it from the government. They go out and buy it themselves, and 150,000 of those pay the whole brunt. So if insurance costs go up 176 percent over 4 years, another 58 percent this year, that means the songwriter, the farmer, the self-employed person has a very difficult time buying insurance. It is a terrifying prospect. That is why healthcare is on the minds of the American people.  One would think the American people might turn around and look at Washington and ask: Why doesn't the President of the United States and why don't Members of Congress--Republicans as well as Democrats--get together and do something about the skyrocketing premiums?  Well, what would you think if I told you that last month the President of the United States, President Trump, called me and asked me to do just that?  He said: I don't want people to be hurt over the next couple of years while we are continuing to debate the long-term structure of healthcare on the individual market. So why don't you get with Senator Murray from Washington--she is the ranking Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee--and why don't you try to work something out so people will not be hurt during these 2 years.  He said: I have to cut off the cost-sharing payments because the court has said they are not legal, but we can put them back. Go negotiate. See what you can do. Try to get some flexibility for the  Fortunately, Senator Murray and I were already working on that and to have the President's call was encouraging to me. He called me three more times over the next 2 weeks, and the long and short of it is we produced a result.  Here is what the result looks like--and I am going to talk about it from the point of view of why Republicans are supporting it. Senator Murray and Democratic Senators were here earlier saying why they were supporting it. Senator Rounds from South Dakota, a former Governor of that State, a man who understands insurance very well and helped develop this proposal--we are here today to say this happens to be one of those bills where there are[[Page S7099]]good reasons for Democrats to support it, there are good reasons for Republicans to support it, and the President has asked for it.  Here is what it does, from my point of view. The so-called Alexander-Murray legislation, which was recommended to the Senate by Senator Murray and me--there were 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats who were original cosponsors, including Senator Rounds and myself. That doesn't happen very often here. That is one-quarter of the Senate offering a bipartisan bill on a contentious subject to the  Here is what it does. One, it lowers premiums. In 2018, where the rates are already set, it requires the States to work with the insurance companies and give rebates for the high premiums that have already been set. In 2019, it will lower premiums. That is the first thing it does and the first reason why I and many Republicans support it.  Because the premiums are lower, it also means fewer tax dollars are going to pay for ObamaCare subsidies. That is another reason Republicans and conservatives like the idea of the Alexander-Murray bill.  Another reason we like it is, because there are lower subsidies, there is less Federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office has examined our bill and has said that it saves money over 10 years, nearly $4 billion.  There are other reasons we like it. It gives States flexibility in increasing the variety and choices of the insurance policies they can recommend. That is the biggest difference of opinion we have between that side of the aisle and this side of the aisle. They want Washington to write the rules; we want the States to write the rules.  We agreed to make some changes so that States can write more rules. For example, the Iowa Senators, Mr.Grassley and ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7098.txt,1695,0915,2017.0,8.0,November
105,topic-id,429,"Mr.President, I want to briefly thank the Senator from  As the Senator from South Dakota said, this has been a very contentious issue, but we thought that if we listened enough, we might find a few things we could agree on. Senator Murray and I not only involved our committee, which is a committee of 22 or 23 Senators, but we invited anyone not on the committee to come and meet with the witnesses--the Governors and the State insurance commissioners--for an hour before the hearings. We had nearly 60 Senators involved in the entire process on those 4 days. That is pretty remarkable when you have 60 Senators--more than half of whom are not on the committee of jurisdiction--attending and participating, and that helped develop what we did.  The person with the best attendance was Mr.Carper, the Senator from He is not a member of the committee, but he came to every one of the committee meetings, and he often stayed for the hearings themselves. I thank him for his active participation.  In boiling it all down, I think what we are trying to say is, there is a lot we still do not agree on, but we have heard the American people. Healthcare is on their minds. They are signing up, and those who are in the individual market are getting sticker shock if they do not have any government support. For the next couple of years, we have a plan that will avoid chaos and begin to limit the growth of premiums and, in 2019, reduce premiums. In addition to that, it will give Americans a new plan to buy called the catastrophic plan, and it will give many States the opportunity to use some of their own ingenuity to create a larger variety of choices.  That is a good set of options with which to respond to the American people who ask: Why don't the President and the Congress work together to do something about healthcare? It does not solve all of the problems, but it is a step in the right direction, and it is something we can build on.  I thank the Senator from Delaware for his contribution, and I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his.  I hope, when the President returns from Asia, that he will look at the agreement he asked us to produce, and I hope he will support it. If he does, I believe it will be part of the law when we go home for  Thank you.

583,topic-id,962,"Mr.President, today we celebrate the 25th anniversary of high-performance computing at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Leadership Computing  For a quarter century, Oak Ridge has led the way globally, pushing the boundaries of computational performance and continually giving scientists more powerful platforms for simulation and discovery at every scale--from the smallest building blocks of atoms to the vastness of galaxies--in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science, cosmology, industrial modeling, nuclear power, and more.  Using Oak Ridge's computing facility, scientists have expanded the scale and scope of their research, solved complex problems in less time, and filled critical gaps in scientific knowledge.  The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility has led the rapid evolution of scientific computing that has produced a millionfold increase in computing power and has been home to both the first teraflop--1 trillion calculations per second--and the first petaflop--1 quadrillion calculations per second--systems for scientific computing. Oak Ridge has twice placed two supercomputing systems at the top of the international TOP500 list, where supercomputers are ranked by their number-crunching performance.  Today computer simulation is an essential part of modern science, but in 1992, when Oak Ridge established its Center for Computational Sciences, which was later renamed the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, not many people thought that the next great center for high-performance computing would be located in east Tennessee.[[Page S7059]]  As I have said many times, this region has one of the most formidable concentrations of brainpower anywhere in our country.  The Department of Energy unleashed that brainpower when, later that year, it selected Oak Ridge, along with its partners, three national labs and seven universities, to lead one of the Office of Energy Research's--now the Office of Science--new high-performance computing research centers to serve scientists from national laboratories, universities, and private industry.  Meanwhile, in 2002, Japan introduced its Earth Simulator, which was at the time five times more powerful than any other high-performance computer in the world.  I traveled with former Senator Jeff Bingaman to Japan, and we were briefed on the significance of Japan's investment in the Earth  Japan's development of the Earth Simulator meant that the United States no longer was the clear leader in high-performance computing, and for the first time, American researchers were looking abroad to obtain access to the latest computing tools.  Senator Bingaman and I made it a priority to recapture the lead in high-speed computing by introducing and passing the High-End Computing Revitalization Act of 2004.  This legislation paved the way for Oak Ridge to regain the lead in supercomputing. Within a few years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility deployed a supercomputer called Jaguar that would break the petaflop barrier--a quadrillion calculations per second--in 2008 and take back the top spot on the TOP500 list in 2009.  For the past 25 years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility has not only been home to some of the world's most powerful computers, but it has also been a global leader in the development of software applications and tools for scientific research. That is important because it is not just about having the fastest computer, it is also about having the experts who know how to program and use them.  Each year, the facility provides computer systems 10 to 100 times more powerful than most other computers available for research for the lab's own scientists, as well as international teams of scientists trying to make breakthroughs on the toughest science challenges.  Those scientists publish new science discoveries in nearly 500 research papers per year.  Beyond basic science, dozens of companies, from small businesses to Fortune 500 giants, have used Oak Ridge supercomputers to accelerate their own research and development and gain a competitive advantage in the global market.  For example, these high-performance computers have allowed companies to develop an add-on for long-haul trucks to optimize airflow, which improves fuel mileage by up to 10 percent.  Other companies were able to use simulations to extend the shelf life of consumer products and to analyze combustion in gas turbines to improve performance and lower emissions.  Not only does supercomputing help scientific discoveries and companies, supercomputers at our national laboratories can be used by Federal agencies as a ``secret weapon'' in the effort to combat issues like Medicare and Medicaid waste, fraud, and abuse; to find terrorists and criminals; and to help the National Institutes of Health find cures and treatments for disease.  Other countries have taken notice of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility's success, tried to duplicate it, and now threaten our lead in scientific computing.  The United States faces a choice between falling behind competitors like China or advancing technologies that can make us safer and more competitive.  In the June 2017 ranking of the world's most powerful supercomputers, China maintained the top two places, Switzerland was third, and Titan at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is the fastest supercomputer in the United States, moved down to fourth.  In 2018, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility will complete Summit, which will be more than five times faster than Titan and will help researchers better understand materials and nuclear power and support more energy breakthroughs.  The fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, which I wrote with Senator Feinstein, prioritizes supercomputing and recommends $150 million for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, as well as $381 million to support the delivery of the first exascale machine.  I am very proud of the men and women from all over the world who have come to east Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to make the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility a world-leading center for computational scientific research.  I thank them for 25 years of hard work and dedication, and I look forward to their continued success answering some of the hardest scientific questions.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7058-4.txt,1695,1445,2017.0,7.0,November

1099,topic-id,412,"Mr.President, today we are voting on the nomination of Peter Robb for general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board,  As general counsel, Mr.Robb will have the important job of helping workers who feel their right to organize collectively has been violated or assisting employers when some of their employees want to form a union.  Mr.Robb will have an opportunity to help restore the Board to the role of a neutral umpire in labor disputes.  While partisanship at the Board did not start under the previous administration, it became far worse.  When the Board is too partisan, it creates instability in our Nation's workplaces and creates confusion for employers, employees, and unions.  For example, in 2015, at the previous general counsel's urging, an NLRB decision dramatically expanded ``joint employer'' liability, and this increased liability makes it much more likely a company will find it more practical to own and operate its stores, taking away the opportunity for a worker to own and run their own franchise.  This decision was the biggest attack on the opportunity for small business men and women to make their way into the middle class that anyone has seen in a long time, threatening to destroy the American Dream for owners of the Nation's 780,000 franchise locations.  Or consider the previous general counsel's aggressive application of the National Labor Relations Act to protect certain employees' belligerent, threatening, and discriminatory conduct.  One troubling decision involved an employer that fired a picketing employee who engaged in racist and offensive conduct on a picket line.  The Board found that the employee's remarks were ``racist, offensive and reprehensible,'' and violated the company's nondiscrimination policies and the union's conduct rules; yet the Board still ruled that the employer's discharge of the employee was unlawful.

468,topic-id,634,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.3562 and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan, commonsense legislation to improve our services for those who have ``borne the battle"": America's disabled veterans.  Currently, if a disabled veteran in VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program needs adaptations made to their home due to the limitations of their disability, then it is their vocational rehabilitation counselor, someone who has no experience or training in home construction, who makes such arrangements for these adaptations.  In addition to the lack of core competency in home adaptations, these counselors have experienced a significant and steady rise in their job counseling caseloads, so their focusing on this home construction takes away from their primary function as a vocational counselor. This has resulted in inefficiencies for disabled veterans who now have to wait in line, and it is costing taxpayers more money.  While these are master's degree-level counselors who provide great services to our veterans every single day, they do not have the expertise to understand how to build a wheelchair ramp, affix a grab bar to a wall, or implement other home adaptations. This bill would simply transfer these responsibility's to VA's Specially Adapted Housing program, where they deal with these kinds of construction projects every day.  This change is needed. It will save the taxpayers money, and, most importantly, it will help our disabled veterans immensely by ensuring that they have the right people on the job to address their service-connected disabilities in a timely fashion.  Mr.Speaker, as we head into Veterans Day this upcoming weekend, I just want to take a moment of personal privilege and say what an honor it has been to serve on the VA Committee and chair the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, and I want to thank, especially, the chairman for that opportunity. It is humbling to know that in some small way I can do my part on behalf of the people of west Texas to serve those who put their lives on the line for all of us.  Veterans represent the very best of what this country was built on: service before self. I say this because, at a time when our country's culture and political environment seems so divided, the one thing that continues to bring us together as Americans is our servicemembers and veterans.  When they raised their right hand and swore an oath to defend their fellow citizens, they did not care if we were from a red State or a blue State, Republican or They did it for love of country and to protect not only their family and friends, but also the stranger whom they will never meet.  That is why I am also very proud that, when we consider veterans legislation as we are doing today and tomorrow, we are doing the two most important things expected by all Americans: working together to solve problems, and delivering on our promise to the American people. I believe that the cumulative effect of commonsense measures such as the bill that we are considering today are helping to deliver on those promises.  I want to thank Chairman Roe, again, and also House leadership on both sides for helping us bring this bill through our committee and to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I would be remiss if I didn't also thank the leadership of my ranking member, friend, and fellow west Texan, Mr.Beto O'Rourke, in getting this bill introduced and to where it is today.

482,topic-id,302,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.3949, yet another piece of bipartisan, commonsense legislation that will serve our veterans.  In the transition from deployment to employment, apprenticeship programs have proven to be extremely successful. Roughly 20,000 veterans are actively training or participating in these programs, and their employment outcomes are nothing short of impressive. According to VA's data, over 90 percent of veteran apprentices are employed after completing their programs with an average starting wage of over $60,000. Over their lifetime, apprentices see an increase in compensation of over $300,000 as compared to their peers.  These programs aren't just a win for our veterans, they are a win for taxpayers. Every dollar invested in apprenticeship programs sees a return in benefits of $35.  While it is clear to see the advantages of apprenticeship programs, like in many parts of VA, this program is hampered by needless burden and bureaucracy. Currently, private employers who offer these programs in more than one State have to register with each State individually. Burdened by the difficulty and trail of paperwork that this creates, many employers only choose to participate in a limited way or they just don't offer them altogether.  H.3949, the Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform Act, or the VALOR Act, authored by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Ro Khanna, streamlines the registration process for employers, which, in turn, encourages them to participate and leads to more opportunities for our veterans.  Given the tremendous sacrifice our veterans have made for our country, we should do everything we can to ensure that they have access to good jobs, and the VALOR Act does just that.  I would like to thank Mr.Khanna again for his hard work and his leadership on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Decisions about lake levels, flood storage capacity, and other measurements of the body of water that powers that station are set forth in FERC license protocols and guidelines written and administered by folks who work right here in                              {time}  1500  As a former official for the Texas Lower Neches Valley River Authority, I know that these are tough decisions to make, and sometimes it is a matter of choosing between bad and worse options of where to put all of that water.  But in my district, serious concerns have been raised by my constituents and local river authorities about whether FERC's licenses for hydropower facilities need to be adjusted to account for the unprecedented flooding that we just experienced and with the ability to make commonsense changes in the face of an impending flood event.  My amendment ensures that nothing will stand in the way of FERC going in and examining the licenses for any facility located in the path of the terrible disasters that we have seen this year. By passing it with strong bipartisan support, we will make clear that that is just what FERC should do.

987,topic-id,753,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Native American Heritage Month by honoring a dedicated community leader and warrior from Nebraska's Second Congressional  Growing up on the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, Rudi Mitchell was one of eight children raised by a single mother. Rudi's mom, Mary Lieb Mitchell, was a strong woman and a major influence in the lives of her children. Her focus was education and ensuring her children had the opportunities that she did not have.  It was because of her that Rudi and his siblings all went out to pursue[[Page H8530]]higher education. Including nieces and nephews, 15 members of his family have earned degrees ranging from bachelor's to doctorate, to medical degrees.  In 1964, Rudi felt the call to serve our Nation at a time of war and enlisted in the United States Army Medical As he will tell you, Native Americans consider it an honor to serve as a warrior, and he was proud to do so in the U.He was a part of the Army Medical Corps and served a total of 3 years and 13 months of which he deployed to South Korea, providing medical support to troops.  Once his service was complete, Mitchell used the GI Bill to attend the University of Nebraska Omaha, and in August of 1973, he earned his bachelor of general studies with an emphasis on social work. He then pursued and received his master of social work in August of 1975.  With his degrees in hand and inspired by his mother's dreams, Mitchell worked for the Nebraska Indian Intertribal Development Corporation and the Bureau of Indian Affairs for After that, he returned to the Umonhon Nation Reservation in Macy, Nebraska, and was the acting director of the outpatient mental health-social services department at the Carl Curtis Health Education Rudi then earned his doctorate of education and counseling and psychology from the University of South Dakota in December of 1987.  Mitchell continued to serve those residing at the Macy and Winnebago Reservations, including as interim president of the Nebraska Indian Community College and, most recently, as the assistant professor of Native American studies at Creighton He is also listed as a qualified expert witness in Indian child welfare cases in the courts of the State of  His deep compassion for the youth of the Umonhon Nation inspires him to continue to make an impact. With the high suicide rate and many suffering from depression, Mitchell has made it a mission of his to interact with the youth as a social worker and mental health therapist. As an elder of the Umonhon Nation, Mitchell participates and leads traditional Umonhon prayer ceremonies in welcome and graduation ceremonies.  Rudi continues to preserve his native language, which his mother did not allow to be spoken in his childhood home because she wanted them to learn He also is working to revive the lost culture of his Nation, including the importance of his Indian name. His is Sihi-duba of the Buffalo  As a direct descendant of Chief Big Elk, the last hereditary chief of the Umonhon Nation, Mitchell followed his great-great-great-great-grandfather's legacy of leadership, and has served as a Native American leader on the local, State, and national level. From 1992 to 1995, he was the Tribal chairman of the Umonhon Nation and the chief elected governmental representative of his people. He presided over the elected Tribal Council at all official meetings and represented their interests with county supervisors, the Nebraska Unicameral, the United States Congress, State Governors, the President of the United States, and international leaders.  In addition, Mitchell serves on the board of directors for the Big Elk Native American Center, a nonprofit that is working to provide a multitude of services to more than 8,000 Native Americans from over 130 Tribes that reside in the Omaha area. Currently, the nonprofit provides language services, teaching the Umonhon language, and providing expert witnesses.  Mitchell is a lifetime member of the VFW Post 1581 and the American Legion Post 1, and although he has officially retired, he still serves as an elder of the Omaha Through his lifetime of dedicated service, he has helped many youth and members of the Umonhon Nation overcome depression and learn about their heritage.  We are proud to recognize Mitchell as a true warrior, patriot, and selfless servant; one that not only fought for his Nation, but also for those impacted by mental health issues, and continues to keep his Native American culture and heritage alive for future generations.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8529-2.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,7.0,November

903,topic-id,966,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share the amazing story of Rick Corman, the hardworking, hard-charging founder of R.Corman Railroad Group in Nicholasville, Kentucky, in my district. Rick's life story is an example of the American Dream, and his tireless spirit, grit, determination, and generosity benefited not only the employees of R.Corman, but an entire community.  Unfortunately, because of America's broken Tax Code, the abilities of entrepreneurs like Rick are compromised, and the estate tax, in particular, threatens the future ability of the R.Corman Railroad Group to continue to drive economic growth, employment, and charitable giving in  This story is timely. As Congress takes on the task of reforming our broken Tax Code over the next few weeks, critics will undoubtedly protest that this plan is a tax cut for the rich, and they will cite our changes to the estate tax as an example. But as the story of Rick Corman reveals, the estate tax is not a tax on the wealthy as much as it is an unfair penalty on hard work, jobs, charity, upward mobility, and the American  In 1973, after growing up in a low-income, five-room house with no interior bathroom, Rick Corman started his company immediately following high school graduation with nothing more than a dump truck, a backhoe, and a tenacious spirit. Driven by his remarkable operator skills, and then by his commitment to safe and reliable service, Rick was able to become a trusted provider in the railroad industry.  But his success would not have been possible without the assistance early in his career from Luther Deaton, a community banker for what is now called Central Bank in As Rick grew his company, he faced debts and cash flow problems. He struggled to get a loan. As Luther said: He had a good company; he just faced a cash crunch.  But Rick invited Luther to the site of a coal train derailment inside a tunnel in the middle of the night to show his work; and Rick, recalling the episode, laughed because he had gotten his banker filthy and covered in coal dust. But after that experience and seeing how hard Rick worked, Luther knew that this man would not fail. So Rick was then able to secure character-based loans that allowed his company to thrive because his community banker was willing to take a risk on him based on what he knew about his business and Rick's drive to succeed.  Today, this type of loan would never be allowed under the overly restricted Dodd-Frank law, but those loans proved to be essential for the growth of Rick's company and ultimately highly profitable for the bank.  Without access to capital, today's entrepreneurs are prohibited from doing what Rick Corman did. Over 40 years he grew his company into what is today known as R.Corman Railroad Group, continuously investing profits back into his business, into its workers, and into the surrounding community.  Today, R.Corman has field offices in 23 The company serves all seven class I railroads, many regional and short line railroads, as well as various rail-served industries.  Rick grew the company into what it is today by treating all of his workers well, working alongside them, and never asking them to do a job that Rick himself was unable or incapable of doing himself. The company's diversity and investment in people gave it the ability to service all aspects of the freight railroad industry at any scale. The company has been critical to restoring service when class I railroads are devastated by flooding or storms like Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, or  But now the future success of this company is threatened by the estate tax, also known as the death tax. In 2013, Rick Corman passed away after a heroic 12-year battle with cancer. It resulted in the transfer of his life's work to a living trust. More than anything, Rick had an intense appreciation for the hard work and loyalty of his employees who had been and continue to be an integral part of the company's success, and he wanted to ensure that he protected their jobs into the future.  Since Rick's passing, the trust has continued to reinvest cash into the company, as he intended, and the company continues to operate and help those who have benefited from it. The company has invested nearly $110 million in capital assets, and employment has grown by 53 percent, nearly 450 jobs. The company has donated more than $2.5 million to charitable causes since Rick's passing.  But due to the estate tax, the company has yet to feel the full impact of the tax. But starting in 2019, nearly 30 percent of its annual cash flow will be pulled from the company as a result. This will significantly impact R.Corman's ability to create jobs, purchase equipment, and donate to charity. The leadership of the company now tells me that the government will actually lose revenue because the company will not be able to grow and create jobs that would produce more revenue than the estate tax will produce.  This is an example of why it is so important we end this unfair tax. The death tax destroys intergenerational small businesses and family farms throughout the Nation owned by people who started with literally nothing and worked their entire life to build a successful company and jobs.  So as we look at the estate tax and tax reform in the coming weeks, I hope my colleagues will remember the story of Rick These families and these businesses should not have to fear triple taxation from Washington just because someone passes away.  Our bill immediately delivers relief from this tax, and I hope that we will pass a repeal of the estate tax to honor entrepreneurs, job creators, and philanthropists like Rick                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8531.txt,2238,0915,2017.0,7.0,November
190,topic-id,280,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today because I think education is the number one equalizer. It is the door to opportunity, yet the GOP tax plan will make it harder to afford to be able to go to college.  When I was a kid, my parents--both immigrants from Mexico, where mom only had a third grade education--told me that I had to become a doctor or a lawyer. That was the only way to get out of the poverty that we lived in.  As a result, I went to college. I was saddled in student loan debt when I came out. As a matter of fact, I still have over $50,000 of student loan debt. It shouldn't be this way.  Congress should be working to make it easier to go to college so that there is debt-free college, or at least make it more affordable. Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Instead, Congress is considering a terrible GOP tax plan that proposes to eliminate the student loan interest deduction and lifetime learning credits. Under current rules, borrowers paying off education loans can deduct up to $2,500 of interest paid on student loans.  Deductions lower your taxable income. About 12.4 million people claimed it for the year 2015. You can claim the student loan break for several years after college while paying off the loans.  The GOP tax plan would destroy this key deduction for young graduates and workers getting the job training they need to succeed in the 21st century economy.  Millenials and young workers, if you disagree, rise and have your voice heard today. Just say no to the GOP tax plan that only makes it harder to afford college.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8501-4.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,6.0,November

1084,topic-id,1241,"Mr.President, 1 year ago, the American people went to the polls. The American people demanded a change. They demanded a change from 8 years of too little economic growth and too much government control and regulations. The effect was immediate, and the effect was incredible.  In the past year, we have gotten a lot of very good news about the American economy. Right after the election, businesses became much more optimistic about the direction of our country and they started hiring. Last Friday, we learned that in the United States we have created more than 2 million jobs since election day 2016. Someone said to me: Well, you shouldn't count it from election day. You should count it from Inauguration Certainly, in my home State of Wyoming, on election day there was a confidence, an optimism, a positive feeling that started just at the moment it was announced that Donald Trump had been elected President of the United  Right now we have the lowest rate of unemployment since the year 2002. We have seen the economy grow at more than 3 percent for the past 2 quarters. Consumer confidence just reached the highest level in almost 17 years. All of this is happening since President Trump was elected, and this is very good news for  We can't stop now. We have to do all we can to keep on this path toward a more prosperous country. Americans are optimistic because they know that President Trump is focused on easing the regulations that have held back our economy for the last 8 years. We know that government can create opportunity or crush opportunity based on a combination of regulations, mandates, and taxes. We are now in the land of opportunity, eliminating the regulations and pulling back on taxes to helping our economy grow.  The President has signed legislation that we passed in this Congress repealing one after another of the Obama administration's rules, regulations, and restrictions. President Trump has issued Executive orders cutting back on excessive redtape. President Trump has appointed very good people to important jobs who are committed to reining in Washington's out-of-control bureaucracy. All of these things are important and critical to keeping our economy growing.  Another big part is what we are trying to do now in terms of cutting taxes for the American people. People want to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pockets.  Here in the Senate we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to cut taxes in a way that will actually help American families. We can help families directly by raising their incomes, and we can help them indirectly by growing the economy. Here is how we can do both, because that needs to be our goal.  The first thing we can do is to give people a raise by doubling the standard deduction. If we raise the deduction, people keep more of their hard-earned money, and it makes taxes simpler. Right now, the standard deduction for a married couple is $12,000. Two-thirds of Americans take this deduction. If we roughly double it, people will not pay any Federal income tax at all on the first $24,000 they earn. That is a big cut. It means that a lot more people will decide to take this deduction instead of having to go through the painstaking process of itemizing their deductions on their tax return. It saves them a lot of time, it saves them a lot of headaches, and it saves them the cost of accountants and lawyers who have to help figure out the very complicated tax system in this country. Millions of families will be better off just from this one tax cut alone.  A second thing Republicans are looking to do is to reduce the tax rate for small businesses, the people who are creating jobs all across the country. If someone owns a small business in my home State of Wyoming, she probably ends up paying the taxes on her personal tax return rather than on a separate business tax return. If we cut her tax bill, that is money she can then use to give her workers a raise, to hire more people, and to create more jobs in our community. She can put money back into the business to help grow the economy as well.  When you leave more money in people's pockets, they get to decide how to use that money--what they decide to spend, what they decide to save, and what they decide to invest. People are much better watching their own money than the government ever was, giving people value for that money.  So we want to make sure that tax reform includes a break for small businesses. Around here, they use the[[Page S7083]]words ``tax reform.'' To me, it is about tax reduction, tax relief, and tax cuts. Republicans also want to bring down the rates that Washington charges other businesses. If we can cut the rate businesses pay from 35 percent down to 20 percent, that could be an enormous boost to the economy. Economists who look at this say it is like giving the average American family a $4,000 a year raise. That is how much the average household's income would go up, because workers actually bear most of the burden of taxes that businesses pay.  Now, Democrats actually think the money belongs to It doesn't. It belongs to the people at home who earn it. Democrats often think that if you give Americans even a single dollar in tax cuts, you are taking away Washington's money. It is not Washington's money. The money belongs to the people at home.  We know the exact opposite of what the Democrats believe to be true. Republicans know that giving Americans a tax cut is the same as giving them a raise. Every dollar a family doesn't have to send to Washington in taxes is a dollar they can use for something better. It is a dollar they can use for food, for shelter, for kids, for education, for things that matter to their family. It is another dollar a small business can use to pay its workers more or reinvest in the business to help grow the economy in that community. Tax cuts mean that people decide how to spend their own money; Washington doesn't decide. Families know how to use money much better than Washington ever will.  As we debate these issues and ideas with regard to tax relief, we have an exciting opportunity to give the American people a raise and to give the American economy a boost. This is something a lot of people have been working on for a long time in the Over the past 6 years, the Finance Committee has held 70 hearings on how to make our Tax Code better for all  Republicans are working, and we are listening to make sure that we get the tax reform right that the American people and families need.

It is about jobs. It is about prosperity. It is about a strong and healthy economy for That is what we as Republicans are committed to. We cannot let this opportunity pass.

He has laid out his agenda to cut punishing regulations, to grow the economy, and to help hard-working  President Trump's administration has already taken important steps to roll back the regulatory rampage of the last 8 years. During the last administration, the Environmental Protection Agency issued harmful and punishing, overreaching regulations that hurt workers in my home State of  According to the chamber of commerce, from 2008 to 2016, the EPA issued regulations that cost our economy over $60 billion each year--significantly more than any other Federal agency. These rules had real-life impacts. The Obama administration's so-called Clean Power Plan would have closed powerplants and cost America jobs. We can have both clean air and a growing economy. We have proven it.  My goal is to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs on American families. President Trump shares that goal. That is why EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has led the charge in cutting redtape. The EPA has taken important steps to roll back the Clean Power Plan and other punishing EPA regulations.  It is interesting. The annual cost of high-impact rules by agencies from 2008 to 2016--there were 13 rules by the EPA--in the red right here, billions and billions and billions--over $60 billion.  Administrator Pruitt needs his full leadership team in place at the Agency to complete the task, so today the Senate is going to vote on cloture so we can consider the nomination of Bill He has been nominated to serve as EPA's Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Mr.Wehrum has more than three decades of experience in environmental policy. He has worked as an environmental engineer, a public servant at the EPA, and is an environmental lawyer. His time at the EPA includes 2 years of service as the Acting Administrator of the Office of Air and Radiation--the same office he has now been nominated to lead.  EPA's Office of Air and Radiation is critically important in terms of a division within the It develops national programs, policies, and regulations for limiting air pollution and radiation exposure. One of the responsibilities of this office is implementing the Clean Air Act, and it is a big job.  Here is a chart. Most EPA regulatory burdens come from EPA air regulations; 94.5 percent from the Office of Air and Radiation regulatory burden in 2014; only 5.5 percent from all other EPA offices' regulatory burden of that same year. So under the Obama administration, the air office was one of the biggest regulatory abusers. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the EPA's air regulations were responsible for 95 percent of the cost of the Agency's regulations. Now Mr.Wehrum is going to play a key role in undoing this redtape.  The American people need a qualified leader in the EPA air office. Bill Wehrum is the right man for the job. Don't take my word for it; former environmental Obama Justice official John Cruden said this of Mr.Wehrum: ``I believe he is committed to achieving clean air for all citizens and carefully following sound and current science.'' Marcus Peacock, an EPA Deputy Administrator during the Bush administration, praised Mr.Wehrum, saying that his ``understanding of the Clean Air Act may be second to none. His desire to pull up his sleeves and actually make the Clean Air Act work as a practical matter is second to none.''  Mr.Wehrum's expertise and experience will be tremendously helpful as he pursues policies that will protect America's air, undo regulatory overreach, and allow our economy to grow. I urge all Senators to vote for cloture on Mr.Wehrum's nomination.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Gardner).

However, since Congress created the Choice Program in 2014 to address access to care concerns at VA medical facilities, the committee has heard an increasing number of complaints about the VA Transplant Program from veterans who are concerned about the lengthy travel required for many veterans to reach a VA transplant center and bureaucratic barriers to receiving transplant care closer to home.                              {time}  1545  According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, a greater distance from a VA transplant center was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a transplant and a greater likelihood of death among veteran transplant patients.  That can't happen. This is unacceptable, in my opinion. H.2601, as amended, represents a commonsense solution. That is what we are all about today: commonsense solutions for our true heroes. It would require the VA to consider whether there is a medically compelling reason to require a veteran to travel outside the organ procurement and transplantation network region that the veteran resides in to receive a transplant from a VA transplant center, or whether the veteran faces an unusual or excessive burden in receiving a transplant from a VA transplant center before referring a veteran to a VA transplant center, rather than to a community transplant center.  This would greatly increase access to transplant care in the community for veteran transplant patients living far from VA transplant centers.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.3705, as amended, the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017, introduced by Congresswoman Pingree from  This bill would help ensure that beneficiaries who have received an overpayment from VA clearly understand why the Department believes the veteran owes the money.  Under VA's current practice, when the Department determines that a beneficiary may have received an overpayment, it sends a letter to the beneficiary that explains why the debt was created and how the veteran can dispute or mitigate the debt. But if VA doesn't have the veteran's current address, the veteran may miss important deadlines. For example, if the beneficiary intends to request a full waiver of the debt but does not request that waiver within 30 days of the date of the letter, VA may take action to withhold benefits until the waiver request is adjudicated.  Sound confusing?  It certainly is. We can't have that for our veterans.  Another issue is that some veterans find the language used in the letters to be unclear and confusing. I am sure that is true, too. It is only fair that the veteran understands why the Department believes he or she owes the money. It is the least we can do.  H.3705, as amended, would require VA to develop a new notification letter that explains in plain language how the alleged debt was created and what actions the veteran can take to dispute or mitigate the debt.  In addition, the bill would direct VA to study and report to Congress on its current debt collection process, including how many veterans are not receiving debt collection notices because of incorrect addresses. The report would also describe the steps VA will take to reduce the number of incorrect addresses in the Department's databases.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

As these statistics show, the Veterans Crisis Line is an incredibly valuable resource for veterans. However, while the VA tracks and evaluates statistics such as these for quality and access metrics, it does not currently process them through any meaningful form of data analytics as it relates to the effectiveness of the program.  So, Mr.Speaker, H.4173, as amended, the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017, would direct the Secretary to evaluate the efficacy of the VCL with respect to continuity of VA mental health services using the same anonymous data points as are currently collected by the Research and data analysis of these anonymous data points would utilize the growing national availability of statistics regarding suicides to better evaluate the impact of the VCL and potentially highlight opportunities for outcome improvements.  Mr.Speaker, I believe that evaluating the VCL effectively requires a focus on the full continuum of mental health services provided by VA once a veteran first contacts the VCL or establishes a need for mental health services.

642,topic-id,308,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1133, as amended, the Veterans Transplant Coverage Act of 2017.  This bill is meant to remove an unnecessary barrier to care for veterans in need of transplants involving a living donor.  Last year, Mr.Charles Nelson, a 100 percent service-connected veteran from Texas, sought a kidney transplant through the Department of Veterans Affairs with Mr.Nelson's nonveteran son, Austin, serving as Mr.Nelson's live donor.  Rather than travel from his home in Texas to VA transplant centers in either Nashville, Tennessee, or Portland, Oregon, Mr.Nelson requested to receive his transplant at the University Hospital in San Antonio using the Choice However, his request was denied by VA because Austin was not a veteran, and, therefore, VA did not believe the Department had the authority to pay for this portion of the transplant procedure with Choice funds.  Mr.Nelson eventually received his transplant in San Antonio using his Medicare benefits, private donations, and personal savings to cover the cost of his and Austin's care.  To prevent any other veterans from being unable to access transplant care in the community under Choice, H.1133, as amended, would amend the Choice Program to allow VA to pay for any care or services a live donor may require to carry out a transplant procedure for an eligible veteran, notwithstanding that the live donor may not be eligible for VA healthcare.  I thank my friend from Texas, Congressman Carter, for his dedication to solving this problem for his constituent, Mr.Nelson, and for veterans and families across the country. This is how Congress should work. He is a great representative, and I am really proud to serve with him.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.1133, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.918, as amended, which was introduced by my friend and longtime committee member, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.Coffman).  Mr.Speaker, there have been a number of different names for stress-related military health conditions throughout our Nation's history: battle fatigue, combat stress reaction, shell shock, post-traumatic stress disorder.  Too often we see military personnel returning home with difficulties adjusting to civilian life. For many returning servicemembers, these stressors affect one's postdeployment, especially those receiving other than honorable discharges.  Under current law, military personnel who separate under this status are not eligible for healthcare benefits or general services typically offered to honorable or generally discharged veterans through the Department of Veterans  Mr.Speaker, I want to be clear, I firmly believe that discharge status is an important tool for military leadership, a tool which helps preserve order and discipline among the ranks. Removing the proverbial bad apples from the bushel is key to maintaining a cohesive unit structure.  However, there also seems to be an evolving trend of soldiers who receive other than honorable discharges as a result of their military experience, rather than simply being a bad or ineffective soldier.  In fact, according to the Medal of Honor Society, there are no fewer than eight Medal of Honor recipients who have received other than honorable discharges. H.918, as amended, would provide that those combat veterans who receive other than honorable discharge statuses would be eligible to receive critical mental health assessments and services from the Department of Veterans It is only right, Mr. Again, I appreciate the hard work and forward thinking of my friend from Colorado, who is also a veteran, Mr.I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

882,topic-id,327,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017.  I believe that telemedicine represents the future of healthcare delivery, and I am proud of the fact that the Department of Veterans Affairs is a longtime leader in telemedicine.  Through VA's many different telehealth modalities, VA doctors and nurses have been able to better serve veterans in remote, rural, or medically underserved areas and veterans with limited mobility or other issues that make it difficult to travel to and from the VA medical facilities for needed appointments and follow-up care. Importantly, veterans who have had experience accessing care through telemedicine have demonstrated improved healthcare outcomes, including decreases in hospital admissions.  It is my hope that all veterans would have access to VA telemedicine when and where appropriate. However, the continued expansion of telemedicine across the VA healthcare system has been constrained by restrictions on the ability of VA providers to practice telemedicine across State lines without jeopardizing their State medical license.  H.2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017, would remove those constraints by authorizing the VA providers to practice telemedicine at a location in any State, regardless of where the provider or patient is located. This would provide VA clinicians the statutory protection they need to continue providing high-quality telehealthcare to veteran patients across the country without fear of penalties imposed by the State medical licensing boards.  I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Representative Glenn Thompson from the great State of Pennsylvania, for his leadership on this issue and for bringing this important bill forward.  I am also grateful to my fellow committee member, Representative Julia Brownley of California, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, for her work and advocacy on VA telemedicine.

It is clear that the benefits are concentrated to those who need help the least, ignoring those who need help the most, and producing an unaffordable deficit in the future.  But one of the most disturbing elements of this is that the Republican plan would gut the agreement that we negotiated in good faith with the wind energy industry to be able to wean them off tax subsidies. It was phased down in exchange for that certainty. The industry has up to $50 billion that is at risk by having the Federal Government pull the rug out from underneath them.  We were well on the path towards sustainability with a clean American bill--low carbon energy. It puts at risk 50,000 jobs as a result of the reversal in course, and it raises questions for American business whether or not they can trust the American Congress to keep a deal.  This is an element that must be changed. We must respect the agreement that we made and protect the massive investment in manufacturing and employment.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8448-2.txt,99,TAX POLICY,2017.0,3.0,November
1001,topic-id,1209,"Mr.President, we are here in the wake of yet another senseless mass shooting. Again, we continue to watch in horror a community torn apart and families seeking solace and comfort, loved ones deprived of people close to them forever. We know about that feeling in Connecticut because we had been through it in Sandy Hook just 5 years ago, almost to the month. Next month will be the fifth anniversary.  Every day in America in communities across this great country, there are senseless similar acts of violence one by one, person by person. Every day there is a mass instance of people dying of gun violence. The danger is that this kind of incident will become a normal way of life in We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized. We cannot lose hope that action is possible. We cannot allow ourselves to succumb to this supposed normal. We cannot surrender to fear or complacency or hopelessness.  Our hearts and prayers are with the brave souls who are enduring this unspeakable grief and pain. Again, we know about it in Connecticut because I remember well that afternoon at Sandy Hook and the days that followed when families hoped for numbness. They hoped that the rawness and unimaginable pain of that loss would leave. For some, it has lessened, but it will never go away for them or for the families in Texas or Orlando or San Bernardino or Virginia The list is a long one, and it should include those families in Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, Bridgeport and in other communities--not necessarily urban, but suburban and rural--around Connecticut and around the country that have endured this same grief.[[Page S7052]]  Numbness is not the answer. Action is the answer--honoring those victims by action. That honor is never too soon. That sense of grief will never go away. As much as our hearts and prayers go out to those families, we must also honor them with action.  Our reaction is not necessarily aimed at the last shooting or the last death by gun violence. It should prevent the future ones. The trap of the gun lobbyists is to say: Well, what you are proposing wouldn't have prevented what happened last Sunday in Sutherland Springs, But we do know that 26 people might be alive today if the U.Air Force had done its job. Twenty-six people might be alive today if the U.Air Force had reported this conviction by court-martial of the shooter to the NICS background system. Twenty-six people might be alive today if the U.Air Force had followed the law.  There is a law that requires this reporting. It was passed in 2007. It requires all courts and all jurisdictions to make that reporting.  The law here is also clear that the shooter never should have had access to firearms. There are laws on the books right now specifically designed to help prevent dangerous individuals with criminal records of exactly this kind from getting their hands on guns, and that includes anyone who has a domestic violence conviction in any court, including military court.  As the author of that legislation, Frank Lautenberg, said at the time: It is a very simple principle. Wife beaters and child abusers should not have guns. The statistics bear out that principle now more than they did ever before. The mix of guns and domestic violence is a toxic one. Fifty-five percent of all homicides against women occur during domestic violence disputes, and a woman is five times more likely to die during a domestic violence dispute if there are guns in the house.  The law also prohibits anyone who has been dishonorably discharged from the military or convicted of an offense carrying a sentence of more than 1 year from buying a firearm.  The Department of Defense has a clear legal obligation to have made that report. By the way, that obligation includes military court indictments as well as convictions, because they may disqualify someone from obtaining guns.  We know today that the shooter in Sutherland Springs, TX, also was involuntarily committed to a mental health facility after sneaking guns onto an Air Force base and trying to kill his military superiors. That person should never have been anywhere near a firearm, let alone having the ability to buy one from a licensed firearm dealer, as apparently occurred.  The Air Force's lapse is shocking and inexcusable. It is a lapse that may have contributed to, if not directly caused, that shooting because, otherwise, that shooter would have completely lacked access to the firearms he used so lethally.  The American people deserve to know why the gunman's conviction was not reported in the background check database. The American people also deserve to know what immediate steps the Department of Defense will take to ensure that every court-martial indictment or conviction is reported to the FBI when they disqualify someone from accessing guns.  The American people deserve action. So I have written to the Defense Secretary James Mattis urging him to take immediate action to ensure that guns are prevented from falling into the wrong hands. That means taking specific, concrete steps to identify an individual whose convictions and court-martial disqualify them from obtaining a gun and making sure those records are submitted to the I want to know what system there will be for identifying those convictions.  I am also planning to introduce legislation because enforcement of that law should be done and reemphasized and reinforced so that there is no question in any mind of anyone in the military about their obligation. They must ensure that people who are convicted of disqualifying offenses in military courts are reported to the national background check database so they are prevented from having access to these firearms by purchasing them from licensed firearms dealers.  As of now, the background check law applies only to those licensed dealers. We need to extend it to include all firearms sales. We need other commonsense measures to prevent and stop gun violence, but at least the military can be compelled to honor this obligation. I know its heart is in the right place, and I know they will diligently reform what they need to do largely on their own because they recognize that obligation.  We have an obligation, as well, to enforce all of these laws more diligently. As a law enforcement person, one who was the State attorney general for 20 years and the U.attorney before then, I am proud of the State of Connecticut for classifying domestic offenses so they can be disqualifying under the law. Connecticut is only one of a handful--perhaps three States--that have that disqualifying classification, so the States need to do better as well.  The simple, commonsense fixes to help enforce laws that are already on the books to keep America safe will enable the law to be real and effective. If it is unenforced, it is dead letter. It must be enforced. We need better enforcement, and we also need better laws.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join in this effort, and I hope this new legislation will be bipartisan, just as we grieve together regardless of party.  Thank you.

1087,topic-id,1478,"Mr.President, this coming week will mark Veterans It is an important time for us to reflect on what veterans do for us and what their families do for us. The sacrifices of both those who serve and those who support those who serve are incredibly important.  We have half a million Missouri veterans, and one of the great privileges of this job is to get to represent them, their values, and the commitment to freedom in our country that they stand for.  A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to welcome a group of southwest Missouri veterans who came to Washington with the Honor Flight program. I think the Presiding Officer also does this, but every time I get a chance, if there is an Honor Flight from our State, I try to get down there because it is a great time to see and to talk to and to thank those who have served us.  When the Honor Flights started 20 years ago or so, there were still some[[Page S7085]]World War I veterans coming, and then they were almost all World War II veterans. Today we see some World War II veterans, Korea veterans, and Vietnam veterans, all of whom serve in the great tradition of being willing to fight for the freedoms that we enjoy every day. I find it humbling and gratifying to know that those veterans get to come here and enjoy the day with each other. In many cases it is the first time they have ever been to the Capitol, the National World War II Memorial, Arlington, and the other places on the trip that now so many tens of thousands have taken.  Many of those veterans whom I saw the other day and whom I have seen through the history of the Honor Flight program were just teenagers when they answered the call to serve--basically, a little more than high school kids who knew that something needed to be done and they were able and willing to do it. They fought difficult battles and, in some cases, often under unbearable conditions. Some of them lost their closest friends in the military. Many of them lost comrades in arms. Some of them lost comrades right beside them. Some of them lost people who went out on another mission and never came back. Some of their families lost a servicemember who never became a veteran.  I was down in Perryville, MO, a little town between Cape Girardeau and Louis, on the Mississippi They are building an exact replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial--the Vietnam wall. We were able to present a flag to the group that raised the money and made the plan to replicate the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Mall to take it back and become part of the Vietnam memorial at  Our veterans are an extraordinary group of men and women. They really stand for the best we stand for as a nation. It is important that with not just honor them on Veterans Day but honor them every day--every day that we live in this free and prosperous Nation that they helped defend.  Admittedly, it is hard not to take all of the freedoms that we enjoy for granted because generations of Americans have been willing to fight and die to protect those freedoms. Because of that, generations of Americans have benefitted from those freedoms, and it seems to us the way people should be able to live everywhere. Maybe too often we think it is the way people do live everywhere, but in many parts of the world, having the security to walk out the door every morning, to drop your kids off at school, to go to work and earn a living, to worship as you please, and to build a better life is not available to people in other countries the way it is here. That is the debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans.  This year, one of the areas of great legislative success has been in the work for veterans. Chairman Isakson of Georgia is going to follow me on the floor in just a few minutes. He is the chairman of that committee. He has a great committee, but they have a great chairman. That committee, with its chairman, and the committee in the House have passed eight bills, at least, that the President of the United States has signed into law that do a number of things for our veterans.  We have built on previous progress for improving veterans care. A few years ago, we made the decision that veterans need to have more choices. A veteran shouldn't have to drive by a hospital they would like to go to in order to get to a hospital miles and miles away. They shouldn't have to pass three or four facilities that could do as good a job or better in order to get to a veterans facility.  There are some things our veterans facilities should do better than anybody else. They should be better at dealing with post-traumatic stress better than anybody else, although they may not be as accessible. They should be better at dealing with patients who have suffered from IED attacks, eye injuries, people who work with veterans in prosthetics, and those patients who have lost arms and legs in the service of our country. They should be pretty good at that. There is no particular reason they should be good at open heart surgery or kidney dialysis or all the other things you go to the hospital for, if that is where a veteran wants to go. We found out that a lot of veterans would rather go closer to home. A lot of veterans would like to go to the hospital they are more familiar with when they need their own healthcare. They would like to go to the hospital they have been to lots of times with other family members and others.  So we really expanded the Veterans Choice Program and expanded the money available for that program. We try to create these opportunities side by side with an existing facility. There has to be some startup money involved, but, eventually, I think our young veterans will find that they can almost always find a hospital they would rather go to or a doctor they would rather see.  We have increased compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities. World War II veterans, such as Arla Harrell from Louis, who suffered a lifetime of illness because he was part of a mustard gas experiment, is finally getting both compensation and the recognition that throughout his lifetime his health was impacted by something that happened while he was serving his country.  We have continued efforts to address the problems at the Veterans' Administration by passing legislation to modernize the outdated benefits claims appeals process to make it easier for VA employees to be fired for misconduct.  We want to protect employees who point out what is wrong. There have been plenty of whistles being blown at the VA over the last decade. While we want to be sure people can blow those whistles, we also want to be sure that the VA can quickly and effectively remove employees who are not doing what they ought to be doing and, in fact, are aggressively doing, in some cases, things they shouldn't be doing.  We worked to expand the possibility and the opportunity for education benefits by expanding what can happen under the post-9/11 GI bill, helping to connect veterans with employers who provide benefits and programs. The HIRE Vets Act, a bill I sponsored in the Congress, was part of the first major pieces of legislation the Congress passed this year. I think that, sometime in the next few weeks, the Department of Labor is going to be talking about how we will recognize and evaluate employers who hire veterans, who give veterans credit for skills they learned in the military, and who promote veterans. To every employer who hires veterans, that is a good thing and we should want to do that. The HIRE Vets Act, like the LEED standard for energy, creates a standard so that we can recognize companies that do that in a significant way. I am pleased that Secretary Acosta in the Department of Labor has put that on a fast track so these companies can be recognized for what they do.  Our veterans have worked hard and have put themselves in danger to keep us safe. As legislators, we owe them, as we owe those who follow in their footsteps, our continued efforts to ensure that those defending our country have everything they need and to show that we are also grateful to those who have defended our country in the past.

14,topic-id,504,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the dangerous tax plan that is currently being considered by the House Ways and Means House Republicans wrote this proposal behind closed doors and then presented it to Congress and the public just last week.  This is not the kind of bipartisan tax plan we need to help lift up working families, grow our economy, and lead to a better future for our constituents. In fact, under this proposed plan, about 80 percent of the benefits will go to the wealthiest 1 percent. While helping out wealthy individuals and corporations, the proposal hurts many working families by getting rid of deductions for[[Page H8526]]State and local taxes and medical expenses, for example.  Mr.Speaker, there is another place where this bill will hurt working families. Mr.Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said: ``an investment in knowledge pays the best interest.'' When it comes to education, this plan is an inexcusable lost opportunity.  Education is one of the smartest investments we can make, and tax policy is a place where there is tremendous potential to do great things. Unfortunately, this tax proposal shortchanges America's schools, students, and teachers.  Ninety percent of students attend public schools, yet this tax plan starves public education by making changes to the property tax deduction and reducing funding sources for the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds  On top of that, the plan would turn 529 college savings plans into a Trump-DeVos private school voucher scheme that will primarily aid wealthy families and will further undermine our public education system.  This tax plan doesn't just hurt our students, it also hurts teachers. Right now, across the country, teachers pay an average of $500 a year out of their pockets to help stock their classrooms with supplies like pencils, notebooks, and materials to enhance learning, and that has been offset by a $250 classroom supplies deduction, which is the least we could do to help those hardworking, underpaid teachers, but this bill eliminates that deduction for classroom supplies.  We should all also be deeply concerned about the consequences of this GOP tax plan for families who invest in higher education. The bill eliminates the student loan interest deduction, making it harder, rather than easier, for millions of Americans who are working to pay off their student loans.  On top of that, the bill repeals the lifetime learning credit and the Hope scholarship credit, has major reductions in tax credits for tuition, and will make employer-paid tuition count as income.  That is the wrong direction. We need a tax proposal that helps, not hurts, students and working families.  This proposal takes away important investments in education, and at the same time will add about $1.5 trillion to the deficit, leaving our children and grandchildren to pay the bill.  Mr.Speaker, this plan will limit opportunities for people to get ahead. That is wrong. We should come back to the table and craft a plan that works for all Americans, not a plan that strongly and wrongly favors those at the top.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8525-5.txt,2092,THE STATE OF AMERICA'S VOTING INFRASTRUCTURE,2017.0,7.0,November

Through the superior      training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA      contractors are able to provide both cost-effective      construction services and middle class jobs with health and      retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on      representing companies that accept responsibility for paying      fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers      compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.       Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves      bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the      basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of      the traditional obligations associated with being an      employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors      who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the      laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation      unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The      key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor      brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire      workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a      workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls      as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal      responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits,      are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment      insurance, and are frequently not paid[[Page H8578]]     in compliance with federal and state wage laws. The joint      employment doctrine is an important means for forcing these      unscrupulous contractors to compete on a level playing field      and to be held accountable for the unlawful treatment of the      workers they utilize.       As an association representing large, medium, and small      businesses, we oppose H.3441 because it proposes a      radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment      under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond      reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-     Ferris or returning to any concept of joint employment that      has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.     3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint      employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor      brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce      provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint      employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of      joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the      essential terms and conditions of employment (including      hiring employees, discharging employees, determining      individual employee rates of pay and benefits, day-to-day      supervision of employees, assigning individual work      schedules, positions and tasks, and administering employee      discipline)''. H.3441 goes further by expressly      countenancing a company using labor brokers retaining control      of the essential aspects of the workers' employment in a      ``limited and routine manner'' without facing any risk of      being a joint employer.       Simply put, H.3441 would create a standard that would      surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction      industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would      further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical      businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's      recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint      employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment      doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a      far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.3441 does      not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It      creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help      unethical employers get rich not by creating more value, but      instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers      as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has      neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them      under our nation's labor and employment laws.       On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance      for your attention to our concerns about this legislation.

319,topic-id,346,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill. It will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, the bill we are debating today is another assault on hardworking Americans who are desperately trying to put food on the table for their families, scrape together enough money to pay for child care, and have a roof over their heads.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying that they need this bill to save local businesses. We all support local businesses in our community. But my colleagues suggest that unless they pass this law, franchisors will become joint employers. Well, if they act like franchisors and control brands and standards, and they don't do things like hire, fire, and supervise the franchisees' employees, they won't be. In other words, if they act like a franchisor and not an employer, they won't be considered a joint employer.  In fact, this bill could actually harm franchisees and take away their independence because it would allow franchisors to indirectly control the labor relations of its franchisees, but be insulated from liability for violations that might arise from that control.  Now, my amendment would require that if a franchisor directs a franchisee to take an unlawful action that would violate labor laws, then the franchisor shall be considered a joint employer for the purpose of the violation.  In other words, if a franchisor acts like an employer, then they should be held accountable for their actions as an employer. Workers must be able to get their hard-earned overtime pay and the wages they are owed. This is common sense.  This motion would protect small businesses, promote the independence of franchisees, and, importantly, cure the defect in the bill that insulates franchisors from liability for exercising control over their franchisees' labor or employment relations.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation currently is an attack on workers' rights.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

1073,topic-id,912,"Mr.President, I rise today to commemorate the courageous service and selfless sacrifice of our Nation's veterans.  Honoring our veterans is one of the greatest privileges I have as a Senator, which is why I often attend celebrations in Arkansas to acknowledge and salute some of the brave men and women who have served our Nation in uniform.  I recently had the pleasure to recognize the service and valor of 15 Arkansas veterans during the Arkansas Military Veterans' Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The class of 2017 inductees comes from all across These veterans served in conflicts ranging from World War II through the War on[[Page S7076]]Together, they have earned some of our Nation's most prestigious honors and commendations, including the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Legion of Merit, and the Silver Star Medal for gallantry.  I also had the opportunity to present three Arkansas veterans with the medals and commendations they had earned when I attended the Veterans Day celebration in Fort Smith, I am proud of the work that we do to obtain the service medals and recognition that these heroes have earned.  We have also worked hard to honor the efforts of Mr.Errol Severe, of Eureka Springs, AR, as he strives to preserve and promote the role of joint service aviation cadets in the 20th century. Mr.Severe, an Air Force veteran, operates the Aviation Cadet Museum, which is the only museum in the United States that exists exclusively to celebrate the teamwork, collaboration, patriotism, and courage of the individuals who trained for and fought in the national aviation effort from 1917 to 1965.  As we recognize our veterans and honor the sacrifice and heroism of those who have been called to serve our Nation in uniform, we must recommit ourselves to fighting on their behalf. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am committed to honoring the promise made to our veterans.  We have made tremendous progress during this In June, President Trump signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection This strengthens accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs by allowing the VA to dismiss bad employees while protecting those who expose wrongdoing.  We are also continuing to improve the Choice Earlier this year, we hosted listening sessions with Arkansas veterans to obtain their input on the strengths and the weaknesses of the program, as Congress continues to expand access to adequate healthcare options for veterans.  In addition, we enhanced the post-9/11 GI bill benefits to increase educational opportunities. I am proud to have played a role in crafting this law, along with my colleague from Oregon, Senator I am pleased that he can join me on the floor to recognize the importance of the provision we have championed for several years to fix an oversight that prevented combat-injured members of the National Guard and Reserve from receiving the same GI bill benefits as Active-Duty military members. This is a great example of Senators on both sides of the aisle working together to get things done.  Fixing this clear oversight in the law that unfairly penalized wounded and injured servicemembers and kept them from accruing educational benefits they rightly earned while in recovery was a priority for both of us because these men and women deserved better. To correct this injustice, we introduced legislation earlier this year, as well as in the last Congress, and I am pleased that it was included in the comprehensive GI reform bill that was signed into law this summer.  While we have made improvements, there is still more that needs to be done, including the expansion of VA services for female veterans. I encourage my colleagues to support the Deborah Sampson Act to address these concerns, and I urge VA Secretary Shulkin to implement reforms written in the bill that don't require congressional action. Our work must continue.  Today, my colleague from Indiana, Senator Donnelly, and I will introduce legislation to allow veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam war era the opportunity to prove toxic exposure in order to qualify for VA benefits.  Let me take one more opportunity to thank our veterans and their families. This country made a promise to our veterans that we must live up to, and I am proud to be able to work for them to ensure that we follow through with our commitment.  The men and women who put their lives on the line in defense of our country deserve our undying gratitude. They also deserve our support when they transition back into civilian life, which is why we must support efforts to improve their health, their ability to further their education needs, and to pursue their dreams, just as they fought to make that possible for their fellow That sentiment is shared throughout this For all of our disagreements in Washington, we truly do come together in support of our veterans. That is one area of agreement.  I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership to ensure equal treatment of education benefits for wounded guardsmen and reservists. I was very proud to work with him in support of this efforts, and I look forward to working with him in the future.  Our guardsmen and reservists are called to defend and protect our Nation, exactly like Active-Duty members. So it is only right that they receive the same GI bill benefits.  I yield the floor.

340,topic-id,177,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding as well. The VA currently requires veterans in need of organ transplants to travel to VA transplant centers to receive their transplant. Waiting times at these centers average 32 percent longer than those non-VA transplant centers.  In addition, we have reports that show that the further the veteran is from a VA transplant center, the less likely the veteran is to receive the organ transplant. This can ultimately prove fatal. We owe it to our Nation's[[Page H8560]]heroes to provide them the best possible care, regardless of where they live.  Mr.Speaker, I support the legislation offered by my friend and colleague from Florida, Dunn, to solve this problem. I am just amazed that we have waited this long to realize we had one.

Small-business owners all around Virginia's Seventh Congressional District have been asking for tax and regulatory relief that will free them from the tyranny of government control.  Take, for example, two employers in my district: a home care franchisee called BrightStar Care of Richmond, and a daycare center called Rainbow Station at the  Mark Grasser, president of BrightStar Care, had this to say to me about the unworkable joint employer standard: ``We have a franchisor who wants to work with a franchisee to provide services. Unfortunately, that is not possible because that would violate the current joint employer standard. This ends up hurting everyone in the process. This standard is forcing employers and employees to make decisions that are not best for everyone involved, but what is best to satisfy government.''  John Sims, the owner of Rainbow Station at the Boulders, similarly said this: ``Having the proposed standard reversed allows small businesses like mine to thrive, knowing exactly where everyone stands.''  I am happy to report that the House is taking a bold step forward on defending businesses and workers today.

1046,topic-id,2306,"Mr.President, this morning I drove from Cleveland to I was in Youngstown, OH--Mahoning Valley--at Teamsters Local 377 talking to workers. There were maybe 200 of them in the room, mostly retirees who are in danger of having their pensions cut--pensions they earned over a lifetime of hard work.  To understand how that happens, when workers are at the bargaining table, whether it is Teamsters, electricians, Steelworkers or SCIU, they so often are willing to give up wages today in order to have a secure retirement in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.  That is what these workers chose to do. They chose to give up wages. Whether they worked for Schwebel's in Youngstown, whether they worked for Roadway, over the road, whether they were working for any number of companies, they were willing, at the bargaining table, to give up higher wages today to have money to set aside that was then invested often in Wall We will get to that in a minute. It is bad enough Wall Street squandered those workers' money. It is worse that the government that is supposed to look out for these workers simply isn't doing it. One of the retired workers, Ed Barker, told us: We did our part. Now it is time for Members of Congress to cross party lines and do theirs.  We talk a good game in this body about how we respect workers and respect their work, but I am not sure we always live that. If we really value a hard day's work in this country, we start by keeping our promise to these hard-working Ohioans, Virginians, Montanans, and all over this country. We keep our promise to those hard-working people in our country, but we can't end there. That is just the beginning of what we need to do to ensure that hard work pays off for ordinary  During his campaign, Candidate Trump made a lot of big promises to workers in He ran some of his big rallies across our He made big promises to workers in Ohio and across the country. He told them he would put American workers first. Well, the White House today looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives, and many of the people the President has put in charge have a record of doing the opposite of putting American workers first.  That is certainly true of Peter Robb, the nominee to serve as the general[[Page S7010]]counsel of the National Labor Relations Mr.Robb has spent his career working to strip workers of their rights, defend corporations accused of mistreating workers, and he has tried to undermine the watchdog agency he is now seeking to join. He will be working at the National Labor Relations Board, which is supposed to strike a balance and advocate only for American workers. The President's nominee is someone who received a very high salary building his career defending corporations accused of mistreating workers, working to strip workers of their rights, and trying to undermine the NLRB's effort to get a fair shake and build a level playing field for workers.  Someone who views unions and collective bargaining as a threat to be dealt with was primarily the story of Mr.Robb's career, instead of helping to protect the central rights for workers. A person like that has no business serving as the top lawyer for the National Labor Relations  His nomination is just the latest in a long line of evidence that work simply isn't valued in this country the way it used to be. People in Ohio and around the country work harder. They work more days, more hours, longer hours, harder than ever before, and they have less to show for it.  Over the past 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone up, and executive compensation has gone up--all because of the productivity of the American worker, but, fundamentally, the workers haven't shared in the wealth they have created. Again, GDP goes up, profits go up, executive salaries go up, productivity goes up, but workers' wages are stagnant or worse. We know that.  We also know people in this body rarely side with workers in that equation. One major reason the economic growth has not brought higher wages to workers is Americans are less likely to have a union card to protect them. When Americans reminisce about the good jobs that disappeared, I am willing to bet most of those jobs were union.  As manufacturing employment declined, the share of workforce represented by unions declined with it--only more rapidly. I can accept that the workforce is changing, but what we can't accept is more and more of our workers are paid less in wages, have fewer benefits, and have little economic security.  It is no coincidence that over the same timeframe, economic growth in this country has been shared among fewer and fewer Keep in mind, as the 1 percent gets richer, they take more and more of the profits, they take more of the productivity gains, and workers are left further behind.  We know what will happen with this so-called tax reform that is being considered in the They are then going to negotiate it right down the hall here in the majority leader's office the same way they did healthcare. They will be right down the hall in the majority leader's office with lots of lobbyists but no light shone, no public, and no media coverage.  We know what happens. We know what happens with tax reform like that. The rich get richer and the middle class shrinks. That is the story of those Teamsters in Youngstown today. As I walked with the crowd of Teamsters, I spoke with a number of them on the way in and the way out. I asked how long they had driven a truck. Most had driven 30, some 40, and a few 45 years. They worked that hard. They gave up wages today so they would have a pension in the future. Yet, right now, because of Wall Street misfeasance and malfeasance, in large part, and because government, the people in this body don't have the guts to stand up for these workers, we know what has happened to their pensions, and we know what will happen to their pensions if we don't step in and do the right thing come December this year.  We know what will happen with the tax reform bill, again, written down the hall in the majority leader's office--the same thing. The wealthiest 1 percent get richer. The rich get richer and the powerful get more power and what happens is, the middle class shrinks. We know that.  Last week, I was on the floor with many of my colleagues talking about a case before the Supreme Court--Janus v. The case is part of a decades-long attempt to chip away at workers' power in the workplace. Mr.Robb has been part of that effort. The nominee to be the top lawyer at the National Labor Relations Board has been part of the effort to chip away at workers' rights, to continue the demeaning and diminishing role of workers in this country, to suppress wages in this country. He is the person the President of the United States wants to serve as the top lawyer on the National Labor Relations  What is wrong with that picture? He defended corporations accused of discrimination of not paying their workers the paychecks they earned. Imagine, he represented the corporations that tried to keep these workers from getting the paychecks they earned. He worked for an energy company that was working to defeat workers' organizing effort. His own law firm's website brags about how they delayed the election 2 more years.  You know how it works. My colleagues know this. These workers signed a petition. They signed a card, if you will, saying they would like to have a union election. A majority of these workers--probably a majority of 60, 70 percent--signed a card saying they wanted to have a union election. It is a right in this country. It is a right since the 1930s. When President Roosevelt pushed through the National Labor Relations Act, workers received the right to vote on a union. Mr.Robb's company was bragging. They were bragging that they were able to delay the election for 2 years. So maybe they couldn't defeat the workers, but do you know what you do then? You delay the election because you have really good, high-priced lawyers who know how to do this for management, for the corporation.  If you delay the election for a week, for a month, for a quarter, for half a year, for a year, for 2 years, you know what happens. Many of those workers who signed that petition who thought they might have a shot at the union, some of them got fired, some just left, some of them were ready to retire, maybe some of them died. So by the time the election is held, you have pretty much defeated the organizing effort. That is why people like Mr.Robb don't belong at the National Labor Relations  We need someone in this job who wakes up every day ready to defend American workers, not oppress them, not shut them down, not depress their wages. You don't want somebody who has spent his career trying to bring these workers down.  What Mr.Robb doesn't seem to understand is, it is not corporations that drive the economy, it is workers. We grow the economy from the middle class out.  I know you are going to hear a number of my colleagues who support this huge tax break in this tax bill. It is all about cutting the corporate tax so corporations make more money, have higher profits, have higher executive salaries. It will not have anything to do with wages. It never does. No matter how profitable the companies are, they are not willingly giving higher wages to its workers. You are going to hear from these companies. You are going to hear the defenders of these companies come to this body, and they are going to talk about how corporations are driving the economy; that if you give tax breaks to the richest people in the country, it will trickle down and create jobs and increase wages. Well, it hasn't worked that way in the past.  In the 1990s, Bill Clinton grew the economy. He focused the tax breaks in the tax bills on the middle-class workers and grew the economy out from the middle. Twenty-two million net private sector jobs increased during the Clinton years.  The next 8 years, under President Bush 2, the tax cuts all went to the rich, two major tax cuts--not entirely to the rich but overwhelmingly to the rich. For trickle down, zero net increase of private sector jobs. There were 22 million during the Clinton years because he focused on the middle class. There was zero job growth during the Bush years because it was trickle-down economics.  What is going on in the back room in the majority leader's, Senator McConnell's, back office? It is another tax cut for the rich, trickle down, see what happens. The rich get richer, and the middle class shrinks.[[Page S7011]]  What Mr.Robb doesn't understand is, it is not corporations that drive the economy, it is workers. When the workers are doing better, they are buying more things, they are creating more demand, companies sell more products, the economy grows. If work isn't valued, if corporations shortchange workers with the help of lawyers like Mr.Robb, then Americans can't earn their way to a better life for their families no matter how hard they work.  We all know, workers are working harder than ever before. They are working longer hours than ever before. They are more productive. Profits are up. Executive compensation is up. Wages have been flat. What is fair about that? What should we do about that? What we should do about that is not to put people on the National Labor Relations Board who want to do more of the same.  Whenever we face another attack on American workers and their freedom to organize, I think of the words of Pope He said: ``There is no good society without a good union, and there is no good union that is not reborn every day in the peripheries--that does not transform the disregarded stones of the economy into cornerstones.'' We need laws that reflect the dignity of every discarded stone, of every American working too many hours for too little pay. The last thing we need is another nominee who doesn't value work, another nominee who doesn't respect the Americans who do it, another nominee who always lines up on the side of the richest people in the country and always is working to take rights away from workers, to take wages away from workers, and to take benefits away from workers. That is the story of Mr.Robb's work history in the private sector.  Is that the kind of person you want representing workers and representing the American economy at the National Labor Relations Board? I think not.  I urge my colleagues to listen a little bit more. Go to the Teamsters' hall in Youngstown like I did today. Listen a little more to the Americans we serve. Listen a little less at the country club, to the big corporations trying to squeeze every last penny out of these workers' hands, to squeeze every last penny out of these workers.

Small businesses aren't just about selling a product or providing a service. Entrepreneurs take the risk for a chance to improve their community and their family's livelihood. These individuals employ our friends and families and improve our quality of life. Congress needs to do what we can to help entrepreneurs succeed.  Young businesses need to use their limited capital, time, and resources to grow their business, not fill out bureaucratic paperwork. This problem has only grown worse since Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010.  When Dodd-Frank passed, Congress promised it would protect consumers. But it has only hurt community banks, small businesses, and the middle class. Dodd-Frank's burdensome regulatory regime has caused community banks to disappear across America, making access to capital more difficult for many small businesses.  The House passed the Financial CHOICE Act to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank, but it currently sits untouched in the United States I hope they will quickly vote to repeal Dodd-Frank and make credit easier to access for Main  But there is more we can do in the people's House to help create new jobs and opportunities. All too often the Federal Government creates regulations that disproportionately hurt small businesses. While a large corporation may have a team of lawyers to comply with these rules, this is rarely the case for a young business. That is why I support this bill.  This bill ends ambiguity in the law by clearly defining a nonpublic offering exemption under the Securities Currently, companies just starting out risk unintentionally violating these laws, which might discourage them from seeking the capital they need to grow. It is common sense to ensure our country's laws are clear and to allow small businesses to operate without fear of accidentally violating the law.  Our economy depends on small businesses and those who put everything on the line to pursue the American This bill will benefit all of us by helping those individuals grow their businesses and create jobs in their communities.

1050,topic-id,607,"Mr.Speaker, reforming our Tax Code isn't an easy thing to do. If it was, we would have done it at some point in the last 30 years. But here is the reality: because of high-powered lobbyists and special interests within a 5-mile radius of this body, we have failed, time and time again, to do what is right for the hardworking American taxpayer.  But in the coming weeks, however, we have a rare opportunity to finally deliver a tax bill that puts working families first by passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law.  First, let me address the fact that there are certain provisions within this bill that some of my colleagues and I might differ on. That will always be the case. But instead of bickering, I urge my colleagues not to look at things in a vacuum and, instead, evaluate it by asking ourselves three important questions.  The first question we should ask is: Does this bill cut taxes for the vast majority of hardworking American families? The answer to this question is yes. Studies already show that if this bill passes, a typical family of four making around $60,000 will see nearly a $2,000 tax cut.  Let's think for a second what this money could be used for. Instead of giving it to the Federal Government, families could spend it on their children, they could put it in savings, or they could even pay off their debts. President Trump promised working families around the country a tax cut. And if this was put on his desk tomorrow, that promise would be delivered.  This leads us to the second question we should ask ourselves: Would this bill bring back jobs from overseas? The answer to this question, like the first one, is also yes. By cutting the corporate tax rate to below the global average and making other necessary reforms on the business side, this bill would make us competitive with our foreign competitors and encourage business to be done here instead of abroad.  Job creators, both large and small, have been coming out in support of this bill. Companies as big as UPS and AT&T, to small businesses right in North Carolina, have said that reforming our Tax Code will make it easier for them to create more good-paying jobs, and we should listen to them.  This takes us to my last question that we should all ask: Would this bill simplify the tax filing process for working families next year and in years to come? The answer to this, as well, is yes.  Mr.Speaker, one of the most striking statistics that I have seen with my constituents and people all around the country is that they spend more than 10 hours a year doing their taxes. Because of the many different forms they[[Page H8604]]have to fill out, recordkeeping, and tax planning that they have to do, Americans are rightfully demanding a much simpler process. By doubling the standard deduction, collapsing the rates, and closing special interest loopholes, Americans will experience a much simpler process when filling out their taxes.  I know how stressful this process can be for many back home, and I am a firm believer that the last thing you should do is worry about navigating our broken Tax  Mr.Speaker, I posed three questions, and the answer to all three was yes. So instead of bickering about preserving a deduction here, or a tax credit there, I urge my colleagues to unite behind a tax reform bill that would cut taxes for working families, bring jobs back home, and make the filing process simpler for millions of people.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8603-2.txt,,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,8.0,November
652,topic-id,698,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time, for the recognition.  Let me just say, I want to thank members of the Health Subcommittee, both sides of the dais, who have worked hard on this legislation, and it is unfortunate that it was not brought to the floor of the House in the month of September.[[Page H8458]]  From a subcommittee perspective, we were ready. We had our legislative hearings in We were delayed one time when the whole House recessed after the shooting of the Members at the baseball practice, but we rescheduled for 2 weeks later, and we had a successful hearing. We had a good hearing; a lot of facts were laid out. We came up with commonsense legislation that was offset in a responsible way. The offsets are not draconian.  We have before us a bill today that will, in fact, fund some of the Nation's most important public health programs. It does fund the State Children's Health Insurance for 5 years, one of the longest extensions for this program since its inception in 1996. It will ensure that children and families who rely on this program will continue to receive the access they need. It also includes, in a fiscally responsible way, to delay the harmful ObamaCare-mandated cuts to safety net hospitals, who also provide care to underserved patients.  Now, think about that for a minute. We are accused of undermining ObamaCare, but here is a cut that ObamaCare mandates to your safety net hospitals across the country--not just in Texas, but across the country--and we are replacing that today in a fiscally responsible way.  It provides funding for community health centers, an important key part of healthcare in communities across the country. It will help the Americans who rely on these vital health services.  Not only does the bill provide assistance for underserved populations, but it does so without adding to the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called this a responsible health package, noting that the $18 billion cost is fully offset, with savings beyond the 10-year budget window.  Other groups have also been supportive: Texas Hospital Association, Texas Health Resources--for me back home--Children's Hospital, and a number of healthcare organizations.  We have data from MACPAC, whose job it is to advise Congress on Medicaid and CHIP policy; and MACPAC has advised us that, under current law, there are no new Federal funds for State Children's Health Insurance for fiscal year 2018 and beyond. Unless Congress acts to renew funding, all States will experience a shortfall in CHIP funds for 2018, which means, if someone is contemplating a ``no'' vote on this bill, if you are contemplating a ``no'' vote, you do need to be aware that if you live in the States of Arizona and Minnesota, you ran out of money in October of 2017; North Carolina, same situation. Oregon runs out next month. Vermont runs out next month. You need to think about your ``no'' vote before you apply it.  Every single U.territory, with the exception of Puerto Rico, ran out of money in the month of  So those are a few facts that people do need to bear in mind, if they vote ``no'' on this bill, what the actual implications of that are.  Yesterday, during debate on the rule, I heard a lot of discussion about taking money out of the Prevention It doesn't take money out of the Prevention Fund, but it does provide discretion for some prevention and public health dollars. It takes it away from the executive branch and redirects these dollars to proven public health programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support in Congress, like community health centers.  So we are fulfilling our Article I responsibility. We shouldn't just be giving everything to the administration to decide how to spend money, whether it be a Democratic or Republican administration. This is the right thing to do.  I am proud of the work done by our subcommittee. I think our subcommittee staff has performed admirably on both sides of the dais.

Today is an opportunity for this House to stand up for our Nation's workers and to protect the small local businesses, which form the backbone of the American economy. Today is about restoring decades-old labor law. Ultimately, today is about giving clarity to workers and job creators all across our country.  I have heard from our friends across the aisle that somehow someone can be an employee without there being an employer. I call that the immaculately conceived employee. There is no such thing under the law, nor has there ever been.  This bill does not change the definition of employer. It simply takes the definition of joint employer back to the way it was a few years ago.  It is a shame that we are even having to have this bill. But the activist National Labor Relations Board in 2015 issued a decision that fundamentally upended labor law as we knew it. This change didn't come through the democratically elected Congress, but, instead, from a panel of unelected bureaucrats.  The NLRB's decision and the resulting regulatory agenda have caused deep uncertainty among job creators. For workers, they are left to wonder who their boss really is. That is an incredibly confusing situation to be in.  Under the new joint employer standard, what does it mean to have ``indirect'' or ``potential'' control over an employee?  I have practiced labor and employment law for decades and I do not know what that means, so I can only imagine the confusion Main Street businesses are facing due to this standard.  Currently, there are at least nine different legal tests nationwide to determine joint employer status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and more to come. This patchwork of standards creates regulatory uncertainty, especially for job creators doing businesses in multiple  So, despite what some on the other side want to believe, this is not an abstract issue. I have visited numerous local businesses in my district, and they are very worried about this scheme. I have heard from workers who want to remain an employee of a locally owned business with an owner who knows them, instead of becoming just another employee in some large corporation.  Clearly, I am not the only one who heard these concerns. This legislation is cosponsored by 123 of my colleagues, including Members from both sides of the aisle. This is a bipartisan issue because it isn't about politics. Instead, it is about saving jobs and supporting locally owned businesses.  Let me make something crystal clear: this bill does not remove a single protection for today's workforce. Despite the scare tactics being used by big labor bosses and their trial lawyer friends, the same important protections exist under this legislation, and any irresponsible employer can be held accountable.[[Page H8568]]  Mr.Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to take the side of our locally owned businesses, to take the side of our small business job creators, and to take the side of American workers.

1169,topic-id,2498,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 607 provides for consideration of H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017, and H.3441, the Save Local Business  H.3043 would modernize Federal regulatory permitting processes for the licensing of hydropower projects. Specifically, the bill would designate the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, as the lead agency for these projects.  I am a proud supporter of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that allows for not only American energy independence, but for American energy dominance.                              {time}  1230  Hydropower should be a part of that strategy. In the Pacific Northwest especially, hydropower is a clean and reliable energy source that is particularly abundant. There is remarkable potential for the hydropower industry in this region and around the United  In 2015, hydropower accounted for approximately 6 percent of total U.electricity generation and 46 percent of electricity generation from renewable sources. However, less than 3 percent of dams in the U.produce electricity. That shows just how great the potential is here.  Through this legislation, we can help ease regulatory burdens and streamline the permitting process by naming FERC as the lead agency for coordinating all Federal authorizations. This will result in balanced and more timely decisionmaking and reduce the current duplicative oversight regime.  So how does this benefit the average American?  Well, having a reliable power source is essential to the world today.  Even more, this legislation also has the potential to lower energy costs and create good-paying jobs. By doing so, we can help Americans put away and keep more of their hard-earned money.  Currently, the hydropower industry employs a workforce of approximately 143,000 people, and that number would certainly rise under this legislation as we unlock our full potential.  Now, some of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this legislation could hurt the environment, so I want to address that.  First, hydropower is an entirely clean source of renewable energy. Increasing hydropower production actually helps protect the environment and promote better public health.  Second, the legislation makes clear that these permitting reforms should have no effect on this Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the National Historic Preservation Those laws and their protections will remain in place.  This is simply about promoting a reliable power source, lowering energy costs, creating jobs, and unlocking the full potential of an all-of-the-above energy strategy.  Mr.Speaker, I will also note that this rule will provide for consideration of four amendments to H.3043, including one minority and one bipartisan amendment.  The other bill covered by the rule is H.3441, the Save Local Business As the sponsor of this legislation, I am thrilled to see this body taking action to protect millions of jobs and provide clarity to America's workers.  Jesus said that no man can serve two masters, and there is real wisdom behind what He said as there is wisdom behind everything He said. His teachings are important every day, but that basic principle seems particularly important in the context of this legislation.  For decades, there was a commonsense legal test that determined when two or more separate businesses could be considered joint employers and held jointly responsible for the same group of employees. Employers had to share direct and immediate control over essential terms and conditions of employment. As a former labor and employment attorney who practiced in this area for decades, I can assure you this was the standard that everyone knew and appreciated.  Well, in 2015, the activist National Labor Relations Board issued a ruling[[Page H8536]]in Browning-Ferris Industries that upended this cornerstone of Federal labor law and created a vague and totally unworkable new joint employer policy.  Making matters even worse and more complicated, Federal agencies then incorporated the new standard in their regulatory agenda. Under this new standard, two independent businesses could be considered joint employers if they make a business agreement that ``indirectly'' or ``potentially'' impacts their employees. Under some of these standards, you can actually be reserved power.  Just think about the uncertainty and ambiguity this standard could cause. It is hard enough for people to even agree on what exactly those terms mean. Imagine how confusing it is for Main Street businesses to understand and follow that.  This is not some abstract issue. In fact, I have been hearing and talking with job creators and workers in my district about this for years. I have sat around the restaurant tables and heard real stories and concerns.  Bob Omainsky, the owner of Wintzell's Oyster House in my home district, had this to say about the confusion caused by the new joint-employer standard: ``If we hire an outside landscaping company to keep our lawns lush, I could be considered a joint employer if I show the landscapers where to mow. Or, if I contract a food supplier for certain ingredients, I could become part of a lawsuit if one of their workers complains about overtime pay. The uncertainty is nothing more than governmental overreach that is crippling eateries like Wintzell's and discouraging growth throughout the restaurant industry.''  This story and example is not unique to my district. These stories exist all over the country from Seattle, Washington, to Miami, Florida; and we heard a whole bunch of them in the hearings that we held in committee. This is why this bill has earned support from both sides of the aisle. This is not a partisan issue, but instead this is about protecting jobs and providing clarity to workers.  Workers shouldn't have to wonder who their employer is. They deserve better than a vague and confusing rule that the American Action Forum found threatens 1.7 million jobs. Even the Progressive Policy Institute issued a statement saying the expanded standard ``may do more harm than good.''  I also want to make one thing perfectly clear: this legislation does not remove a single worker protection. All worker protections provided by the National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Equal Pay Act remain unchanged and are still available.  I also want to dispel the myth that this legislation is some departure from the norm. In fact, this legislation simply restores the agreed-upon legal standard that existed for decades.  The reality is that the new standard has created so much confusion and ambiguity that no one really knows what the law is. There are at least nine different legal tests nationwide to determine joint employer status under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and there are more to come.  This patchwork of standards creates regulatory uncertainty, especially for job creators doing businesses in multiple Ultimately, this legislation is about providing clarity to workers and job creators. It is about protecting the rights of workers and ensuring employers have clarity on their responsibilities to their employees, and it is about preserving the small businesses that are the backbone of our local communities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 607 and the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.Byrne) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule, which provides for consideration of two deeply flawed pieces of legislation.  H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017, is yet another attempt by this Republican majority to prioritize corporate profits over ensuring people have access to safe and clean drinking water.  This bill would not only threaten our clean water, it would also undermine States' rights and Tribal rights by prioritizing power generation above all else when deciding whether to grant or extend a license to operate a hydropower project.  Simply put, this bill puts profits ahead of the public interest. By giving a rubber stamp commission more power than other expert agencies, the bill rigs the process in favor of power producers at the expense of States, Tribes, and our environment.  This bill prioritizes profits over clean water and healthy fisheries and should be strongly defeated. Protecting our families and our environment should always be our first priority.  In another giveaway to corporate interests, House Republicans are also bringing to the floor this week H.3441, the so-called Save Local Business Act, under the false claim that it eliminates uncertainty for workers and protects small businesses.  The truth is a very different story, Mr.Joint employment standards ensure workers can hold employers accountable for violating wage and hour laws, child labor, or refusing to collectively bargain. This bill represents a significant and dangerous break from that standard and would undermine the rights of American workers.  This legislation rewards companies that rent employees from staffing agencies instead of hiring them directly, and allows them to evade responsibility for upholding the rights of those employees, even though they profit from their work.  This bill is not about helping workers or small businesses. This is all about giving powerful companies even more power over their employees.  But, Mr.Speaker, what is just as troubling as the content of the underlying bills is the process Speaker Ryan and his Republican leadership team routinely use to call up this terrible legislation.  Today we are considering the 49th completely closed rule of the 115th That is right. Today House Republicans are breaking their own record for the most closed session of Congress in history. It is astounding. This is something you would celebrate in Putin's Russia, not here in the United  Since he first took the gavel in 2015, Speaker Ryan has continue to shamelessly break his promise to allow a fair and open legislative process here in this  In Speaker Ryan's first speech as Speaker in October of 2015, he said: ``We need to let every Member contribute. . . . Open up the process. Let people participate. A neglected minority will gum up the works. A respected minority will work in good faith. Instead of trying to stop the majority, they might try to become the majority.''  Speaker Ryan and I disagree on a great many issues, but I strongly agree with what he said in that 2015 speech. We do need to let every Member contribute and open up the process here in the We do need the majority party to respect the minority party so we can actually work together on bipartisan solutions.  But in the 2 years since Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he has, sadly, failed to deliver on his commitment to open up the legislative process. Things have only gotten worse. In fact, Speaker Ryan is the only Speaker who has not allowed a truly open rule to give Members the opportunity and the chance to do what their constituents sent them here to do and to offer different perspectives and ideas on how to improve legislation.  With each new closed rule they bring to the floor, shutting out amendments from both Democrats and Republicans, the cynical hypocrisy grows louder and louder. Instead of the people's House, this has, sadly, become ``only the people who agree with Paul Ryan's House.''  I guess my question for the Speaker would be: Did you mean any of what you said? Did you forget all those promises you made? Or did you have absolutely no intention of keeping those promises once you were in power?''  Every single Member of this House of Representatives was elected to represent the people of their district, but[[Page H8537]]we cannot do that if the party in the majority blatantly uses strong-arm tactics like these that prevent us from doing our jobs.  In 2015, Speaker Ryan also said: ``We need to return to regular order. We are the body closest to the people. Every 2 years, we face the voters. . . . We represent them. We are supposed to study up and do the homework that they cannot do. So when we do not follow regular order--when we rush to pass bills a lot of us do not understand--we are not doing our job. Only a fully functioning House can truly represent the people.''  Where do I begin?  Literally just a few months ago, Speaker Ryan and the Republican leaders of this House were recklessly steamrolling their healthcare bill to the House floor without holding anything close to the number of hearings that we held when the Affordable Care Act was passed.  Instead, they led a haphazard process where the bill was drafted in secret behind closed doors--locked doors--without any input from rank and file Members of Congress and the American people. Mr.Speaker, that is not regular order. That is unconscionable. That disrespects this  Today, when asked by a reporter about this record-breaking closed process, Speaker Ryan responded: ``Absolutely we have an open process.''  Really?  Let's review his record this Congress: Zero open rules--zero. Forty-nine completely closed rules.  Open process?  Open process my foot, Mr. I guess in the age of Donald Trump, words simply don't matter anymore. Black is white, up is down, open is closed, and politicians can say whatever they think sounds good and they think they can get away with it--facts be damned.  If Speaker Ryan were serious about a fair and open process, he would not turn this House into a rubber stamp for Donald He would let us be the independent voice the people of our districts elected us to be. He would not routinely shut out the voices of Democrats and He would let this House actually debate the serious legislation and issues that come before us.                              {time}  1245  With one closed rule after another on each bill that comes to the floor, Speaker Ryan has completely shut out both Democrats and rank-and-file Republicans, routinely blocking amendments we offer.  This is not how the Congress is supposed to work. Our constituents deserve a Congress that actually debates the bills that will affect their lives. They deserve better.  I refuse to sit by while the Republican leadership makes a mockery of this American voices will not be silenced.  The Speaker may grant promises of openness, inclusiveness, and regular order, but we just lived through the most closed year in the history of this institution, and the year isn't even over yet, Mr. Republicans ought to remember that they will not always be in the majority. I don't think a Democratic majority could be this bad on basic process, even if we tried. But any Member who votes for this record-breaking closed rule today had better not have crocodile tears for regular order and openness when they find themselves in the minority some day in the future. Anyone who supports 49 closed rules and zero open rules in a single year loses all credibility on the issue of openness.  My Republican friends should be ashamed--ashamed--of diminishing this House and diminishing its Members and their thoughtful ideas. I urge Democrats and Republicans to take a stand and vote ``no'' on this closed rule.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

But, nonetheless, they represent the thinking of the Republicans who are in charge of this  What is particularly distressing to me is that, on one of those measures, it is being brought to the floor under a completely closed process.  As I mentioned, last night, the ranking member of the Education and the Workforce Committee came before the Rules Committee to offer three germane amendments, and the Rules Committee said: No, you don't have the right to have a debate on your ideas, even though they are perfectly germane, on the House floor.  I think that is lousy. As a result, we come today and we make history. This is now officially the most closed Congress ever in the history of our country. My friends on the other side of the aisle are getting up and talking about how proud they are. They talk about bipartisanship. What they don't tell you is that most of the bipartisanship are on things that really don't mean a lot: naming of post offices and bills that pass by 435-0. On big things, on important issues, they block us. I mentioned some of the things they blocked.  I know a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle care deeply about the DREAMers, since Donald Trump decided to throw their fates into the balance. They want to do something to help these young people, many of whom came when they were 1 year old or 2 years old and know no other country as their home but this country. We tried to fix that legislatively, as the President said he wanted us to do, and the Republican majority blocked us. They blocked us.  We tried to offer an amendment again to say let's not invest a gazillion dollars on a border wall. Let's invest in our people. Let's build up our infrastructure. Let's construct the finest railway system in the United States--in the world--over the next decade. They blocked us.  We had an amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic violence and child abuse, and they blocked us.  We had an amendment to say we need to ensure that this culture of corruption that we see in the White House doesn't grow any bigger, that the Trump family doesn't benefit from the taxpayers, they don't benefit financially from the taxpayers, and we were blocked on that as well.  Then we have been blocked on amendments to debate these wars that have gone on for years and years. The war in Afghanistan is endless. It is the longest war in American history. We can't have a debate on the floor. We are[[Page H8542]]told that it is not appropriate and that it is not the right time.  The bottom line is, what my friends on the other side of the aisle are doing is they are running this place in a very authoritarian way, basically saying: It is our way, and that is it. It is our way or the highway, and you don't matter.  Well, we have had enough. We have had enough of being shut out, and we are not going to shut up. We are not going to sit by and allow this pattern of closed rules and closed processes to continue without a protest. This is a serious matter.  For the Speaker of the House in his press conference today to get up and say, ``Oh, we have a very open house,'' I mean, where is he living?  That does not reflect the reality. Maybe Donald Trump can say those kind of things that don't reflect reality, but the Speaker of the House ought to know that today, under his leadership, this has become the most closed House ever, and it diminishes this institution and it diminishes every single Member of this institution.  So vote ``no'' on this rule. I urge my Republican friends, who care about process, who want this place to be more deliberative, to vote ``no.'' Send a message to your leadership that you have had enough.  If you want more bipartisan legislation, if you want a less polarized Congress, then open the process up a little bit. I have news for you, if you do, maybe the popularity of Congress will go up a little bit. I think we are at, like, 12 or 13 percent now. Maybe that might get you up to 15 or 16 percent. But it is the right thing to do.  This is not the way we are supposed to run a legislative body. When you do it this way, you end up with lousy legislation. Your healthcare bill was a disaster. It reflected no input from anybody. Thank God the Senate said no to it. We see the same thing going on with the tax bill.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so maybe we can bring up a little bit of a debate on the need for a select committee to study gun violence. But, please, vote ``no'' on this. Please send a message to the Republican leadership that enough is enough and we are tired of these closed rules.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

1179,topic-id,1312,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, this has been a very open process. At the beginning, you recognized me for an hour and I gave, as is customary, half of my time to the other side so that they could present their side.  In our committee, the Rules Committee, we let anyone who wants to come--any Member who wants to come and basically say whatever they want to say for as long as they want to say it. We don't really have any rules in the Rules Committee because we want to have it so open, we want to give everybody such an opportunity, that we let everybody come and say whatever they want. Then we take it all into account and we make some amendments in order and some not.  Because we have done our job so well this year, we have had so many bills in the House--and the House has passed them all--that this House is just about a record-breaking House in terms of what we are passing. Yes, our friends over in the Senate haven't passed a lot of them. I don't think the American people like that. I think the American people want the Senate to get to work like the House has been at work.  This is important work, and we are here to do it and not play games. The bills that are under this rule are very important bills.  I have heard a lot about climate change. The gentleman may suggest that people on our side of the aisle don't understand science. I am not a scientist, but I do understand climate change. I do understand from the people who are worried about it, and a lot of people are legitimately worried about it. The only thing you can do about that is to have alternative sources of energy.  Hydroenergy is one of those sources. You don't release any carbon molecules in the air when you generate electricity using water. So one of the bills addresses that.  The other bill--my bill--the Save the Local Business Act, is a very important bill, a bipartisan bill. There are bipartisan sponsors on this bill. As I said earlier, there are tens of thousands of businesses around America and hundreds of thousands of employees of those businesses that are aching for us to pass this bill.  So far from being small things that don't matter--by the way, saying nice things about teachers isn't a small thing. I think it is a big thing. These are important pieces of legislation, and I am proud of the work that this House has done to make sure that we consider them and pass them.  Mr.Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 607 and the underlying bills.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 607 Offered by Mr.McGovern:       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution      (367) to establish the Select Committee on Gun      Violence The first reading of the resolution      shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the resolution are waived. General debate      shall be confined to the resolution and shall not exceed one      hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking      minority member of the Committee on After general      debate the resolution shall be considered for amendment under      the five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions      in the resolution are waived. At the conclusion of      consideration of the resolution for amendment the Committee      shall rise and report the resolution to the House with such      amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question      shall be considered as ordered on the resolution and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion or demand for division of the question except one      motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the      Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to      no resolution on the resolution, then on the next legislative      day the House shall, immediately after the third daily order      of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the      Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the      resolution.       4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of House Resolution 367.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled[[Page H8543]]     ``Amending Special Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the      previous question on such a rule [a special rule reported      from the Committee on Rules] opens the resolution to      amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2)      Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of the motion for      the previous question on a resolution reported from the      Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member leading the      opposition to the previous question, who may offer a proper      amendment or motion and who controls the time for debate      thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

1081,topic-id,2146,"Mr.President, I rise to talk about the affordable housing crisis that is gripping our When I say ``crisis,'' I mean I know that people here are on the precipice of talking about what we are going to do in response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and Maria, and I would like to say, the housing crisis that will exist in the aftermath of those hurricanes is real, but there are also even greater implications from the housing crisis that exist today without those hurricanes, and it is only going to continue to grow and get worse until we deal with it.  This past February, more than 2,000 families packed into the New Holly Gathering Hall in South Each family was hoping to hear its name called. It wasn't a contest. It wasn't a game. It wasn't the lottery. It was a lottery to see if families could get affordable homes.  The Mercy Othello Plaza would soon open 108 affordable housing units. That is hardly a match for the more than 2,000 families who were interested in trying to get into one of those affordable units. Based on the numbers alone, their chance of getting an affordable home was lower than an applicant's chance of getting into  Ninety-five percent of the families attending that night left disappointed, continuing to search for affordable housing. This is just one story of how the affordable housing crisis is gripping our I am sure every one of my colleagues in the Senate could talk about a story they have heard in their State because this crisis impacts every It impacts every community, both urban and rural alike.  As I have traveled across the State of Washington, I have seen some of the most hard-hit areas for affordable housing. I even have veterans returning home not being able to find affordable housing. I have seen an aging population living longer and also not having the resources when looking for affordable housing. I have seen young workers who want to be close to where their employment is and yet having to drive so far away because that is the only place they could find affordable housing. We have seen homelessness in numbers that harken back to previous days when we had a true recession.  The most damning part of the housing crisis is, we know how to solve it. We just need the courage to act.  For decades, the housing growth was the most stimulative part of our economy. Throughout the 1980s, housing was 18 percent of Today that number has dropped to just 15 percent. When people discuss tax reform and GDP growth, housing is still one of the ways that economists will tell us that we can grow  In the sixties, seventies, and eighties, if somebody asked, How do we stimulate our economy, usually a cheer would go up for housing, but since the economic downturn, we haven't heard that cheer. In fact, it is almost as if we have forgotten how stimulative housing is to our economy.  The total number of houses built between 2007 and 2016 total just 8.9 million units, which is far below the 15 million-plus average for every 10-year period through the seventies and nineties. We are off the pace of what it takes to provide affordable housing. As a result, the vacancy rates and inventories of homes for sale have also fallen. The national vacancy rate--which is the number of homes for sale--has receded to the 2000 level, erasing all the runup we saw in the housing boom. Moreover, homeownership in the United States is now at its lowest rate since the 1960s.  Twenty million American families, including 11 million renters, are now spending more than half of their income on housing. That means less money for other essentials like food and healthcare and gas.  The National Low Income Housing Coalition tells us that 7.4 million more available affordable homes are needed because we have seen an increase of 60 percent since the year 2000 in the need for affordable housing.  So the United States has become a rent-burdened economy. If we don't address this crisis, the problem is only going to get worse. In fact, one study found that if we don't address this crisis, we are going to see another 25-percent increase in the number of Americans spending more than half of their income in rent.  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the House of Representatives are talking about what they want to do in tax reform. I would say they should look at this data as it relates to where we are with homeownership and housing and things that would eliminate the private activity bonds--one of the key drivers of affordable housing production. It would be a big mistake if they got rid of that. Obviously, there are units of affordable housing that are being planned and built right now. In fact, one estimate is that over 1,000,000 units wouldn't be completed just because of the House provision.  Obviously, limiting the mortgage interest deduction for new homeowners could potentially increase taxes on homeowners and thereby limit the number of people who could afford a home. Almost one-third of taxpayers nationally claim the property tax deductions. They could also see an impact to that. I hope our House colleagues and our Senate colleagues will see, in light of the housing crisis, what a terrible idea those things are.  How did we get to this crisis as it exists now? Part of the issue was demand. For starters, the 2007 housing crash pushed millions of families into the rental market and reduced wages on working families. The demand for rental housing skyrocketed.  Over 7 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure, and they demanded more affordable places to live. Today the homeownership rate is the lowest in our Nation since the 1960s. The last 10 years have seen the largest gain of renters on record. The demand for rental housing shows no sign of slowing down.  Millennials, like many of the young people we see who want to be close to jobs in our burgeoning economy, are forced to rent instead of own. They are seeing that challenged, in big numbers, by the fact that there is not enough supply.[[Page S7081]]  At the same time demand was going up from returning veterans, from aging seniors, from workplace needs, from many more people needing affordable housing after being pushed out of the homeownership market--at the same time demand was going up, supply failed to keep pace. Affordable housing stock is being, and was being, converted to market rate-based units. That means they got taken out of the affordability framework.  A new report found that the number of apartments being deemed affordable for low-income families dropped 60 percent over the last 6 years.  With all this pressure and demand of people falling out of home and back into the market and pushing things down, we saw so many units that were affordable units get transferred over to market-based rates and thereby losing supply.  The new production of affordable housing has not filled the gap, and production of affordable housing is at its lowest 10-year production rate on record since 1974. It, too, has played a role in this problem.  The combination of increased demand and lack of production has caused the explosion in our affordable housing crisis. The number of Americans facing extreme unaffordability--that means they are paying more than 50 percent--has gone from 7 million Americans to 11.2 million That is a 60-percent increase in the number of people in the United States who are in this area of extremely unaffordable rates for housing.  While I know we are going to discuss natural disasters and helping communities recover--everywhere from the families who have been impacted in Florida, in Texas, and various places--we also have to look at the issue of affordable housing everywhere from Seattle and Portland and San Francisco to all the way across the country, to Philadelphia and Miami and many other places.  In the aftermath of Katrina, Congress passed an expansion of the low-income housing tax credit, and it built 28,000 affordable units on the gulf. I know my colleagues will want to do something similar for Texas and the Gulf States to make sure we are doing something, but we need to understand that at the time of Katrina, there was a need due to more than 275,000 homes destroyed by that hurricane. Building 28,000 units was barely a blip.  The low-income housing tax credit helped rebuild some units, but it came nowhere close to solving the housing crisis in New Market rates in New Orleans are 35 percent higher after the storm, and 37 percent of households are paying more than half of their income in housing. Now, 12 years later, another disaster has hit, and we are going to try to address this crisis, but the housing burden for extremely low-income families in Texas and the major metro areas of Texas is among some of the worst in the That was before the crisis. Before the actual impact of hurricanes, Texas was already at a crisis point.  Texas has only 29 affordable units for every 100 low-income households looking for those options. Houston is the third worst in the country for housing availability for extremely low-income people. Now families from Florida to Puerto Rico are going to also be finding a very difficult situation.  Expanding the tax credit could help, but we have to do more than just expand the tax credit for those disaster We need a very big systematic investment in affordable housing all across the United States, and expanding the low-income housing tax credit is one way to do that. The good news is, we have good bipartisan support for the low-income housing tax credit enacted in 1986. It helped build 3 million rental units across this country over the last 30 years. If you want to make a dent in this crisis, both in response to the hurricanes and the crisis that already existed, we need to begin filling that gap by increasing the credit.  That is why I joined Senator Hatch in introducing the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Improvement Act, something that would help us build hundreds of thousands of new units in the next 10 years. I am glad Senators Wyden, Portman, Sullivan, Merkley, Scott, Bennet, Collins, Kaine, Heller, Leahy, Shaheen, Murray, Schumer, Murkowski, Young, Graham, Schatz, Booker, Hassan, Isakson, and Sanders are all supporters.  We have good, bipartisan support from people who understand that this crisis is real and that it is only going to grow. But we also know that the additional tax credit would create almost 450,000 new jobs over the next 10 years. That is because housing is stimulative to the economy. Construction alone supports over 2 million jobs. And it helps by making sure that the economic impact to GDP is realized now through this investment.  It also helps us save money as an economy and a country by putting a roof over people's heads. One of the reasons I was so excited to work with Senator Hatch on this was because in his home State of Utah, they made such great progress in dealing with their homeless veteran population. The community decided that by putting a roof over someone's head, they actually helped lower overall costs. One study found that placing people in affordable housing lowered Federal Medicaid expenditures by an average of 12 percent, and a University of Pennsylvania study found that taxpayers could save $16,000 per homeless person who was placed in affordable housing.  So we need to act. We need to realize that housing provides an investment in job creation and has historically contributed between 2 to 4 percent of GDP growth since the 1980s; that it is an underpinning of our economy; and that we need to make sure that our Tax Code works and make sure that people are purchasing homes as well as finding affordable housing.  As our colleagues deal with the end-of-the-year policy issues and deal with our response to these storms, I hope we will realize that this underlying crisis also needs attention. We have worked on a bipartisan basis in the past to address it, and we can work on a bipartisan basis in the future to both stimulate our economy and solve these problems.  Ninety percent of the affordable housing units being built in the country use these tax credits, so it is only by extending the tax credits, putting a roof over people's heads, that we are going to be able to deal with this crisis. The good news is, it helps us save money and it helps us with GDP growth.  I thank the  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Moran).

1045,topic-id,1179,"Mr.President, I would like to talk about an issue in my State of West Virginia--really my region--that is becoming very important, I think, to this country's energy security and prosperity.  As we know, West Virginia has extensive natural gas liquid resources. Nearly a century ago, when these resources were discovered, the rapid growth that followed turned Central West Virginia into a national hub for the petrochemical industry. You know what, we have never looked back.  Today, chemistry remains our State's second largest industry and directly impacts other major sectors like energy, biomedical engineering, and manufacturing. West Virginia is home to 140 different chemical companies that employ nearly 13,000 workers. West Virginia's share of GDP from the chemical industry is the sixth largest in the country, and these products are about one-quarter of our State's major international exports. We still have one of the highest concentrations of chemical, polymer, and resin manufacturers in the world.  The sector is sort of a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities facing this important American industry during a time of fierce international competition. Estimates show, more than 100,000 workers in West Virginia already have the industrial skills to fill jobs in this sector, and there are thousands more who could easily be retrained to fill these jobs in this important industry. With our region's abundance of natural gas from Marcellus[[Page S7009]]and Utica shale, West Virginia is perfectly positioned for a massive increase of economic growth and new jobs.  Natural gas liquids provide the building blocks for many of the products used by our consumers every single day--products ranging from the dashboard in your car or the water bottle that many of us use. Right now, we don't have the right infrastructure in place to store and distribute the building blocks that make up these products. As a result, these valuable resources are being used to generate heat and electricity, instead of being made into consumer products. As Energy Secretary Perry put it, that's like cooking your breakfast over a fire of hundred dollar bills. This represents a huge opportunity to act on this administration's ``America First'' energy policy. It is an opportunity to grow an industry here at home with an American workforce and America's natural resources.  To elevate these issues in Congress, I am proud to serve as the cochair of the bipartisan Senate Chemistry We host briefings about the importance of this industry to America's economy and national security. States that may not have robust petrochemical sectors, nonetheless, rely on its products for manufacturing, agriculture, and several other key industries.  For months--I would say more than months, years--I have been advancing the development of an Appalachian natural gas liquids market to improve our storage and distribution capabilities. New drilling technologies have unlocked access to trillions upon trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and their associated liquids in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Some of our most downtrodden economic areas have this valuable asset right there.  Unpredicted just a decade ago, this asset can create a renaissance in the region's petrochemical industry, but this can only happen if policymakers and the private sector seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity. To do that, we need to create a natural gas liquid storage hub in Central The concept of this new hub is simple. Right now, because we don't have a way to store these liquids, we are unable to fully maximize this resource. That hurts producers, refiners, and our manufacturers in the State of West Virginia, and Ohio, and beyond.  A storage hub and the necessary pipeline infrastructure would create a robust Appalachian market for natural gas liquids. This would have major national benefits, and here is why. Let's think about the hurricane that just occurred and devastated our friends in The gulf--and particularly Houston and the storage hub at Mont Belvieu, TX--dominate the domestic market there. Hurricane Harvey knocked out as much as 60 percent of that supply. It knocked it offline, and it took a month to get the hub back up and running. By establishing an Appalachian storage hub away from Hurricane Alley, we would add redundancy that protects our economy and our national security. Having all this storage capacity in only one region of the country only drives up production costs for American manufacturers. I would also add that this resource is in Appalachia should have this storage hub to be able to capitalize and create the jobs right in our own neighborhood.  As Appalachia has become a robust producer of natural gas liquids, pipelines that used to flow from the gulf to the Northeast have been reversed. They are now sent to the gulf for storage and refining. It is sent back as ethylene to the interior of the country--often Appalachia itself--and to the Midwest for manufacturing. This back-and-forth obviously drives up prices for the goods you buy every day, from furniture to toys, to cars.  To be clear, development of an Appalachian hub would not come at the expense of the gulf's market. It is a comparative advantage. The Appalachian hub can more efficiently serve many of the domestic manufacturers, while the gulf can expand its export capacity. Besides making the national market more efficient and resilient, an Appalachian market will drive significant development in a region that desperately needs a boost.  A recent study found that the Appalachian States of West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky would see as much as $35.8 million in new capital investment, creating more than 100,000 jobs by 2025 with this new hub.  When Secretary Perry accepted my invitation and visited West Virginia in July, the development of an Appalachian natural gas liquid storage hub and market was a great topic of emphasis. The Secretary met with several business leaders as part of a roundtable discussion to discuss paths forward in developing a regional ethane market. Needless to say, the Secretary saw the obvious benefits of such a project and that the hub could play a key role in the administration's related goals of rejuvenating the Appalachian economy and achieving an ``America First'' energy policy.  The Secretary and I have discussed how best to bring this public-private partnership to life since his visit to West I think all of my colleagues--particularly those representing Appalachia--should be as excited about this concept as the Secretary and I are. Several private entities are undertaking that initial development work right now, with interest coming from both domestic and foreign investors.  I have been engaging frequently with Secretary Perry and with Commerce Secretary Ross about making this storage hub a reality. The Trump administration understands the importance of this project to the economies of West Virginia and the region. I appreciate their efforts to help move our State forward beyond the economic disasters we have had over the last several years. I will continue my advocacy for this enormous economic development opportunity and encourage my colleagues--not just from the States I mentioned but all around the country--to join as partners in this effort.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from                        Nomination of Peter Robb  ",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7005-6.txt,1676,NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH,2017.0,6.0,November

440,topic-id,1842,"Mr.President, today I wish to shine a spotlight on the increasingly dire political, security, and humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Senator Booker and I, along with Senators Durbin, Coons, Warren, Markey, and Brown, recently sent a letter to President Trump urging the administration to take immediate action to ensure that the United States is prepared to do our part to help stave off further violence and human suffering.  The Democratic Republic of the Congo, or the DRC as it is known, is a country of vast natural resource wealth. It is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa by land mass, with ample arable land, a variety of precious minerals, and the world's second-largest river, the Congo, which possesses substantial hydroelectric potential; yet, despite an abundance of natural resources--indeed, because of it--the people of the DRC have endured centuries of exploitation and atrocities. In the postcolonial era, the country has struggled with decades of conflict, endemic corruption, and extreme poverty. The DRC ranks 176th out of 188 countries on the Human Development Life expectancy is 59 years. An estimated 77 percent of the people live on less than $2 a day. More than 12 percent of children do not live to see their fifth birthday. Mothers die in childbirth in more than 7 out of every 1,000 live births. The statistics are truly alarming.  The 1997 to 2003 civil war involved at least seven countries in the region and, by some estimates, caused 5.4 million deaths from war and war-related causes. The conflict was characterized by massive human rights violations and introduced the world to the brutal consequences of the mining of conflict minerals. Eastern Congo has been referred to as the rape capital of the world, and sexual violence continues to be used as a weapon to traumatize and terrorize the population.  Despite the establishment of truth and reconciliation committees by the Sun City Accords in 2002, the installation of a unity government in 2003, and the deployment of the largest United Nations peacekeeping force in the world, the country remains unstable. The peacekeeping mission in DRC plays a critical role in protecting civilians in conflict areas and promoting stability; yet its capabilities are limited, and it is not a substitute for a political agreement respected and adhered to by all relevant stakeholders. Let me be clear: I fully support MONUSCO peacekeepers who seek to uphold their mandate. Though the mission has come under criticism over the years for not doing enough to protect civilians and for controversies regarding its own abuses, we must ask ourselves what would have happened--and what might still happen--if the UN were not present--or if the United States forces such significant troop reductions that the mission is rendered ineffective, which I fear we may be perilously close to doing.[[Page S7057]]  Despite the deployment of peacekeepers and despite the Sun City Accords, conflict, instability, and meddling by other countries in DRC persisted. It took another 10 years and the efforts of the UN and the African Union to put the Congo on a path towards true stability in 2013 through what became known as the Framework of Hope, in which other governments pledged noninterference; yet, instead of building on this landmark agreement over the past 4 years to achieve reconciliation, stabilization, and development, the country has become subsumed in new conflicts and instability due to political leaders' self-interested and shortsighted calculations.  DRC's long and as yet incomplete road to peace is a classic example of how pernicious longstanding conflicts require persistent, high-level diplomatic engagement to untangle and address root causes. International diplomacy often isn't swift or easy, and sometimes the parties take two steps forward and one step back. It is often frustrating. It is often exhausting, but it is always essential. The work of former Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Russ Feingold, who was constantly in the region engaging with heads of state, was instrumental in holding neighboring countries to their commitments under the Framework of Hope, which reduced violence and insecurity. The work of Senator Feingold's successor, Tom Perriello, was instrumental in helping obtain a political agreement in the DRC in 2016 that held the promise of achieving democratic elections and an end to sweeping government abuses against unarmed civilian protesters.  The current spread of violence within the DRC serves as a painful reminder of how critical it is that we continue to work not only to maintain the gains we have made on the international front, but also the fragile respect for democracy and good governance inside According to the constitution adopted in 2005, elections should have taken place in November of last year, and President Joseph Kabila, having served two terms, should have stepped down. Instead, President Kabila first tried to change the constitution and then, when that effort failed, he threw up obstacles--slow-rolling voter registration, underfunding the electoral commission, and insisting on a unilateral and hurried process for the creation of new provinces--all of which precipitated a political crisis late last year when it became clear that the polls would not be open. While the opposition engaged in good-faith negotiations with the government to come to agreement on a new election timeline, Kabila has once again refused to abide by the terms. In fact, elections planned for the end of this year per that December 31 agreement--duly signed by the ruling party and the opposition--will not take place until December 2018. President Kabila's decision to remain in power beyond his mandate and to walk away from last year's political deal has caused instability and upheaval that, if not directly responsible, appears to be feeding growing violence and unrest in various parts of the country, this time including in areas of the country that had been largely been stable.  Government forces and progovernment militia are accused of gross human rights violations in the Kasai region. Two UN investigators, including an American, were killed in the region in March as they attempted to look into allegations of human rights abuses by security forces, and multiple researchers have uncovered evidence of potential involvement by state actors in their murder. The UN has not ruled out involvement by government forces, but more investigation is needed. At least 80 mass graves have been discovered. Over 5,000 people have been killed since 2016, according to some reports. The lives of hundreds of thousands of children and their families in Greater Kasai have been turned upside down by this brutal violence, with nearly a million and a half people internally displaced in the Kasai alone, including 850,000 children. Just last week, the head of the World Food Program warned that, if WFP did not receive funding and access to the area, hundreds of thousands of children would die over the next couple of months. All told, nearly 4 million Congolese are internally displaced--over a million newly displaced in Kasai alone just over the last 12 months--giving DRC the dubious distinction of having the most internally displaced people in  We have a moral obligation to pursue peace. We cannot stand by and allow conflict in DRC or anywhere else spiral so far out of control that an untold number of women are victims of sexual violence, and millions die from conflict, starvation, and preventable disease.  We have a moral obligation to try to halt mass atrocities wherever they occur. The scale of violence perpetrated against civilians in Congo has been staggering.  We should care because the world is supporting a massive peacekeeping operation in the country to the tune of $1.14 billion a year, of which the U.will pay an estimated $325 million this year. We need the MONUSCO mission to be efficient, we need it to be effective, and we need to create conditions for it to end, but the only way for the mission to draw down in a responsible fashion is as peace and stability are progressively achieved. Therefore, the United States, a leader in the international community, must do more to help facilitate a political process that will lead to a durable peace.  The problems in the Congo are not insurmountable, and our voice and diplomatic influence could help bring about a solution if the Trump administration is willing to make an effort to do so. There are several easy steps it could take immediately.  1, the administration could fill critical vacancies. The President should immediately nominate an accredited Ambassador to Our last Ambassador, a highly capable career foreign service officer, left his post in The President should nominate an Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs for Senate confirmation. The position has remained vacant for 9 months, with Ambassador Donald Yamamoto serving in the role in an acting capacity.  Second, on the heels of UN Ambassador Nikki Haley's visit to DRC last month--one of the first visits to the continent by a senior member of the Trump administration--I urge the delegation to capitalize on the momentum from that trip to push for the following: 1, implementation of the December 31 agreement; 2, broader cooperation with and support for the investigation into human rights abuses in Kasai; 3, ensuring there is a credible international investigation into the murder of the two UN investigators; and 4, sharing the assessment of the humanitarian emergency in the  I understand that Thomas Waldhauser, head of U.Africa Command, accompanied Ambassador I hope that he will share his assessment and any recommendations he has related to MONUSCO's deployment. I urge Ambassador Haley to ask that the Security Council convene an emergency meeting to discuss the findings of her trip. Finally, the administration should reexamine the decision in March of this year to lower MONUSCO's troop ceiling, given conditions in the country and the observations of the returning delegation.  We must use all the tools at our disposal, such as the Atrocities Prevention Board, to devise concrete actions our diplomats can take to stave off further violence. The White House should consider tightening sanctions on the regime. So far, we have sanctioned six sitting or former senior government and security officials, as well as a private company owned by one of them, under Executive Order 13671 issued in 2014. Sanctions have proven effective at getting Kinshasa's attention and should be applied in an ever-tightening manner aimed at the highest levels of government until we see demonstrable progress towards implementing the December 31 agreement. The Global Magnitsky Act is another tool that the administration could use to further pressure the regime.  The last conflict in DRC caused a regional conflagration that I consider among the worst in the continent's recent history in terms of the toll on human lives. It should never be repeated. The administration can and should take the steps I have just outlined immediately. While simple and straightforward, they could prevent further bloodshed. A repetition of the war is not inevitable, and I hope the President will take action to forestall[[Page S7058]]an increasingly dire humanitarian and political crisis in the region.

1082,topic-id,848,"Mr.President, later today we will start the process of voting on the confirmation of William Wehrum for Assistant Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and I take this time to urge my colleagues to reject this nominee and vote against his confirmation.  The EPA Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation supervises national programs and policies for regulating air pollution and radiation exposure. Notably, this office administers the Clean Air  As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, I once again find myself using my voice to say that science and public health, not partisan politics, should drive the confirmation process.  If confirmed, Mr.Wehrum is expected to play a leading role in dismantling climate change regulations. Since the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 ruled that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are dangerous air pollutants, OAR is the office that accepted the endangerment finding and developed the Clean Power Plan to address carbon pollution.  Given the Trump administration's own admission--or lack of suppression--in the latest update to the National Climate Assessment ``that it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,'' it should be common sense to nominate and confirm Administrators who care about our environment and our future, including acting on climate change. It is inexcusable to confirm those who disagree with that. I am not convinced that Mr.Wehrum will act on carbon pollution or any other air pollutant.  It would take an extraordinarily independent Assistant Administrator to resist the current course at the EPA under EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.[[Page S7082]]We know that we have a challenge at the top. We need as the person to head this Agency a person of integrity who will stand up for what science tells us we need to do in protecting air quality. I would argue that Mr.Wehrum is not that person.  Let me go over some of the challenges we face.  For example, in January of 2017, the EPA issued itself a 6-month extension to respond to Maryland's Good Neighbor petition. The petition alleges that 36 powerplants in five neighboring States are preventing Maryland from meeting its own obligations under the Clean Air That deadline expired with no EPA action on the petition.  On September 27, 2017, Maryland filed suit against the  On October 5 of this year, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation filed a similar lawsuit because pollution from powerplants is a source of nitrogen pollution in the Chesapeake  On October 27, 2017, the EPA denied a separate Maryland petition asking the EPA to add nine States to the Ozone Transport Region, alleging that these States contribute to the violation of the 2008 ozone national ambient air quality standards.  In its response to the petition, the EPA determined that expanding the Ozone Transport Region is ``not appropriate at this time'' because existing rules will achieve reductions in emissions. The EPA's response states that ``better-targeted approaches, such as those under the Clean Air Act's good neighbor provision, would be more effective in addressing the 2008 ozone targets.''  The EPA's reasoning to deny the Ozone Transport Region petition--that existing rules will adequately address transported pollution--is predicated on the sincere implementation of those rules. In fact, Maryland did utilize--we did utilize--a ``better targeted approach.'' Maryland filed a Good Neighbor petition last November that was ignored for 1 year, prompting the lawsuit against the  Based on his professional history and testimony, I do not have reason to believe that Mr.Wehrum will ensure that existing rules will adequately address air pollution. While he worked at the EPA during the George Bush administration, Mr.Wehrum attempted to direct the Agency's air requirements to favor markets, earning praise from industry groups he would later represent in private practice. How can we ask Mr.Wehrum to objectively administer the Clean Air Act after a career spent on one side?  Mr.Wehrum has 20-plus years working for the industry as a lobbyist. He has a record of ignoring science in the recommendations that he made. There are examples of where he absolutely disagreed with expert groups--just to give one example, the Academy of American Pediatricians' assessment on mercury and air toxins submissions. Mr.Wehrum took issue and disagreed with their findings.  He was seen as an unacceptable choice in 2007 when he was nominated to lead the same Agency by President Bush, and his nomination was withdrawn over Democratic opposition. So this is not the first time we have had a chance to deal with Mr.Wehrum for this position. In the interim, he has only continued his work to advance industry by advocating for weakening the Clean Air  I will continue to stand up for the rights of Marylanders and all Americans to air that is safe to breathe and a climate that is livable, and all of us can help in that regard by rejecting this nominee.

104,topic-id,958,"Mr.President, while Senators Alexander and Rounds are on the floor--Senator King has just left--I find it ironic that the four of us who are gathered here are former Governors and are interested in getting things done and are interested in working across the aisle. We want to be able to achieve better results for less money. I applaud Senators Alexander and Murray for their efforts in trying to ensure that we begin to do that.  I think my friend from South Dakota gives much credit to President Obama in his attacking what was originally bipartisan legislation that had been introduced here in 1993 by Senator Orrin Hatch, with 22 Republican cosponsors, and that later became  The idea behind their proposal was that there ought to be exchanges in every State and that the people could join if they did not have healthcare coverage; 2, that there would be a sliding scale tax credit to help buy down the cost of coverage for people who got their care in the exchanges; 3, that there would be an individual mandate that said you don't have to get coverage but that, if you don't, you have to pay a fine; 4, that there would be an employer mandate that said employers of a certain size would have to cover their people; 5, that insurance companies could not refuse to cover people with preexisting conditions.  Barack Obama had nothing to do with that. We continue to hear folks deride the idea of the exchanges and the five points I just mentioned as He had nothing to do with it. When we marked up the Affordable Care Act, we took, really, those ideas from the 1993 legislation here, with 23 Republican cosponsors--RomneyCare--and proposed and implemented it, I think, in 2006. It worked. When we were marking up the Affordable Care Act, we were actually looking for something that worked in order to give coverage to people in a cost-effective way.  In 1993, the Republicans used, I think, what was originally a Heritage idea--Romney in 2006. They had a good idea, and it used market forces. What we have never done since the Affordable Care Act went into place is actually enable a good Republican idea to work. I think what Senator Alexander has put together with Senator Murray can help move us closer to that step.  Some other things that I think we ought to do include a reinsurance plan along the lines that Senator Kaine and I have introduced, and that, I think, has a fair amount of support in a lot of corners. If we are not going to have an individual mandate--and I think we ought to, but if we are going to take it away--the other thing is to make sure that we put in its place the exchanges having young, healthy people so you have a group of folks in each State in the exchanges who are insurable without the insurance companies losing their shirts.  I think one of the great things about what Senator Alexander and Senator Murray are trying to do here is to take the small step of ensuring that the cost-sharing reductions really help lower income people with their copays and help them with their deductible costs. If we can do that, along with the 1332 waiver, which I support, this can be a confidence builder. Maybe we can do some other things like the reinsurance ideas we have and others have. If there is a better idea than the individual mandate, by golly, let's do that, but we need healthy, young people in the exchanges.  My hope is, we can find common ground and make it on a little broader range of ideas to bring us good healthcare coverage at an affordable price and then turn--kind of pivot--to the Affordable Care Act itself. As for the stuff in the Affordable Care Act that ought to be changed or dropped, let's do that. As for the portions of it that ought to be preserved, let's do that as well.  Again, I commend my friends for coming up with this very good step. My hope is that we can get a vote for it.  I met with a lot of insurance company folks earlier today. We do not agree on everything, but one of the things I heard from them is, if we were to do what Senator Alexander and Senator Murray have called for with respect to cost-sharing reductions and if we were to do some kind of reinsurance plan along the lines of what Tim Kaine and I have suggested--but not necessarily that--and if we were to do something to make it clear that the individual mandate or some other mechanism were going to be in place and stay in place so we could get young people into the exchanges, if we were to do those three things, they told us, we could bring down premiums anywhere from 30 to 35 percent in the exchanges.  Who benefits the most? As it turns out, it is not just the people who are getting their coverage in the exchanges. Who else benefits the most is Uncle Sam because, if we reduce premiums by 30 to 35 percent, Uncle Sam, which pays all of these tax credits to help buy down the cost of coverage in the exchanges, reaps a big benefit as well, and that helps to bring down the size of the deficit, which is good.

Yet, when we spend 18 percent, we don't cover everybody, and we don't get better results. That is a good question, and I hope the President and Prime Minister Abe got into that. Yet that is something I need to turn away from now.  Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Bill Wehrum to be EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and  We have seen this movie before, but like many sequels, this one may actually be worse than the original. My opposition to this nominee should not come as a surprise to my colleagues or to Mr.Wehrum because, in 2005, President George Bush nominated him for the exact same position, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at the I opposed his nomination at that time, as did many of my colleagues, and he was not confirmed.  Prior to his nomination in 2005, Mr.Wehrum was an industry lawyer and later a political employee at the He served as chief counsel to Jeff Holmstead, then the Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, from 2001 through 2005. While serving at the EPA during this time, Mr.Wehrum had a concerning track record of suppressing scientific information and the work of the EPA's career staff, deferring to industry on issues of public health, and not responding to my colleagues and to me when we were then serving on the Environment and Public Works  President Bush eventually nominated Mr.Wehrum to fill Jeff Holmstead's seat and to serve in an acting capacity as Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at the EPA, something Mr.Wehrum would not be able to lawfully do today.  Behind me, to my left, is an excerpt from an editorial from April 2006. The New York Times published an editorial opposing Mr.Wehrum's nomination that mirrored my concerns at the time:       [The Holmstead era at EPA] will be remembered chiefly for      its efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act (particularly with      respect to rules governing mercury emissions and older power      plants), to manipulate science and to elevate corporate      interests above those of the public. Mr.Wehrum, who served      as Mr.Holmstead's deputy and doctrinal hit man, could make      things worse.  That is a direct quote from this editorial. This is the New York Times editorial from 2006 opposing Mr.Wehrum's nomination for the very same position he seeks today.  During the Environment and Public Works Committee's consideration of Mr.Wehrum's nomination in 2005, I voted against him because I feared he would continue to fail to clean our air and protect public health. Despite the fact that Mr.Wehrum was not confirmed due to his inability to secure the 60 votes needed for cloture on his nomination, he was able to serve as Acting Assistant Administrator for EPA's air office for 2 years.  Since leaving the EPA, Mr.Wehrum has returned to industry and served as an industry lawyer in litigation against the  Since returning to the private sector, Mr.Wehrum has reflected on his time spent at In doing so, he didn't point to the good work he did at the Agency to advance its public health mission or the lasting protections he put in place that made a difference in the lives of ordinary citizens; instead, he noted that his tenure at EPA was really good for business, saying:       I'm a much better lawyer now than when I first joined the      agency. To really get to know how the agency works and how it      ticks, I think that is very valuable. I have expanded my      capabilities which will hopefully allow me to be effective in      generating business and clients.  In generating business and clients. Sadly, my fears of 2005 were well-founded, and only one thing has changed--the Senate rule with respect to the number of votes we need to consider and confirm a nominee. If Mr.Wehrum is confirmed this week, it will be because he is the beneficiary of the Senate's elimination of the requirement with respect to needing 60 votes to consider nominees. It will not be because he is better suited for this important job.  I will walk through some telling numbers for my colleagues this evening. The first number is 31. That is the number of times Mr.Wehrum has represented industry against the EPA in Federal court since 2009.  Let me be clear on this. After serving in an unconfirmed capacity at the EPA because he was too far outside the mainstream to be confirmed by this body, Mr.Wehrum then left the Agency and has spent the years since suing that very same Agency and attempting to weaken environmental and public health protections on behalf of his industry clients. Many of these lawsuits are still ongoing and, in the majority of the pending lawsuits, Mr.Wehrum has represented the interests of Big  Look at another poster. The number 27. What does 27 refer to? It refers to the number of times public health groups prevailed in court when challenging Bush-era clean air regulations that Mr.Wehrum helped to craft because they did not follow the law or sufficiently protect public health. Failing to follow the Clean Air Act meant delays in public health protections and uncertainty for businesses across  I don't doubt that Mr.Wehrum is a fine lawyer--so why were so many of the rules he helped to write found to be unlawful? The confirmation process is essentially a job interview. It is not a job interview with EPA, in a sense, and it is not really a job interview with us, but it is a job interview with the American people. In this case, Mr.Wehrum is essentially applying for the job he already had at EPA, and you would think that would be easy, but Mr.Wehrum's resume shows that a great deal of the work he did in his last job as Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation was not up to par. In this job, subpar work impacts millions of Americans, especially children and the most vulnerable among us.  The next number is 10. Ten is the number of additional years that children were exposed to toxic air emissions from powerplants because of delays Mr.Wehrum helped put into place while at the  The next number is eight. The number eight refers to the number of days before Mr.Wehrum's latest confirmation hearing when he was in a courtroom arguing against rules that would protect 2.3 million miners, construction workers, and bricklayers. According to Mr.Wehrum, ``People are designed to deal with dust. . . . People are in dusty environments all the time and it doesn't kill them.''  The next number is two, which is the number of times the DC Circuit Court cited ``Alice In Wonderland'' in its decisions to reject EPA rules that Mr.Wehrum helped craft because, in the court's view, the regulations were based on fantasy rather than following ``the rule of law.''  The next number is one. One is the number of times that language from a law firm that represented industry--and also happened to be Mr.Wehrum's former employer--made it verbatim into a clean air regulation that Mr.Wehrum stated he was ``extensively involved'' in preparing.  Think about that.  Zero is the number of times Mr.Wehrum advocated in court for stronger clean air regulations since leaving the It is an especially troubling number for those of us living in downwind States like We live at the end of America's tailpipe, along with our neighbors in Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and folks all the way up to Zero is also the number of times Mr.Wehrum expressed a desire to protect public health when I met with him prior to his confirmation hearing.  Mr.Wehrum sits before us again today nominated for the very same position he was nominated for 12 years ago. After reviewing Mr.Wehrum's record, talking to him in person, and listening and reading his answers during the hearing process, my position has not changed since 2005, primarily because his views do not appear to have changed.  Like other EPA nominees, Mr.Wehrum was evasive on many of the questions asked of him, even convincingly forgetting a case that he worked on against the renewable fuel standard in National Chicken Council, et al v.[[Page S7103]]However, what was clear in the answer that he did give, and in his conversation with me, is that public health simply is not Mr.Wehrum's main concern.  In fact, when asked what Clean Air Act regulation he does support, he answered as follows:       I represent clients in private practice. It is my legal      ethical duty to zealously represent their interests.  Well, in this job interview with the American people to be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, the American people are his clients, and the fact that he cannot--or has refused to name--a single regulation that helps to ensure that they and their families have clean air to breathe is almost disqualifying in and of itself. Whether it is carbon, mercury, silica, or other toxic air pollution, Mr.Wehrum continues to show that he sides with polluters over science and doctors every time.  Mr.Wehrum's extreme views will not be good for public health, and quite frankly the legal uncertainty that has resulted from his past work will not be good for American businesses. Businesses need certainty and predictability, and they don't get it with the kind of work he has done.  Let me close by reminding our colleagues that next week we celebrate the 27th anniversary of the signing of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Twenty-seven years ago, we weren't debating how to weaken or delay our clean air laws. Instead, we passed bipartisan legislation that would improve and strengthen our clean air laws based on the very best science. In the process, we strengthened our economy too. Back then, 89 Senators, including some who still serve in this Chamber, voted to approve the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As a Congressman over at the other body at that time, I voted along with them. A Republican President, George Herbert Walker Bush, signed the bill into law 27 years ago today. It was commonsense legislation, it was bipartisan, and we are all better for it.  When the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 passed Congress, I was a Congressman in the House, and I voted in favor of that bill. I was proud of helping to pass that monumental law because I believed then, and I still believe today, that we can protect our environment and grow our economy at the same time--and we have the job numbers to prove it.  We have had some delays in implementation, but, by and large, the law has been a huge success and has benefited just about every For every dollar we spend in installing new pollution controls in cleaning up our air, we have seen $30 returned in reduced healthcare costs, better workplace productivity, and saved lives. We have a return of $30 for every dollar we spend installing new pollution control.  The bottom line is, fewer people are getting sick and missing work because of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  When it comes to the rhetoric surrounding air regulations, there is a lot of fake news that people like to peddle, but as the saying goes: Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinions but not to his or her own facts.  Here are the facts. Our economy did not take a slide because of clean air protection. Quite the opposite is true. The Obama administration implemented the Clean Air Act based on the best science to date. Now our air is cleaner. We have seen 8 years of economic growth.  I will say that again. We have seen 8 years of economic growth, the longest stretch in our history. Energy prices at the pump and the meter are lower than when President Obama took office--lower, not higher. The beauty of our clean air laws is that they are not static. Our clean air protections keep up with the latest oversight science and the latest technology.  As we learn more about what makes us sick, about what is impacting our environment, and about what can be done to clean it up, the EPA has the authority, under the Clean Air Act, to make adjustments to make it better, to ensure that it protects more people, not fewer. That has been the trajectory to date. As technology and science develop, so do our clean air regulations.  That is also the story of our country. Through innovative and creative solutions, we strive for progress in order to have a better life here at home and to lead the world in tackling the environmental challenges of our time. Mr.Wehrum's policies have been tried and have been proven not only unsuccessful but even dangerous. We don't need to continue to move backward. We need to move forward.  Mr.President, I will leave you and our colleagues with this. I am sorry to say that Mr.Wehrum has worked deliberately to halt that progress, to delay that progress and to roll back clean air laws that have been protecting America and Americans for decades. Unlike many of the nominees who have come before us this year, unfortunately, we don't have to speculate about how Mr.Wehrum would do in this position. We have already seen it. We have already seen it, and the results were not good for the rest of us.  As his clients at this time, we deserve better representation. Today Americans deserve leaders at EPA who will be impartial and will look out for the interests of all Americans, not just Big Oil and the kind of clients who can afford Mr.Wehrum's legal bills.  We have seen this movie before, and there is no need for a sequel. I regret having to say that, but I do believe Mr.Wehrum is not the right fit for this position today, any more than he was a dozen years ago.  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on his nomination to serve as EPA's Assistant Administrator for air.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

It is a covenant that says: you do this for us, and we will take care of you when the time comes, when you need us. It is a covenant that our honoring is of paramount importance, and there is no one here in the people's House who wants to turn his or her back on that covenant.  As part of this enduring covenant and commitment to those who have served our Nation, the VA provides, as has been mentioned, a modest Aid and Attendance benefit to low-income veterans in need of our support. It is a benefit that helps pay for assisted living and in-home personal care for veterans who qualify for VA pension and are homebound or require the aid and assistance of another person.  Unfortunately, as Roe mentioned, a number of unscrupulous scam artists are out there taking advantage of this commitment and this benefit provided to our veterans. They abuse the VA system by deliberately misleading our veterans into thinking they have to pay application fees, into creating damaging irrevocable trusts, into paying extra fees for so-called expediting these applications when no such expediting is available, and for paying any fees at all when, as has been mentioned, the veterans service organizations do it for free.  Practices such as these leave vulnerable, elderly veterans with few choices outside of draining their own remaining assets. My bill, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act of 2017, is a bipartisan, commonsense approach that will direct Federal agencies to work with the States and outside experts to establish standards that will prevent this kind of exploitation of our veterans and protect them from dishonest, predatory, or otherwise unlawful practices relating to the A&A benefit, and it will require a report from the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study and report to Congress on how better to protect veterans from these scam artists.

At the same hearing, another small-business owner testified that: ``I would cease to be an independent small-business owner . . . ultimately, I would become a de facto employee of the corporate brand.''  These are merely two examples of the consequences real American small-business owners face because of the decisions of Washington bureaucrats and activist judges. The Obama-era joint employer scheme threatens small businesses, the engines of American economic growth.  Small businesses, after all, create the majority of the new jobs in this Nation; they spur innovation.  Enacting this legislation would help ensure continued freedom for America's best job creators.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.3441. Passage of this legislation is necessary to restore certainty to America's small-business owners and their employees so that they can continue to operate their businesses locally and independently.

Meanwhile, working people who play by the rules are getting crushed by healthcare costs, childcare expenses, housing payments, and student loan debt.  What is the Republican solution for this problem?  A $1.5 trillion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, and a tax increase for tens of millions of hardworking families.  This bill is a scam. Republicans are throwing a wealthy five-star banquet for the wealthy and well connected, and saving a few crumbs that fall from the table for the hardworking middle class.  Democrats know that American people deserve a better deal. That is why we are fighting to build an economy that ensures better jobs, better wages, and a better future; create 10 million new full-time, good-paying jobs; invest in rebuilding our crumbling roads, bridges, and schools; lower costs for everything from prescription drugs to childcare; and break up corporate monopolies that are raising costs and reducing choices for working families.  Republicans might be fine with the status quo that benefits the wealthy and powerful special interests.

Mr.Speaker, I rise to oppose the deficit-exploding Republican tax plan that rewards billionaires first, and then asks hardworking Americans to pay for it.  The Trump Republican tax scam will raise taxes for millions of working families. It will kill jobs in the home construction industry. It will punish student loan borrowers. This reckless plan will repeal the deduction for State and local income and sales tax. I would remind my colleagues in the majority: If you vote ``yes,'' you are voting for a $900 billion tax increase on American families.  This bill is not conservative. It is not pro-family. It is not pro-worker. It will kill jobs and reward the wealthy and corporations at the expense of everyone else.

It is reported that President Trump wanted to call this bill ``cut, cut, cut.'' That would have been apropos.  The first cut is for him and his family members, the second cut is for his wealthy friends and acquaintances, and the third cut is for large corporations classified as It certainly does not cut taxes for middle-income families or most small businesses. In fact, it does just the opposite. It is crystal clear who gets the cuts and who gets to pay more.  First and foremost, the GOP tax plan eliminates inheritance taxes that only apply to two-tenths of 1 percent of families who wish to pass along their wealth, unearned and untaxed.  Why are Republicans doing this? Because it is a huge priority for some of their biggest donors, and the middle-income families will be asked to pay for this $172 billion giveaway to the superrich.  The GOP pretend not to be cutting taxes for the superrich by maintaining the top rate of 39.6 percent. However, their plan increases the income levels that the 39.6 percent applies to from $470,000 a year to $1 million. These proposed rate changes will cost over $1 trillion.  The GOP tax plan also features a special rate for the owners of passthrough businesses that will cost $448 billion. These are LLCs and partnerships that pay zero corporate taxes and whose owners' income is treated the same as everybody else's.  LLCs and other types of passthroughs make up 95 percent of all the businesses in the country. Some of the largest businesses, like Koch Industries, Chrysler, and, of course, most of the entities owned by the Trump organization are  Passthroughs that are truly small businesses are not currently subject to the highest individual rates and already pay 25 percent or lower. The National Federation of Independent Businesses opposes this provision for this very reason.  Mr.Speaker, most of us, especially those who have worked in State governments, view our States as the best[[Page H8528]]laboratories for the development of good ideas and best practices. This passthrough idea was the centerpiece of Governor Sam Brownback's tax overhaul in Kansas 5 years ago. The Governor promised it would yield massive economic growth.  And what happened? Kansas was plunged into a massive budget deficit and forced to make draconian cuts to education, infrastructure, and the rest of the State's operations. This year, the Kansas Legislature overrode Governor Brownback's shortsighted experiment.  I urge my colleagues not to make the same mistake here. This scam will subject the good people of this country to a second great recession in a single decade. Middle-income families will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates deductions for State and local taxes. This includes millions of Americans and over 500,000 South  Middle-income families who itemize deductions will pay more because the elimination of the personal exemption will cost their households $4,000 per member.  Middle-income families who utilize mortgage interest deductions will pay more because the GOP plan lowers the cap.

Why are Republicans doing this? Because it's a huge priority for some of their biggest donors. In fact, this cut is not even about the 0.2 percent--it's really about two families--the Mercers and the  The bottom line is that America's hard-working low, moderate and middle-income families will be asked to pay for this $172 billion dollar give away to the super rich.  At the heart of this scam is the GOP pretense not to be cutting taxes for the super-rich by maintaining the top rate of 39.6 percent. However, it increases the income level that the 39.6 percent applies to; from $470,000 to $1 million. These proposed rate changes will cost over $1 trillion.  This cut also goes to those who make far more than $1 million as well. Whether your income is $1 million, $10 million, or $100 million, this provision alone gives you an extra $25,000 a year. Mr.Speaker, many South Carolinians I represent do not make $25,000 in a year.  The GOP tax plan also features a special rate for the owners of ``pass-through'' businesses at a cost of $448 billion. These are LLCs and partnerships, who pay zero corporate tax, and whose owners' income is treated the same as anybody else's.

This year, the Kansas legislature overrode Governor Brownback's short-sighted experiment.  I urge my colleagues not to make the same mistake. This scam will subject the good people of this country into a second great recession in a single decade.  Let's take a look at who pays more while the President and his wealthy friends and acquaintances pay less.  Middle income families will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates deductions on state and local taxes. This includes millions of Americans and over 500,000 South  Middle income families who itemize deductions will pay more because the elimination of the personal exemption will cost their households $4,000 per member.  Middle income families who utilize the mortgage interest deduction will pay more because the GOP plan lowers the cap, costing millions of Americans more.  Middle income families with children in college or recent graduates will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates the deduction for interest on student loans.  Middle income families that are victims of natural disasters will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates the casualty loss deduction.  Middle income families who adopt children will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates the adoption tax credit.  Middle income school teachers will pay more because the GOP plan eliminates their ability for to deduct for supplies they may purchase for their classrooms.  Middle income families struggling to pay costly medical bills will pay more because the GOP plan shamefully eliminates their deductibility.  Mr.Speaker, paying for pass-through gimmicks and tax giveaways to multi-millionaires by raising taxes on moderate and middle-income Americans is reprehensible.  Democrats are ready to do real tax reform on a bipartisan basis. But not once in this process, has the other side attempted to negotiate. In fact, they have publicly made it abundantly clear that they want a bill that only Republicans will support.  Bipartisan tax reform should lower taxes for working people, not raise them.  Bipartisan tax reform should end incentives for offshoring jobs and level the playing field for American corporations.  Bipartisan tax reform should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit for single filers and the Child Tax Credit to help families.  Real bipartisan tax reform would not increase the deficit, add to the debt and pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren.  I know many of my colleagues share these values. Let's set aside this partisan process and do something worthwhile for the American people. Until then, the Democratic Caucus will be resolute in our opposition to ramming through tax increases for middle income Americans and massive giveaways for the rich.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8527-2.txt,208,VETERANS DAY,2017.0,7.0,November

While the VA is seeing high rates in calls to the Veterans Crisis Line, there is no overarching approach to ensure the VA is effectively preventing future suicide attempts and integrating the hotline information into VA's mental healthcare services.  H.4173, the Veterans Crisis Line Study Act, would address that critical gap in oversight. This bill would require the VA to study the outcomes of the VA's Veterans Crisis Line while protecting the privacy and anonymity of the veteran callers.  As a proud cosponsor of H.4173, I believe it is critical that Congress ensures this emergency resource for our veterans struggling with PTSD or other mental health conditions is working as it should.

773,topic-id,469,"Mr.Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, our Nation is still faced with the epidemic of veteran suicide. And while the VA has made it a priority to address this problem, there are still many combat veterans left without access to VA mental healthcare services.  Here is what we know. An average of 20 veterans commit suicide daily. VA evidence suggests a decrease in suicide risk among those who have received VA healthcare services. In May 2017, the Government Accountability Office found that 62 percent of the over 91,000 servicemembers who were separated for misconduct from 2011 to 2015 had been diagnosed with PTSD, TBI, or other conditions that would be associated with misconduct.  Of those veterans, 23 percent, or 13,282, received an other than honorable discharge, leaving them without access to VA's critical mental healthcare services.  As a Marine Corps combat veteran, I like to live by the rule that we never leave anyone behind. Unfortunately, the military routinely used the other than honorable discharge to rid itself of combat veterans who were designated as having disciplinary problems and who often had documented medical histories of PTSD, rather than providing them with the treatment and rehabilitation they so desperately needed.  While the correlation between their mental health condition and minor misconduct could be linked, this fact made no difference to their character of discharge.  Mr.Speaker, my legislation, H.918, the Veteran Urgent Access to Mental Healthcare Act, seeks to correct this. Historically, a veteran with an other than honorable discharge has been able to seek VA care for a service-connected disability. However, due to the way these combat veterans were discharged and because of a failure to connect the dots between their minor misconduct and their mental health condition, the Department of Defense has failed to recognize this as a problem.  H.918 will stay with tradition and correct this disconnect by authorizing mental healthcare services for these other than honorably discharged combat veterans. This bill also requires an initial mental health assessment and directs the VA Secretary to establish a formal character of service determination process to trigger reviews of their discharges for potential eligibility for VA benefits.  Mr.Speaker, before the rate of veteran suicides increases any more, it is time to right this wrong and permanently authorize mental healthcare services for some of our Nation's most vulnerable veterans. When someone puts on the uniform, they take an oath to defend our freedoms. We, in turn, as a nation, promise to make sure they receive the care and the services they need after returning from the battlefield.  As we approach Veterans Day, I encourage my colleagues to keep that promise for these combat veterans with other than honorable discharges and to[[Page H8552]]support the passage of H.918. I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their support of this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8550.txt,1912,HENRY COUNTY COLLEGE,2017.0,7.0,November
887,topic-id,161,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017.  Under current law, VA healthcare providers must possess a current, unrestricted license issued by a State to practice medicine at a VA facility. However, VA providers are restricted from practicing telemedicine across State lines. This limits the VA's continued expansion of telemedicine and, as a result, reduces the accessibility of healthcare for so many veterans.  As technology continues to evolve and Congress considers what the VA of the 21st century should look like, there is no doubt that methods like telemedicine, coupled with more regulatory flexibility, are long overdue.  Geographical location in our country is no longer a challenge thanks to modern technology. VA healthcare providers should have the opportunity to practice telemedicine across State lines to provide medical advice to our veterans that is more timely and responsive to the patient's needs.

63,topic-id,499,"Mr.Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. However, I would like to point out the positive outcomes this bill would provide to the Hydropower industry. This bill would improve the administrative efficiency, accountability and transparency in the process of expanding hydropower generation. It would bring certainty and timeliness to the licensing process, that right now takes decades to move through. This bill would require other federal agencies to submit earlier any foreseeable issues that would prolong the licensing process, instead of waiting until the last hour as they are able to today.  With that said, H.3043 falls short in its treatment of tribal communities. I believe the proponents of this bill have worked in the best interest of Indian Country, but have unfortunately fallen short. First, this bill would overturn the D.Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Tacoma v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that held that the Department of the Interior has the mandatory authority to develop appropriate conditions to protect federal Indian reservations under the Federal Power Also, that FERC has no authority to reject these conditions because the Interior Department did not meet FERC's schedule. H.3043, would overturn this decision by allowing FERC to put a clock on other Federal agencies and force them to accommodate their schedule. For example, if the Interior Department misses the deadline then Tribal interests cannot be considered again until the next re-licensing opportunity at least 40 years later.  H.3043 does nothing to strengthen the tribal voice in the process and truncates our trustee agencies' responsibility. This bill would allow FERC to make the determination as to the scope of environmental review for 4(e) conditions, which the Interior Department is already required to give deference to.

3,topic-id,2398,"Mr.President, I rise today with my colleague from Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto, to introduce the Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's--or BOLD--I am pleased that Senator Capito and Senator Kaine are also joining us as original cosponsors.  Our legislation would create a public health infrastructure aimed at combating Alzheimer's disease and preserving brain health. Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest and most under-recognized public health threats of our time. Former Surgeon General David Satcher has said that it is the most under-recognized public health threat of the 21st century. Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, and that number will soar as our population continues to grow older and lives longer.  In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's is our Nation's most costly disease. The United States spends more than $259 billion per year, including $175 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs. The financial impact of this dreadful disease will only continue to grow. In fact, it is estimated that by the year 2050, Alzheimer's will cost our country $1 trillion and afflict 16 million  While Alzheimer's is the only one of our Nation's most deadly diseases without an effective treatment or cure, tantalizing new research suggests that there are steps we can take to promote prevention and improve treatment.  The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer's as a public health crisis. It is because of public health advancements that we have safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, interventions to quit smoking, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives. The effort to combat Alzheimer's disease requires a similar unified, national public health effort. That effort is gaining steam.  In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this devastating disease. In fact, people were afraid to even refer to the disease, just as years ago people did not talk about cancer.  Seven years ago, I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh the bipartisan National Alzheimer's Project Act, which set the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating the disease by the year 2025. That bill created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 billion in Federal funding per year is needed to achieve that goal.  On the Appropriations Committee, I have worked hard with Senator Blunt and others to turn the words of that recommendation into action. The funding bill for this year provides another $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, and that includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer's research--the largest in history. That brings the total for Alzheimer's research to $1.8 billion--well within reach of the $2 billion goal, which the experts tell us is necessary for breakthroughs.  While this research is moving forward, we must put into practice what we know and enhance the quality of care and support for those living with Alzheimer's and their families. In March, the Aging Committee, which I chair, held a hearing on the arc of Alzheimer's, from preventing cognitive decline to ensuring quality care for those living with dementia. The hearing shed light on the fact that although we do not yet know how to prevent Alzheimer's, we are advancing in our understanding of the disease. Its progression does not happen overnight; it is preceded by years and perhaps decades of changes in the brain and a continuum of changes in behavior, including cognitive decline. A growing body of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, such as regular physical activity and attention to heart health, may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. There is so much we have yet to know.  Alzheimer's is a public issue for those living with the disease, for those caring for their loved ones with the disease, for all of us as taxpayers, and for those who know that our brain is our most precious resource. Alzheimer's exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on families and communities. More than 40 million Americans know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver of a loved one facing a chronic disease like Alzheimer's.  The legislation we are introducing today would apply a new public health approach to Alzheimer's disease. It would establish Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice dedicated to promoting effective Alzheimer's disease management and caregiving interventions, as well as educating the public on the disease, cognitive decline, and brain health.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already doing tremendous work to combat Alzheimer's within the Public Health Road Map of the Healthy Brain This legislation would create centers of excellence across the country to implement the CDC's Public Health Road The centers would take a number of key steps against Alzheimer's. They would work to support early detection and diagnosis, lessen the risk of avoidable hospitalizations, reduce the risk of cognitive decline, enhance support to meet the needs of caregivers, reduce health disparities, and support care planning and management for those with the disease. The Centers' activities would support health and social services professionals as well as families and communities.  In addition to establishing the Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice, this bill would spread the opportunity for communities across America to create the necessary core capacity to combat Alzheimer's and to enhance existing efforts in this regard. The legislation would establish and distribute cooperative agreements to public health departments to support systems change, communications, and programmatic interventions. These agreements would also support the actions in the CDC Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health  Finally, at the heart of public health is data. This legislation would direct the CDC to collect data on cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, caregiving, and health disparities within its current systems. The bill would also create cooperative agreements for the analysis and reporting of data to ensure that the results are disseminated to the public and are used, ultimately, to improve brain health.  For far too long, we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as an aging issue that plagues our seniors today and threatens to affect many more tomorrow. In fact, the disease is far more than that.[[Page S7018]]It is a public health issue with a course that we can change. If we do not take action, both in this new public health approach and by continuing to build on the research, this disease will bankrupt the Medicare and the Medicaid We cannot afford to spend over $1 trillion in the year 2050 on just this one disease. We cannot afford to lose 16 million Americans by that year to this devastating disease. We cannot afford to allow the heartache and devastation of this disease to affect more and more American families.  There are steps that we can take today to prevent cognitive decline and to improve the lives of those who are living with Alzheimer's and the lives of their caregivers. This public health approach is not only empowering, but it is key to avoiding the terrible impacts that I have outlined.  After decades of expanding much needed biomedical research in Alzheimer's, we are ready for the next step--to translate research into policy. The BOLD bill would create a new, enlightened public policy out of promising research by creating the first ever national public health infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease.  I am pleased to say that the bipartisan bill that the Senator from Nevada and I have introduced, with our colleagues from Virginia and West Virginia, is endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, and the National Association of  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I urge my colleagues to support this critical and bipartisan legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.

The Alzheimer's      Association and AIM are pleased to support the bipartisan      Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for      Alzheimer's Act, which would create an Alzheimer's public      health infrastructure across the country to implement      effective Alzheimer's interventions focused on public health      issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,      reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.       More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's      and, without significant action, as many as 16 million      Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another      person develops the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050,      someone in the United States will develop the disease every      33 seconds. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's      costs to increase from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to      $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs      threaten to bankrupt families, businesses and our health care      system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.       As scientists continue to search for a way to prevent,      cure, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's through medical      research, public health plays an important role in promoting      cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive      decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health      response will help create population-level change, achieve a      higher quality of life for those living with the disease and      their caregivers, and reduce associated costs. The BOLD      Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would provide this crucial      investment by establishing Alzheimer's centers of excellence      across the country and funding state, local and tribal public      health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis,      reduce risk, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, reduce      health disparities, support the needs of caregivers and      support care planning for people living with the disease.      These important public health actions allow individuals with      Alzheimer's to live in their homes longer and delay costly      institutionalized care. These goals are consistent with the      National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes      a strategy to ``work with state, tribal, and local      governments to improve coordination and identify model      initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease and related      dementias awareness and readiness across the government.''       The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would also      increase the collection, analysis and timely reporting of      Alzheimer's data. This data is critical to identifying      opportunities for public health interventions, helping      stakeholders track progress in the public health response,      and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed      decisions when developing plans and policies. Finally, the      bill would also strengthen implementation of the Center for      Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Road Map,      which includes strategic action items for state and local      public health departments and their partners to promote      cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment and help      meet the needs of care partners.       The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your      continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with      Alzheimer's and other dementias.

963,topic-id,648,"Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to acknowledge the response of our communities and Federal agencies to the recent hurricanes and wildfires. I would like to first offer my thoughts and prayers to families affected by these tragedies.  The USDA and FNS play a vital role in providing supplemental nutrition assistance when disasters occur by coordinating with State, local, and voluntary organizations. Nothing is more important that providing food when people find themselves suddenly, and often critically, in need following disaster-related emergencies.  FNS has worked tirelessly to provide nutrition assistance to those affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the Western Our fellow citizens in Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, California, and Oregon have received assistance including automatic mass replacement of benefits, D-SNAP, free school meals, and waivers, ultimately ensuring people have enough to eat in their time of need.  As Secretary Perdue has said, each disaster situation is unique. The USDA and FNS have demonstrated their ability to respond to each of these unique situations in a timely and effective way.  The challenges facing our communities ravaged by hurricanes and wildfires are unprecedented. Getting food on the table in a timely manner should not be an additional challenge. I want to recognize the fortitude of our fellow citizens as they come together to rebuild after such devastation as well as acknowledge the USDA's diligence in addressing the nutrition-related needs of our fellow citizens.  Mr.Madam Speaker, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--[[Page H8657]]known as SNAP--provides modest food assistance benefits to families in need. The program helps to alleviate hunger, reduce poverty, and improve nutrition across our country on an ongoing basis.  SNAP is also designed to help families put food on the table when disaster strikes. In response to recent hurricanes, fires, floods, and storms, officials at the United States Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA FNS) have worked with other federal and state emergency response agencies to ensure those impacted by disasters have access to food.  Flexibilities in SNAP, for example, allow states to issue SNAP benefits early to ensure recipients can stock up on food before a disaster hits.  In many cases, SNAP recipients impacted by disaster and power outages are able to request additional benefits to replace food they lost, and in certain circumstances, are able to use their SNAP benefits to purchase hot foods if they lost power and are unable to cook.  Disaster SNAP, known as D-SNAP, is a key feature of the program that provides nutrition assistance benefits to families in major disaster areas who aren't currently receiving benefits. Importantly, D-SNAP also provides families currently enrolled in SNAP with supplemental benefits to help them get by in the wake of disaster.  In addition to SNAP, other federal anti-hunger safety net programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), child nutrition programs, and Disaster Household Distribution (DHD) come to the aid of those recovering from disaster.  For example, schools in areas affected by disaster can provide meals to all kids at no charge and can be more flexible in where and when they serve meals.  DHD is another program to allow food banks and other organizations to distribute emergency food boxes filled with nutritious food to people that don't have access to feeding sites or grocery stores in the aftermath of disaster.  Madam Speaker, when disasters hit the United States--and its territories--it is imperative that our government effectively and efficiently helps those impacted by these terrible tragedies.  SNAP and our other nutrition programs are a key component of disaster response efforts, providing food to families in need. In the aftermath of recent tragedies that devastated Puerto Rico, the U.Virgin Islands, Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, California, and Oregon, USDA was able to respond.  I'd like to thank my friend and colleague on the Agriculture Committee, the Chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8652.txt,1805,1115,2017.0,8.0,November

SENSE OF       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) foreign investment provides substantial economic      benefits to the United States, including the promotion of      economic growth, productivity, competitiveness, and job      creation, and the majority of foreign investment transactions      pose little or no risk to the national security of the United      States, especially when those investments are truly passive      in nature;       (2) maintaining the commitment of the United States to open      and fair investment policy also encourages other countries to      reciprocate and helps open new foreign markets for United      States businesses and their products;       (3) it should continue to be the policy of the United      States to enthusiastically welcome and support foreign      investment, consistent with the protection of national      security;       (4) at the same time, the national security landscape has      shifted in recent years, and so have the nature of the      investments that pose the greatest potential risk to national      security, which warrants a modernization of the processes and      authorities of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the      United States;       (5) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United      States plays a critical role in protecting the national      security of the United States, and, therefore, it is      essential that the member agencies of the Committee are      adequately resourced and able to hire appropriately qualified      individuals in a timely manner, and that those individuals'      security clearances are processed as a high priority;       (6) the President should conduct a more robust      international outreach effort to urge and help allies and      partners of the United States to establish processes that      parallel the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United      States to screen foreign investments for national security      risks and to facilitate coordination; and       (7) the President should lead a collaborative effort with      allies and partners of the United States to develop a new,      stronger multilateral export control regime, aimed to address      the unprecedented industrial policies of certain countries of      special concern, including aggressive efforts to acquire      United States technology, and the blending of civil and      military programs.     3.

355,topic-id,914,"Mr.President, I come before this body a second day in a row to talk about an event that the Senator from Connecticut has been referring to that has shocked all of us. It has rattled us to the very core and shocked the conscience of the entire  I didn't get a chance to hear everything he said about this today, but I was encouraged to hear him make comments about fixing the background check system, which I think failed us terribly here, and it failed, of course, the 26 people who lost their lives and the 20 more who were injured in this terrible shooting in Sutherland Springs, TX, during a Sunday morning church service at First Baptist  Of course, at times like these, we need to respect the right and the need of people to mourn and to grieve their loss and to express our solidarity with those families who were torn apart. One woman who has lived in Sutherland Springs for nearly 70 years described the community as a place where ``everybody knew everybody.'' She said that before Sunday, most people didn't even keep their doors locked because the town never experienced any significant crime. Well, now that has changed.  Sutherland Springs has suffered at the hands of a man whom initial reports have described as having a known history of violence, a man whose victims included his own grandmother-in-law as well as the visiting pastor of the church. No community finds it easy to deal with unexpected heartbreaking[[Page S7037]]losses like this, but the fact that this crime involved so many tightly knit friends and neighbors and occurred in a house of worship on a Sunday morning and harmed so many innocent children makes the task much harder.  As each new detail emerges from what is still an ongoing investigation, we need to study the whole puzzle and ask ourselves how this happened, why so many lives were lost, and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent it. We know, for example, that the gunman was court-martialed by the Air Force and convicted of seriousness domestic abuse, fracturing the skull of his own son. Under the relevant Federal law, the Gun Control Act of 1968, this should have prohibited him from ever purchasing a gun in the first place, but we know it didn't in this instance. This critically important information from the suspect's criminal history was not uploaded into the relevant background check databases even though a Federal law clearly requires that it be done.  Finally and most troublingly, we know what happened next: Mr.Kelley unlawfully purchased four firearms after passing Federal background checks that did not turn up his Air Force convictions. Of course, the shooter lied on his paperwork. He was asked about these convictions--that is part of the background check system--but because there was no record of it, he was able to lie his way into getting these firearms. This is very clearly a problem, and the Air Force has now admitted that Kelley's convictions should have barred him from ever purchasing or possessing firearms. What appears to have happened is that the records of the convictions were not uploaded into the National Instant Criminal Background Check They are required to be uploaded by Federal law already.  There are still some questions to sift through, but I plan to introduce legislation--and I would be happy to work with my colleague from Connecticut--to ensure that all Federal Departments and Agencies, including the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction records into the national database. This legislation will also encourage, to the greatest extent possible under the Constitution, State and local governments to do the same. We can make the Federal Agencies do it. We can only request that the States do it, as the Senator from Connecticut pointed out earlier, and their record of compliance is lousy. It is lousy.  Justice Department records indicate that some Federal Agencies and State governments are failing to comply with the Federal law. According to the Department of Justice, the number of these records that are actually uploaded is staggeringly low. That is unacceptable, and it must change.  What is important to note, though, is that when the dust settles, the appropriate answers won't necessarily be the easy ones. The fact remains that under existing law, this atrocity should have been prevented. This gunman should not have been allowed to purchase firearms and should have been arrested when he tried to do so. We need to better understand why our existing laws didn't work in this instance, and that is what my proposed legislation will do. After analyzing the problem, we will try to ensure that everyone is complying with the law.  In 2015, I introduced legislation called the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act that addressed a related issue: the failure of State and local authorities to upload valuable mental health records into the NICS background check database. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to work together with anybody who is willing to meet these problems head-on.  Right now, we need time and clarity. We need to know and continue to study the facts. Then, as we have already started to do, we need to consider all existing laws and regulations, both State and Federal, in light of this new information.  Mr.President, I know we are coming up on a deadline. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 5 minutes.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.

356,topic-id,479,"Mr.President, as we wait for additional details, I want to say a few more words about the strong community of Sutherland Springs, one just 35 miles from my hometown of San Antonio, TX, where I grew up.  First Baptist Church, where the shooting occurred, has served as a mainstay in the town since 1926. It is the site of church services every Sunday, weddings, social gatherings, and even some funerals. We hope the First Baptist Church can bounce back from this tragedy, and I am confident they can because faith, hope, and love can never be extinguished no matter the depravity, the evil that tries.  We are not sure what will happen to the building or the congregation itself, but no matter what, the unique spirit of this community will no doubt endure. I am hopeful that the town of Sutherland Springs will come back too. If people like Stephen Willeford are any indication, it will. Stephen, of course, is the plumber who managed to hit the gunman through a gap in his body armor. He was joined by Johnnie In a truck, the two chased the gunman at high speeds for 11 miles into neighboring Guadalupe What these two men displayed is that in the worst circumstances, we won't let evil have its way. We won't let sick individuals like this shooter escape the consequences of their crimes. Strangers will come together and act quickly and courageously to defend the communities they love and in which they live.  Today I join Governor Abbott, my colleagues--Senator Cruz and Representative Henry Cuellar, in whose House district this occurred--and so many other Texans in once again pledging my support to the people of Sutherland I send my thoughts and prayers to those who lost parents, children, friends, and relatives in this unbelievable act of evil.  The biggest danger, though, is that we become numb and we just simply move on to other matters. We can't let that happen. As Sherry Pomeroy, the wife of the pastor at First Baptist, said yesterday, ``Please don't forget Sutherland Springs.'' And when we hear people ask us to do something about terrible tragedies like this, let's do what we can, working together in a bipartisan way, to fix the holes in what is already the law, which says that people like this shooter should never have gotten their hands on a firearm in the first place. But either through human error or some failure of the background check system, he was able to do so. We need to fix that, and hopefully, in doing so, we can bring some small sense of justice to the people who lost so much last Sunday in Sutherland Springs,  I yield back the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING Without objection, all time is yielded back.  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Gibson nomination?

1040,topic-id,1412,"Mr.President, today we join the stunned community of Sutherland Springs, TX--a small town near San Antonio--in mourning the loss of too many innocent lives. One innocent life is too many.  I listened to the impassioned comments of our colleague from New York asking us to do something, but I actually think it is important we understand exactly what did happen, and once the fog of this terrible tragic event lifts, after the law enforcement agencies can do the appropriate investigation, then I think it is appropriate for us to ask: What can we do, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States--what can we do to make something like this less likely?  I wish I was optimistic there was some magic wand we could wave and that we could prevent terrible tragedies like this, but in a free and open society, unfortunately, we don't have that magic wand.  On the other hand, we have arrived at a consensus, I think, in this country, that background checks, for example, are appropriate for people suffering from mental illness, people who committed previous felonies. Those people are banned from possessing or purchasing firearms, and there is a consensus that they should be banned.  There are some early reports--and, again, the fog of this terrible tragedy has not yet lifted. We need clarity in order to know what did and did not happen and where we might be able to act to make a difference. There is some indication by some news reports that this individual had committed domestic violence and had been convicted of that by a court-martial. That, too, would likely have been a disqualifying factor in his ability to possess or purchase firearms. So we need to know exactly what the facts are.  I appreciate the passion of our colleague from New We are all stunned by what happened, but I think being rational people, we ought to want to know exactly what the facts are before we decide what the best course of action might be. It may be that, like we saw a few years back at Virginia Tech, an individual who had previously been adjudicated mentally ill, that determination, that judgment was not entered into the National Instant Background Checks System run by the FBI, and because it wasn't--because of a failure of communication between the State and Federal authorities--he was able to purchase a firearm when he was legally disqualified from being able to do so.  So those are the sorts of things I think we could work together on. I know, for example, after the terrible shooting in Las Vegas, I was shocked, like so many others were, that somebody could essentially bypass the prohibition against making a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic weapon by the use of the so-called bump stock. As somebody who enjoys the outdoors and is a hunter and enjoys recreational shooting, I can tell you I know of no sportsman, no hunter, who uses a bump stock. It seems to me the sole purpose of this is to bypass the prohibition about turning semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons. That is something I hope the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue to look into and determine whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms ought to be extended the authority to regulate the so-called bump stocks.  Back when President Obama was President of the United States, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms said they did not believe they had the authority, but several of us have written to them and asked them to clarify for us just where they think they do have authority and where they feel they need additional authority so we can work with them, hopefully, to prevent terrible tragedies like that from occurring in the future.  Yesterday we all received the news that a gunman opened fire on parishioners at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, killing at least 26 people during the Sunday morning church service. I can't imagine a more vulnerable time. People were sitting in the pews with their heads bowed and their eyes closed and then were exposed to this madman unleashing death in that house of worship. The victims included young children and a pregnant woman, among others. All 26 of them are now gone, aged 18 months to 72 years old.  This small community and an entire Nation must now bind its wounds as we mourn the dead and meet the face of evil with moral clarity and a newfound determination to stem the violence that continues to plague the United States of the  We saw in New York that somebody used a vehicle--a car--to mow down people and to kill people as an act of terrorism.  We are vulnerable in so many ways because we are an open society. Unfortunately, these sorts of tragedies seem to come back to us time and again, and we in Texas are not immune.  We remember the knife attack at the University of Texas in Austin earlier this year. We remember the shooting of police officers in downtown Dallas last year, where five police officers perished, and at Fort Hood in 2009. Each of[[Page S7008]]these events has been shocking, inexplicable, and, certainly, reprehensible.  This tragedy may be the worst of all. That this event occurred in a house of worship makes it all the more grotesque and despicable. Hymns of praise were silenced, and those led to cries for help.  The shooting in Sutherland Springs has been called the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history. It is perhaps better understood by the words of one man whose mother and father were both killed yesterday. He was sitting on the curb, outside the emergency room, at Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, a town nearby. Shaken to the core, he called the events of yesterday ``unimaginable.'' It is impossible to comprehend what it must have felt like to wake up this morning in Sutherland Springs--a small, tight-knit, rural community that is roughly 35 miles southeast of San Antonio--with so many neighbors lost and the sound of yesterday's gunfire and sirens still ringing in the air.  One of the people who lost her life was Crystal Holcombe, who died with her unborn child and several relatives. Another was Annabelle Pomeroy, a shy 14-year-old girl, whose uncle describes her as an ``angel in the flesh.''  We know, thankfully, that two Good Samaritans turned on and pursued the shooter and may have prevented this nightmare from lasting even longer. We are grateful for the heroism and the quick decisive action of these two men. We know that about 20 injured remain in hospitals, including a 5-year-old, Ryland Ward, who was shot multiple times.  Yesterday I spoke with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt, Jr., and offered not only my condolences but my unequivocal and complete support. Sheriff Tackitt said that the bloody scene inside First Baptist was horrific, but that the response to the tragedy was instantaneous. First responders from the surrounding area, as well as State and Federal officials, inundated Sutherland Springs with logistical resources and personnel, offering their love and compassion, as well--a proud display of what I often see, which is an attitude that being a Texan doesn't describe just where you are from. It describes who your family is.  Today I join the sheriff, as well as Governor Abbott, and my friend Representative Henry Cuellar, in whose congressional district this tragedy occurred, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Cruz, and so many other Texans in asking God for healing and for understanding.  We know the investigation into exactly what happened and why is ongoing, and it is important that we allow this investigation to be completed so we can know what happened and exactly what we might be able to do to prevent tragedies like this from occurring in the future.  I hope that Texans who call Sutherland Springs and First Baptist Church home will soon have some answers. I send my thoughts and prayers to those who lost parents, children, friends, and relatives in this outrageous and inhuman act. I hope each of us will pledge to be a light in the darkness. To the families whose lives are forever changed by this atrocity, let us provide a strong shoulder of support.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1079,topic-id,1737,"Mr.President, as the world now knows, there was a tragic shooting in Sutherland Springs, TX, last Sunday, which took the lives of 26 innocent people and injured 20 more. On Monday evening there was a prayer vigil for those victims. The community gathered to pray and to pay their respects to the deceased.  There are two people in particular who were in attendance, whom I want to highlight: Stephen Willeford and Johnnie I mentioned them yesterday, and perhaps you have seen them on the news, but I have been thinking a lot about them lately. In addition to the tragedy, this was really one of the things that gives you a little hope amidst the terrible circumstances. Stephen, of course, is the man who responded to the shooter's rampage by grabbing his rifle and running toward the First Baptist Johnnie drove the truck that chased the gunman down at high speed. In typical Texas fashion, these two gentlemen don't consider themselves to be heroes, but I consider them to be heroes. They said that they were just doing what needed to be done. Johnnie said it was an ``act now, ask questions later'' kind of deal.  I think we in Washington should take more of our cues from people like Johnnie and We should show courage, track down anything that is not right, and do our very best to fix it. In particular, Stephen Willeford--maybe you have to be a Texan or an Alaskan to really appreciate what he did. From what I have read, he was an NRA-certified shooting instructor. He apparently heard the shooting at the church, grabbed his gun and went there and, basically, ended up stopping the shooter from killing more people.  The shooter apparently had accumulated enough ammunition to do a lot more damage than he did, but, thanks to the intervention of this concerned citizen, this person who was willing to put himself in harm's way actually shot the shooter and discouraged him from doing more. But for his actions, a lot more people would have died on that terrible, terrible  The police can't be everywhere all of the time. That is one reason why, in my State and around the country, we believe that citizens ought to be able to defend themselves under appropriate circumstances.  We now know that the gunman was court-martialed by the Air Force and convicted of serious domestic abuse. Under current Federal law, this should have prohibited him from ever purchasing a firearm. The fact that it didn't means that we need to figure out why Federal law wasn't followed and make darn sure that the relevant information is always uploaded into the background check databases.  There were multiple errors--human and systematic errors--that should have prevented this shooter from ever buying a firearm. He unlawfully purchased four firearms that he wasn't permitted to purchase. Federal background checks did not turn up his Air Force conviction for domestic violence, a felony, for fracturing the skull of his infant stepson. These convictions were not uploaded on the NICS Federal database.  I plan to introduce legislation--and I have been talking to a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are interested in providing a solution to this problem, but we are going to introduce legislation to ensure that all Federal departments and agencies, including the Department of Defense, upload the required conviction records. My legislation will also encourage to the greatest extent possible under the Constitution that State and local governments do the same.  We all remember the terrible shooting that occurred at Virginia Tech a few years ago by a person who had already been adjudicated to be mentally ill by the State, but because the State did not upload that information into the Federal database when he went to buy a firearm, there was no hit, no disqualifier that appeared that would have prevented him from buying that[[Page S7079]]firearm in the first place. We need to make sure those systems work every time.  What Sutherland Springs has exposed is that the Federal Government is failing to comply with reporting requirements. This is unacceptable, and it must change.  Yesterday, David Goldfein, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, came by my office, and I am grateful to him for that. I told him that it must have been one of his worst days when he found out that the Air Force had failed to notify the Federal authorities of the information that would have disqualified this individual from buying a firearm. He appropriately expressed grave concern over the fact that the gunman's convictions were not sent to the NICS database. He pledged to get to the root of the problem, and I believe him.  It is worth noting that we have tried to address similar problems before, and we can do it again. In 2015, I introduced a bill called the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act, which addressed a related issue, and that was the failure of State and local authorities to upload valuable mental health records into this same NICS database.  I think there is a bipartisan willingness in this Chamber to work on problems inherent in the sharing of these records, and I hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this new legislation once it is introduced. We are shooting for the first part of next week. We owe it to the men and women and the families of Sutherland Springs to make sure that our laws are enforced and that individuals like this shooter with a history of violence do not gain illegal access to firearms.                               Tax Reform  Mr.President, I want to address the work that the House Ways and Means Committee is currently engaged in and what we will be doing in the U.Senate to reform our overly complex, burdensome, and self-destructive tax system. I think there is a lot of momentum gathering each day.  Yesterday, Senator McConnell, the majority leader, commented on our once-in-a-generation opportunity to overhaul our Tax To accomplish this goal, both the House and the Senate are moving forward on different proposals.  This week, the House Ways and Means Committee completed its first 2 days of discussing the House bill unveiled last week called the Tax Cuts and Jobs At the same time, the Senate Finance Committee is continuing its work too. Chairman Hatch will continue to guide the committee through an open process, and members will have the chance to engage in productive discussions and debate. That will start once the chairman's mark or the base bill is released, hopefully by later this week. Perhaps as early as next week, we will begin the process in the Senate Finance Committee of marking up that bill, with Senators offering amendments and voting on it. Once both Houses of Congress have completed their work, my hope is that we can get this bill on the President's desk by  Some of our colleagues across the aisle, instead of contributing to the solution to this overly complex and self-destructive Tax Code, have been lobbing insults from their partisan bunkers, even though many of them have endorsed many aspects of the plans in years past. For example, early on, interestingly, there was criticism of our desire to make our global tax system more competitive so that more businesses will move their manufacturing facilities back to the United States and so that we can stamp more of their products ``Made in America,'' creating more jobs here. It is ironic because they were criticizing us for giving tax relief to businesses when people like President Barack Obama, back in 2011, had endorsed the very same concept, not to mention the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, and Senator All of them have endorsed similar proposals, yet they were quick to criticize us for doing exactly the same things that they themselves had previously endorsed. Unfortunately, our Democratic friends are quick to criticize our plans not just because they disagree with them on the merits but simply because it is our proposal and they are not interested in working with us across party lines.  This is really a shame and a lost opportunity. People are crying out for Democrats and Republicans to work together in the best interests of the country. Unfortunately, our Democratic friends are simply ignoring the urgency of the situation--the stagnation of American workers' wages and couples finding it harder to start families or, once they do, pay for a college education. As my friend the junior Senator from Florida, Senator Rubio, wrote a few days ago in the New York Times, it is more than time to reconcile ``our social contract to the realities that working families face.''  The Tax Code has not been comprehensively overhauled since 1986. Now that some of us are trying to, the swamp is fighting back. It is important that we win this fight against the swamp--the special interest groups that try to come in and protect various special-interest tax provisions that make our code unnecessarily complicated, forcing us to look for additional revenue from other sources because they want to protect theirs at the expense of the rest of the country.  But the do-nothing approach of the recent past will not work. We can't let them stop us because hard-working families are waiting. They are waiting on us to quit stuffing our own pockets and start putting money back into theirs.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

Mr.Chair, I rise in support of H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization  Mr.Chair, I believe, and I think others do as well who have had experiences within their constituencies, within their congressional districts, that the hydro relicensing process is plainly broken, plain and simple.  Let me give you a couple of real-life examples of why this legislation is needed, and why it is needed now. They both provide energy in my district for the people in the San Joaquin Valley, for households, for farmers, and for people in the valley, and they are the same two examples that Congressman Denham spoke of a moment ago.  The Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts have worked through the licensing process in good faith for more than 8 years, and they have spent over $30 million to renew the license for Don Pedro Dam, a facility that has been in operation for almost 40 years. The districts estimate that, when they are finished with this process, they will have spent almost $50 million.  Meanwhile, the Merced Irrigation District, my constituency, has spent over 10 years and $20 million to relicense the Exchequer Hydroelectric project. This process is still not finished. This facility has been in operation for over 60 years.  Since these are public agencies, these costs are passed on to the ratepayers in mostly small, rural communities that Congressman Denham and I represent. It raises their electric costs. It makes no sense.  This is about maintaining clean, renewable energy. This is about reducing the regulatory burden and not passing these costs on to the ratepayers. Given the experience that I have just given you, my constituents believe that, frankly, this bill could go further in removing inefficiencies in the relicensing[[Page H8621]]process, but it is a good first step.

198,topic-id,974,"Mr.Speaker, it has been just about 100 hours since the House Republican leadership released their tax plan finally, not only to the American people, but also to their own rank and file  I represent a great district, it is eastern Connecticut, it is about half the State geographically, and it is home to the University of Connecticut, Electric Boat shipyard, Groton Navy base, Coast Guard I am very proud of the fact that these are really sharp folks, and in that less than 100-hour period, I have had about 700 emails and calls into my office from people who have looked at this plan, have run the numbers, have looked at what the existing Tax Code provides, and looked at what the net impact will be if this plan were ever to become law.  Louis from Norwich, Connecticut, who is a tax preparer, describes a neighbor of his who is 68 years old, she lives by herself, she earns $33,000 in pension and Social Security income, only of which $21,000 is taxable, and she has a small mortgage.  She looked at the Republican tax plan, which includes a standard deduction of $12,500, and that is it. Her new tax will be $1,014 if that plan were to go into effect.  Under existing law, the itemized deductions that she can claim today are roughly about $12,500, the same amount as the standard deduction, but she is also able to claim a personal exemption, which every American is entitled to under the existing Tax With that existing plan, her net taxes are $445. So this tax plan will more than double her taxes.  Now, $33,000 a year for a 68-year-old, I would say that is barely middle class, but certainly it is middle class under a lot of definitions as a homeowner, yet this tax plan is increasing her taxes by over 100 percent.  Mark from Clinton contacted me about the fact that this tax plan is going to eliminate the deduction for qualified medical expenses above 10 percent of your adjusted gross income. What does that mean? If you have got medical expenses for eyeglasses, hearing aids, or you have someone in a nursing home that you are paying out-of-pocket expenses for, or you have a home healthcare aide coming into your home that is not covered under your insurance, you can deduct that off of your taxes to the extent that it exceeds 10 percent of your adjusted gross income.  Mark from Clinton is one of those people. Clinton, Connecticut, is a very middle class community. His taxes are going up.  That qualified medical deduction, again, is something that was repeated over and over from individuals who contacted my office, who can't believe that, again, they are doing the right thing, they are paying their bills for their healthcare--for themselves or for their kids or for their aunt or their parent--and they are losing that deduction. I am sorry. The standard deduction that is being offered as a compensation doesn't come close to helping an individual in that situation.  In addition, the State tax deduction, which the present Tax Code allows, is gone under this proposal. In the State of Connecticut, they have calculated that families that earn between $50,000 and $200,000 a year will see their taxes increase by 14 percent under this proposal.  So, Mr.Speaker, we are talking about a plan which was sold to the country as a tax cut for the middle class. Again, there are lots of other economic incentives that they put in there supposedly for corporations to cut their corporate tax rate and cut the rates for people in the top 1 percent. Again, it is totally imbalanced, but I am going to set that aside for the moment, because what was also guaranteed and promised was that middle class Americans would see their taxes going down, people like Louis from Norwich; Mark from Clinton; and Jason from Niantic, who is going to lose his college student loan interest rate deduction.  They eliminate the college student loan interest rate reduction. Again, we are living in a time right now where student loan debt is $1.3 trillion. One of[[Page H8500]]the few ways that you can manage that debt is being able to deduct it off of your taxes. That is being eliminated under the House Republican plan.  Now, if I sound a little worked up, it is because, literally, within minutes, the House Ways and Means Committee is going to start marking up this bill. Not one hearing is being held for outside voices to sort of at least crunch through the numbers of this proposal. The plan is for Speaker Ryan to force a vote next week. We are talking less than 10 days for rewriting the U.Tax Code, which has not been rewritten since 1986.  When it was done under President Reagan, it took a year for the process to unfold, and that was the right way to do it, to allow the subcommittees to take a look at their provisions of the Tax Code on the Ways and Means Committee, to hold hearings, to actually have an intelligent, thoughtful exchange of ideas before you mark it up, rather than jamming it to the floor, when you are taking away people's qualified medical expenses. Again, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  The deduction that people get for dependent care assistance programs--if you have a kid who is developmentally disabled and needs a personal care attendant in your home right now, you can deduct that--that is being taken away.  This is a bad plan. We need to slow down; we need to give the American people a chance to understand this better. Again, I call on the Ways and Means Committee to, again, slow down and cancel the markups that are scheduled this week.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgH8499-4.txt,1836,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,6.0,November
280,topic-id,332,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her condolences and her prayers for Sutherland  Mr.Speaker, I also thank Mr.Byrne and, of course, Chairman Foxx, for their work on this particular bill. I thank Mr.Correa, Mr.Peterson, and the other supporters of this legislation.  Prior to August 2015, the joint employer standard used by the NLRB[[Page H8571]]made it easy to understand who is and who is not a joint employer. For decades, a joint employer relationship existed when one company exercised ``direct and immediate'' control over another company's workforce.  However, as you know, under the case Browning-Ferris Industries, the NLRB departed from many years of legal precedent in August of 2015 by establishing a new, expanded joint employer standard. This standard could trigger employer liability by a company exercising vaguely defined indirect control over an employee.  We have heard from local businesses from my district and across the State of Texas, and it is clear that this decision is causing them significant confusion.  In my district--let's say in Laredo, Texas, there is a local restaurant owner who says that his restaurant currently employs close to 1,000 local employees.                              {time}  1700  This expanded joint employer standard has limited his investment in his business and the number of workers that he has. Reverting back to the former joint employer standard that we had for so many years would allow him to hire the employees that he needs to hire and reinvest money.  This new expanded standard makes it difficult for local franchisees like this one in Laredo to offer the employer relationship support from franchisers for the fear that these benefits could be used against them in a joint employer lawsuit.  Those fears are well founded. For example, the Progressive Policy Institute, known for its pragmatic ideas, says that the expansion of this joint employer doctrine ``may do more harm than good.''  This is why I am supporting this legislation. We are asking that it revert back to the legal standard that we used for many years.

Yesterday morning, a gunman stormed into a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a small town of about 400 or 500 individuals, and brutally murdered 26 innocent lives, including at least 12 children, marking the worst shooting in Texas history.  Today we grieve the horrific loss of dozens of innocent people. We pray for the victims' families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.  I have spoken personally with Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt, County Commissioner Albert Gamez, and other citizens of that area to assist in any way that we can.  In the coming hours and days, we will learn more about the victims of this tragedy, their names, their faces, their stories, the joy they brought their families and their friends.  We are fully committed to helping Sutherland Springs recover from this senseless tragedy, and we ask every Member of Congress to join us to support this recovery.

1043,topic-id,442,"Madam President, today the U.House of Representatives begins marking up H.1, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and as the U.Senate continues to debate tax cuts, I am reminded of a speech that former Democratic President John Kennedy delivered in New York City in 1962. In fact, it was in December of 1962, when he said:       In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too      high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way      to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates      now. The experience of a number of European countries and      Japan have borne this out. This country's own experience with      tax reduction in 1954 has borne this out. And the reason is      that only full employment can balance the budget, and tax      reduction can pave the way to that employment. The purpose of      cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to      achieve the more prosperous, expanding economy which can      bring a budget surplus.  President Kennedy went on to say:       I repeat: our practical choice is not between a tax-cut      deficit and a budgetary surplus. It is between two kinds of      deficits: a chronic deficit of inertia, as the unwanted      result of inadequate revenues and a restricted economy; or a      temporary deficit of transition, resulting from a tax cut      designed to boost the economy, increase tax revenues, and      achieve--and I believe this can be done--a budget surplus.      The first type of deficit is a sign of waste and weakness;      the second reflects an investment in the future.  If someone had just tuned in, they might think I was quoting, perhaps, President Reagan or perhaps some other Republican leader. This was President John Kennedy in 1962.  We need to cut taxes once again and put money back into the pockets of the American people. I can state that Montanans need more jobs, but, importantly, we need better paying jobs. Most importantly, they need bigger paychecks. The best way to give Montanans a pay raise--how about cutting their taxes? We need tax cuts.                       Texas Church Mass Shooting  Madam President, separately, I just want to express my sincere and heartfelt sympathies to the people of Sutherland Springs, What a devastating turn of events there--men, women, and children showing up for worship on a Sunday in a church.

This museum is squarely focused on telling the personal stories of those who have served, including those who have lost their lives serving our country. The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will be the only one of its kind that uses personal belongings, letters, and memories to bring the stories of our servicemembers and their families to life.  In addition to world class interactive exhibits that will serve to educate the next generation about the value of military service, this project will also be connected to an online database featuring the collection.  The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will also serve to honor our men and women in uniform by providing space for celebrations, and veterans ceremonies and reunions.  Ohio has a proud history of honoring our Nation's veterans and supporting our current men and women in uniform. Ohio is home to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the National Museum of the United States Air Force, and was recently selected as the United States Veterans Affairs National It is fitting that Ohio should be the place for telling these stories.

569,topic-id,642,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Virgin Islands for her leadership on this issue and for making it a priority and giving it the urgency that those under TPS status deserve.  Mr.Speaker, first of all, of course, I want to extend my condolences to the families whose loved ones were murdered in Sutherland Springs, Texas, while attending worship service.  I also extend my condolences to my colleague from Texas, Eddie Bernice Johnson, who is mourning the death of her sister.  Mr.Speaker, after college--it was a lot of years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday--I worked as a social worker, working with families in need of emergency services, in need of shelter, in need of food, and in need of medical care. I also worked with foster care children.  Mr.Speaker, you may know that I also spent over 20 years as a law enforcement officer. As such, the preservation of human life was my number one priority. Saving lives was first. But then we also wanted to improve the quality of life for persons living and working in our community.  Mr.Speaker, the quality of life matters also. That is what we are here to talk about tonight as Members of Congress: improving the quality of life for families who desperately need our help.  Approximately 50,000 Haitians hold TPS status, and 32,500 of them live in 18,800 U.S.-born children in Florida have Haitian parents who are TPS holders.  How did we get here, Mr.Speaker?  As you know, an earthquake--not planned, not expected--left thousands dead and resulted in the total collapse of Port-au-Prince's infrastructure. A few years before the earthquake, I participated in a mission trip to Port-au-Prince, We worked with children and families from a local church in Port-au-Prince, That church was totally destroyed by the earthquake.  The earthquake displaced 1.5 million Haitians within their own country, destroyed more than 100,000 homes, and damaged nearly 200,000 more. The number of schools that were destroyed in Port-au-Prince alone is unbelievable. Over 55,000 Haitians who lost their homes in the earthquake are still living in 31 camps for internally displaced persons, unable to leave.  We are here tonight to talk about improving the quality of life for persons, for families, who desperately need our help.                              {time}  2015  This crisis is not over. In April of this year, heavy rains caused flooding and landslides. According to the Haitian officials, an estimated 80 percent of spring harvest may have been destroyed.  This crisis is not over. Since September of 2016, damage from Hurricane Matthew and recent rains have compounded food insecurity experienced by an estimated 3.2 million people in Haiti, not to mention the devastation caused by Irma and Hurricane Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis that already existed, placing 2.4 million Haitians, 32 percent of the population, in the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.  Mr.Speaker, forcing the return of 50,000 people to Haiti would disrupt any meaningful effort to recover. As you know, in May, the Department of Homeland Security redesignated Haiti for 6 months of temporary protective status rather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of DHS' decision, obviously, did not reflect the reality on the ground.  Regardless of how you might feel about the policy, TPS holders are perhaps the most vetted, legally present, and work-authorized community in our country. They have submitted to numerous criminal background checks every 18 months. Americans with temporary protective status are hardworking individuals who are contributing to our economy, our communities, and our industries. Just check the numbers.  Mr.Speaker, the only strategic and humane decision is to fully extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23 deadline. Working to improve the quality of life for families who desperately need our help, that is the promise of America, and I pray that America keeps its promise.

I reject the notion that we have to rob Peter to pay Paul or, in this instance, jeopardize the future of Medicare and steal $6 billion from critical prevention programs to pay for children's healthcare.

I'm not worried about whether wealthy families can be able to afford to pay for increased Medicare premiums, but I am worried that these changes will result in wealthy people abandoning the program in large numbers, which would worsen the risk pool and ultimately increase the costs for middle- and lower-income seniors. It would fracture completely the universal nature of Medicare and put the entire program at risk. It is an unwise proposal that should be rejected.

So low is it on their priority list that they let the law expire. Three States have already required emergency funding, and 400,000 Texas children are at risk if this program is not continued.  In the face of this crisis, their response is: We won't put another new dollar into this program unless we take it from Medicare beneficiaries.  Why should we begin calling on those who rely on Medicare to pay for non-Medicare purposes?  It is wrong.  The second way they propose to fund this bill is by reducing funding for public health and prevention, whether it is for Zika and West Nile virus, where I live down in Texas, or it is for the opioid crisis, which is affecting our State like every other one.

Many of the nominees who are being sworn in are unqualified, incompetent, and have actually built their careers on dismantling the agencies they are now leading.  To be clear, Mr.Wehrum's nomination represents yet another broken promise by President Trump--this time, to our Nation's farmers. As a candidate, Mr.Trump pledged to champion the RFS, a policy with broad bipartisan support that reduces our greenhouse gas emissions, helps us revive rural economies, and makes our Nation less dependent on foreign oil.  Yet the President continues to surround himself with advisers intent on sabotaging the RFS, like Scott Pruitt, Carl Icahn, and, now, Mr.Mr.Wehrum has proven, time and again, that he is not a friend of the Renewable Fuel Standard  He sued the biofuels industries--not once, not twice, not three times, but at least four times--representing groups like the American Petroleum Institute which are strong opponents of the During his nomination hearings, Mr.Wehrum refused to commit to supporting the RFS, claiming he was ``unfamiliar'' with the program. He wouldn't even acknowledge the unprecedented attacks launched on the biofuel industries by this administration.  If you support the RFS, as Illinois farmers and I do, it should be obvious that the right thing to do is to oppose Mr.This is not about having blanket opposition to President Trump's nominees; this is about our national security, our rural communities, and our environment.  I have already fought a war over oil, and I would rather run my car on American-grown corn and soybeans than oil from the Middle Our farmers deserve better than a President who makes campaign promises to protect the RFS in Iowa but will not honor them when he gets to the White  I understand that Administrator Pruitt has written a letter to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle regarding a pending petition requesting to move the ``point of obligation'' and a rulemaking on renewable volumetric obligations. Both of these decisions, as Administrator Pruitt's letter states, will be final in the coming days. That is why I am calling on my colleagues to simply hold Mr.Wehrum's nomination until after EPA finalizes these decisions.  There is no rush to confirm Mr.Wehrum this week. Better yet, let's oppose his nomination altogether.  I am also concerned that he will gut key public health protections that we all rely on to protect our families and the air we breathe. One of the most serious responsibilities I have, as both a U.Senator and a mother, is to protect children and families from harmful pollutants and to make sure the air they breathe is safe from toxic chemicals.  After reviewing Bill Wehrum's previous work in the Office of Air and Radiation, it is clear that he made dismantling the Clean Air Act--and all of the air pollution safeguards and public health protections guaranteed by it--one of his top priorities. In that office, he actively fought to roll back commonsense safeguards against lead, fine particulate pollution, and ozone smog. But he didn't stop there. He even led efforts to weaken standards designed to reduce emissions of mercury--one of the most deadly, toxic pollutants in the world--from coal-fired powerplants. Bill Wehrum wasn't looking out for us; he was looking out for the fossil fuel industry.  When Mr.Wehrum was originally nominated for this position under the Bush administration, the Senate had the good sense to reject his nomination. He was never confirmed, and I hope we do not confirm him now.  Again, I urge all my colleagues to oppose Mr.Wehrum's nomination and, instead, support our farmers, our children, and our families.

They have been very helpful with this bill.  I am honored to speak in support of my legislation, H.2601, the Veterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery, or VICTOR,  America owes our veterans every advantage when it comes to receiving an organ or bone marrow transplant, yet the current VA transplant policy often runs counter to the medical interest of the patient. There are only 14 facilities in the Nation where a veteran may receive a transplant in the VA healthcare system, and none of these facilities perform all types of transplants.  Timely organ transplants often represent the difference between life and death. Unfortunately, due to government bureaucracy, our veterans are often forced to travel hundreds or thousands of miles repeatedly in order to get the chance to receive a new liver, heart, or kidney. That travel alone can prove fatal.  Traveling to get a transplant isn't the only obstacle these patients face. Oftentimes, it is the program itself. The limited size and scope of the VA transplant program means veterans have a lower chance of getting a transplant and a greater chance of dying while on the waiting list.  The VICTOR Act allows veterans who need an organ or bone marrow transplant through the VA system the ability to access a federally certified transplant center close to their home if the veteran and their doctor agree that that is medically safer. It will make it easier for veterans to access lifesaving medical care by allowing them a number of ways to qualify for care closer to home.  As a surgeon and as a veteran, I believe this is good medicine and good public policy. The status quo puts roadblocks in front of veterans who need lifesaving transplant care, and the VICTOR Act eliminates these roadblocks and increases access to care our veterans have earned.

221,topic-id,1884,"Mr.President, yesterday there was another gun massacre and horrible circumstances. I know the Presiding Officer came to the floor earlier today to say a word about his feelings and the feelings of his family. They are shared by all of us. It is heartbreaking to think that some person so demented, so unusual would come into a worship setting and kill innocent people.  Yesterday, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at least 26 people were killed and 20 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire in the sanctuary of the First Baptist The reported shooter, Devin Kelley, used an assault rifle to commit this mass murder. The victims range in age from 18 months to 77 years. About a dozen of those who were killed were children, including the daughter of the church's pastor. This is heartbreaking. Our nation grieves for the victims and their loved ones.  The shooter reportedly drove up to the church wearing a bulletproof vest and tactical gear, and he began firing in the parking lot before entering the church. At some point, a local resident who lived near the church began firing back. The shooter then drove off, with two residents in pursuit, eventually crashing his car. He was found dead from a gunshot wound, which may have been self-inflicted.  President Trump and others have said that this exchange of fire with citizens responding saved lives and shows that the policy response to the shooting should be to arm more good guys with guns. Let us not forget that 46 people were shot before these citizens came on the scene.  This reported shooter, 26 years old, had served in the U.Air Force from 2010 until 2014, working on logistics readiness. In 2012 he was court-martialed for two counts of assault on his then-wife and child. He was sentenced to confinement for 12 months. He received a bad conduct discharge in 2014. He remarried in 2014, and had worked as an unarmed security guard at a water park. He reportedly bought four guns, one each year from 2014 to 2017, and three of those weapons--the assault rifle that he used in this crime and two handguns--were found at the scene.  Local law enforcement said that the shooter was likely motivated by a domestic situation. His wife's grandmother was one of the victims.  There are so many things that come to mind. First and foremost is the grief and sorrow we all feel for the families who were affected. It is so sad that when people go to church on Sunday, they are not safe from gun violence and gun massacres, which are occurring way too frequently across the United Just over two years ago, nine people were killed by a gunman in the Charleston Emanuel AME And just last month we saw the worst mass shooting in modern American history in Las Vegas, with 58 people murdered and over 500 wounded. In Chicago, at least 29 people were shot, five fatally, over this past weekend.  There are things that we need to do, and that only we can do in Congress, to make the laws better and safer.  I respect the Second I respect the fact that there are men and women in my family, friends, and people I represent across Illinois who own guns and use them safely and responsibly. We have sportsmen and hunters in my family. We have people who buy guns for sporting purposes and for self-defense. They store the guns carefully and safely. They take very seriously that they are dealing with a deadly weapon. They don't want anyone innocent to be hurt. I respect that very much. I think we all should. But I also call on them now. They need to lead us into a more sensible policy when it comes to gun safety.  Owners of firearms, overwhelmingly, when asked, believe we should have comprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of those who misuse them. Overwhelmingly, a majority of gun owners feel that way, as most Americans feel. Why can't we do that? We certainly know it is within our power.  In my State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, we are approaching 600 homicides this year--600--most of them from gunfire. It is heartbreaking. That doesn't include those who were injured by being shot as well. Where are these guns coming from? There are no gun stores in the city of That is true. But when it comes to purchasing guns, it makes no difference. The suburbs have plenty of gun dealers. Of course, there are gun shows in neighboring States, like We also know gun stores in the suburbs of Chicago supply 25 percent of the identified crime guns. We know many of those are sold in what is known as a straw purchase. They are sold to someone who buys a gun for someone who is not legally qualified. It is a girlfriend or someone who buys a gun because she has no criminal record so her boyfriend can use it--misuse it--and kill innocent people. Can't we toughen that law and make sure there are real penalties for straw purchases? That is not going to slow down any legitimate gun owner or anyone who wants to use a gun in a responsible fashion. That is one thing we can do.  Then there is the gun show loophole. We know, with Columbine and other places, that it was a gun show loophole that opened the way for the purchase of guns that killed innocent people. Let's do something about that. We should. If we are serious, we should.  We also know that the 1996 Lautenberg amendment prohibits convicted domestic abusers from buying or using guns. That applies, as well, to military personnel. Questions need to be asked and answered about this shooter in Texas and what happened after he was court-martialed for domestic abuse in the Air Force in 2012. How did he purchase a gun after that, in violation of the Lautenberg amendment?  We need to also ask why in the world anyone needs to own an assault weapon. I understand people buy rifles and shotguns and even handguns for sporting and self-defense. But why does anyone need to own a military-style weapon--one that can be converted, as we found in Las Vegas, to a weapon that discharges 100 rounds in 7 seconds?[[Page S7031]]That is totally unnecessary for any legitimate legal purpose. It is available, perhaps, for military use, perhaps, for law enforcement but not for the ordinary American citizen who would purchase and own a gun for legitimate purposes.  Next, we need to make sure that we understand why gun violence is growing in The number of people who have been killed or injured just grows by the year. It is getting worse. According to a CDC report issued just last week, gun deaths increased for the second year in a row last year. There were more than 38,000 gun deaths in 2016, up from 36,000 in 2015 and from 33,500 the year before that. We are experiencing a public health crisis of gun violence in America, according to the American Medical  Of course, there is no single law or policy that would prevent every shooting death, just as there is no single law or policy that would prevent every drug overdose death. But we have to start working together, on a bipartisan basis, to bring these shooting numbers down.  We need to also talk about the issue of mental health, raised by the President in response to this tragedy in The President said:       This isn't a guns situation. . . . I think that mental      health is your problem here.  Despite the fact that most violence in the United States has nothing to do with mental illness, many are arguing that mental health is really the issue. What have we done in the Senate when it comes to mental health and guns this year? Senate Republicans used the CRA to repeal a regulation that directed the Social Security Administration to share mental illness information with the background check compilation of information. There was advocacy for massive cuts to Medicaid, which would throw millions of people with mental health needs off coverage. There was an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would have allowed insurers to refuse coverage of essential health benefits, including mental health treatment. And there was a refusal to provide additional Federal funding to help provide mental health care. We don't have a very good record this year in the Senate when it comes to taking mental illness seriously, and we should.  I will also introduce a bill that I am working on to encourage more crime-gun tracing in light of last week's crime-gun trace report from the Chicago Police  We focus on terrorism and what it does to our country, and we should. That is our responsibility. Anyone who would do harm to innocent Americans--as in 9/11, killing 3,000 in that particular instance--needs to be taken extremely seriously by all of us in Congress and in the White Foreign sources of terrorism need to be carefully watched when it comes to our border security, when it comes to background checks, and the like. But let's be honest. More Americans are dying from Americans killing Americans with guns than by terrorist activity. It is just as much a death as any foreign terrorist threat would be, and we need to consider it just as seriously as we do when it comes to the issues of terrorism and safety for the people of  Why doesn't the Congress take this up? Why don't we even have a debate? I am on the Senate Judiciary We have not had a single bill this year that addresses gun safety--not one--despite the gun violence that takes place every day and despite tragedies like this tragedy over the weekend in Sutherland Springs,  Every time a terrible shooting occurs, Republican leaders in Congress say now is not the time to act. And then Congress never acts.  Congress still has not acted to close the 72-hour background check loophole that allowed the Charleston church shooter to buy his gun in 2015.  Congress has done nothing to address the bump stocks that enabled the Las Vegas shooter to turn a concert into a war zone.  Congress still hasn't even addressed the gun show loophole that allowed the Columbine shooters to commit that massacre back in 1999.  Will Congress act in response to this latest tragedy? Will the Republicans who control Congress finally stand up to the gun lobby and put legislation on the floor to bring down the number of gun deaths? Or will the Republican-controlled Congress ignore this public health crisis once again?  The Republicans in Congress are rushing to pass massive changes to our tax code in a matter of weeks, and yet they refuse to do anything to prevent the next mass shooting. If the Republicans treated this gun violence epidemic with a fraction of the urgency they are showing when it comes to cutting taxes for the wealthiest one percent and the largest corporations, we could save many lives.  I pray for the victims of gun violence in this nation, but I also pray that my colleagues will act to reduce this gun violence epidemic.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7030-4.txt,326,RECOGNIZING DIWALI AND HINDU NEW YEAR,2017.0,6.0,November

992,topic-id,470,"Mr.President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Steven Engel to head the Justice Department's Office of Legal  On many occasions, President Donald Trump has made clear that he does not appropriately respect the rule of law in We have seen this many times over the last few years, from his bigoted and disdainful comments about Federal judges, to his firing of FBI Director Comey because of what the President called ``this Russia thing,'' to his shameful pardon of Joe Arpaio, a man convicted of criminal contempt for refusing to stop violating the Constitution, to his efforts last week to badger the FBI and Federal prosecutors into doing his bidding.  As Republican Senator Bob Corker said last Friday:       President Trump's pressuring of the Justice Department and      FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for      punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate      and not only undermine our justice system but erode the      American people's confidence in our institutions.  If my Republican colleagues want to restore confidence in our institutions of justice, they can start by making sure that only someone truly independent of Donald Trump serves in the vital position of Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal  The Office of Legal Counsel, or OLC, is not well known, but it is a critical part of the Federal government. OLC exercises statutory authority to provide legal advice that is binding on the executive branch. In addition to giving legal advice to the President and executive branch officials, OLC reviews all proposed Executive orders and Attorney General orders for form and legality. Essentially, OLC serves as a check to make sure that the President and his administration are faithfully executing the laws.  There have been shameful moments in our history when OLC's leaders have lacked the independence and judgment to stand up for the rule of law. For example, in 2002, under Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, OLC produced the infamous torture memo that approved the CIA's use of torture techniques like waterboarding. When this memo became public in 2004, the Justice Department was forced to withdraw it. Jack Goldsmith, a prominent conservative legal scholar who was acting head of OLC at the time said he was ``astonished'' by the memo's ``deeply flawed'' and ``sloppily reasoned'' legal analysis.  Then, in May 2005, OLC had a new leader--Steven Bradbury--and he secretly issued three new torture memos approving the use of waterboarding and other abusive interrogation techniques. Then-Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey strongly objected, saying the United States would be ashamed when the memos came to light, but Attorney General Alberto Gonzales overruled him.  Already, we have seen troubling signs at OLC under President In January, OLC signed off on President Trump's travel ban Executive order, a decision that was kept secret from then-acting Attorney General Sally According to ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7038-4.txt,326,COMMEMORATING VETERANS DAY AND HONORING SERVICE ANIMALS FOR VETERANS,2017.0,7.0,November

1115,topic-id,1522,"Mr.President, on September 5, 2 months ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration's repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, better known as  DACA provides temporary legal status to immigrant students if they register with the government, pay a fee, and pass criminal and national security background checks. It was renewable on a 2-year basis.  The young people protected by DACA are also known as They came to the United States as children. They grew up knowing only this country, believing this was their home and their future. Many of them in their teenaged years were told quietly by a parent that their legal status was not the status of an American citizen. These kids, who grew up singing the Star Spangled Banner and pledging allegiance to the American flag, have no country.  It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican from On a bipartisan basis, we asked President Obama to establish a program like the DACA The President responded, and DACA has been a success. Almost 800,000 Dreamers have come forward. They have surrendered to their government the information that many of their families kept secret for years. They trusted us. They gave this information to the government and said: We want to become part of America's future, and we are willing to sign up, submit ourselves to the background check, pay our taxes, pay our filing fee, and do whatever is necessary. They trusted us. These young people who came forward and received DACA have then gone on to contribute more fully to their country. They are teachers, nurses, engineers, first responders, and servicemembers in our military.  Now, because of President Trump's announcement, the deportation clock is ticking on these young people. Beginning on March 5, 2018, not that long from now, every workday for the following 2 years approximately 1,400 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to deportation. These young people who trusted our government will now, with the decision to end DACA, find themselves in an extremely vulnerable position.  When they lose their DACA protection, if they are teachers, they are forced to leave their students. If they are nurses, they are forced to leave their patients. If they are first responders, they leave their post. If they are soldiers willing to die for our country, they are forced to leave our military service.  This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis. It is also an economic crisis. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2 billion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a conservative operation, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA recipients will cost $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction in economic growth over the next 10 years.  Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for these Even FOX News--no liberal media outlet--recently found that 79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers, including 63 percent of those who voted for President Sixty-three percent, or almost two out of three Trump supporters, supports a legal status for  The answer is clear. Congress needs to pass the Dream Act, and we need to[[Page S7032]]do it before we leave Washington, DC, for the holidays.  It was 16 years ago that I first introduced this bipartisan legislation to give a path of citizenship to these young people. In July I introduced the most recent version with my friend, Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator from South  Over the years I have come to the floor almost 100 times to tell individual stories of the These stories tell us what is at stake when we consider the fate of DACA and the Dream Today, I want to tell you about Ha Eun  When she was 6 years old, her family came to the United States from She grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Here is what Ha Eun says about her childhood in the United States: ``I was fortunate enough to grow up learning that diversity is encouraged and differences are not just tolerated but welcomed.''  Ha Eun was a good student and committed to public service. In high school she was a member of the National Honor Society, received the Principal's Academic Achievement Award, and was an Oakland Activities Association Scholar She was a member of the track and field team during all 4 years of high school.  Ha Eun is now a senior at the University of Michigan, majoring in She volunteers with the Red Cross, and she is copresident of an organization called The Supply, which raises money to help students in Nairobi, Kenya, obtain an education. As copresident, Ha Eun has expanded this organization's efforts, and they are now volunteering locally near  Ha Eun was also a policy and programs intern for the Asian Americans Advancing Justice  As Ha Eun completes her last year of college, her dream is to become a lawyer. She wrote me a letter, and here is what she said:       Although I'm legally labeled as an ``alien'' in this      country I call home, I believe I am an And I      believe this not solely because I live, study, work and      contribute to this country, but because I believe in the core      values all Americans share as a nation: liberty, justice, and      prosperity.  Ha Eun and other Dreamers have so much to contribute to our country, but without DACA or the Dream Act, they will be deported back to countries where they haven't lived since they were children. Will America be stronger if we deport people like Ha Eun? I think the answer is obvious.  When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Graham said: ``The moment of reckoning is coming.'' That moment has arrived. Congress has a responsibility to do our job and make the Dream Act the law of the land before the end of the year, before we go home for the holidays; otherwise, we will bear the responsibility for forcing hundreds of thousands of talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting them at risk of immediate deportation.  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are interested in finding a path to get this done. I salute all of them who in good faith have offered their help. We have to focus now. We have to come together and focus.  Many of my Republican colleagues have said that we need to put in border security elements. Count me in. Let's sit down and have an honest discussion about making our borders safer and stronger. I will gladly join that conversation. I think there are many things we can agree on that will lessen the likelihood that there will be those coming across the border in the years to come.  I recently met with the head of border security, and we talked about things that might be done. There is something called a Z I didn't know about it. It is a virtual x ray machine, a low-level radiation x ray machine that can x ray vehicles and determine whether they are secreting individuals or contraband that shouldn't be allowed in this country. He talked about one particular border crossing and said: We have a Z Portal there, but it can be used on only about one out of every five vehicles. He said: I would like to have more of them.  I think he should. Why wouldn't we make that part of border security? I said: What about other things coming into this country, other than people?  He said: One thing we are concerned about is fentanyl.  Fentanyl is a chemical that is used to enhance the addiction of heroin, and, sadly, it is deadly. Many heroin addicts die when they lace the heroin with fentanyl and inject it, so we try at the borders to stop the importation of this fentanyl from China and other countries into the United I asked him about it.  He said: Sadly, we don't have enough new spectrometers, which are used to test these chemicals. We need them to stop the flow of this deadly drug into our country and to protect the men and women who are doing the actual surveillance.  Isn't that something we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis, to make our borders safer, to lessen the likelihood of people dying from the opioid heroin crisis? These are things we can do together.  Somehow we haven't been able to come up with a list of particulars from the other side of what they would like to move forward on, but I am ready, willing, and determined to get this done.  We have to do this this year. There is no excuse. There are too many lives at stake, not just the 780,000 DACA individuals but all of the people whom they are helping in their lives today. They are depending on us.  We are running out of time. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this constructive and bipartisan effort.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7031.txt,326,1745,2017.0,6.0,November

1172,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the Republican effort to roll back the joint-employer rule that the Obama administration promulgated. This joint-employer rule is an attack on workers, and it is an attack on franchisee businesses.  For people watching, Mr.Speaker, understand that when a franchisor, the big headquarters, tells a franchisee, ``You have got to do every single thing we tell you. You basically work for us. We are going to tell you the size of the sandwich. We are going to tell you the kind of oil to use. We are going to tell you how to schedule your workers. We are going to, basically, control your enterprise, though you are supposed to be an independent business,'' the Obama administration said, ``We are going to treat you as if you are joint employers.'' So if there is wage theft or there is unfairness on the job or some problem that comes up with workers, then the big company, the headquarters, will also be held responsible for solving the problem.  What the Republicans do today, Mr.Speaker, is say: ``No, we might impose all these conditions on you per the franchisee agreement, but, if there are problems, it is going to be your problem, franchisee.''  This is absolutely unfair. As workers are going all over this country trying to get higher wages, this is a whole movement for them to get livable wage for people who work every single day at our fast-food chains. They are going to their local franchisee owners to ask for those wages.  But if the franchisor says: ``You can't pay any more than this. We are going to restrict you in multiple number of ways. We are going to make you sell food items at a cost that you can't even sustain, like the dollar menu''--those things cost more than a dollar, folks. But if the big headquarters says you have got to charge a dollar as a promotion, then the franchisee has to eat that.  But when workers need more money, the big company makes that impossible, and then workers are left holding the bag along with the franchisee.  The joint-employer rule, holding both sides responsible for those wage thefts to pay for hours, these things make a more fair process and require the big headquarters to take responsibility as well.  I urge a ``no'' vote on this. This is an antiworker bill. This is an anti-small business bill, which is somewhat surprising to me, given that my friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for small business, but, really, they are just for big business. If you have any doubts about that, all you have got to do is look at this tax bill they are putting out there.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of      the United Steelworkers (USW), I strongly urge you to oppose      H.3441, the ludicrously named ``Save Local Business Act''.      The bill has virtually nothing to do with small businesses      but will greatly restrict the definition of employer under      the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).       Targeting a National Labor Relations Board decision,      Browning-Ferris Industries, H.3441 is not only drafted to      repeal a decision where the employer tried to avoid      collective bargaining responsibilities through      subcontracting, but radically changes the Fair Labor      Standards Currently, under the FLSA, employers cannot      hide behind labor contractors or franchisees when they set      conditions of employment. H.3441 strips nearly a century      of workforce protections to give large employers almost      unfettered ability to hide from long established employer      responsibilities.       The rise in temporary or precarious work in the United      States is fast becoming an unfortunate norm in the economy. A      recent study on the rise of temporary employment found the      proportion of American workers engaged in ``alternative      work'' jumped from 10.7% to 15.8% in the last decade. When in      the last decade 94% of net job growth is in the alternative      work category, workers continuously find themselves unable to      seek remedy for their grievances or an ability to      collectively hold their ultimate employer accountable. H.     3441 will accelerate the growth of job-instability as      employers will be able to manipulate the system to avoid      collective bargaining by hiring temporary employees or      contractor employees.       Congress' responsibility to American workers in this time      of rising income inequality and precarious work must be to      improve access to collective bargaining and stop employer      circumvention of U.labor laws, not to weaken them. H.     3441 strips workers of another tool to hold their employers      accountable. A vote for this legislation is a vote against      working people and the right to democratic representation in      the workplace. I urge you to vote no on H.3441.           Sincerely,                                                    Leo Gerard,                                          International  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance, which says that this legislation would not benefit small businesses that create good jobs. It actually would place such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the expense of the workers and taxpayer-funded social safety net programs.                                                Signatory Wall and                                 Ceiling Contractors Alliance,                                  Saint Paul, MN, October 5, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,              Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Mr.Speaker and Leader Pelosi: I am writing on behalf      of the Signatory Wall and Ceiling Contractors Alliance      (SWACCA) to express our strong opposition to H.3441, the      ``Save Local Business Act.'' This legislation will not      benefit honest small businesses that create good jobs with      family-sustaining wages and benefits. It will actually place      such employers at a permanent competitive disadvantage to      unscrupulous companies that seek to thrive solely at the      expense of their workers and taxpayer-funded social safety-     net programs.       SWACCA is a national alliance of wall and ceiling      contractors committed to working in partnership with our      workers and our customers to provide the highest-quality,      most efficient construction services. Through the superior      training, skill, and efficiency of our workers SWACCA      contractors are able to provide both cost-effective      construction services and middle class jobs with health and      retirement benefits. Our organization prides itself on      representing companies that accept responsibility for paying      fair wages, abiding by health and safety standards, workers      compensation laws, and unemployment insurance requirements.       Unfortunately, however, we increasingly find ourselves      bidding against companies that seek to compete solely on the      basis of labor costs. They do so by relieving themselves of      the traditional obligations associated with being an      employer. The news is littered with examples of contractors      who have sought to reduce costs by willfully violating the      laws governing minimum wage, overtime, workers compensation      unemployment insurance, and workplace safety protections. The      key to this disturbing business model is a cadre of labor      brokers who claim to provide a company with an entire      workforce that follows them to job after job. It is a      workforce that the actual wall or ceiling contractor controls      as a practical matter, but for which it takes no legal      responsibility. In this model workers receive no benefits,      are rarely covered by workers compensation or unemployment      insurance, and are frequently not paid in compliance with      federal and state wage laws. The joint employment doctrine is      an important means for forcing these unscrupulous contractors      to compete on a level playing field and to be held      accountable for the unlawful treatment of the workers they      utilize.       As an association representing large, medium, and small      businesses, we oppose H.3441 because it proposes a      radical, unprecedented re-definition of joint employment      under both the FLSA and the NLRA that goes far beyond      reversing the standard articulated by the NLRB in Browning-     Ferris or retuning to any concept of joint employment that      has ever existed under the FLSA since the Act's passage. H.     3441's radical and unprecedented redefinition of joint      employment would proliferate the use of fly-by-night labor      brokers by ensuring that no contractor using a workforce      provided by a labor broker would ever be deemed a joint      employer. This is because the bill precludes a finding of      joint employment unless a company controls each ``of the      essential terms[[Page H8540]]     and conditions of employment (including hiring employees,      discharging employee, determining individual employee rates      of pay and benefits, day-to-day supervision of employees,      assigning individual work schedules, positions and tasks, and      administering employee discipline)''. H.3441 goes further      by expressly countenancing a company using labor brokers      retaining control of the essential aspects of the workers'      employment in a ``limited and routine manner'' without facing      any risk of being a joint employer.       Simply put, H.3441 would create a standard that would      surely accelerate a race to the bottom in the construction      industry and many other sectors of the economy. It would      further tilt the field of competition against honest, ethical      businesses. Any concerns about the prior administration's      recently-rescinded interpretative guidance on joint      employment under the FLSA or the NLRB's joint employment      doctrine enunciated in Browning-Ferris can be addressed in a      far more responsible manner. Make no mistake, H.3441 does      not return the law to any prior precedents or standards. It      creates a radical, new standard. This standard will help      unethical employers get rich not be creating more value, but      instead by ensuring their ability to treat American workers      as a permanent pool of low-wage, subcontracted labor that has      neither benefits nor any meaningful recourse against them      under our nation's labor and employment laws.       On behalf of the membership of SWACCA, thank you in advance      for your attention to our concerns about this legislation.      Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any      questions or require additional information.           Sincerely,                                                  Timothy Wies,                                                         Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I want to go back to this point I have been making about how this is now officially the most closed Congress in history, and I think people need to keep that in mind before they vote for this rule.  But the gentleman from Alabama, again--I guess in this age of Trump, I mean, you can twist things all kinds of different ways, you know--bragged about all this great bipartisanship here. In that number that he was referring to, a number of bills that were supported in a bipartisan way, a big chunk of them are things like naming post offices, suspension bills that are not controversial, Hats Off to Teachers Day, those types of bills.  But on major legislation, whether it is healthcare or whether it is this crummy tax bill that they are going to be bringing up, this place is polarized because they block out any competing ideas.  Let me again reiterate for my colleagues: the Rules Committee has blocked more than 1,300 amendments this year. That is just this year alone.  Now, I already mentioned amendments on the AUMF, climate change, Afghanistan, and more. I think those are important subjects. But the Members offering these amendments, I think, no matter what you believe about these amendments, deserve the right to be heard by the whole House and to receive an up-or-down vote.  But here are a few more examples of the germane amendments that my friends on the Republican side on the Rules Committee blocked under the closed and structured rules. They blocked an amendment to prohibit the repeal of  You know, I mean, 800,000 people's lives now are in the balance because of Donald Trump rescinding the protection for these DREAMers, and he said: Congress, you do it. You fix it.  Well, we tried to bring an amendment to the floor to have a debate and fix it, and if my Republican friends don't want to vote for it, they can vote ``no.'' But they blocked it. They blocked an amendment to bar funds from being spent on this stupid, idiotic wall that the President seems enamored with along our border. They blocked an amendment to increase funding to fight rural domestic violence and child abuse. They blocked several amendments to ensure the Trump family doesn't profit off the Presidency, and we all know that they are, but we can't even have that debate.  They blocked an amendment to protect asylum seekers and human trafficking victims, and they blocked an amendment to ensure victims of incest can have access to abortion care. I can go on and on and on. I mean, they blocked Congressman Grothman's budget amendment twice. He is a It was germane. He even testified before the Rules Committee, but you blocked it.  Last week, you blocked Representative Jimmy Duncan's amendment to allow doctors to practice medicine out of State on a volunteer basis. It may be a good idea. It deserves to be debated. You blocked it.  Is that a poison pill? Is that what the gentleman was referring to? You know, process matters, and it matters for this reason, because when you have a lousy process, you end up with a lousy product.  I know it is not sexy to talk about process, you know, but it is important. It is important that we do our jobs, we debate these issues, and that we listen to Democrats and Republicans, you know, come before us with ideas: some we may agree with, some we may not, but let's have that debate. What is wrong with that? Why is that such a radical idea in this place? To get up and say I am proud of this; I am proud that we are now the most closed Congress in the history of our country? That is something to be proud of?  I think that is something to be ashamed of. I think it diminishes this House of Representatives, and it diminishes every single member of this House, Democrats and Republicans alike.  This is supposed to be a deliberative body. Let's deliberate. Let's not negotiate things in the back room and then rush it to the floor and demand an up-or-down vote. You know, you don't have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are people in your own party who have some good ideas, too, and I think we have good ideas as well. And if you want bipartisanship, true bipartisanship, and you want to end the polarization, open the process a little bit. That would be helpful.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

142,topic-id,486,"Mr.Speaker, obtaining accessible and reliable forms of capital is one of the biggest challenges that small businesses and entrepreneurs face today. I will say that again. We are not talking about large corporations. We are talking about small businesses and entrepreneurs.  According to the 2016 Year-End Economic Report from the National Small Business Association, 41 percent of all small businesses surveyed said that ``lack of capital is hindering their ability to grow their business or expand their operations, and 20 percent said they had to reduce the number of employees as a result of tight credit.''  That is why I introduced the Micro Offering Safe Harbor This bill does not create a new securities registration exemption under the Securities Act; rather, it defines what constitutes a permissible nonpublic offering, and it provides small businesses with the clarity and confidence to know that their offering is not a violation of the Securities  If enacted, this will make it easier for entrepreneurs and small businesses--again, not large corporations--to raise money from family, friends, and their personal network without running afoul of the vague and undefined private offering safe harbor provisions in the Securities Act of 1933.  More specifically, this legislation requires the following three criteria be met simultaneously in order to trigger a safe harbor exemption for a security offering: each purchaser must have a substantive preexisting relationship with an owner; there can be no more than 35 purchasers of securities from the issuer that are sold in reliance on the exemption during the 12-month period preceding; and, lastly, the aggregate amount of all securities sold by the issuer cannot exceed $500,000 during the 12 months preceding the offering.  The Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act helps bring clarity to existing law so that our current and future job creators can easily raise capital within the confines of an easy-to-understand provision without the help of an ever increasingly expensive expert.                              {time}  1245  Furthermore, the legislation preserves all Federal and State antifraud protections. Ultimately, this bill will scale existing Federal rules and regulatory compliance for small businesses, thus providing another practical option for entrepreneurs to raise the capital they need to start and grow their business.  The timing for this legislation could not be better, as the House continues to promote job creation and economic growth through this once-in-a-generation effort to reform our Tax  As our small businesses and startups continue to provide for over half of all current jobs and over 65 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s, we must provide the tools they need to succeed, and this legislation does just that.  I thank Chairman Hensarling, Chairman Sessions, and Chairman Huizenga for working to bring this important bill to the floor.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question, adopt the rule for H.2201, and vote in favor of the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act when it comes to the floor for consideration.

The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act is the principal labor statute protecting agriculture workers and establishes wage, health, safety, and recordkeeping standards for both seasonal and temporary farmworkers. Joint employment standards under this law and the Fair Labor Standards Act are vital to protecting the rights and protections afforded to these workers.  Oftentimes, farmworkers are recruited, hired, supervised, or transported by intermediaries, sometimes referred to as farm labor contractors. Farm operators utilizing farm labor contractors maintain control over working conditions seeking to ensure the financial success of their operation.  Despite this shared responsibility, farm operators may argue that the farm labor contractors they engage are the farmworkers' sole employer responsible for compliance. Farm labor contractors are often thinly capitalized. This means if a farmworker seeks redress for a violation, he or she may not be able to collect from the farm labor contractors. Under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, joint employer liability helps ensure covered workers can also hold liability from farm operators that share responsibility.

I am President of Farmworker Justice and have 37      years of experience as an attorney, including at the National      Labor Relations Board, Legal Services, in private practice      and at this organization.       Farmworker Justice opposes the ``Save Local Business Act,''      HR 3441 because it would remove an important mechanism to      protect farmworkers and other low-wage workers from suffering      violations of the minimum wage and child labor requirements.      The bill would make it extremely difficult to hold two      businesses jointly liable as ``joint employers'' of the same      worker or group of workers. This bill, if enacted, would      result in massive violations of the minimum wage and other      labor abuses that would harm farmworkers and harm the      reputation of the entire agricultural sector.       This bill, if enacted, would reverse more than 130 years of      knowledge developed in the[[Page H8570]]     quest to eradicate sweatshops. The Fair Labor Standards Act      of 1938, which sets minimum wage, overtime, and child labor      standards, adopted a definition of employment relationships      based on 50 years of experience under state laws that evolved      to address employers' efforts to evade child labor and other      labor laws.       During the mid- to late-1800's states adopted laws to      regulate and limit the hours of employment of children and      quickly confronted employers' efforts to evade the laws.      Business owners that operated a manufacturing plant would      claim that the children in the plant were employed solely by      a subcontractor within the plant or had been brought to the      plant by a parent or sibling and therefore should not be      considered to have ``employed'' the child. Even if the      subcontractor or parent were punished, in the absence of      liability on the part of the plant operator it would suffer      no adverse impact and would be free to find another      subcontractor or parent to bring children to do the work. In      addition, often a labor contractor lack sufficient assets to      pay a court judgement, leaving workers remedy-less.       One of the responses of state legislatures was to adopt a      broad definition of employment relationships that imposed      employer status on the larger business owner even where there      existed a labor intermediary. Numerous states adopted      language defining employment relationships that later became      the model for the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.       The state laws and the FLSA defined employers as entities      that directly or indirectly employed a worker and defined the      word ``employ'' as including not just the restrictive common      law definition's ``right to control test'' but also as ``to      suffer or permit to work.'' 29 USC 203(g). To ``suffer''      in this context means to acquiesce in, passively allow or to      fail to prevent the worker's work.       This broad definition imposed liability on a company that      had the power to prevent the work of the worker from      happening and denied the business the ability to hide its      head in the sand about what was happening in its business,      including where it utilized labor contractors or other      intermediaries which were considered employers of those      workers. See Goldstein et al., ``Enforcing Fair Labor      Standards in the Modern American Sweatshop: Rediscovering the      Statutory Definition of Employment,'' 46 UCLA Law Review 983      (1999). The purpose of establishing joint responsibility is      also reflected in FLSA's definition of ``employer,'' 29 USC      203(d), `` 'Employer' includes any person acting      directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in      relation to an employee.''       The facts in the U.Supreme Court's decision in      Rutherford Food v. McComb, 331 U.722 (1947)      illustrate the concept. A slaughterhouse company retained a      contractor to assemble a crew of workers to de-bone meat in a      special room within the slaughterhouse. The Department of      Labor sued the defendant company for recordkeeping and      overtime violations. The company denied that it employed the      meat de-boners, arguing that the contractor was their sole      employer. The Court found that the definition of employment      relationships in the FLSA imposed liability on the      slaughterhouse.       The Save Local Business Act would alter the longstanding      meaning of employment relationships under the FLSA and the      National Labor Relations The NLRA excludes agricultural      workers from its protections, so I will focus on the      The FLSA's minimum wage applies to farmworkers on most (but      not all) larger farms; small farms generally are excluded      from the minimum wage. 29 USC 213(a)(6). Agricultural workers      are excluded from overtime pay. 29 USC 213(b)(13)-(16).      FLSA prohibits certain types of child labor although it      allows large agricultural employers, as well as small family      farms, to employ children at younger ages than is allowed in      other occupations. at (c)(1)-(2).       The bill would set criteria so onerous that it would be      rare for two businesses that shared responsibilities      regarding workers to be held to be joint employers; just one      business would be held to be an employer. Because the Migrant      and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (AWPA) refers      to the definition of ``employ'' in the Fair Labor Standards      Act, the proposed law may also apply to 29 USC      1802(5). AWPA is the principal federal employment law      for farmworkers, regulating employment contracts and the use      of farm labor contractors.       Many agricultural workers suffer violations of the Fair      Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and other basic labor      protections. Often, when such workers try to remedy illegal      employment practices, they run into a problem: the farm      operator that really determines their job terms and has the      capacity to prevent abuses, denies that it is their      ``employer'' for purposes of the minimum wage and other labor      protections. Instead, the farm operator claims that a ``farm      labor contractor'' or other intermediary is the sole      ``employer'' of the farmworkers on its farm. Often a labor      contractor competes for business by promising low labor costs      and when sued by victimized workers cannot afford to pay a      court judgment.       In most such cases, the definition of employment      relationships in the FLSA enables courts and the Department      of Labor to ensure compliance with the law by considering the      farm operator and the farm labor contractor to be ``joint      employers'' and jointly responsible for meeting FLSA's      obligations. This issue has been the subject of numerous      lawsuits in which farm operators have been held to be joint      employers with their farm labor contractors.       This Committee played a historic role in addressing abuses      of migrant workers at the hands of farm operators and their      labor contractors and recognized the importance of the joint      employer concept in ensuring a law-abiding, prosperous      agricultural sector. The Farm Labor Contractor Registration      Act of 1964 was passed in part in response to the powerful      documentary by Edward Murrow, ``Harvest of Shame'' that      aired during Thanksgiving weekend in 1960. Congress revised      its provisions and replaced it with the Migrant and Seasonal      Agricultural Worker Protection Act of 1983, 29 U.S.     1801 et seq. At the heart of this Committee's motivation      was ensuring joint employer responsibility.       ``This broad scope of joint employment--and joint employer      liability--is one of the AWPA's most important features. The      AWPA's legislative history indicates that Congress considered      the joint employer doctrine ``a central foundation'' of this      new law. 29 C.F.500.20(h)(5)(ii); citing House      Report, n.2 at 4552. It is the ``indivisible hinge'' that      allows workers to hold accountable all those responsible for      violating the AWPA's protections. Id, citing H.97-     885, 97th Cong., 2d Sess.1, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.     4547, 4552 (1982) (``House Report'').       The economic reality is that few farm operators will risk      their profitability and the survival of their business by      delegating all responsibility to a labor contractor. Most      farm operators who engage labor intermediaries exercise      substantial decision-making regarding the impact of      subcontracted workers on their business. If strawberries or      grapes are harvested when they are over-ripe or under-ripe,      are subjected to pathogens transmitted on the footwear or      hands of farmworkers, or are not handled carefully to prevent      bruising, huge financial losses could result. A farm operator      generally makes these and other major decisions to ensure its      profitability, even if it uses a farm labor contractor,      instead of its own supervisor, to ensure that its decisions      are carried out. Such farm operators should not be able to      avoid complying with the minimum wage or child labor      requirements by blaming a labor contractor as the sole      employer. In most cases, there is shared responsibility among      the farm operator and the labor contractor so that the      workers on the farm ensure the profitability of that      business. That shared responsibility means shared liability      is appropriate.       The joint employer concept does not deprive farms or other      businesses of the ability or right to engage labor      contractors or other intermediaries such as staffing      agencies. Nor does it prevent businesses from entering into      agreements that require labor contractors to comply with all      employment-law obligations, purchase liability insurance      against employment-law claims and hold the larger business      harmless for any litigation and liability that may result.       Joint employer liability creates an incentive to ensure      that a business selects its labor contractors, as well as its      directly-hired supervisors, wisely and ensures compliance      with employment laws. In addition to ensuring protections for      workers, joint employer liability helps protect law-abiding      businesses from unfair competition by unscrupulous employers      that keep their labor costs low by using labor contractors      that violate employment-related obligations. The joint      employer concept is an important, longstanding approach to      minimizing sweatshops and its elimination would result in a      return to an era in which sweatshops are more prevalent.       The joint employer concept also helps create consumer      confidence regarding their purchases. People want to feel      good about the food they eat. Agriculture has a reputation      for poor treatment of farmworkers that would be exacerbated      by the increases in abuses that would flow from this      legislation.       Congress should reject the Save Local Business Act because      it contradicts 130 years of experience in preventing      sweatshops in factories and at least 50 years of consensus      regarding policies needed to remedy and prevent abuses of the      people who labor on our farms and ranches to produce our      food.

475,topic-id,434,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today, marking the 48th day since Hurricane Maria made direct landfall on the island of Puerto  Wreaking havoc for over 3.4 million American citizens living on the island, this administration's response has been beyond atrocious. I witnessed it myself a couple of weeks ago, and so did a group of 50 registered nurses from across the country who volunteered for a two-week disaster relief fund and mission.  What these courageous women described upon returning was not at all reassuring. The lack of efficient action has led to deadly conditions and consequences: lack of food, water, medicine, proper healthcare services, houses with roofs blown off or infested with black mold, and leptospirosis outbreaks across the island.  Laura Maceri, a registered nurse, said: ``It's hell there. The people have nothing, yet they are the first to offer you the shirt off their back.''  Another nurse, Hau Yau, expressed: ``We couldn't believe this is part of the United We did home visits in low-income communities with the public health liaisons there who identified those in need, and helped them do basic blood pressure checks, blood sugar checks, to refill their medicine, et cetera. They have already had chronic diseases going on, and now their environment is full of hazardous materials, and the sanitation is very, very poor.''  From another nurse, Erin Carrera: ``Spent the day in Rio Grande, a hard-hit area right outside of San No power or water here since We set up a clinic at the FEMA site for the first time here. People lined up blocks since 10 p.m. last night. But FEMA was only handing out papers--papers, which need to be filled out in order that they may receive some reimbursement eventually. Each person received a small bottle of water, a mini bag of Cheez-It and a little pack of vanilla cookies. We were able to provide care to some, not nearly enough, but one small contribution to this tragedy today.''  Another nurse said: ``Today we went to a town called They had almost no water or food there. They were desperate. They are relying on rainwater. One million chickens died during the storm and are now decomposed and causing people to get sick. Overwhelming is the only thing I can say to describe it.''  Mr.Speaker, I stand with these nurses in their demands to address the humanitarian crisis on the island of Puerto This administration must respond immediately.  We need to waive FEMA's cost-sharing requirements in Puerto Yesterday, Representative Gutierrez and I introduced the WEPA legislation--the Waiver of Emergency Payments Act--that chooses and aims to do exactly that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8602.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,8.0,November

725,topic-id,462,"Mr.Speaker, I stand here today to shed light and to put a face on an imperative issue, the imperative issue of affordable housing. I am here representing neighborhoods like Marble Hill, Inwood, Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, Morningside Heights, Harlem and east Harlem, and the northwest  Public housing and public housing capital funding is imperative for many of my constituents. Just to shed some light on the magnitude of this problem, Mr.Speaker, in the 13th Congressional District, there are 62 housing developments--62 public housing developments.  There are a total of 340 buildings, and, within those buildings, there are 34,609 apartments where families live; so 62 housing developments out of 326 for the entire city of New York, 340 buildings out of 2,462 buildings in the city of New York, and 34,609 apartments out of 176,692 apartments across the city of New  In fact, Mr.Speaker, public housing houses over 400,000 residents. It is larger than many cities in many States across the Nation, and public housing capital funding is imperative and necessary for my constituents.  Not only do these residents rely on stable, affordable housing to stay close to their families and be near their jobs and schools, but our city relies on these residents who are also teachers, home healthcare workers, caregivers, and taxi drivers. They run our city. In fact, they are an integral part of the economic engine of the city. They are part of our local economy. They fuel our economy on a daily basis. Mr.Speaker, these folks really represent the economic engine of New York  As you will hear from my colleagues, affordable housing--public housing--and its residents are under threat. After a decade of funding reductions, the President's administration made one thing clear: they plan to drastically accelerate funding reductions for This turns that housing agency, essentially, into an absentee landlord, into a slumlord, if you will, administrating public housing developments across the country that are in decrepit and seriously embarrassing conditions.  The administration's fiscal year 2018 budget proposal revealed a $7.6 billion cut, almost a 20 percent cut to HUD, and a two-thirds cut to public housing capital needs.  Now, New York City has a need of $17 billion to do point work, roof work, boiler work, and elevator work to improve the quality of life of the residents of these housing developments. Yet the administration has proposed a $7.6 billion cut. This is a national crisis, an affordable housing national crisis.  We have Members from California to Texas to New York who all believe that affordable housing should be at the forefront of our progressive priority. It is a fundamental cornerstone of the American Dream that we cannot afford to let slip away.[[Page H8648]]  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from the State of Texas (",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8647-4.txt,99999999999999,1930,2017.0,8.0,November
726,topic-id,461,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her eloquent remarks regarding this pressing need, this national crisis of housing.  Let me just share with you some other numbers that will further ensure that the American people understand in full depth this crisis.  In my district, as I said earlier, there are 75,463 residents of public housing out of 400,000 citywide. There are 34,035 NYCHA families in the district out of 174,283 citywide. Twenty-five percent are children who are subject to mold like you see right here on this easel, Mr.Speaker, mold that contributes to asthma and to other respiratory diseases that then lead to absenteeism in the schools and long-term problems for young people and children who live in these public housing units.  In addition to that, Mr.Speaker, 21 percent of the residents of these housing developments are seniors over 62 years old who are also subjected to mold, chipping paint, and elevators that don't work. They have to go up and down 18 or 20 stories. Some of them are in wheelchairs or have some real challenges getting around. Yet the Federal Government and its Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, continue to be an absentee landlord abandoning them to their own fate. Fifty-two percent of those residents, Mr.Speaker, are on fixed incomes, and 46 percent across the city have an employed family member. So these are the numbers that are very telling to this national crisis.  The reduction in capital funding which leads to the deterioration of buildings' roofs and facades, failure of boilers, leaks, mold like we see right here, and other unacceptable conditions are devastating to my constituents, and they contribute to a public health crisis, asthma, respiratory disease.  Americans need a better deal for housing. As we continue negotiations on the fiscal year 2018 appropriations and the administration prepares the fiscal 2019 budget proposal, we need to ensure that public housing is adequately funded.                              {time}  1800  Sufficient capital funding is imperative for my district and the country, and it ensures the creation of jobs through capital work.  Investing capital dollars in public housing repair would also yield employment in our communities. It also ensures the reduction of negative health outcomes and healthcare costs related to the deterioration of housing conditions. It also results in quality, stable housing for low-income Americans, which is one of the most important factors in the alleviation of poverty.  Americans need a better deal for housing. I hope that my colleagues remember the constituency that we serve, particularly the most vulnerable ones like the residents of public housing, and we continue to fight back against budget cuts. Growing the public housing capital fund must be elevated as a priority.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.Gomez).

728,topic-id,1284,"Mr.Speaker, earlier, I talked about some of the proposed budget cuts that HUD has brought forward for this fiscal year. Let me tell you, the American people, what some of the programs are that will be negatively, adversely affected by these cuts on a daily basis.  Section 8, a program that provides rental assistance to help low-income individuals and families, more than 125,000 households in New York City's NYCHA complexes depend on Section 8 vouchers, 39,000 of which are administered by the city's HPD Approximately half of the voucher recipients are elderly and disabled.  Community Development Block Grants help the city enforce housing quality standards. More than half of the city's Community Development Block Grant allocations support housing quality standards funding; 500,000 inspections have been conducted, 8,000 emergency repairs, 16,000 housing litigation cases, and emergency shelters for 1,000 households, just in 2016.  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit, nationally, 90 percent of the affordable housing is financed through the Low Income Housing Tax The Low Income Housing Tax Credit and tax-exempt bonds have helped create and preserve over 116,000 safe, quality, affordable homes in New York  These programs will be compromised and lead to apartments with mold, chipping paint, leaky pipes, dysfunctioning elevators, failing boilers, and leaky roofs. So this is a major national crisis.  Let me share with you some of my constituents' stories. Now that we have talked about numbers, let's talk about what these numbers mean and who they impact.  Let's talk about, for example, a lady named Maria Pacheco, who has lived in the UPACA 6 development for 12 years. She is retired from working at the stock market. This is what she had to say about the importance of making capital improvements to her public housing building:       If NYCHA fixes the entrance doors and the walkway in front      of the development, more seniors would be able to get out of      their apartments more often. There are a number of seniors      who do not come out of their apartments because they are not      able to open the entrance doors. Those doors are really heavy      and the walkway is dangerous, and a lot of seniors fear they      will fall.  Maria Pacheco needs a better deal in housing from Seniors are too afraid that they will fall.  During Secretary Ben Carson's listening tour--by the way, Mr.Secretary, New York City is still waiting for you to see our public housing complexes and the conditions that they are in--during his so-called listening tour, this is what he had to say to a development in Columbus, Ohio, that is partially funded by HUD: ``Compassion means not giving people a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say: `I'll just stay here. They will take care of me.' ''  Mr.Secretary, ``a comfortable setting,'' you said. Public housing often lacks consistent heat and hot water. That is far from being comfortable.  Public housing elevators often break down. That is far from being comfortable.  Public housing often has no heat and hot water and mold on the wall. That is far from being comfortable.  I think my constituent Birdie Glen, age 78, who lives in the Jackie Robinson Development with her husband and great-grandson would disagree with you, Mr.She is retired from the Department of Education, and this is what she had to say:       If they fix the boilers in the Jackie Robinson Development,      the residents would be more grateful and appreciative. The      lack of consistent heat and hot water has caused a lot of the      residents to get sick. Adults as well as children have been      visiting the doctor's office more frequently due to getting      sick because of no heat and hot water.  This has become a public health crisis as well. During the winter months, residents experience more illnesses in the Jackie Robinson complexes because the boilers need to be replaced.  Another resident, Felicia Rodriguez, 70 years old, who lives in the Gaylord Houses, says:       In my 2 years living at Gaylord, I have experienced severe      flooding, water damages in different areas of my apartment.      If we had repairs and upgrades in our development, we will      value our homes and neighborhood. We need to ensure we get      the repairs completed in a timely manner to avoid further      damages to our infrastructure.       Gaylord has significant leaks due to the pipe damage, brick      gaps, roof damage. These problems affect our health, our      hygiene, and[[Page H8650]]     economic issues for many seniors in Gaylord development. By      making major roof and brick repairs at Gaylord White Houses,      we will eliminate leaks, flooding, and damage to the top      floors of these apartments.  This is a public health crisis.  Let's talk, Mr.Speaker, about public health and mold.  In every city, there is an aging public housing development complex, and a lack of investment for decades means that many buildings pose great, great health risks to the residents. In New York City, a majority of NYCHA buildings are more than 60 years old. Public housing authorities have endured decades of Federal disinvestment. For many, a lack of affordable funds means that repairs have spiraled out of control. Some units are so damaged that they cannot be lived in.  Citywide, there are 2,300 NYCHA units that are vacant, and many need extensive renovations to become safe homes again. Not only is the lack of Federal investment hurting the number of public housing units available, but vacant units almost always make public housing less safe for current residents.  Speaking to DNAinfo, Jisele Hearne elaborates how vacant units make the Harlem River Houses less safe: ``Of course, we are worried. Anyone can come in and you don't know what they are going to do. They can . . . leave the gas on. It's not safe living someplace where nobody is monitoring.''  Harlem River Houses has been plagued with mold for many years, and units on the top floors have remained uninhabited.  Mold affects 328 NYCHA properties, and the situation has only worsened after Hurricane That was in 2012. We need capital investment not just to eradicate the appearance of mold; we need to address the root cause of that. We need to replace leaky roofs, crumbling pipes, and all ventilation systems to make sure the mold is gone forever, for good.                              {time}  1815  The health of children, families, and seniors is at stake. The CDC reports that exposure to mold can lead to coughing, wheezing, eye and skin irritation in otherwise healthy people.  For small children, exposure to mold may lead to asthma, leading to absenteeism in the schools. For vulnerable residents, such as seniors or small children, mold may lead to much more serious medical conditions.  The government is the landlord of public housing complexes across the country, and we cannot expect public housing residents to deal with conditions that would be deemed unacceptable in the private market. It is our solemn duty to make sure that public housing residents have homes that allow them to lead healthy and productive lives.  If we can afford to spend $1.75 million remodeling one unit in public housing--that is the White House that I am referring to, which is public housing. If we could spend $1.75 million to renovate the most expensive public housing unit, the White House, then surely, Mr.President, we can afford to guarantee safe homes for public housing residents.  If President Trump can spend $291,000 on office walls, then America's 1.16 million units of public housing should have walls free of mold, like the one we see right here, and other safety hazards. Unlike the White House, residents of public housing cannot afford lavish renovations. They depend on us, and we must not fail them.

730,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from[[Page H8651]]the State of California for her eloquent words.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to highlight another factor that contributes to the problem of the lack of affordable housing, and that is the decreasing affordability crisis in New York  Historically, New York City was built on inclusivity, and it is here that people from all walks of life come in and they coexist. It is this diversity that contributes to the success of this great experiment called America, this great experiment called New York It is young people moving here from Tennessee and immigrant families from the Dominican Republic, like my family, for their own American Dream right here in New York And New York City's success is one piece of the national picture of urbanization.  This enormous change in cities across the country includes an influx of more people, often young and from diverse backgrounds. This means we need the visionaries in expanding our housing supply, especially our affordable housing supply.  Mr.Speaker, that is why we are here today, to highlight on this national crisis of a lack of affordable housing. America has a housing crisis--an affordable housing crisis. Working and middle class New Yorkers have felt the brunt of fewer options available on the market.  Countless middle- and low-income families cannot afford to live in the neighborhoods they have known their entire lives. They must give up living close to jobs, schools, familiar neighbors, and everything else that defines their community.  The very foundation of our city is threatened when households must make difficult choices between basic necessities and rent. That is truly a fight for the soul of our neighborhoods, our cities; and they are often forced to leave these houses and communities.  This is not a crisis that affects only a few. It impacts many New Sixty-nine percent of New Yorkers rent their homes, and nearly half of renters struggle to pay rent every month. Many are one unexpected bill away from debt or eviction.  While this situation is dire for those struggling to pay rent in their apartments now, there are virtually no options for low-income New Minimum-wage workers will need to have three full-time jobs or work at least 119 hours per week to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment at market rate.  Not only is it physically impossible, but we should not ask that of workers in our city. The crisis of affordability nationwide will not vanish if ignored. So long as New York's economy is thriving, rents won't plateau or fall on their own. Developers will continue to eye aging buildings for redevelopment and build new luxury apartments. Rather than leave the creation and preservation of affordable housing up to chance or whims of the market, we must be intentional about funding affordable housing.  We already have a housing stock of 176,000 units of public housing in New York City alone. That is the lifeline of hundreds of thousands of residents, but it is in dire need of investment.  If we care about diversity and care about inclusion, we must put our money where our mouth is and we must repair and preserve public housing for a future of increasingly expensive cities.  Another aspect of the lack of affordable housing and the income gaps affecting New York City is the dynamic of gentrification. Mr.Speaker, I have the distinct honor of representing Harlem, which recently was--there was an attempt to change its name to SoHa by speculators, people who want to turn Harlem, a traditional iconic neighborhood of New York City, into something else.  There are Harlems in every State across the country. There are Harlems in every country around the world. Harlem is a personality. It is an attitude. Harlem is for those who feel that perhaps they don't have a voice but they want to fight to get to another level. That is It is a spirit.  Harlem, which, during the latter half of the 20th century, was plagued with crime and abandonment, is now falling victim to its own success. Rents have risen and many long-term residents have been displaced.  The same is happening in Washington Heights, Neighborhoods that saw over 100 homicides every year and that now are down to low single digits are seeing a dramatic increase in rent and affordability; and many folks who have been living there for decades, like my family, are now having to make tough choices of whether they remain in the neighborhood that they love or have to move somewhere else.  Even among those who remain, they still face additional challenges because the neighborhood they have known for so many years now feels unfamiliar. For many, the fear of displacement is ever-present.  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8647-4.txt,99999999999999,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,8.0,November

232,topic-id,398,"Mr.Speaker, as the Nation celebrates Veterans Day this week, a day we honor those who served our country, I am happy to report the VA has made great strides in improving and assisting veterans with physical injuries. It struggled, however, to deal with many of the invisible injuries plaguing our veterans, like post-traumatic stress disorder.  These invisible injuries ravage our Nation's veteran population, with an average of more than 20 veterans a day committing suicide. This is entirely unacceptable. We must work harder to look for real solutions to this crisis.  That is why I am here today urging my colleagues to support the Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers Act, also known as the PAWS The PAWS Act will set up a 5-year pilot program in the VA to provide post-9/11 veterans suffering from PTSD with service dogs if other treatments have not been successful.  Individuals suffering from PTSD experience emotional numbness, loneliness, nightmares, hypervigilance, and anxiety. However, traditional VA treatments are symptoms-based and often have side effects or fail to address the root of these issues.  Service dogs, however, have no side effects. They can be used in tandem with other treatments. They can be[[Page H8529]]trained to wake their owners from nightmares, create a buffer zone in large crowds, remind their owners to take their medication, and watch their owners' back to provide a sense of security and more.  I have heard from veterans suffering from PTSD that sometimes the hardest part of the day is just getting out of bed in the morning. The schedule of walking, feeding, and caring for his or her service dog offers veterans purpose and a sense of responsibility. Ultimately, a service dog and its owner better each others' lives.  It is important that the House pass the PAWS Act and allow the VA to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of providing veterans with service dogs.  While talking about service animals, I would also like to recognize Eli's Fund, an initiative at Texas A&M University created in memory of the late Lance Corporal Colton Rusk and Eli, his service dog, that provides financial support for service animals of Active-Duty servicemen and -women, medically retired veterans' service animals, and retired military animals, to help with veterinary medical bills.

23,topic-id,1877,"Mr.President, for the last month, in the wake of the tragedy in Las Vegas, I have been asking my colleagues to show some courage, stand up to the gun lobby, and take weapons of war off of our streets.  Now, we have all had to bear witness to another tragedy. Three days ago, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a single person armed with an assault rifle murdered 26 people and left another 20 injured. This gunman walked into a church and opened fire on peaceful churchgoers, including children as young as 18-months old. A helpless toddler who barely learned to walk. Eight members of a single family were also lost.  The shooter had 15 magazine clips of ammunition--almost 450 rounds--and used all of them. Ask yourself: how would you feel in those moments, with hundreds of bullets flying around and not knowing whether you will live or die, or whether you will be able to protect your child? Think about those children--terrified, witnessing their families being shot while in a place of worship. It is time that we ask what this says about us as a country. And what does this say about us to the rest of the world.  In 1996, after a mass shooting where a gunman opened fire on tourists at the sea side in Port Arthur, killing 35 people, Australia acted swiftly. Twelve days later, Australia's government enacted sweeping gun control measures. Since then, there has not been a single mass shooting in that country since. Mass shootings in America, however, have become common place. It is no longer a matter of if, but when, another one will happen.  If there are now mass shootings in churches, where are we safe anymore? Not concerts, not schools, not holiday parties. Just a month ago, we experienced the worst mass shooting in our nation's history in Las A gunman opened fire with multiple semi-automatic assault rifles that he had legally transformed into automatic weapons, killing more than fifty people and leaving more than 500 wounded. Among the victims were mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters.  There was Kelsey Meadows, 28 years old, who after graduating from the University of California, Fresno, returned to her hometown of Taft, California to be a substitute teacher at her alma mater, Taft Union High She was described by the high school principal as ``smart, compassionate, and kind'' with a ``sweet spirit and a love for children.'' Her entire family and community was completely devastated. Kelsey could have been any of us attending that concert. My own daughter told me after the Las Vegas shooting that she was supposed to be in the city that evening, but her plans had to change. It was only a little more than a year before the Las Vegas shooting that we experienced what had then been the worst mass shooting in our nation's history.  That was when 49 people who were enjoying an evening of dancing with friends and loved ones were massacred in Victims in Orlando included 22-year old Luis Velma who was working at Universal Studios on a Harry Potter ride. There was also Eddie Justice, a 30-year old accountant who texted his mother from the shooting, telling her: ``Mommy I love you.'' ``In club they shooting.'' ``He has us.''  I encourage every member of this chamber to imagine receiving those text messages from their son or daughter.  And just six months before that, 14 people were killed and more than 20 injured in San Bernardino, California at a work holiday party.  Among the victims was a father of six. A mother of three. A woman who was eight when she and her mother left Vietnam for a better life in The youngest victim was 26, and the oldest was 60.  The list goes on and on. Eight murdered at the Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, A police officer and two innocent citizens brutally murdered by a man with an AK-47 style weapon in Colorado In 2013, 12 people fatally shot at the Navy Yard, less than two miles from where I stand today. And on December 14, 2012, 20 children had their lives taken at Sandy Hook Elementary  Once again, I encourage every member of this body to imagine dropping their young child off at elementary school this morning, only to learn a few hours later that a gunman walked into that school and tried to kill as many people as possible. That is something we could have prevented. But we did not. Instead, we have made it easier for those with mental health issues to get guns. I often remember Sandy Hook and think about how we let these families down. We failed them. And sadly, the mass shootings have continued to get worse in terms of frequency and lives lost. And I will not sit by while these killings continue.  That is why today I am joining with my colleagues to reintroduce legislation to prohibit the sale, transfer, manufacture, and importation of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices that can accept more than ten rounds. I will keep doing this. This legislation must constantly be before this body until it is enacted. Every member must make a decision whether to stand up or let the National Rifle Association win again.  This legislation is not perfect. But it is part of the solution. We must start with reducing the supply of the weapons of war that are used to take the lives of our loved ones.  The deadly assault weapons used by the attackers in each of the devastating shootings I have mentioned would have been banned under the Assault Weapons Ban bill that I am introducing today. The new legislation is based off of legislation we previously introduced following the horrific attack committed against young school[[Page S7119]]children in Newtown, It will provide much needed fixes to the law to keep our communities safer, while also protecting the rights of lawful gun owners.  Back when we enacted the 1994 legislation, that law prohibited semiautomatic weapons with a detachable magazine and at least two military characteristics. The bill we are introducing today tightens this test to prohibit semiautomatic rifles, handguns, and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic. This is the standard employed in my home state of California--and it works.  Based on the 10 years of experience from the 1994 law, we learned that the ``two-characteristic'' test was too easy to ``work around'': a manufacturer could simply remove one of the characteristics, and the firearm was legal. The bill we are introducing today will close that loophole. The bill also prohibits ``bullet buttons'', a feature that certain manufacturers developed to evade restrictions on detachable ammunition magazines. In San Bernardino, the assault rifles originally contained ``bullet buttons'' for their magazine clips--which enabled them to avoid California's assault weapons ban. Our bill contains language to close this loophole.  This bill also prohibits ``bump-fire stocks'', which, as we saw in Las Vegas, allows individuals to convert semi-automatic rifles to function like a machine gun.  Other changes to the 1994 bill include updating the list of specifically-named military-style firearms that are prohibited, to account for new models developed since 1994; prohibiting semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds; adding a ban on the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines; and eliminating the 10-year sunset that allowed the original law to expire. Importantly, our legislation also prohibits large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds.  Now, let me tell you what the bill will not do.  It will not affect hunting or sporting firearms. Instead, the bill protects hunters and sportsmen by exempting 2,258 firearms used for hunting or sporting purposes and exempting antique, manually-operated, and permanently disabled weapons. The bill protects the rights of existing gun owners by grandfathering weapons legally possessed on the date of enactment. The bill also imposes a safe storage requirement for grandfathered firearms to ensure they don't get into the hands of people who would be prohibited from possessing them.  While the bill permits the continued possession of high-capacity ammunition magazines that are legally possessed on the date of enactment, it would ban the future transfer of these magazines.  Finally, the bill allows local jurisdictions to use existing federal Byrne JAG grant money to support voluntary buy-back programs for grandfathered assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices.  Opponents charge that this legislation impinges upon rights protected by the Second I disagree.  The Supreme Court expressly held in District of Columbia v. Heller that ``the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.'' The Court made it clear that reasonable regulations are allowable under the  This bill is simply establishing reasonable regulations for what types of weapons may be sold and used--individuals should not own a nuclear weapon, they should not own a rocket launcher, and they should not own a military-style assault weapon.  In fact, a number of courts have considered challenges to assault weapons bans. To date, every court that has considered a ban on assault weapons or large capacity magazines has upheld the law as reasonable.  In fact, the D.Circuit, the Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Ninth Circuit, as well as a number of federal district courts have all upheld laws like the one we are proposing.  Importantly, the Supreme Court let stand the ruling out of the Seventh Circuit upholding a local ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines from the City of Highland Park,  Mr.President, I believe very strongly that the most important duty that government has to its citizens is to protect the nation and the safety of its people.  When 26 churchgoers are killed in cold blood with their loved ones in a Baptist Church on a Sunday morning, we fail them by not making sure that they can worship in peace.  When 58 people attending a concert in Las Vegas lose their lives because a madman was able to use laws on the books to make his semi-automatic rifle into a machinegun, all of those who sit in this chamber have failed them.  When 14 people are gunned down during a holiday party by those with assault rifles that let off 65-75 rounds within minutes, our government has failed them.  When 20 elementary school children are slaughtered by an assault weapon, America has failed them.  The firearms used in these massacres are weapons of war. Let me say it as plainly as I can: weapons of war do not belong on our streets, in our churches, in our schools, in our malls, in our theaters, or in our workplaces.  Now, I am under no illusions--I know that the gun lobby has a stranglehold on this building. I know we got 40 votes in 2013, and I know Republicans control the Senate today. But I also know this was hard-fought in 1994, and we prevailed--with Republican support--and it was a bipartisan vote. I still believe that, at some point, Americans will come together and realize that we can be a nation that protects its people from the savagery of these weapons.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7111.txt,1332,CLOTURE MOTION,2017.0,8.0,November

Established in 1854, the Guard predates the founding of the State of Nebraska by 12 years, and those who serve in its ranks today carry on a proud tradition. Whenever the Nation calls, Nebraska Guard men and women have been at the leading edge, responding in times of military need and national crisis.  When the shadow of fascism spread across Europe in World War II, Nebraska's 134th Infantry Regiment was there to bring the light of democracy back to the continent, liberating the French city of Saint-Lo from Nazi occupation.

At this very moment, we can find Nebraska soldiers and airmen deployed all across the globe, protecting our great Whether it is the dozens of National Guard men and women who are currently conducting detainee operations at Guantanamo Bay or those preparing to deploy next year to key positions in the Pacific and the Middle East, our Guard stands ready to answer the call.  The Guard is also playing an important role in working with our allies abroad. Since 1993, the Nebraska National Guard has been linked with the Czech Republic through the State Partnership As Eastern Europe emerged from the heavy hand of communism, the Nebraska National Guard was there working side by side with their military to collaborate, share, and assist, forging a lasting bond that remains strong to this day. This year marks the 25th anniversary of that partnership, and we are all extremely proud of the work our Guard is doing to help bring our democracies together.  That spirit of service extends to their operations here in the homeland as well. When hurricanes so tragically struck our neighbors in Texas, Florida, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, the Nebraska Guard was there to help. The numbers speak for themselves. In Texas, they rescued 461 people and delivered 142,000 pounds of cargo, 6,000 pounds of bottled water, and 1,000 pounds of medical supplies. During Hurricane Irma, 102 members participated in an aviation task force for support operations. Right now, 58 soldiers and airmen are providing assistance to the Virgin Islands and Puerto  The scope of their response to these disasters is a testament to their dedication and showcases the flexibility of the Guard's mission. Whether it is responding to domestic emergencies, overseas combat, or reconstruction missions, these men and women are there to respond with speed, efficiency, and strength.

939,topic-id,443,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Joshua Ryan Redner, a young man from my district in Levittown whose tragic story illustrates exactly why we cannot waver in our commitment to fighting the opioid epidemic.  During his final year of high school, Josh was prescribed Percocet to treat the pain from a knee injury. His parents, George and Jacqui, never imagined that their son, a star athlete, and an excellent student who planned to attend the Coast Guard Academy could be dragged down by addiction.  But addiction can impact anyone, Mr.Not long after the initial prescription, Josh's family noticed changes in his behavior. Then, long after Josh's prescription had run dry, George and Jacqui were still finding pills in Josh's room. Recognizing the beginning of a serious problem, Josh's parents sat him down and Josh committed to getting clean.  Working to get the help he needed, Josh entered rehab. Unfortunately, the treatment did not hold and thus began a cycle of relapse, followed by stints in rehab. George and Jacqui were shocked to learn that Josh eventually moved from OxyContin, which was expensive and hard to find, to heroin, which was cheap and easily found--a transition that is all too common.  Tragedy struck the Redner family with the passing of Josh's older brother, Devastated by the loss of his role model, Josh used the power of his grief to get clean and live a life that would have made his older brother proud. Josh found a good-paying job, acted as a role model for his three younger brothers, and was saving money to buy a home.  Mr.Speaker, it is with a broken heart that I say that this is not how Josh's story ended. Josh once again relapsed. Speaking with his parents over the phone, Josh assured them that he would be okay and asked that they pick him up the next morning. Having no other options, George and Jacqui agreed.  The next morning, George and Jacqui found Josh next to a picture of his older brother, George, having lost his battle with addiction.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, I would like to share with you the words that Jacqui shared with me. Her incredible strength is a testament to the love she has for her sons. Jacqui said:       This heroin epidemic affects everyone it touches. It is not      going away. It is only getting worse. I don't want any parent      to have to bury their child. I should not have had to bury      two of mine.

Our troops were not there under the auspices of the 2001 AUMF, but considering that they were reportedly ambushed and killed at the hands of an Islamic State affiliate, questions have been raised about where our forces are and where they are at war with terrorists versus when they are simply conducting train-and-equip or other missions of that sort.

If they were to say that we need new authorization, they would be conceding that they haven't been acting with authorization all this time. So they are never going to say that we need a new  What has surprised me is that there are Members of this body, the Senate, who are content to let this 16-year old authorization remain in place. Some have even suggested that any updates to the AUMF can be made using the appropriations process. Are we really going to start using policy riders on annual spending bills to approve of sending troops into harm's way? We rarely even vote on individual spending bills anymore, let alone controversial policy riders to those spending bills. Are we truly willing to leave it to the members of the Appropriations Committee to update a law that has put our servicemembers into harm's way, particularly those of us on the authorizing committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? I hope that we more jealously guard our prerogatives than that.  Our inaction on updating the 2001 law has already relegated the role of the Senate in authorizing force to that of a cog in the feedback loop. I would submit that we in the Senate ought to aspire to be more than that.  For 16 years, Congress has been all too willing to let successive administrations use those broad authorities to address new threats and to deploy U.troops to new places. Beyond Afghanistan, our troops have deployed all over the world, to places such as Yemen, the Philippines, Somalia, and Libya to fight al-Qaida and its affiliates.  We have also sent forces to Syria and back to Iraq to defeat ISIS, a group that didn't even exist in 2001. We need to fight terrorism overseas, and I am not suggesting that the United States should shy away from these battles. To the contrary, I believe Congress should do its duty in supporting these missions by voting to authorize them.  In the 16 years since the passage of the 2001 AUMF, approximately 300 Members of the House who voted on it are no longer with that In the Senate, of those Senators who voted on the original AUMF, only 23 Senators remain in their seats today. That leaves approximately 70 percent of the entire Congress that has never cast a vote to authorize military force abroad. Yet, over the years, deployments have continued to new places, combating new foes.  The United States is strongest when we speak with one voice. Therefore, Congress must have some buy-in on these missions. Our allies and other adversaries need to know that the war on terrorism has the support of More importantly, our troops need to know that Congress is behind them.  I know the concept of passing a new, updated AUMF is a tricky one. This is not a conventional war against a sovereign nation in which victory is easily defined. Instead, we are fighting an ideological enemy that has no sovereignty and which, over the years, has moved all over the world, resulting in many splinter factions that could change their name at any time with ease.  This new kind of war requires a new kind of authorization, one that allows Congress's continued buy-in and increases its oversight. Right now, we have neither of these.  After working on this issue for several years, Senator Tim Kaine and I have introduced legislation that we think gets us in the right place. Our bill would authorize the use of military force against al-Qaida and the Taliban[[Page S7073]]and It authorizes force against affiliates of those groups and requires the President to report to Congress when he initiates force against a new group he designates as being associated with al-Qaida, the Taliban, or Military operations can begin as soon as the President has notified There is no time-lapse required.  If Congress doesn't agree with the President's designation, our bill allows a 60-day timeframe during which any Member can bring a resolution of disapproval to the floor under expedited procedures, and adoption of such measure by both Houses would result in the end of military operations against that group.  Our bill adopts the same process with regard to geography to allow Congress to disapprove of military operations in a particular country. I recognize that traditional declarations of war and other authorizations of military force haven't referred to a particular geographic area in which operations can take place. But all of our previous military engagements were against sovereign nations with armed forces, not terrorist groups that can pop up in any country at any time.  If Congress is going to authorize the use of force, we ought to know in which countries U.troops are operating. Requiring the President to notify Congress when he begins operations against one of these terrorist groups in a new country is an important check on the executive branch to ensure there is no overreach.  The bar for disapproving the President's decision is high--appropriately so. It would require two-thirds of the House and the Senate to disagree with the President on his decisions with regard to new associated forces or new countries.  Right now, Congress has very little to say over who or where our military fights. The only option available is to cut off appropriations, and history has demonstrated that simply is not realistic or appropriate.  The most recent example of this, as some of my colleagues will recall, was in 2011, when the Obama administration joined the NATO operation to help rebels in Libya topple Muammar The administration never made the case to Congress as to what U.interests were served by U.involvement. As a result, many Members on both sides of the aisle publicly opposed our intervention in  Yet, when the clock ran out on the time constraints set forth in the War Powers Resolution, Congress did not turn off appropriations because we can't just pull the rug out from underneath servicemembers when they are in harm's way overseas. The ``turning off appropriations'' approach simply hasn't worked in the past and is not likely to work in the future.  We need real congressional buy-in and oversight over a conflict that has morphed considerably since 2001--and which we are now being told is morphing to a new continent. S.43 gives us just that.  I should note that the bill also includes a 5-year sunset. The sunset is not intended to serve as a notice that the war on terrorism will end in 5 years. It is there to require Congress to put its skin in the game by voting on authorizing force.  The administration has signaled its objection to this provision. They think that the war on terrorism could be undermined if terrorists think they just have to wait us out.  I worry more that the lack of congressional buy-in undermines the war right here at home. Seventy percent of Congress has no skin in the game at all. We are free to criticize the President, whether the President is Republican or That is not right.  We ought to have responsibility here. We are the article I branch. We are the branch tasked with declaring war and authorizing use of force. We shouldn't shirk our responsibility. We can't let history repeat itself and go for another 16 years without voting for the use of force against terrorists. That is why I support a sunset on any new or updated  Perhaps the best feature of the Flake-Kaine measure is that it is bipartisan. That is an essential feature. I think we can all agree that passing an updated AUMF along party lines is perhaps the only thing worse than letting the status quo remain. I commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, for signaling that we will move ahead with the markup of the new  I think Flake-Kaine is a great start, but I am under no illusion that the process of putting a bill together that can garner widespread, bipartisan support will be an easy one. But the longer we wait, the higher the risk becomes that we will render ourselves irrelevant when it comes to authorizing force. That is a risk the Senate and Congress should not take.

1026,topic-id,3136,"Madam Speaker, I recently toured the newly renovated United States Capitol dome right nearby and, of course, was well aware it contains a striking fresco at the top. The title of that fresco is The Apotheosis of Washington, a bit of a peculiar image for our time, because it shows a stern, purple-clad George Washington exalted in the heavens.  Now, on his right is the Goddess of Liberty symbolizing emancipation; and on his left, the Goddess Victoria, symbolizing victory. He is surrounded by 13 maidens representing the Thirteen Original Colonies; however, there is a twist. The backs of several of the maidens are turned to Washington, and those represent the colonies of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia as they had seceded from the Union prior to the work beginning the fresco in 1863.  Now, Madam Speaker, the imagery continues, and around the rest of the dome are six allegorical scenes that do really project the defining ideas of America at that time. They are: war, science, marine life, commerce, mechanics, and agriculture. Now, these are perhaps old-fashioned categories to the modern mind, but then they did convey an optimism about the frontier, economic progress, and the potential of what our new Nation might be able to achieve.  Although, Madam Speaker, I had seen these frescos before, something struck me differently this time. These scenes really do grasp an incomplete ideal. The Apotheosis of Washington shows a reflective and confident America, but what is missing is a fuller understanding of the nature of community, individual dignity, and freedom.  The idea of progress is narrowly defined, and that narrow definition is actually still with us today, many times as it informs our debate here. We only tend to value things that we can actually measure--things like production, technology, and military victory--and they still rally us, and they are important.  But, as important as these things are, there is more to life; the more we have grown economically, the more we have grown technologically, the more our Nation groans. We have to be honest, and we have to ask ourselves: Why?  America is a far more complicated country than it was in Washington's time. It is not only due to our size and wealth and amazingly diverse population, but it is also due to rapidly advancing technology, a 24/7 news media cycle, and a highly competitive global marketplace that has made life more frenetic, more difficult, and, in some cases, much more alienating.  Today, there is widespread anxiety in our Nation over economic inequality, declining opportunity, and the concentration of both wealth and power, as well as a new force that is expressing a loss of unity and community, and then combine that with this deep search for a sense of solidarity.  Madam Speaker, while Congress spends much of its time debating numbers, financing, and budgets, a vision for America in its fullest sense goes beyond just material dimensions. Our economic vitality must not only be measured in terms of efficiency and growth, but also in how well we advance the cause of human flourishing.  In spite of all of these reflective comments, this Friday, our Nation will actually pause, and we will pause for a very important reason: it is Veterans Day, and we will celebrate that tradition. So if you are starting to feel overwhelmed by our Nation's struggles, just talk to a veteran.  If you see these policy battles here as impossible to resolve, talk to a vet.  If you really do want to reconnect with the ties that bind us, speak to a veteran.  Madam Speaker, as we are painfully aware, it is not easy to make progress in Nevertheless, there are times when both parties and the administration come together for great good, and actions for veterans represent a unique and proper American opportunity to support the men and women who have served our country. So as we approach Veterans Day and consider how to celebrate this gift of being an American, if we need a reminder, just ask a vet.                              {time}  1930  Now, back to history for a moment, Madam  We rightly mark our independence from the British as the beginning of a new nation, a new experiment in government based in the ideals of freedom. However, freedom most properly expressed is the freedom to do what we ought.  Unlinked to responsibility, to one another, and to higher ideals, freedom can become a meaningless wandering and a search for purpose; and progress, no matter how grand it is, is never an end in itself. Persons who are disconnected from one another, an economy that is uncaring, technology ever accelerating, these are dynamics that can actually be both beneficial, but also leave people behind. Independence from tyranny also means interdependence within community.  Now, Madam Speaker, the Capitol dome is over 150 years old. Until recently, chunks of iron--in fact, I saw one; it was nearly this big--were just falling off, and water was seeping through cracks. But now it is made whole again. The seams are repaired, and there is new, original-like glass and a fresh layer of protective coating. Why? Because we chose to do it. We didn't let it fall into ruin. We didn't lament its potential collapse. We chose to act.  So, Madam Speaker, if we cling to her ideals, this gift of America allows[[Page H8658]]us the freedom to preserve unity and to make genuine progress, which is the freedom to be whole.  As I approached my office here recently, there was a large crowd of men who had gathered outside my door. I assumed they were waiting to see me, and they were wearing camouflage shirts. There was some language on the front of the shirt. As I got closer, I could read it, and it said ``United Mine Workers.'' I thought, well, this is a bit peculiar to see United Mine Workers from Nonetheless, I engaged them in a conversation outside the door thinking I would escort them inside.  But they weren't there to see me. They were there to see my neighbor, who represents the State of Kentucky, and that made a little more sense. Nevertheless, I greeted these men, and we had a very meaningful conversation about work, about security, and about fairness.  These men had spent their lives in very hard jobs. I am sure they proudly toiled to create reasonable livings for their families. They all now showed real signs of physical fatigue. They were in Washington to make a plea, a plea for their pensions, which are facing dramatic reductions.  A similar situation does exist in Nebraska for another group of workers. These men worked for a guarantee that they would be provided for when they could work no more. But given a confluence of factors, their pensions face a dramatic shortfall, and it is not fair.  I lived, Madam Speaker, for 2 years in the area where these men come from, in a town that had lost half its population in 20 years, in the old industrial Rust Belt where the post-World War II economic boom built a thriving, stable community, but now where globalized supply-side theory has had its most dramatic degenerating economic effect.  I said to these men: ``You know that I know where you come from.'' One of them hugged me.  Madam Speaker, our country is in pain. Epic hurricanes and floods, escalating urban violence and an opioid epidemic among those who are self-medicating their own mental or physical or financial anguish, a broken healthcare construct, the aftereffects of bitterly fought elections, and now another mass shooting have torn America's heart apart.  In a vibrantly healthy society, there is space in a good, functional marketplace for fluidity, creativity, and innovation, and a person with an idea and the drive should be able to pursue it. The benefits accrue to the innovator as well as the buyer of the product, to the community as well, and those who give the effort. The point is this: a healthy economy is both individualistic and community-oriented at the same time.  Innovation and competition can be disruptive, but they must be set within a fair set of rules. When the system stacks to the wealthiest or is outsourced by faceless corporations in the name of advancing quarterly profits, exploiting the poor elsewhere and damaging the environment, it sets in motion a series of things: lost jobs, lost community cohesion, and a breakdown of life's stability.  Tie this to a loss of the formative institutions in our society of family life, faith life, and civic life, and we drift. We drift without a national narrative that can hold, and it makes it much more difficult to respond holistically, especially when we have tragedies such as the senseless horror in Las Vegas and now with the unthinkable at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs,  But, again, Madam Speaker, I just have to pause and remind myself that, in spite of these difficulties, in spite of sometimes the darkness which can seem overwhelming due to a lack of unity, we will pause on Friday as a nation, and we will remember our veterans. If it is just too much and too overwhelming, if the debates in Congress are so bothersome and annoying, go talk to a vet about that deeper sense of who we are and what we still can be.  Madam Speaker, in the entryway of the municipal building in a little town of France called Sainte-Mere-Eglise, there hangs an American flag. It is the first thing you see when you walk into the mayor's municipal building.  Sainte-Mere-Eglise was the site where our paratroopers landed prior to the D-day invasion. They landed in the midst of German troop formations and had to fight as they were coming down. One paratrooper got hung up on the church steeple and survived the battle. A replica of him still hangs there today.  The American flag in the mayor's building, in the municipal building, is said to be the first American flag planted on the European continent during the war. It is displayed there in France in a government building proudly as a memorial in thanksgiving to America for what we did to save France and to save Europe from tyranny.  Now, Madam Speaker, most of us today think of war in the traditional construct. We fought with tanks, aircraft, ships, and infantry. But, again, we are in a rapidly advancing technological new age. Even in this age of drones and asymmetrical terror threats such as improvised explosive devices, most of us still see our defense through a conventional lens.  But warfare is changing fast and will continue to change. With the miniaturization of nuclear weapons, drones, and other technologies, we could see the potential for widespread destruction accelerate. We are entering an era that is unprecedented and unpredictable, born from the very technologies that heretofore ensured our own survival. What has emerged, Madam Speaker, is a tripolar world, simultaneously increasing both danger and, interestingly, opportunity.  On one pole stands As this country ascends to economic dominance, China is trying to pair its military clout with military projection in key lanes of commerce. The Communist Party leader, President Xi, projects himself as both a man of virtue and a man of dominance. In fact, The Economist magazine recently called him the world's most powerful man.  At another pole stands Though they face demographic problems, Russia has, in many ways, raced ahead of us in weapons technology superiority. It could be argued that the Soviet era was an aberration, an actual aberration, of Russia's long tradition of czarist rule. Seen in that light, Putin is a new czar type who has moved past Marxist ideology--Marxist theology, perhaps we should say--to recover Russian nationalistic poetry, purpose, and expansionistic power.  The third pole is less of a geographic or ideological proposition. It is an expression of higher ideals. Now, in traditional terms, Madam Speaker, we call this the Transatlantic Alliance, but, in broader terms, it is people from around the world who are guided by a reasoned intuitive sense that all persons have dignity and rights and that the systems of governance and economics ought to be ordered around that very proposition. When a person can exercise excellence for themselves in partnership with others in community, a community of possibility exists.  Because, in America, we believe these values are universal, we also believe that they are more potent than any ideology or accident of geography. That is the long arc of history--born in former ages and translated over time to our present day.  Now, given our vulnerabilities, we understandably and purposefully commit to technological superiority in weaponry. But, as a singular proposition, this is illogical because it cannot hold. The technological gap is closing. There must be more, and it is found in two pathways:  First, back to this idea of our own internal reflection as a country. Recently, we saw a Hollywood elite named Harvey Weinstein brought to shame for his manipulative perversions. Interestingly, this country had a flash of collective conscience. The curtain was raised on Hollywood's dark hypocrisy. Almost all Americans were aghast, which, importantly, showed our capacity to value human dignity.  Second, Madam Speaker, a healthy national conscience gives us the credibility to reinvigorate and rebuild authentic relationships worldwide. By incentivizing good economic models and promoting government models that are fair, we can create the conditions for our own safety, the world's stability, and the world's security.  Madam Speaker, a couple weeks ago, I was on my way home from Washington to Driving from the airport, I saw a big, red pickup truck.[[Page H8659]]Now, that is not a very uncommon site in our State, except that on each side of the truck was a pole, and attached to each pole was an American flag blowing fiercely in the wind. Now, these flags were a bit tattered on the edges, but, nevertheless, they were proudly displayed just like at that little French town, Sainte-Mere-It is my hope that this is the third pole that can truly hold for our good and the good of others across the world.  Now, Madam Speaker, we have talked a lot about the struggles, but closer to home and made in realtime policy, the House of Representatives has undertaken a sincere deliberation at the moment to assist in a structural change to our current economic construct--a new tax deal.  Now, this is what Andy from Nebraska wrote me recently. He said that he is very encouraged because ``if it makes it into law, my back-of-the-napkin calculations show it could benefit my family by around $5,500. For a family of four making about $85,000 a year, that's a big deal.''                              {time}  1945  Madam Speaker, Americans do need a break, especially working men and women trying to get a bit ahead, trying to provide for their families. For many, it is harder and harder. Around 50 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. That is not fully a Tax Code problem. It is also the harsh reality of social fragmentation, downward mobility, and the rising cost of living.  Many forces of globalization have not benefited America, leaving millions behind and all too often forgotten. But tax reform can help, as long as it is fair and as simple as possible for the benefit of all.  We are living in an age where we cannot push the same old policies over and over again and expect them to fit into our 21st century architect of living.  Moving forward, I believe that the source and strength of the American economy will be in the new urbanism of small business, in which entrepreneurs from village to city will add value through small-scale manufacturing, innovative new products, or brokering in repair services. The conditions for entrepreneurial revival may be right on the horizon.  Madam Speaker, though the corporate structure of the 1950s has been made temporarily beguiling by the modest show called ``Mad Men,'' but no young person I know yearns to work for a company for 25 years and celebrate at the end with a gold watch. That era is over and our Tax Code is based on old constructs of what it means to be in business.  So, hopefully, as we work ourselves through this important debate, this bill will be sensitive to the needs of all Americans as it begins to push for a modernized revenue construct that no longer enables complex, lawyered-up, quarterly profit-driven multinationals to unjustly benefit, for instance, from lower taxes abroad while taking advantage of tax loopholes here.  At the same time, it uses the carrot of lower rates to bring foreign profits back to America so that we can revive the Made in America label once again.  Madam Speaker, I have spoken tonight about our challenges both at home and abroad, but we know a truly just and good society can only be possible if we are both strong and safe.  One day, I was in the airport and something interesting happened. A number of troops were coming off an aircraft on the jetway. There was no announcement over the PA system. It just happened spontaneously. The terminal began to break out in applause. It just happened. People intuited that something was right here.  Of course, many people at this moment in our country's history intuit that something is broken, but they also can sense when things are right. We can see it, like when we see our troops or we see a veteran, then our instinct emerges to recognize the nobility of self-sacrifice for one another, our country, and its timeless ideals. Our veterans have done so and our people know so.  When it just gets a little too overwhelming, Madam Speaker, ask a vet. When we lose touch with the source of our strength and greatness, talk to those who have put even possibly their lives on the line for that true source of American strength. Ask a vet.  When it seems as though the problems before us are intractable--how we are going to revive an economy that is good and fair to all; how we are going create the stability necessary for the proper engagement and healthy engagement and exciting engagement with people from abroad; how will we create international stability--when it just seems too hard to get the mind around it, ask a vet who stood in the small village overseas, who may have had to fight their way in, but then offers a hand up to those who have been placed in harm's way.  This Friday is an important holiday. It is a gift to be able to say thank you to our veterans.  Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the amount of time remaining?  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Meanwhile, bureaucrats in Washington are busy setting policies that have a widespread impact on every workplace in the country. As we learned during the Obama administration and from rulings made by the previous National Labor Relations Board, too often these policies do far more harm than good.  When it comes to rules and policies governing our Nation's workforce, there has never been a greater need for Congress to clarify areas of the law that shouldn't be left up to boards and Federal agencies to decide. That is especially true regarding the joint employer issue. In 2015, when the Obama administration's NLRB unilaterally redefined what it means to be a joint employer, the result was massive confusion and uncertainty.

110,topic-id,993,"Thank you, Mr. Like the Senator from Illinois, I rise to voice my opposition to the nomination of Bill Wehrum to serve as the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection  The Office of Air and Radiation oversees matters that are critical to human and environmental health, specifically, air and radiation but also climate change, air quality, and vehicle emissions.  If confirmed, Mr.Wehrum would be responsible for these immensely important issues, which require putting the health of our citizens above industry interests. Given this, I don't know why the Senate would confirm him for this position.  Mr.Wehrum has already served in this role in an acting capacity during the Bush administration. His confirmation was blocked by the Senate in 2006. His prior tenure shows that he will not fulfill the mission of the EPA to protect human health and the environment. In fact, he has a record of putting corporate profits before the well-being of citizens.  During his tenure in the Bush administration, Mr.Wehrum rolled back clean air safeguards that protect public[[Page S7106]]health on 27 occasions. His actions were challenged in court for not fulfilling the requirements of the Clean Air Act, and 27 times the court ruled against Mr. One particular issue that he was involved in was mercury pollution. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has to reduce hazardous air pollutants like mercury, which is particularly harmful to children. Instead of protecting this population from mercury pollution, a neurotoxin, Mr.Wehrum decided to advance the interests of polluters.  During his tenure, Mr.Wehrum also led efforts to prevent EPA from addressing climate pollution. Fortunately, the Supreme Court eventually ruled in favor of regulating greenhouse gases, forcing the Agency to take action.  After the Senate blocked his nomination in 2006, Mr.Wehrum decided he would undermine the mission of the Agency on behalf of polluters. In his current role as a corporate attorney, he has sued the EPA multiple times on behalf of clients in the oil, gas, coal, and chemical industries to undermine protections that safeguard public health and the environment. He has used his current position to attack the renewable fuel standard, which requires biofuels to be blended with gasoline--something the big oil companies hate because it means serious competition for dirty oil. So as an attorney for the American Petroleum Institute--the trade association that represents ExxonMobil, BP, and a number of other oil and gas giants--Mr.Wehrum sued the EPA at least four times in an effort to weaken the RFS, the renewable fuel standard. This is deeply troubling, considering that if he gets this job, he will be in charge of administering the RFS, which will allow him to implement his clear agenda. He has done nothing to lead us to believe he would do anything but side with the giant oil companies.  The facts are clear. The RFS boosts energy security, it creates rural jobs, and it is better for the environment than oil. You are never going to see an ethanol spill in the Gulf of  Colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree that despite this bipartisan support, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has reduced advanced biofuel blending targets for 2018. Now, with Mr.Wehrum's nomination, I have even less confidence in this administration upholding Congress's intent on the  He also has a history of willful ignorance of science. When asked whether he believes that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main drivers of climate change, Mr.Wehrum stated that he believes it is an open question--an answer that runs contrary to the conclusion of 97 percent of climate scientists and runs counter to the ``National Climate Assessment'' that was released by this administration just last week.  Emissions from fossil fuel-fired powerplants are some of the main contributors to climate change. We know this. At the Office of Air and Radiation, Mr.Wehrum would oversee the repeal of standards that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, the Clean Power He would also be in charge of crafting a weaker replacement, if any.  Let me be clear. A weak standard is an affront to the public health and safety of future generations.  To overcome the challenge of climate change, we must transform our economy to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If we don't, Americans and future generations will pay an unacceptable price. But rather than driving innovation and pushing us to overcome this challenge, the administration has ordered a retreat. You can see that retreat everywhere, in a budget that would gut funding for science and innovation, in an EPA that values industry profits over the welfare of the public.  The 23rd annual United Nations climate change conference is taking place right now in Bonn, Two years ago, 195 nations came together to sign the Paris climate agreement in a historic display of the power of collective human will, and they did it because of U.leadership.  Now contrast that to earlier this year, when President Trump ordered the United States to retreat. He announced that he was pulling us out of the Paris climate agreement.  Yesterday, Syria announced that it would ratify the agreement. They were the last remaining nation to not be a part of this agreement. We now stand alone as the only country in the world choosing not to be part of the global effort to combat climate change.  Let's be clear. The President has not only ceded leadership, but he has isolated the United States from the global community. He has put us in this dangerous situation simply to protect short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry.  Mr.Wehrum would exacerbate this administration's wrong-headed approach. He is anti-science, anti-public health, anti-environment. That is why the Senate blocked his nomination in 2006. The Senate recognized then that he wasn't fit for the job. He is even less fit today.

1095,topic-id,977,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about the importance of bipartisan action on healthcare, as the Senator from New Hampshire just did.  Over the past year, I have traveled all around Minnesota to talk with individuals and families and community leaders about healthcare. I have heard from mothers and fathers who have been worried about losing the healthcare their children need to access lifesaving services. I have heard from daughters who have been panicked about how to pay for their parents' long-term care and prescription drug costs. I have heard from hospital executives in rural areas, much like the rural areas in Arkansas, who have been concerned about how they are going to keep their doors open.  What is abundantly clear from all of these conversations is that Minnesotans want Congress to work together to build on the Affordable Care Act, lower healthcare costs, and support policies that work. That is why I believe, first, that Congress must act immediately to[[Page S7091]]pass bipartisan legislation to stabilize the individual market. Second, we must do all we can to support strong enrollment in our health insurance exchanges so that all consumers, regardless of their health needs, can find high-quality, affordable health insurance coverage. Third, it is time to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Let me take each of those in turn.  When Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee got to work and developed a bipartisan plan to stabilize the individual market. As a member of that committee, I participated in numerous hearings with witnesses who spanned the ideological spectrum, solicited input from State and national leaders, and worked in good faith with all of my colleagues to develop legislation that is truly a compromise bill.  This legislation, referred to as the Alexander-Murray deal, will contain healthcare costs for consumers, provide certainty to insurers participating in these markets, and provide States with the flexibility they need to develop innovative, local solutions. I am proud of what we were able to accomplish.  What I am most proud of is that this bill includes a provision that will reverse a decision by the Trump administration that would effectively punish Minnesota for pushing forward a bipartisan plan to stabilize the individual market--a bipartisan plan in our State legislature.  Last year, after our State experienced dramatic premium rate hikes in the individual markets, State leaders worked together in a bipartisan way to pass a reinsurance program to contain these costs, but the program's enactment was contingent upon approval from the Federal  After months of foot-dragging, the Federal Government finally approved the State's reinsurance plan as part of the 1332 waiver proposal, but the Federal Government simultaneously cut Federal funding for MinnesotaCare, which is another program in the State that provides affordable health coverage to working families. Thus, our State had to choose whether to support a bipartisan proposal to stabilize the individual market and lower premiums for consumers or swallow hundreds of millions of dollars in lost Federal funding. It was an impossible choice that was completely unnecessary. That is why I set to work to fix it.  After weeks of productive negotiations, I am pleased to report that the Alexander-Murray deal will prevent the Trump administration from imposing these cuts on But my State wasn't the only one threatened by potential funding cuts. The Alexander-Murray bill would prevent such problems from occurring in any other State as well, and it would do much more.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this agreement would reduce the deficit by billions of dollars, lower premiums in 2019, and preserve coverage options for individuals and families. In short, it is not only good for Minnesota, it is good for the entire country. This bill is a bipartisan win-win-win.  Now our job is to pass this legislation into law. At the same time, we must do everything we can to drive up enrollment in the health insurance exchanges. Regardless of party, if we want to ensure that consumers have access to affordable, high-quality health insurance coverage, we have to get people to sign up for the coverage. More people equals better risk pools, which equals lower premiums. It is really that simple.  Look, the Trump administration has done everything in its power to undermine It has halved the amount of time that people have to enroll in coverage, it slashed funding for outreach and enrollment efforts, and it deliberately misled consumers about the benefits of the ACA and individual requirements for coverage. But we have the power to combat these efforts.  Let's get people enrolled. Open enrollment started on November 1 and will end for most people on December 15. Minnesotans are lucky in that they have until January 14 to sign up for coverage. But everyone who doesn't receive coverage from their employer or through Medicare needs to sign up now, so I urge my colleagues to get their constituents to visit healthcare.gov and shop around and then enroll in coverage.  Lastly, it is time to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, community health centers, and the National Health Service These have always been bipartisan programs. There is no reason this should be any different today.  The anxiety that people in Minnesota and across the country feel about their access to healthcare is not inevitable; it is the result of political decisions made here in Washington, Let's prove to the country that we are not here to fight with each other, we are here to fight for them. Let's show them that we can get something done. Let's take action to protect healthcare and give our constituents, at long last, some peace of mind.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

273,topic-id,1774,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, H.3441, the Save Local Business Act, would fundamentally redefine the relationship between employers and employees.  Mr.Speaker, corporate profits and income inequality are at an all-time high, yet we are debating a bill that would strip workers of their right to hold employers accountable, allowing corporations to further stifle wage growth and undermine collective bargaining. This is yet another Republican attempt to make the rich richer and the working people poorer, just like their tax bill. What we should be fighting for is a living wage and employee rights.  My Republican colleagues say the law is ambiguous and we must act to save small businesses. The law is not ambiguous. They just don't like it because it holds businesses responsible and forces them to bargain with unions. This bill is an assault on workers.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Economic Policy Institute outlining how H.3441 will ensure small businesses are left with sole responsibility for business practices often dictated by large corporations; and, in addition, a letter from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters opposing this bill in support of workers protections.                                    Economic Policy Institute,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2017.     Virginia Foxx,     Chairwoman, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of              Bobby Scott,     Ranking Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House          of       Dear Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: On behalf of      the Economic Policy Institute Policy Center, we write to      express our strong opposition the H.3441, the so-called      ``Save Local Business Act,'' which would do nothing to      protect small business owners or their workers. The Economic      Policy Institute is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank      founded in 1986, and our labor policy unit assesses actions      by Congress and federal agencies that impact workers and the      economy. We urge you to oppose this legislation.       The so-called ``Save Local Business Act'' (H.3441) would      roll back the joint employer standards under both the      National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Fair Labor      Standards Act (FLSA). It has nothing to do with protecting      small businesses. In fact, the bill would ensure that small      businesses are left with sole responsibility for business      practices often mandated by large corporations like      franchisors. It would establish a joint employer standard      that lets big corporations avoid liability for labor and      employment violations and leaves small businesses on the      hook.       Given the realities of the modern workplace, in which      employees often find themselves subject to more than one      employer, working people deserve a joint employer standard      that guarantees their rights and protections under basic      labor and employment laws. Instead, this bill would establish      a standard that makes it nearly impossible for workers whose      wages are stolen or who are fired for supporting a union to      get justice. By limiting employer responsibility to only      those firms who ``directly, actually, and immediately''      exercise significant control over the essential terms and      conditions of employment, the bill would enable large firms      that contract for services to evade responsibility under both      the NLRA and the       When two or more businesses co-determine or share control      over a worker's pay, schedule, or job duties, then both of      those businesses should be considered employers. A weak joint      employer standard robs workers of their rights, making it      impossible for them to effectively collectively bargain or      litigate workplace disputes--and it leaves small businesses      holding the bag when the large corporations that control      their business practices and set their employees' schedules      violate labor law and refuse to come to the bargaining table.      If this committee wishes to support small businesses and the      workers they employ, then it should support a strong joint      employer standard rather than this legislation.       Since the NLRB narrowed its joint employer standard in      1984, contingent and alternative workforce arrangements--     including reliance on temporary staffing firms and      contractors to outsource services traditionally performed by      in-house workers--have grown dramatically. Recent estimates      find that 15.8 percent of workers were engaged in alternative      work arrangements in late 2015, or around 24 million workers      in today's labor market.       The NLRB's 2015 decision in Browning-Ferris Industries      addressed this issue, requiring all firms that control the      terms and conditions of employment to come to the bargaining      table, ensuring that workers are again able to engage in      their right to collective bargaining. Employers already face      only narrow liability under Browning-Ferris, and the Board      would examine the specific circumstances of each case before      making a determination. Nothing in the decision implies that      all employers in a specific industry will be found to be      joint employers under the       Similarly, the Wage & Hour Division's Administrator's      Interpretation on the joint employer standard under the FLSA      did not create any new policy; rather, it simply sought to      make clear for employers their responsibilities under      existing court law and opinion, and to provide the exact kind      of clarity and guidance to employers and the regulated      community that proponents of the H.3441 purport to seek.      And yet, earlier this year, the U.Department of Labor      rescinded that Administrator's Interpretation, hiding it from      view.       In spite of its title, H.3441 does nothing to save local      businesses. Instead, it saves large corporations from any      responsibility for violations of the FLSA and The      legislation leaves small businesses and their workers without      meaningful recourse. We urge you, your fellow Committee      members, and all Members of the House of Representatives to      oppose this bill.

House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members      of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am writing      to express our vigorous opposition to H.3441, the Save      Local Business I strongly urge you to reject this      legislation.       H.3441 seeks to legislate around a century of consistent      case law and established joint employer standards in labor      and employment law. The bill redefines the term ``employer''      so narrowly that many workers will have no remedy when their      employers violate wage laws or their rights to organize and      bargain collectively. We believe the legislation will      encourage ``gaming the system'' so that no one exercises      enough control to be liable as an employer.       The legislation would overturn the National Labor Relations      Board (NLRB) Browning-Ferris decision and leave worker      protections weaker than they were prior to Congress adopting      the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935. On August      27, 2015, the NLRB, in its Browning Ferris Industries (BFI)      decision, affirmed the basic principle that two or more      employers are joint employers of the same employees if they      are both employers under common law and they ``share or co-     determine those matters governing the essential terms and      conditions of employment.'' H.3441 would overturn this      decision and allow employers to evade their responsibility to      engage in meaningful collective bargaining.       The BFI case involves a labor-only, cost-plus staffing      contract under which BFI has subcontracted the employment      relationship only to a staffing agency, BFI owns      the facility and equipment on which Leadpoint's employees      work; it directs the quality and quantity of work performed      by Leadpoint workers.       BFI oversees operations with its own personnel and retains      authority to approve or reject Leadpoint's workers. Leadpoint      can only pay its workers amounts that comply with its      staffing agreement with As the NLRB noted, the Union      ``assert(ed) that absent a change in the joint-employer      standard, a putative employer, like BFI, that is a necessary      party to meaningful collective bargaining will continue to      insulate itself by the `calculated restructuring of      employment and insertion of a contractor to insulate itself      from the basic legal obligation to recognize and bargain with      employees' representative.''       The NLRB joint employer decision is not a dramatic      departure from existing law. It does not upend business as we      know it, nor does it undermine the franchise business model,      as many have claimed. Current law balances the interests of      workers and employers by requiring a fact specific inquiry to      determine whether or not there is a joint[[Page H8569]]     employer relationship. The NLRB joint employer decision in      the BFI case is fact specific and clarifies the joint      employment standard.       Workers at BFI/Leadpoint chose to exercise their right to      determine whether they wanted to organize and bargain      collectively. Workers voted and the ballots from that      election were impounded pending a decision in the BFI case.      After the NLRB issued its decision, the ballots were counted.      The BFI/Leadpoint workers decisively declared their desire to      bargain collectively by voting 4-1 in favor of Teamster      representation. The NLRB ruling will allow these (and other)      workers to negotiate with and hold accountable the employer      which actually controls the terms and conditions of their      jobs. This legislation will deny them the ability to do so.       Not only would H.3441 overturn the BFI decision, the      bill would also drastically change the definition of      employment relationships under the Fair Labor Standards Act      (FLSA). The FLSA currently recognizes that more than one      business can be an employer. Thus, an employer cannot hide      behind labor contractors, brokers, or others. For example,      while there are many responsible employers in the      construction industry, it is well known that abusive schemes      are far too prevalent in this industry as well as others.      Contractors use subcontractors or labor brokers who      intentionally misclassify workers as independent contractors      or pay them ``off the books'' to the disadvantage of      responsible employers. We believe this legislation will serve      as an incentive for worker misclassification to defeat      employment and labor law, as well as facilitate tax      avoidance.       Because the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers      Protection Act (MSAWPA) refers to the definition of      ``employ'' in the FLSA, H.3441 will have an adverse effect      on the ability of workers covered by the MSAWPA to      effectively enforce child labor laws, and seek redress for      wage theft and other employment abuses.

I also thank our friends on the other side of the aisle who have been pushing this issue forward constantly year after year, as we will continue to do so until this issue is resolved.  So many of our servicemembers have selflessly put their lives on the line to protect and defend our country. Our country owes them a debt of gratitude, something we are often reminded of every year around this time as we head into Veterans  Unfortunately, too often, our fellow servicemembers are coming home and they are being prevented from receiving the care that they have earned through their service. They bear the brunt of the human cost of war with an average of 20 veterans committing suicide every single day. Their families carry this sacrifice and this cost throughout their lives.  The rate of mental health and substance use disorders has been steadily rising since 2001. This legislation is bipartisan and would require the VA to provide urgent mental healthcare services, including an initial mental health assessment to veterans who have participated in combat operations or who have survived sexual assault or harassment.  It would also expand those services to those who received a discharge under certain other than honorable conditions who haven't received the character of service or discharge determination yet.  We have heard already about the high numbers of veterans who fall into this category and about how negatively this discharge has affected their lives. When they come home, they are working on their transition to a successful civilian life. This discharge takes away their access to healthcare. It takes away their access to services and benefits that they have earned through, many times, multiple deployments, services that are in place to help set our veterans up for success upon their return home.  In addition, this bill would require the VA to provide services at non-VA facilities for veterans who live in rural or underserved communities.                              {time}  1500  I can't state enough how important this is because it affects those veterans in my district, and on different islands in the State of Hawaii, who are separated literally by a body of water from the VA clinic.

404,topic-id,1097,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, we are at risk of a coup d'etat in this country if we allow an unaccountable person with no oversight to undermine the duly-elected President of the United States, and I would offer that is precisely what is happening right now with the indisputable conflicts of interest that are present with Mr.Mueller and others at the Department of  I join my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, in calling for Mr.Mueller's resignation or his firing.  Moreover, we absolutely have to see the Department of Justice appoint a special counsel to look into the Clinton Foundation, the Uranium One deal, and the Fusion GPS dossier that I will now have the opportunity to discuss.  I really don't know who is investigating the Uranium One deal right now. I know that, in July, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, along with 20 members of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Sessions asking who would be looking into these critical questions, demanding that a special counsel be appointed to conduct a thorough review. It is extremely disappointing that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and my fellow members have received no response from the Department of Justice as to that letter.  I don't know whether the Attorney General's recusal on matters related to Russia impacts, influences, or, in any way, covers the Fusion GPS challenge and the incredible threat to national security raised by the Uranium One deal.  I do know that there is no world in which Mr.Mueller could potentially investigate these matters. It is Federal law that even the appearance of a conflict of interest means that someone cannot engage in prosecutorial duties regarding allegations and investigations. That conflict of interest is absolutely present.  As early as 2009, the FBI knew that we had informants alleging corruption into United States uranium assets. There were allegations of bribery, kickbacks, extortion. Even in 2010, Members of Congress were raising these questions and asking the Obama administration to provide answers that were never given.  I don't think it is a coincidence that at the same time we were hearing from sources that there was bribery to influence our uranium assets, you had former President Bill Clinton getting paid $500,000 by a bunch of Russians to go give a speech. It must have been one hell of a speech. It is deeply troubling to me that these circumstances seem to be ripe for corruption and seem to demonstrate an ecosystem of corruption that must be thoroughly investigated.  Now, why can't Mr.Mueller and Mr.Rosenstein conduct this investigation? First of all, Mr.Mueller was the head of the FBI in 2009. He potentially had a role to play in these questions. At the very least, the fact that the FBI never prosecuted any case, never raised objections, never allowed Congress to be able to look into these matters, that would be an act of omission.  So at best, there is an omission that creates a conflict for Mr.Mueller; at worst, there might have been actual malfeasance or active negligence. And in those circumstances, we need fresh eyes and clear eyes to give the American people confidence that our justice system is, in fact, working for them.  It is not only the Uranium One deal that gives us a great deal to question. We also have this Fusion GPS dossier, which we have now learned that the Democratic Party was paying for. The Democratic Party was out paying people to stir up this salacious and inaccurate dirt on President Trump both before and after he was elected.  In his own testimony before the Congress, Mr.Comey said that these allegations were salacious and could not be relied upon. So it begs the question, what was the Fusion GPS dossier relied upon for? Was it relied upon so that there would be FISA warrants issued to go and spy on the President and members of his team? We don't know, but until we have a special counsel, we will never get those answers, because Mueller and Rosenstein are conflicted.  Why did Congress never hear from these informants? Well, it is no surprise to me. You actually have Mr.Rosenstein's name on the signature block of the pleadings that sealed the information that could have shed light on this entire scandal, but we didn't have that opportunity.  Now, it may very well be that these were simply acts of negligence, acts of omission or oversight. If that is the case, let's get someone in who can give us the answers, because certainly the people who are there now cannot give us answers, and they have these tragic conflicts of interest.  The American people are well aware that the Clinton Foundation functioned largely as a money laundering organization to influence the State Department and to ensure that there were special people with special access and special relationships to the Clintons who got special treatment. That is not an America that abides to the rule of law.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we have to see the rule of law held up and cherished. We are a model for the world, but if we have circumstances where our President, who was elected, is undermined as a consequence of these things, if we do not replace Bob Mueller with someone who can come in absent of association with the individuals who may be implicated, then I fear this great, special place that we hold in the world may be diminished.  So I have introduced legislation. I am very pleased that my colleagues have joined me in sponsoring that legislation, calling for Mr.Mueller to resign. I have also called for a special counsel to be appointed.  To my colleagues on the other side who say, well, hey, you know, there were a variety of agencies that were involved in approving the Uranium One deal, there were eight or nine groups that could have said no.[[Page H8585]]                                {time}  1900  Are Members of Congress really taking the position that the Clintons don't have their tentacles in just about every agency of government?  How ludicrous.

Unfortunately, a proposed amendment by Mr.LaMalfa, my good Republican colleague, and me to require such a supplemental impact statement was not included in the bill.

605,topic-id,2232,"Mr.Speaker, I came here to talk about tax policy, and I will; however, having listened for the last 60 minutes to the most remarkable admission that Russia is meddling in America in many, many ways, even an admission that Russia somehow wants to influence America's elections--in this case, America's elections for the last year--I am pleased that my Republican colleagues are so adamant in pursuing Russian influence and, perhaps, controversial influence in the United I am pleased that they are doing that.  I am also pleased that Mr.Mueller is continuing his investigations. I will note that there have been two indictments and one guilty plea that have already come forth from his investigation having to do with people that are very, very close to President Trump's administration.  More will come of that, and I certainly hope our Republican friends will continue to focus on the fact that Russia is playing very serious and, quite possibly, illegal games or activities here in the United  We will carry on. I firmly believe that Mr.Mueller is not about to resign or be fired. If he were to be fired, I would suspect that there would be far more serious consequences than the kind of yapping we just heard for the last hour here on the floor.  Let me go back to my original point, which has to do with tax policy. As interesting as Russia might be, tax policy is going to be far, far more consequential in the long term. Whatever comes of the Russian situation in the election and conspiracies or other kinds of conflicts will bear themselves out over the next several years or months. Tax policy, however, is something that America is going to live with for a long, long time, were it to pass.  There are many things we could say about it. One is that, yes, the top 1 percent of America's wealthiest people--you take 360 million of us Americans and take the top 1 percent--are going to get 50 percent of all of the tax cuts that are in this multitrillion-dollar tax cut legislation.  So a trillion and a half dollars over the next 10 years to the top 1 percent ought to really drive up that problem that we call income disparity in the United States, you know, what we used to talk about: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, or that America has a real problem with the superwealthy controlling most of the wealth and the rest of Americans really left behind.  So this tax bill is going to make it even worse. Now, that is really good. How does it do that?  Well, let's see. By eliminating the estate tax. Yes, five members of President Trump's Cabinet, including the President, would benefit in the billions. You see, the estate tax would be eliminated in just 4 years, about the same time they would be leaving the administration.  What does that mean?  Well, if you have a billion-dollar estate and there is a tax on that, you can eliminate the first $10 million, $11 million of that, but you have a 40 percent tax on the remainder. Well, that is about $400 million in estate tax.  Who would have a billion-dollar estate?  The President, Mr.Ross, the Treasury Secretary, maybe the Education Secretary, maybe others.  So who is going to benefit from this?  The superwealthy, to the tune of millions upon millions or hundreds of millions of dollars of the estate tax itself.  There is much more to that. American corporations would see their top rating from 39 down to 20. Who is going to benefit from that?  Well, we heard the Treasury Secretary say the American workers will.  Where is the evidence for that?  There is no evidence for that, none at all; in fact, quite the contrary. The Treasury Department's own tax analysis section says that 70 percent of the after-profit taxes now go to, guess who. Stockholders and executives, not to the workers.  It used to be that way back in the sixties and seventies. Maybe 70 percent went to the workers, went to increasing plants and equipment, investments in the United It is not that way anymore. Quite the contrary. The American workers will be left behind once again by those tax reductions.  That is not to say we shouldn't reduce the nominal tax rate for corporations. Yes, we should, but we should do it in a way that actually helps American workers. It keeps investments in the United But, no, not this tax proposal. This one actually creates what is called territorial accounting for international corporations.  Let's suppose that you have an international corporation located in Silicon We have some really big ones there. Territorial taxes would be that all of the earnings that that corporation has outside of the United States would be beyond being taxed by the United States, even though it is an American corporation that can manipulate the price of its goods and services to actually push, overseas, its profits.  You want to bring jobs back to America? Don't do territorial tax reform. It doesn't work for the American worker. It works for the stockholders. Their stocks and stock prices will go up. They will be able to receive even more benefits.  That is only $3 trillion over 10 years of reduction for corporation taxes.  Who benefits?  Wall Street corporate executives.  Who loses?  The American worker loses.  One more thing that is on my mind is that I used to hear last year, the year before last, the year before that--in fact, for the last two decades--a lot of talk from about more than half of the Members of this House of Representatives who would talk about the horrible impact of the American deficit and that it would lead to ruin for the American economy, our grandchildren would be left to pay it off, and all the horrible things that the deficit would bring to the United States, ultimately leading to the collapse of the American economy.[[Page H8591]]  Well, there is some truth in that. The hyperbole was a little bit more than necessary, but, indeed, it is a problem to see our deficit ever increasing.  Every now and then, we come up against the debt limit, and, oh, my goodness, the debate that took place here: We have got to stop it. We have got to stop deficit financing. We have got to bring our budget back into balance.  Not a bad idea. In fact, it is the right thing to do. And, by the way, it was actually done during the Clinton administration.  For 2 years, almost 3 years, the American Federal Government ran a surplus, and it was estimated that in the 2000 to 2010 period, if that surplus were to continue, it might lead to a significant and troublesome reduction in the American debt. That is a complex question as to why that would be troublesome, but, nonetheless, it was said.                              {time}  2000  So what happened?  George Bush came in, cut taxes, decided we would go to war, first war ever in America's history that was not financed by taxes but by borrowing, mostly from China, and the deficit began to explode. And then there was the great collapse in 2008, and the deficit went right through the roof.  So we have been living, since that time of the George Bush tax cuts with a deficit, a structural deficit that has not been solved despite all the rhetoric from the deficit hawks.  Now, I guess the deficit hawks, like the Canadian geese, have somehow migrated to the far south of Washington, D.C., because I don't hear any around here today. They have migrated somewhere far away from But what I hear from those previous folks that called themselves deficit hawks is that they want to drive up the American deficit, that they have a proposal to actually increase the American deficit.  Oh, wonderful, they say, not to worry. We can increase the deficit by well over $1.5 trillion in the next decade and it will be lovely. We will create more jobs.  I am going: Excuse me. I must have missed something in this debate. You just said a year ago that those deficits would somehow create a calamity for the American economy, that we would lose jobs, we would lose our competitiveness, that we would come to ruin, and now you are telling me I shouldn't worry about a $1.5 trillion increase in the deficit over the next decade?  Wow, how does that work? How does that happen?  I want to share something with you. I became--trying to understand what this was all about, how could it be 6 months ago or a year ago they were deficit hawks and they had to do away with the deficit and now they want to increase the deficit? What is this all about?  So I asked my staff: Give me some numbers. Don't we have what we know as a structural deficit built into the budget of the United States tax revenues significantly lower than the expenditures, and therefore we have this structural deficit? Show me what those numbers are.  So they did, and here they are.  Structural deficit, 2018, the structural deficit is $567 billion. That is half a trillion. That is the structural deficit that exists today without any of this discussion about tax cuts.  Next year, 2019, it is expected to be $689 billion, two-thirds of $1 trillion in 1 year--in 1 year.  And it goes on.  The structural deficit in 2020, $775 billion. That is the ongoing structural deficit in the Federal budget: revenue received, expenditures--expenditures $775 billion more than the revenue in 2020.  This isn't talking about the new tax cuts that are being discussed now here in  And so it goes.  In 2022, it is $1 trillion annual structural deficit.  So what does this tax cut mean?  Oh, it is only $1.4 trillion or $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period, but that is on top of the existing structural deficit.  So here you have it. This year, the existing structural deficit before any tax cuts, we are talking about $563 billion. Added to that, as a result of the Republican Ryan-McConnell-Trump tax cuts, we are adding $114 billion on top of $563 billion so that the structural deficit, should this new tax cut ever come into place, will be $677 billion--not millions, billions.  Over the next 10 years, by the end of the 10-year period, as that tax cut, this new tax cut goes into effect, with the addition adding to the existing structural deficit, in the year 2027, 10 years from now, you can expect a $1.6 trillion structural deficit.  This is a problem. It is a problem that is made even worse--even worse--by the fact that the benefit of the tax cut does not go to economic growth, but quite the contrary. It does not go to the working men and women, the middle class of America who really do need to have a better way, better wages, more money in their pockets, a better living, a better ability to take care of their family and their children, a better education, a better opportunity, and a better infrastructure. None of that will happen. Instead, what will happen as a result of the Republican tax cut is that the wealthy will get wealthier.  Remember this: 50 percent of all of the tax cut benefits--and we are talking trillions here, as much as $3 trillion over a 10-year period. Fifty percent of that will go to the top 1 percent of We are talking the superwealthy here.  That is not a better way. That is an awful way to run a government. That is an awful thing for an economy when you continue to skew the American economy to the superwealthy and leave behind the American worker, the American family struggling to do better, struggling to have a better opportunity for their children in school, a better road or a better bus or a better train on which to travel, a better transportation system.  So here we are. Here we are in the House of Representatives debating in committee today how to make the deficit worse, how to increase the structural deficit over the next 10 years, how to literally run this country into bankruptcy.  No, we are not going to go bankrupt, but what we will do, we will terminate key programs as we struggle to find ways of balancing the budget with so little Federal revenue available to us as a result of these tax cuts. I could probably go on for an hour and just work myself into a rage about the lost opportunity.  We Democrats have proposed a better solution, a better way to deal with the tax policies, one that actually provides benefits to the working families of America, who, as our Republican friends like to say, sit around the kitchen table and worry about their debts. Yes, indeed, they do. They worry about it. We have a better way of providing for the infrastructure, a better way of providing for our national security, our education, and on and on.

You talked about Medicare and you talked about Medicaid, of which 60 percent of Medicaid goes to seniors in nursing homes across this Nation, and the potential cut that would come to  You also talked about how it would, as you just did, go after the education system, after research that we need for medical research, and economics, and all of the sciences. You talked about the infrastructure.  You laid out that that budget bill was the template. We are now seeing that template come to reality on the floor of the House first with this tax cut. Probably within months, should this tax bill pass, we are going to see the rest of what you told us to watch out for. Watch out for the cuts coming to Medicare, watch out for the cuts coming to Medicaid, to education, to infrastructure, to the things that Americans depend upon in their daily lives, the Meals on Wheels program, and then the supplemental nutrition programs.  Standing right here, I remember I was in the back of the room here, and I heard you speak about what would happen if that budget bill passed the It did. Now we are seeing the first step.

1104,topic-id,2417,"Mr.President, I rise today to talk about a historic opportunity that will soon be before this body. It is an opportunity to bring real relief to the American people. It is an opportunity to jolt our economy into a higher gear and bring real, tangible benefits to America's hard-working families.  It has been over 30 years since this country last reformed its Tax Over those 30 years, we have seen a lot of change. We have seen the country move from Ataris to smartphones and Wi-This photo shows a Ford LTD station wagon, which rolled off the assembly line 30 years ago. It is a car that any of us would have been excited to drive 30 years ago. Today we have cars that drive themselves. Unfortunately, we still have a tax code that is made for this  So while the world has changed around us and other countries have learned to craft tax codes to entice businesses to grow, our code has gotten more and more out of date and more and more laden with special-interest giveaways. Our Tax Code has turned Main Street into a dead end and our overseas growth into a one-way street.  Reforming the code is not only a way to give us an opportunity to end those giveaways, but it can also boost our economy. I applaud our colleagues in the House, who last week introduced and are working on a proposal to overhaul the tax system. In the coming days the Senate Finance Committee will introduce their own legislation.  While I will mostly focus my comments today on one aspect of tax reform, I will note that on Friday the Tax Foundation released its analysis of the House tax proposal. This analysis concluded that the House proposal would create 975,000 full-time-equivalent jobs and push GDP 3.9 percent higher than it would otherwise be. Taking into account the economic feedback from the proposed reforms, this means taxpayers would end up with 4.4 percent higher income. In other words, they will make greater, higher income as a result of the bill that the House is working on today. Indeed, the Tax Foundation concluded that the total after-tax gain in income for a middle-class family would be nearly $2,600.  Importantly, for my constituents in my home State of Colorado, the gain would be over $3,000. These are serious gains that will bring real, meaningful benefits to hard-working This is just the starting point for our reform. This number is over $3,000 of impact to the people of Colorado of additional income and tax relief. When a significant segment of Americans don't even have access within 24 hours to just a few hundred dollars, a $3,000 a year gain is a significant amount of money.  Today I would like to focus on one part of the tax reform package, and that is the lowering of taxes on America's job creators. Because we have this clunky Atari-era Tax Code--this Ford LTD station wagon Tax Code, our tax rates are no longer competitive. They encourage companies to invest abroad rather than right here at home in the United Back in 1986, when this car rolled off the assembly line, our corporate rate was competitive. It didn't discourage companies from investing in the United  Things have significantly changed since 1986. Foreign countries have figured it out. They lowered their tax rates, and now the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the[[Page S7095]]developed world--indeed, one of the highest tax rates in the world, period. Consequently, businesses have moved abroad more and more. They invested more abroad, and in the United States they have invested less and less.  It is not in the Republicans' view alone. I would draw your attention to this quote right here. President Obama noted this gradual deterioration of the corporate tax code in his 2011 State of the Union Address, saying:       [O]ver the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax      code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those      with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up      paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one      of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes      no sense, and it has to change.  Those are the words that President Barack Obama spoke to a joint session of Congress in 2011 in his State of the Union  The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that just moving the tax rates on corporations from the uncompetitive 35 percent to the middle-of-the-pack 20 percent and adding permanent full expensing of capital investments would increase GDP from 3 percent to 5 percent above what is currently forecasted. That increase would not just happen in a decade or two, it would be front-loaded, meaning that we would see a fast response from this economy, with 2.4 percent to 3.2 percent higher GDP in the first 3 to 5 years under this proposal. That boost will not just be to the corporate bottom line. It will increase the average American household income by $4,000.  Let me say that again. It will increase average household income in America by $4,000.  Since these estimates were released, since those numbers, statistics, and analysis have been done, opponents of pro-growth tax reform have thrown everything they can at the proposals and estimates to see what will stick to try to bring it down. They said these numbers are too rosy. They said that we can't possibly get a $4,000 increase in average household income because that would mean more money would end up in bank accounts of American households than is raised in revenue by the corporate income tax.  They said that corporations have been ``rolling in money'' for a long time. So if they wanted to invest in America they already would have. Some opponents say we should tax corporations more--take the profit that is sitting overseas and spend it as the government wishes. When opponents of tax relief see a company with money, their reaction is to take it--to take it like it is the Government's money. But we know that doesn't work. Even our European friends, whose residents tend to be far more open to socialist experiments, have rejected this notion. They know that tax reform is about creating the environment that will cause companies to invest in America, not attempting to seize profits from companies that can easily move elsewhere. That is why France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Greece--not exactly bastions of open economic innovation--have lower corporate tax rates than we do.  The chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, told the Joint Economic Committee recently:       This is not about right wing parties throwing money at rich      corporations. It is about economically literate governments      understanding that if we want wages to be higher, than we      have to give workers capital to work with.  Let me say that again. This effort for tax relief is about ``economically literate governments understanding that if we want wages to be higher, then we have to give workers capital to work with.''  Let's go back to the first response we heard from opponents of tax relief: It is ``absurd'' to think the average American household will get $4,000 more in income because that is more than the country raises in tax revenue.  In other words, if we took every dollar raised from corporate tax and handed it over to American families, they wouldn't get $4,000. That is the argument opponents of tax reform are saying, but this response simply doesn't get it.  What is the economically literate perspective?  Recall that a lot has changed over the last 30 years, but one thing hasn't changed, and that is the U.corporate tax rate. As you can see on this chart, the average OECD tax rates have dropped over time. You see the blue OECD line, and the orange line on the chart is straight across. The average OECD tax rates have dropped over time, but the U.rate stayed right where it is. The U.advantages that made it the place to invest in 1986 have slowly faded away. Other countries have used their tax rates to become more competitive, and companies have responded.  Business investment now is unfortunately low. Indeed, Chairman Hassett warned that there is a crisis in our country because of the lack of what is called capital deepening, which is just an economist's term for the impact of capital stock--things such as equipment, structures, and intellectual property--on worker productivity.  Worker productivity is, in turn, what drives up wages. That is what makes wages increase. The more productive a worker is, the more the employer is willing to pay that worker to keep him or her in the job with rising wages.  Going to another chart, we can see the effects of that. Prior to 1990, when corporate profits were going up by 1 percent, workers' wages went up by more than 1 percent. Since that time in the 1990s, we have seen change. From 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase in business profits corresponded with only a 0.3 percent increase in workers' wages. One of the biggest culprits in this is the corporate tax rate. It is what causes that disconnect between corporate profits and workers' wages.  When a company decides whether and where to invest in new buildings, equipment, and research, they look at the tax rate to know what return is needed to make that investment profitable. The higher the tax, the higher the needed return. So companies facing higher taxes either don't invest at all or they invest in another country. That is why experts say that workers bear 45 percent to 75 percent of the burden of corporate taxes, because businesses invest in them less and less, the higher the tax. It is as if the corporate tax rate casts a shadow on the entire economy.  We can see that shadow here. This is the way economists model the market for capital--factories, equipment, buildings, The higher the price, the less the companies demand. The lower the price, the more the companies demand. This is a simple concept.  Suppliers of those things are the reverse. If they have to sell at a low price, they don't make very much, but if they can sell at a high price, they make more. These two should meet in the middle, but they don't meet in the middle today because the government has come in and imposed a corporate tax. So each unit of capital costs more than it should because of this tax system. That means businesses only want this much. The producers only get this much. The government takes the rest.  What is left? We can see right here what the government is taking. We can see the effect that taxes have on the economy. What is left is this dark-shaded triangle. This is what economists call deadweight loss. That is the stuff that doesn't happen because of the tax. This is the tax shadow--the deadweight loss. It is deadweight in our economy. In that shadow, business activity just doesn't happen, and workers just don't get the capital they need to be more productive.  Remember, businesses are deciding whether and where to invest that next dollar. If the cost is too high--reflected here--they won't invest, at least not here in the United They will decide not to expand at all, or they will expand in a country that has a lower tax rate, or they will simply shut down entirely.  I don't think the American people would be surprised by this. This is not news to them. They lived this for a long time. They know it well. They know businesses are not expanding here. They have seen businesses close. They have seen a slowdown in the startup of new businesses. They know wages haven't gone up in many years.  They understand this shadow. Businesses don't expand. Workers are laid off. Money moves abroad. It is because of this high tax that doesn't leave us with decreases in costs, creating a deadweight loss on our economy. They understand it, and they know that corporations pass that tax on to them in the form of lower wages.[[Page S7096]]  But here is the good news. Help is on the way. Lowering the corporate tax rate lowers the rate of return needed to make investments work. It removes the shadow that blocks the economic sunlight. Suddenly businesses are operating here in the green.  More investment in factories, buildings, equipment, and IP means more Americans are more productive, and that makes total sense. You get more done when you have a new computer than when you have an old clunky one. You produce more when you have a new machine on the line. Workers become more productive, and the companies pay them more both because they are bringing in more and because they want to keep those workers to do more. That is what happens when you lift that economic shadow that we talked about that corporate taxes impose and cast on our economy. You create more jobs, and wage competition grows income.  This isn't just economic theory. As you can see here on this chart, wage increases are significantly higher in countries with lower corporate tax rates. We don't need just simple economic theory; we need economic results, and that is what this chart shows us. High-tax countries like the United States have weak wage growth. The United States is down here on this chart representing the highest statutory corporate rate countries. High-tax countries like the United States have weak wage growth--less than 1 percent, even close to zero percent. You can see that here. Low-tax countries--these are the lowest statutory corporate rate countries. These are the bottom 10 lowest rates. Low-tax-rate countries see a wage growth of 1 percent, 1.5 percent, 3.5 percent, even 4 percent, and that is because they don't live under that economic dead weight, that tax shadow, that deadweight loss zone of high corporate taxes.  It also matches my experience in talking with companies in U.multinational corporations doing business in Colorado have told me that they want to expand here, but they just can't justify it when they look at the tax rates we have here versus around the world, especially in I have even heard from some foreign-based companies that do business in Colorado that this sort of reform--I ask unanimous consent to complete my remarks.

1105,topic-id,271,"Mr.President, it would entice them to invest more in the United This is real, and the American people need it.  It is good television to say that it is absurd to think that American families will get more money from lowering the corporate rate than the tax raised in revenue, but it is wrong. It is tempting to look at a stash of corporate profits and think that corporations just must not want to invest here or ``let's just take that money,'' but that is wrong too. The right move is to create the tax environment that tells businesses that they should invest here because they can make more money. That is why President Obama called for corporate tax reform. That is why former Treasury Secretary--and one of President Obama's economic advisers--Larry Summers said that reducing the corporate tax rate and lowering the competitive disadvantage faced by American multinationals is ``about as close to a free lunch as tax reformers will ever get.'' That is what we do by lowering the tax rate. That is how American families end up with $4,000 more in their pockets--and not just one time; once this fully takes effect, that increase is permanent.  Mr.President, we have a historic opportunity. The American people need and deserve a new and better Tax Code, a modern one designed for today's world, not an Atari world or a Ford LTD world.

1039,topic-id,1597,"Mr.President, I rise to speak about the mass shooting in Texas yesterday--the latest mass shooting in what seems like never-ending gun violence in our country. My heart breaks for the victims and their families and for the community of Sutherland Springs in  We are still gathering all the facts about this specific crime. We are still learning about what happened, how this murderer was able to purchase a gun, whatever his twisted rationale was for walking into a house of worship in a small town and slaughtering more than 20 people, including young children, with an assault weapon. Our incredible law enforcement officials are working hard to answer all of that, but the most important fact of all is something we already know very well. This was yet another case where someone on American soil who had absolutely no business getting his hands on a weapon of war was able to get one and use it to commit heinous mass murder.  Of the five worst mass shootings in our history, three of them have occurred in just the past 17 months. Think about that. In a small town in America, nearly 7 percent of the town's population was slaughtered just because they went to church that day. The weapon he used was based on a military weapon designed for a war zone, but this was not a war zone. It was a church. People were singing and praying and savoring life.  I reject the notion that it is too soon to act. If not now, then when? We should ban assault weapons and bump stocks today. People who don't want to have an honest conversation say we need to wait. Well, for how long? Because we wait, and we wait, and we will see evil rear its ugly head over and over again, and we are told to wait again.  We have enough information today for Congress to do its job and try to keep our constituents safe from gun violence. We had enough information before yesterday to act, but what Congress does not have is the political will to act. My friends, this must change. Thoughts and prayers are not going to stop the next mass shooting. Merely talking about doing something about the mentally ill obtaining guns isn't going to stop the next deranged person with hate in their soul from committing yet another mass murder. The Second Amendment does not mean that Americans should have to risk getting shot because they walked down the wrong street in a city or decided to go to a music festival in Las Vegas or a night club in Orlando or an elementary school in Newtown or a movie theater in Aurora or a church on Sunday in  After each of these horrific acts of violence, what happened here in Congress? More than a month after Las Vegas, we still can't even tackle the most obvious fixes like banning bump stocks. Plain and simple, Americans are being slaughtered and Congress is refusing to protect them.  I hear my colleagues who rightly say we can't pass laws to stop every instance of a deranged gunman who wants to kill innocent men, women, and children, just like our other criminal laws will not necessarily stop every instance of crime, but there is no excuse for not even trying. Everyone in this Chamber knows that a shooting in a church is something that should never happen in this country. Mr.President, I think you would agree with that. I think everyone who serves in this Chamber would agree with that. So then why aren't we doing anything to stop this violence? Why aren't we making it harder for a crazed, evil person to get their hands on a weapon of war?  It makes me wonder what our colleagues are waiting for. Are they waiting for the NRA to come in and give them cover and tell them it is OK to act? Are they waiting for the NRA to give them permission to stand up and do something? If the NRA said today assault rifles or bump stocks should be banned, it would be done tomorrow. That is the sad truth of this place, but we know the NRA will not say that because they want to keep selling these weapons of war to anyone who is willing to buy them, no matter how unsafe it makes it for the rest of us.  Congress has caved in over and over again to the enormous pressure by the NRA and the gun industry--which just wants to protect their profits--and has ignored the vast majority of Gun owners and nongun owners alike support commonsense measures to keep their fellow Americans safe.  These mass slaughters continue, and Congress has done nothing--absolutely nothing. To me, this is a monumental failure of leadership, and it is no wonder that gun violence and mass shootings happen here at a higher rate than any other developed country in the world. This has to change. It is not enough to solve the individual crime after the fact. We have to take meaningful, real action to prevent the next one. This is what has to happen. To those who doubt that Congress can actually get something done, we already know that, depending on the motivation, depending on whom Congress is actually listening to, Congress is fully capable of moving quickly to enact change. Instead of acting like its hands are tied and refusing to do anything--which is what is happening right now--far more often than not, Congress listens to the special interests instead of the people who actually elect them to keep them safe.  Look at the shameful state of our gun laws now and tell me if you think these laws came about because families in our States demanded them or was it because the NRA demanded them? Congress has turned a collective back on strengthening and expanding our national background check system. We should be fixing the holes in the system--whatever is necessary--not just[[Page S7007]]shrugging our shoulders and saying there is nothing that can be done. Who do you think demanded that we don't fix the background check system? Was it families in your State or was it the NRA? Congress refuses to ban high-capacity magazines, which are literally made for war, and let killers fire dozens of rounds without having to stop and reload. Who do you think demanded that, families or the NRA?  Congress still refuses to ban assault weapons, which are designed for war--designed to kill as many people as possible as rapidly as possible but are given different names so they can be sold in the civilian world. Who do you think demanded that, our families or the NRA?  Congress is on the verge of passing legislation to make it easier right now for killers to buy suppressers, known by many of us as silencers, to attach to their weapons and make it harder for the police to do their jobs and catch violent criminals. Who do you think demanded that? Certainly not the police and not our families--the  Congress is dragging its feet on banning bump stocks, the inexpensive piece of equipment the killer in Las Vegas used to turn its already-powerful firearm into an automatic weapon capable of firing hundreds of rounds per minute. Who do you think demanded that, families or the NRA?  Just this February, Congress overturned a rule that had prevented people who were so incapacitated that they could no longer handle their own finances from getting their hands on a gun. Who do you think demanded that, families or the NRA?  Congress even went so far as to pass a law that blocked the Centers for Disease Control from studying the issue of gun deaths the way they are allowed to study any other cause of death in this country. Why? Because it is an attempt to hide the overwhelming data showing that keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people would decrease gun crime. Who do you think demanded that? Who do you think demanded that Congress suppress the facts and the alarming data about gun violence? Do you think it was families or the NRA?  This really has to change. Congress needs to start protecting the people we were elected to represent. Their voices matter, and it really does matter whom you are listening to. Their voices matter, and they must be heard. We must listen and enact change that would actually help to keep our States safer from gun violence. We are the ones who need to act. We can't ignore our responsibility to keep our country safe from this kind of violence.  To all the people who are watching us right now, I would say this: After all these massacres, pay attention to what your elected leaders are saying. Pay attention to what they are actually doing. Watch how they react. Look closely at how they use their time here. Listen to what they say or don't say. After these mass shootings, did they tell you we were going to bow our heads for a moment of silence and leave it there or did they tell you we were going to fight with every bit of energy to actually fix these broken gun laws and protect our American citizens?

366,topic-id,2622,"Madam Speaker, it is certainly an honor and pleasure to follow my dear friend from Iowa with whom I got to share a little time last[[Page H8488]]weekend, be out in God's nature and just enjoy the best Iowa has to offer, and Steve King is one of those best things.  Well, we have heard a great deal about the New York terrorist, although I believe Governor Cuomo told us there are no terrorist ties initially, before he had any time to know anything, really. But that seems to be kind of the way most mayors where these terrorist attacks occur respond. They immediately declare, ``This is not terrorist. No terrorist ties.'' And then, lo and behold, we find out, eventually, there certainly are.  One of the problems that has been created during the last 8 years and a little bit during the last part of the Bush administration is the development discussion of countering violent extremism. But I do want to touch on something about the diversity visa lottery program.  My first year in Congress, in 2005, we eliminated the diversity visa lottery program--at least voted in the House to eliminate it--but the Senate would not take it up, wouldn't take it up. We had a Republican majority in the House and Senate, and the Senate wouldn't take it up.  Then, in November of 2006, we lost the majority in both And, of course, the Democratic majority in both Houses loved the diversity visa lottery program. In fact, I have a floor speech from Senator Chuck Schumer where he extols the virtues of the diversity visa lottery program. Here are some highlights.  Senator Schumer said--this is May 24, 2006: ``As a Member of the House, I helped create this program, which my colleague, Senator Kennedy, created in the Senate in 1990.''  He said: ``In fact, my city of New York has dramatically benefited from this program, and diverse countries such as Ireland, Poland, and Nigeria have had large numbers of immigrants to be able to come, set roots, and help the diversity of New York and of  ``So this is an excellent program. Nobody has said it has done a bad job.''  Those were his comments in 2006.  Well, I am here to say it has done a bad job. So now nobody can say that nobody has said it has done a bad job, because I am saying it has done a bad job.  No matter how noble the original idea was, you should never trust the country's security to a lottery. That is insanity.  Of course, in a speech back in 2006, then Congressman Schumer, now Senator Schumer, said--or, actually, he was a Senator in 2006. But Senator Schumer said: ``I think America should admit many more of those people but not at the expense of this small, successful program that guarantees that other countries, such as the Irelands, the Polands, and the Nigerias that are unable to have immigrants come in for family reasons, can get people to come into this country.''  Senator Schumer also said, about the diversity visa lottery program: ``But one of the things great about America is, again, we allow people from all over the world to come here.  ``So I plead with my colleagues, keep the diversity visa program.''  He said: ``As I ride my bike around New York City on the weekends, I see what immigrants do for This program has dramatically helped. Neighborhoods such as Woodlawn and Greenpoint have been revitalized by new Irish and Polish immigrants. Neighborhoods such as East Flatbush and Harlem have been revitalized by West African immigrants. We don't have to stop this program.''                              {time}  1315  Well, again, it is insanity to trust our national security to a lottery, and that is what the diversity visa lottery program does.  We have had terrorists, and we have known it for a number of years, that have been getting their names into the lottery so that hopefully they would win the lottery and come to America to kill  I understand that there was a stepped-up effort in the last couple of years to vet people a little better, but the trouble here is, as then-Director Comey of the FBI testified before our Judiciary Committee, we have got nothing to vet these people against, so many of them, from Syria, from  He said in Iraq, we had all of the government records. It turns out, even with all the government records, they let in two terrorists. We had fingerprints of theirs on IEDs that killed Americans, and they let them in, and eventually realized they had made a mistake. So they said we are going to step up our vetting after they realized they had admitted known terrorists into the United States that created IEDs to kill and maim  They could say we were stepping up the vetting program, but when there is no information--this is what Comey said. With Iraq, we had the government records, we had fingerprints, we took fingerprints off  Syria, Yemen, we have got nothing. The government there doesn't give us their records. We have nothing to work from. In Syria, for a while, ISIS had taken over one of the printing facilities where they could print the passports. So we had no information to work from. We didn't know what was true and what wasn't.  So, once again, we were trusting our national security and the lives of Americans to a fatal game of Russian roulette, but it was from the Middle East, it was from Uzbekistan, it was from places where people have been radicalized.  I have got the numbers here. In fact, let's see, diversity visa program statistics, as I understand, the New York terrorist, the ISIS supporter who killed eight people, wounded so many others, in 2011, we had 5,091 from There were none from Poland, and in the top ten, there were certainly none from  We had, in 2012, 4,800 from Uzbekistan; and even better news, we had 4,453 from For those who are not keeping track, the Iranian Government has not given us information that we can count on about people in Iran who want to come to America, and we know Iran is the largest national supporter of terrorism in the world. So we don't have much of anything to vet these people on, but, you know, Senator Schumer said it is a great program, and nobody said anything against it as he rides his bicycle around.  Well, fortunately he wasn't riding his bicycle around in front of the terrorist that was allowed in on the program he thinks was so grand. And, frankly, I am grateful he was not on his bicycle in front of that terrorist killer that his program let in.  In 2013, Uzbekistan, we had 5,101 come in from We did have 2,038 come from Poland that year.  In 2014, another 6,027 that we could not adequately vet coming from Some of them we could with relatives, but many of those people simply could not be vetted. We don't know if they were sent here by the Iranian Government to kill Americans or not.  In 2015, we have another 4,992 from Iran; Uzbekistan, we had another 4,368.  So we don't have the numbers from 2016 yet, unfortunately, but hopefully that gives some idea of what we are dealing with.  We also need to understand that government officials tell us: You know, we had no indication this guy was a terrorist.  There were even people from the government, the Feds, who were saying: Gee, you know, this was not a known person.  This New York terrorist, not a known person to the Federal authorities.  Well, it turns out, in 2015, they interviewed him. He had terrorist ties.  The thing people need to understand is--and I have been saying this for years, I have grilled Director Mueller on this issue. I was contacted by one media outlet that says: Why are you just bringing this up now about the purge of training materials?  My goodness. I have been talking about this for years, I have been made fun of about this for years, but I have been right about it for years, Michele Bachmann and  It should not have been classified what they took out of the FBI materials, but they classified it so we couldn't show America how stupid some of their purging was, how senseless, how, as some of our agents told me, we are blinding ourselves of the ability to see our enemy.  So I grilled Mueller some years ago over the fact that they got a heads-up twice that the older Tsarnaev brother was radicalized, he was a terrorist, he[[Page H8489]]was a threat to American lives. They didn't do anything; the CIA didn't do anything.  The FBI finally sends some agents out. They interviewed the older Tsarnaev, but they didn't know what to ask. They don't know what the signs are of someone who is radicalized, because they have had beat down their throats for so long, and this was the Obama administration, they had the FBI's Guiding Principles document on training. And this was the document that the FBI used to say: Oh, no. We have got to be politically correct. We can't teach people about how to find and spot a radical  So there was a purge of FBI training materials.  There is a fantastic Judicial Watch special report, it can be found on their website, dated December 5 of 2013, ``U.Government Purges of Law Enforcement Training Material Deemed `Offensive' to Muslims.''  Who was complaining? Well, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Islamic Society of North America, and they just happened to have known contacts who were named as coconspirators supporting terrorism in the Holy Land Foundation prosecution.  What did Mueller's FBI do under Mueller's specific direction? They created an outreach program. They called them their community outreach partner for these people who judges said: There is plenty of evidence to show that these people have ties supporting terrorism. We are not going to eliminate their names.  The Dallas Federal Court said that; the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said that. It didn't make it to the Supreme Court, but two courts said: Yeah, there is plenty of evidence to see there are plenty of ties here, evidence of their ties to known terrorists.  So it wasn't until 2008, after years of having this evidence, that Director Mueller sent kind of an apologetic letter to CAIR, Council on American-Islamic Relations, saying: You know, we better suspend our community partnership for a while.  It is just unbelievable, but it was the political correctness during the Obama administration that has gotten people killed, because they purged our training material. And God bless Ken Jensen, FBI agent. He had prepared the 700-page training materials that Mueller ordered destroyed.  Somebody needed to study that material before they went out and talked to If they had, they would have recognized this guy has probably radicalized, and we better be on the alert. They could have saved lives at the Boston Marathon if Mueller had not prevented them from knowing how to do their job. And he is special counsel.  By the way, Madam Speaker, the former Director of the FBI who blinded the FBI of their ability to see terrorists, why do we think he came out with the indictments exactly when he did? Well, I can tell you why, because he is as easy to read as anybody in the world. He came out with those indictments when he did because he had people starting to call for his resignation, starting to demand that he be removed, demanding that he recuse himself. Even The Wall Street Journal, that has been very sympathetic, they pointed out it was time for him to go. What did he do? He immediately comes out with indictments to show: No, no, no. You can't demand that I go. I am too relevant.  You look at those indictments, and I am for punishing anybody who has committed a crime, but there was no need for a special counsel to come up with what he did. The FBI could have done that. The Department of Justice could have done that. We didn't need Mueller and 20 lawyers, all of these Hillary Clinton sycophants, in there to come up with this. The DOJ could have done this. It was just a ridiculous couple of indictments to be spending all these millions of dollars for.  We also know that same kind of conduct occurred when Comey came to the Hill and testified there is no trace of evidence of collusion between President Trump and the  Well, Mueller had to be puckering up, because he knew: Uh-oh. Now there is testimony from the FBI Director that there is no basis for me to be special counsel and to have hired all these people. So the President could be in line to fire me, because now we have testimony from the FBI Director there is no basis for this investigation. Shut her down.  So that night, they leak out he is investigating President Trump for obstruction of justice. Excuse me? We all know what that so-called evidence was. They will never, ever get a conviction, because it was not obstruction of justice.  Obstruction of justice is when you do what Comey and Loretta Lynch did to prevent a proper investigation, and you make an agreement with potential defendants that if they will just give you their laptops and let you look at them, you will destroy all that you find, and you will never use any of that information to prosecute them, and you give them immunity from prosecution. That is not what you do if you are going to prosecute a case.  You get them in a bind and then you tell them: Here are the charges you are looking at unless you come clean and identify the person above you with whom you were working and what they did.  Then you work up the chain to the big fish, which is how organized criminal organizations have been prosecuted over the years. It would work in this case, but Director Comey was so busy figuring out how to explain how Hillary Clinton should not be prosecuted, though the evidence was basically for a slam dunk case of conviction, that he overlooked properly pursuing the case.  We don't need Director We need him gone, and we need a special prosecutor to get into this, clearly, since Jeff Sessions recused himself on anything involving Hillary Clinton and And we can't have Rod Rosenstein, for heaven's sake, now that we know that he and Mueller should not be involved in this special counsel situation, because they both were engaged in the coverup of the initial Russian investigation that revealed Russia was trying to corner the market on uranium, and they had to seal that, because if they hadn't sealed that and covered up that evidence and that investigation, then Hillary Clinton would not have been able to hit the Russian megamillions lottery by authorizing the sale of uranium to Uranium One that ends up in Russian hands.  Bill Clinton wouldn't have gotten $500,000. He didn't hit the megamillions, except for the 145 or so that went into the Clinton  Mueller cannot possibly investigate this. He is in it up to his eyeballs, and so is They both ought to do the decent thing. I know it is not characteristic, but they ought to do the decent thing and resign and let somebody that is not completely submerged in the original coverup investigate this whole matter.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8487.txt,1801,VETERANS APPRENTICESHIP AND LABOR OPPORTUNITY REFORM ACT,2017.0,3.0,November
413,topic-id,1284,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr.I appreciate your hosting this hour because this is critical stuff here. This is the kind of thing that makes or breaks an experiment in self-government because there is an attempted coup taking place.  We have heard over and over about, oh, gee, Mr.Mueller will come to a fair and just conclusion. Well, the only fair and just conclusion that Bob Mueller could come to would be that he should never have accepted the position of special counsel, that he had conflicts so deep that accepting the role of special counsel could not be ethical and appropriate. You wonder, why would he take it?  Well, when you find out that, as FBI Director, he and U.Attorney Rod Rosenstein were involved in the deep cover investigation into Russia's effort to corner the market using American uranium, and that Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder and others in the administration approved the sale to a group, the stockholders of which donated, as I understand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in effect, the Clintons hit the Russian megalottery--the megamillions lottery from                              {time}  1930  As I understand, $145 million or so to the Clinton Foundation, in effect, the Clintons hit the Russian mega lottery; the megamillions lottery from Russia, and just a little tease was the half-a-million-dollar fee for just giving one little, short speech by Bill  But if we look back at what has gone on, just look at some of the facts, it was shocking that FBI Director Comey did not have Cheryl Mills interviewed. She was Clinton's former Chief of Staff at the State Now we are finding out, well, I guess, gee, if Comey was going to draft a statement saying that there was not sufficient evidence to prosecute Hillary Clinton before he ever talked to Cheryl Mills or talked to Hillary Clinton or followed up on the most critical evidence, then clearly it makes sense why Director Comey would not want to make Cheryl Mills' interview recorded, and would make an agreement with Cheryl Mills and the other potential defendants in the case that, gee, if they just got a look at their laptops, they promised they wouldn't use anything in the laptop to prosecute them, and the FBI would then, under Comey's direction, would actually participate in the obstruction and destruction of evidence so that nobody could ever use it against any of them.  Now, originally, we thought that might only be Hillary But as we find out, gee, Mr.Mueller, Mr.Comey, and Mr.Rosenstein were in this up to their eyeballs when it came to the Russian investigation regarding uranium. If they were doing their jobs, they should never, ever have allowed that sale of American uranium to go to a company that they knew would end up in Russian hands.  So if you look at Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Bentel, Bryan Pagliano, and Paul Combetta, these are people who were potential targets. And what does Director Comey do?  He makes sure that they walk. Because if they were properly interviewed, like good prosecutors or good investigators normally do, you start there and you say: You help us with what happened and what you were told by the person above you, and then we won't prosecute you to the full extent of the law.  That is how deals are made. That is how you get to a Mr.Big in a racketeer organized confederation.  Mr.Comey and the FBI apparently relied on the Fusion GPS investigation knowing where it came from and knowing who paid for it. This is incredible.  If you go back to the Washingtonian article of 2013, it makes pretty clear that Comey and Mueller were basically joined at the hip.  In fact, a quote back in 2013 says: ``The stressed Comey had few people he could turn to for advice; almost no one was allowed to know the program existed, and disclosing the program's existence to someone outside that circle could send him to prison. In fact, there was only one person in government whom he could confide in and trust: Bob Mueller.''  ``Comey thought, `A freight train is heading down the tracks, about to derail me, my family, and my career.' He glanced to his left at his fellow passenger, thinking, `At least Bob Mueller will be standing on the tracks with me.' ''  ``The crisis over, Comey and Mueller shared a dark laugh.''  Well, it is not quite so amusing when you look at the stakes and whether or not this little experiment in self-government will continue. For example, we know that Comey admitted in testimony before Congress before the Senate that he had leaked information in order to get a special counsel appointed. That was his dear friend who would stand beside him through thick and thin, Bob This brought memories of when Mr.Comey urged his boss, John Ashcroft, to recuse himself and let them appoint a special counsel. So Ashcroft trusted He probably shouldn't have, but he did.  Then Comey saw to it that his child's godfather, Patrick Fitzgerald, would be the prosecutor. Much like Mueller, he got massive amounts of money and a great powerful staff so they could go after Karl Rove and Vice President They were embarrassed there was no case there, so they made up one on Scooter Libby, and he became the fall guy.  But we know from the leak that Comey admitted that he used an ex-U.Attorney, identified as Columbia University professor Daniel Richman, to leak to The New York Times the contents of the memo Comey wrote.  If you look at the FBI contract with agents and with people employed by the FBI, it makes it very clear that memo that Comey prepared about his conversation with the President was not supposed to ever be provided to the press. That is FBI property, and he violated the law in leaking it.  But if you look, then-professor Daniel Richman got that to The New York Times author Michael Schmidt, who later wrote the Comey memo story in which Comey told Congress he directed Richman to leak.  Well, if you go back through and you start looking for this common thread, Michael Schmidt writing stories for The New York Times about leaks, then you find a number of cases where it appears likely. Whether it is March 1, March 4, March 5, March 6, it appears likely that this was James Comey leaking again.  The only question is: Did he commit a crime in one or all of those events?  The answer is: We will never know as long as Bob Mueller is special counsel. He needs to have the decency to say that it was a mistake for me to take this on, it was a mistake when Comey testified there was no evidence of any collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians, it was a mistake for him to leak out that night that now he is investigating the President for obstruction of justice.  Why would he do that?  So he wouldn't get fired, because there was no purpose in his investigation.  Why would he indict people when he did?  Because even The Wall Street Journal and others around this town began to say: Do you know what? Mueller really should resign.  He had to get those indictments out quick so people would not keep calling for his resignation. Well, some of us are. We have got to clean this town up, and it will start with the resignation of Mr.Mueller and a proper investigation of all of this underlying case involving Comey, Lynch, the Clintons, Russia, and Rod Rosenstein who oversaw the Russia case before he decided to seal it.[[Page H8589]]    ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583-6.txt,1801,VETERANS APPRENTICESHIP AND LABOR OPPORTUNITY REFORM ACT,2017.0,7.0,November

727,topic-id,712,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Espaillat for leading this important Special  It is no secret that many cities in our country face an affordable housing crisis. That crisis is particularly acute in California, as everyone in my State, from the Bay Area to Los Angeles to the Inland Empire, will tell you.  California is a desired destination for people from all over the world, many of[[Page H8649]]them skilled, tech-savvy young people who moved to California for our climate, culture, or commerce. This is especially true for my home city of Los Angeles, which boasts cultures and cuisines from all over the globe, allowing anybody to feel at home.  Unfortunately, the growth of affordable housing has not kept pace with the population growth. This disconnect has created a housing affordability crisis that is exacerbating economic inequality and forcing lifelong Angelinos out of neighborhoods they grew up in.  The lack of housing raises rents on working families, which, in turn, threatens the vibrant hubs of Latino, Black, and Asian culture throughout my district, potentially stripping these neighborhoods of their character that made them so unique and desirable to live in in the first place.  Our affordable housing crisis has left more than 400,000 households in the city of Los Angeles and 900,00 in L.County in what they call a precarious housing situation. A precarious housing situation means that the dwelling is substandard, families are doubled up, or they spend more than half their income on housing.  That is 1.3 million people in precarious housing situations, teetering on the edge of homelessness, one bad day away from losing the roof over their head. That is on top of 58,000 homeless individuals in Los Angeles  Simply put, the affordability crisis in California threatens our State's great legacy to provide economic opportunity for all.  In Los Angeles, we have seen that, when we target our resources to help specific populations, we get results and we save lives. In 2015, L.City housed more than 15,000 people, including 2,600 veterans and 2,800 chronically homeless people, more than any other city in the country.  Despite the historic housing shortage and a staggering mental health crisis, my city has proven that policymakers can tackle this problem if we have a coordinated effort at the State, local, and Federal levels.  L.is stepping up. So is the State of L.passed measure HHH, which is $1.2 billion to help individuals who are homeless. The California State Legislature passed 15 housing bills and a $4 billion bond to be on the ballot in 2018.  But we can't do it on our own, and we don't need the Federal Government to undermine our efforts by undermining their role and responsibility at the Federal level. Unfortunately, our Republican-led Federal Government doesn't believe in being a good partner and doesn't believe in combating unaffordable housing and homelessness. They have chosen to starve vital agencies like Housing and Urban Development and zero out funding for agencies such as the Interagency Council on  Cities like L.and States like California need responsible Federal partners to tackle issues like homelessness so they can make tough choices and make sure we have a housing situation that serves all people. That starts with actual Federal investment in projects and programs that help people, not just the rich. That is why the Republican tax cut plan is such a sham and deserves to go back to whatever dark corner of Republican dogma it came from.  As it stands right now, the Republican tax plan would cut the production of affordable housing in half by eliminating multifamily, tax-exempt housing bonds. It would also repeal the 4 percent tax credit and provisions authorizing the use of tax-exempt private activity bonds. Taken together, these provisions account for 50 percent of all affordable housing production and would make our affordable housing crisis even worse.  Republicans in Congress only claim to care about giving States the power to pursue their own policies. It would be great if their actions matched their words and they actually worked with our great cities and States to address important problems instead of making them worse.  I ask for all of you to consider that any tax plan not exacerbate the housing crisis in our country.

46,topic-id,330,"Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.3043 from Representative McMorris Rodgers, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.  For centuries, Western States have fought over scarce water supplies. We even have an expression in the West that says: Whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over.  Water scarcity in the West led our visionary forefathers to build Federal water storage projects throughout the West to provide water, hydropower, recreation, flood control, and environmental benefits while adhering to States' water rights.  These were nonpartisan endeavors, as evidenced by President John Kennedy dedicating the San Luis Dam in While the Central Arizona Project came after President Kennedy,[[Page H8620]]it continues to bring prosperity to Arizona's cities, Tribal communities, ranches, and farms almost 50 years after its inception.  The Glen Canyon Dam and other projects affiliated with the Colorado River Storage Project provided the backbone of a regional economy that has produced year-round and emissions-free hydropower.  H.3043 streamlines the permitting process and encourages the expansion of hydropower generation by establishing a single lead coordinating agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, in order to facilitate in a timelier manner all hydropower authorizations, approvals, and requirements mandated by Federal law.  This bill will also dramatically decrease costs to relicense non-Federal dams, a huge win for the  Presently, FERC exercises jurisdiction over 1,600 non-Federal hydropower projects at more than 2,500 dams under the Federal Power  According to FERC, the relicensing workload is increasing dramatically. Between FY 2017 and FY 2030, roughly 480 projects amounting to 45 percent of FERC-licensed projects will begin the relicensing process.  Rural co-ops, power companies, and other stakeholders in the West need a clear process without the bureaucracy. Let's get bureaucracy out of the way and pass H.3043 so we have a clear process moving forward for pursuing worthwhile hydropower projects.

119,topic-id,593,"Mr.President, allegations of sexual harassment against a growing number of people have surfaced recently. Some facing the accusations have issued public apologies, while others have maintained their innocence. But the allegations continue to mount, and as each new one surfaces, so grows my concern about whether we're doing enough to combat this problem.  There are many things on which members of this chamber don't agree, but one thing on which we can and should agree is this: sexual harassment has no place in the workforce. And it certainly has no place in the halls of  To signal how seriously I take this issue, I last week called on the Senate Rules Committee to impose a requirement of sexual harassment training for every employee in this chamber. Today, I'm introducing a bipartisan resolution to ensure that the Rules Committee has the authority necessary to ensure that every member of this chamber, every employee on the Senate payroll, and every unpaid Senate intern receives anti-harassment training.  This is not an onerous requirement, and it's one that's long overdue. Training materials on harassment already exist, thanks to the Congressional Office of Compliance and our Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for It's already mandatory for my Judiciary Committee staff and personal office staff to take anti-harassment training. The executive branch and some private employers already have instituted similar training requirements for their employees.  More than two decades ago, I sponsored the Congressional Accountability[[Page S7066]]Act as a sign of our commitment to promoting fairness in the workplace. This 1995 statute requires Congress to follow the same civil rights, labor, workplace safety, and health laws to which other employers are subject.

But I think we have to acknowledge that in our society, despite our best efforts and intentions, sexual harassment remains a serious problem. And we must work together to make sure that the Senate remains free from harassment.  Some may say that policies regarding sexual harassment should be left to the discretion of each office. But I believe it's important for every Senate office to have a consistent stance on this particular issue. Every office should receive the same training so the Senate maintains a culture in which harassment is not tolerated. This is a common interest we all share. The voters who sent us here expect the best. We owe it to the American people to hold ourselves and our employees to the highest standards of conduct and professionalism.

991,topic-id,1139,"Mr.President, today the Senate will confirm Steven Engel to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal  The Office of Legal Counsel, which we refer to as the OLC in the Judiciary Committee, functions as legal advisor to the President and executive branch agencies, providing advice on complex questions of constitutional and statutory interpretation. The OLC essentially serves as the general counsel to the executive branch.  Mr.Engel is well equipped to lead that office, both from the standpoint of academics and from the standpoint of background. Mr.Engel received his undergraduate degree from Harvard, his master's of philosophy from Cambridge University, and his law degree from Yale Law  Following his graduation, Mr.Engel clerked for Judge Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Mr.Engel joined the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis after clerking for Justice Mr.Engel's practice focused on appellate and commercial litigation matters.  In 2006, Mr.Engel joined the OLC as counsel to the Assistant Attorney General at that time and was later promoted to Deputy Assistant Attorney There he provided legal advice to the Attorney General, to the White House counsel, and other executive branch clients on a variety of legal matters.  In 2009, Mr.Engel joined the law firm of Dechert as a partner in the white collar and securities litigation group and later in that same firm as a member of the complex commercial litigation group.  Mr.Engel's nomination has broad support across the legal community. The Senate Judiciary Committee received a number of letters in support of his nomination. One such letter is signed by former Attorneys General Mukasey and Gonzales, as well as former Deputy Attorneys General Filip, Morford, and Other letters of support were received from his coclerks on the Supreme Court, a group of Mr.Engel's former colleagues, Yale Law School classmates, and Harvard Law Professor Jack Mr.Engel also received an endorsement from the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of the city of New York, which is the largest police union in New York  Another letter from former senior government officials and legal officers of the executive branch, including Kenneth Wainstein and Michael Hayden, noted their ``enthusiastic support'' for Mr.Engel's nomination. Wainstein and Hayden wrote: ``We are confident that as head of OLC, Steve will render legal opinions with the highest level of professional integrity and according to his best understanding of what the law and the Constitution require.''  Mr.Engel and I met this summer, and we discussed the importance of congressional oversight and the essential role played by Members of this body and the House of He assured me that he agreed that each Member, whether or not a chairman of a committee, is a constitutional officer entitled to the respect and best efforts of the executive branch to respond to his or her requests for information. Further, he committed to review the May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this very issue and to consider whether a more complete analysis of the issue is necessary.  You may remember that my interest in this whole thing goes back to early in this new administration, when people working for the President and presumably speaking for the President said that the only oversight letters that would be responded to would be those from chairmen of committees. Now, you can imagine that leaves out[[Page S7040]]at least 30-some Republicans that would never get answers to their oversight letters, and it would leave out 48 Democrats that would never get answers to their letters. Consequently, most of Congress would not be able to do their constitutional role of oversight, making sure that the executive branch is in enforcing the laws and spending the money according to what we require. So I raised that issue through a 7-page letter to the White House, and they came and visited with me about it.  I think they had some misunderstanding of what oversight was all about. They wrote a letter that said they are going to respond to every Member of Congress on oversight issues, which satisfies me from the standpoint of their intent.  As I just said in my remarks here, Mr.Engel committed to review that May 1, 2017, OLC opinion on this issue and to consider whether a more complete analysis of the issue is necessary because every Member of Congress should be able to do oversight, and every Member of Congress ought to expect an answer to their letters from the executive branch of the government, whether they are a chairman or not, whether they are a Republican or not, whether they are a Member of the House or a Member of the I want to make sure that we follow through on this, although I will give this administration credit for almost totally reversing an opinion that they issued way back in  The head of OLC is a highly important role at the Department of Justice, and it is a role whose importance is felt throughout the Federal Just to show you how it is felt throughout the entire government, let me tell you that they issued an opinion in the previous administration on something to do with the work of inspectors general throughout the government, previously, or maybe originally, intended to say what the inspectors general could demand or not demand. We understand that the law passed in 1979 says that an inspector general can be entitled to any information he wants from that department, but they issued an opinion--the OLC person at that time--along the lines of, well, there are some areas that maybe the head of the agency has to review, which means that the 1979 law isn't being carried out in the spirit. That is kind of an example because that opinion from the Justice Department was used by general counsels throughout the administration of Obama to keep Congress from doing its oversight work. That is how important the person who is the head of the Office of Legal Counsel is in determining what goes on in the executive branch of government--enough to stifle the oversight work of the Congress of the United States or the work of the inspectors general of each department.  So I see Mr.Engel as a person who is going to be a friend of congressional oversight and, if he isn't, I am going to be very, very disappointed. He has satisfied me through his testimony before our committee and through the promises he made in letters to me and in the privacy of my office that he is going to do that. So we are ending up with a Mr.Engel who is, as you can see, very well qualified to take on such a role as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal  I urge my colleagues to support Mr.Engel's nomination and confirm him to this important position.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7038-4.txt,457,SECURING ELECTRONIC RECORDS FOR VETERANS' EASE ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,November
33,topic-id,667,"Mr.Chairman, hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy strategy.  We have a tremendous opportunity to expand renewable hydropower production. However, without some much-needed licensing improvements, we risk losing investment opportunities in new hydropower infrastructure. In particular, closed-loop pumped storage hydro projects offer the opportunity to store energy for use when it is needed.  I have introduced separate legislation, H.2880, with the goal of making the review process of these projects as efficient as possible. Both H.3043 and H.2880 will allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose licensing conditions only as necessary to protect public safety, or that are reasonable, economically feasible, and essential to protect fish and wildlife resources.  I am excited about the possibility some are exploring to build these facilities in abandoned mine lands. This renewable energy solution for power could be a real benefit to our coal field regions in central Appalachia in the form of jobs, economic development, and energy security. I am proud of what we are doing here in an effort to make this happen.  Industry and labor groups alike support H.3043 because a modern regulatory framework for hydro is good for jobs and good for consumers. The following groups have written in support of the bill:  The American Council on Renewable Energy, the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, and many others.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record the letter containing the names of supporters.                                                 November 6, 2017.       The undersigned groups are writing to express strong      support for H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization      Act of 2017, and to request your vote as it is considered on      the floor of the U.House of Representatives this week.       Hydropower is America's single largest provider of      renewable electricity, making up almost one-half of all      generation from renewable resources. Given that hydropower is      an important source of domestic, emissions-free, flexible      power needed to ensure consistent and reliable electric      service, we must[[Page H8618]]     look to preserve and protect our existing hydropower system      and promote new expansion opportunities.       H.3043 provides a framework that adds accountability and      transparency, eliminates inefficiencies and redundancies, and      unlocks innovation and advancements in technology and      operations, while protecting environmental values, public      participation, and all existing authorities of federal and      state decision-makers in the licensing process       The current regulatory environment is placing hydropower at      risk. The licensing process can result in both new and      existing projects taking up to ten years or longer to receive      their approvals. This not only creates uncertainty for      project owners and developers alike, but burdens electricity      customers with additional unnecessary costs and only delays      important environmental measures that the industry, resource      agencies, and the environmental community agreed upon during      the licensing process and want to see deployed.       Additionally, the fleet of almost 2,200 hydropower projects      across the country supports approximately 118,000 ongoing      full-time equivalent jobs in operations and maintenance and      25,000 jobs in construction and upgrades. By maintaining our      existing fleet and supporting growth in the sector, the      hydropower industry could support close to 200,000 jobs.      Further local economic development in other industries is      also spurred due to access to affordable electricity from      hydropower projects. However, we will not realize the full      measure of these jobs and economic opportunities without      improvements to the licensing process.       We believe H.3043 is a moderate proposal developed with      bipartisan input and, as such, deserves strong support by      both Republicans and Please contact any of our      organizations for additional information or assistance on      this bill.

68,topic-id,556,"Mr.Chair, first of all, I would like to thank the chair and ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this bill forward.  This amendment, which is supported by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, is pretty simple. It requires Federal decisionmakers in the Department of the Interior to consider the threat of invasive species when installing fishways.  This was brought to my attention while looking at a dam on the Wisconsin River in Below that dam, we had Asian carp, an invasive species, a huge fish. If that fish was able to get further north on the Wisconsin River, because of a fishway, you could wind up with this invasive species not only in the northern part of the river, but, and quite frankly, in dozens of lakes throughout northern  As a matter of fact, given where that dam is, if there is even flooding, that invasive species could wind up working its way into Lake Michigan and up the Saint Lawrence It is very important that before the Department of the Interior listens to certain environmentalists, they realize that a fishway at this dam would result in big trouble.  Because of the devastating effects invasive species can have on the environment, local fish population, and the economy, this amendment will ensure the Federal agencies take into account all consequences before installing fishways.  Mr.Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Alliant                                               Alliant Energy,                                                 November 8, 2017.     Mark Pocan,     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington,     Glenn Grothman,     Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Representatives Pocan and Grothman: I am writing in      strong support of your invasive species amendment to H.     3043, the Hydropower Modernization Act of 2017, which is due      to be considered on the floor of the U.House today.      Alliant Energy deeply appreciates your commitment to this      pro-environment measure, and for protecting Wisconsin's      watersheds.       As you know, an Alliant subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and      Light, owns and operates a dam located in Prairie du Sac,      Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin The Prairie du Sac dam,      now over 100 years old, is responsible for the formation of      Lake Wisconsin, which serves as an enormous recreational and      wildlife resource for our state.       Over a decade ago, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service      sought to impose a fishway requirement on the license for the      dam, essentially calling for a ``fishway'' to be installed to      allow for the upstream migration of native fish. Since that      time, however, scientists and state officials have discovered      the existence of non-native, invasive fish species (Asian      carp) at the base of the dam. If a fishway were now      installed, it seems clear that these invasive species would      also be able to migrate--and thereby endanger native fish      populations upstream, including Lake       Your amendment would ensure that, in this particular case,      the U.Fish and Wildlife Service would be required to      consider the threats posed by invasive species before      imposing a fishway condition on a hydroelectric license. We      believe strongly that such decisions should be predicated on      the most up to date information available, and your amendment      will help guarantee that invasive species are not permitted      to threaten the Lake Wisconsin watershed.       Again, thank you for offering your amendment. Please let me      know how Alliant may assist you in ushering this much-needed      provision into public law.

It is true with temporary workers, you have a middleman who takes the money off the top, and that is unfortunate. But you have to realize that the reason we have more temporary workers is we make it harder and harder to be an employer in the first place.

They are not calling in expensive contractors or companies from Montana, and they are not waiting for the folks from FEMA or the U.military. They are not waiting for Donald Trump to grant Puerto Ricans a little more time now that he has made it clear that he will not personally give them his grade A help forever. The people of Chicago are getting help to the people of Puerto Rico before any official resources are coming to their rescue.  It boggles the mind that it has come to this.  Here is another more difficult case. A bridge and a road were washed away by the storm. This is near Jayuya, Puerto Rico, but it could be almost anywhere on the island. More than 6 weeks after the storm and nothing, not even orange cones or a guardrail to keep people from driving off into danger.  If you live up the side of this hill, you are not going anywhere any time soon until something changes, because the Army Corps of Engineers has decided just to not show up and are missing in action.  Mr.Speaker, I should not have to give this speech almost 2 months after the storm. We should have accomplished much more. The people of Puerto Rico pretty much understand that President Trump doesn't want to help them and really doesn't care.

Many of these brave men and women make the ultimate sacrifice, such as my own brother, Jesse Morlan Hatch who was killed in World War SSG Aaron Butler of Utah also comes to mind. Staff Sergeant Butler was tragically killed in the line of duty last summer while serving in The valor of patriots like Jesse and Aaron is indicative of all men and women who volunteer to serve in our Armed I have always had a deep-rooted respect for America's servicemembers and her veterans.  On behalf of the State of Utah, I would also like to express our humble gratitude for our Nation's veterans and active servicemembers. Throughout[[Page S7107]]this weekend, Utah will host a variety of ceremonies, all dedicated to celebrating our veterans. The town of Magna will be hosting its annual Veterans Day parade; the town of Howell will be naming its community center after SGT Rocky Payne, who was killed in Iraq in 2005; and the students of Granite Park Junior High School will be hosting a special Veterans Day assembly. With events being held all across our State, it is clear to see that Utahns hold our Nation's veterans in the highest esteem. I am honored to represent a State that honors our veterans.  I would also like to personally acknowledge the city of Layton, which will be hosting a grand Veterans Day parade to be followed by the groundbreaking ceremony of a new Vietnam War memorial wall. I could not even begin to describe the endeavor that Mayor Bob Stevenson, the city of Layton, the Utah State Legislature, and so many others have undertaken to bring this wonderful memorial to I am grateful for their leadership, and I am delighted to see this memorial become a reality.  I will close today by saying this: To all veterans and your families, thank you. Thank you for your sacrifice, for your commitment, and for your dedication to this Nation and its citizens. Most of all, thank you for your patriotism and faith in To our Nation's veterans we owe a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.

182,topic-id,440,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Securing Electronic Records for Veterans' Ease Act, the SERVE Act, because we all know and feel that veterans and their families face very real challenges when they transition to civilian life. We all know that we have an important responsibility to do what we can to help. Finding housing or a roof over their heads should not be an ordeal, especially if it is caused by difficulties in showing the stipend that student veterans get from Uncle  In conversations with student veterans throughout my district, proof of income for housing kept coming up as a big challenge. In fact, Nick Quinzi, a marine and founder of the Veteran's Student Association at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, told my office that if he had a wish list of things to make his veteran experience better, the number one item would be fixing the lack of verification for the monthly housing stipend and, therefore, giving him better access to housing.  The fact that Nick and many veterans like him have no proof of income that a property manager or landlord could consider when weighing creditworthiness and income qualifications is the definition of an unnecessary burden.  Mr.Speaker, this bipartisan legislation would help veterans obtain proof of income for the housing allowance[[Page H8561]]they receive while utilizing the post-9/11 GI This is, as we have all said, a commonsense fix to this problem. It requires the VA to make documentation for the post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing stipend accessible and available online. That is it.  Student veterans will use this documentation to provide needed verification to housing agents, apartment managers, and potential landlords. This bill would provide a permanent solution to the inadequacy of the statement of benefits that is currently available--an official form, accessible online, that verifies the housing benefit is necessary and builds upon existing website functionality. The VA's eBenefits site already provides access to certification letters for VA compensation and pension benefits.  Mr.Speaker, this fix could have a big effect. There are close to 1.1 million student veterans using the post-9/11 GI Bill who would be eligible to benefit from this.  Mr.Speaker, our veterans have earned this benefit. We, as elected officials, feel a responsibility to make sure that they do not face bureaucratic hurdles that prevent them from taking advantage of all of the benefits that they have earned.  I would like to close by thanking Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their role in bringing this bill to the floor and for their work on behalf of all of our Nation's veterans.

His empty promises have already hurt millions of people across the country, from our seniors who depend on Medicare and Medicaid, to the LGBTQ community he promised to protect and Dreamers living in fear of deportation.  Now, with the nomination of Peter Robb to serve as the General Counsel at the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, Donald Trump has broken yet another promise--this time, to fight for and protect American workers. As an independent agency, the NLRB has an important mission to enforce our Nation's labor laws, protect American workers, and safeguard their right to organize collectively.  The NLRB's mission is not to ignore our Nation's labor laws, to go after American workers, or to weaken their right to organize. Yet Peter Robb's career has been dedicated to doing all the things that NLRB is not about.  Joining the anti-union, anti-worker forces, President Trump has consistently nominated people to the NLRB who are best positioned to destroy and undermine the core functions of the agency itself. Earlier this year, President Trump forced through two management-side lawyers to create an anti-worker majority on the  Today the Senate is debating the nomination of someone who has spent his entire legal career fighting to screw over the very workers the NLRB is supposed to protect. If confirmed as General Counsel, Mr.Robb will be responsible for supervising nearly 1,500 agents investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practice cases and overseeing elections where workers decide whether or not to unionize. This is a position[[Page S7080]]of great consequence for millions of workers across our country, and they deserve someone much better than Peter  Mr.Robb has spent his career defending management and employers from workers fighting to form a union, unionized workers on strike, and workers who brought forward discrimination and disability claims. You don't have to take my word for it. Mr.Robb's biography on his own law firm's website tells the story clearly:       [His] extensive experience includes advising on mergers/     acquisitions, plant closings, labor contract negotiations      (both large and small), managing lockouts and strikes,      securing labor injunctions, discrimination issues and      disability claims.       His litigation includes defending employers from unfair      labor practice charges, age and sex discrimination charges,      class action age claims, and wage/hour claims as well as      bringing suits against labor organizations. With such vast      experience and a no-nonsense approach, Peter's clients look      to him for sharp advice, rigorous representation and powerful      litigation.  That is a description on his own law firm's website.  Mr.Robb cut his teeth busting unions and retaliating against workers as lead counsel at the NLRB in the early 1980s when President Reagan decertified the air traffic controllers union, fired 11,000 air traffic controllers, and barred them from Federal service. More recently, he represented Dominion Energy's successful attempt to defeat a union organizing campaign at a power station in  Management and corporations have a right to hire lawyers like Mr.Robb who will vigorously represent their interests, but Mr.Robb is certainly not the right person to lead an agency whose mission is to protect workers' rights, not to go after those rights tooth and nail. Mr.Robb's record clearly demonstrates that he will side with powerful corporations and special interests over workers who lack the resources to defend themselves.  Unions built the middle class in Hawaii and across our country. Instead of confirming another management protector at the NLRB, we should be working together to protect workers and make it fairer for them to form and to join a union, which is their right.

1089,topic-id,902,"Mr.President, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on the floor of the Senate after my esteemed colleague from the State of My colleague is the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I just want to express my appreciation for his commitment and his work on behalf of all of our great veterans.  Like him, I rise today to speak in tribute to our veterans and men and women in uniform and all that they do for us.  This weekend at events across the country, we will pay tribute to the fine men and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Every day--but especially on Veterans Day--we honor these soldiers who have left the comforts of home and family to defend our freedoms and fight for our way of life.  Our freedoms have been secured by the sweat and sacrifice of courageous men and women who, throughout our history, have bravely done what was needed to protect our great We also recognize that those who serve do not serve alone. We appreciate, too, the sacrifices of the families and the loved ones who have supported our veterans in their service.  This Veterans Day, we will honor military members from our ``greatest generation'' to those men and women fighting in the War on Terror today. These Americans understand best the words of President Ronald Reagan when he said:       Freedom is never more than one generation away from      extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the      bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on      for them to do the same.  These men and women who have fought for and protected our country have given so much, and we cannot do enough to thank them, whether they returned from Active military duty 7 days ago or seven decades ago.  Although we can never repay our debt of gratitude, one of the most tangible ways we recognize our veterans' service is by providing these men and women with quality healthcare and support services, including education and work opportunities. With that debt in mind, let me briefly outline some initiatives that we have been working on to provide for our veterans. Congress has passed significant veterans bills this year, including legislation that holds the VA accountable and ensures that VA employees are putting our veterans first and legislation that updates and modernizes the VA's benefit claims and appeals process, reducing wait times for our veterans.  Additionally, one of my top priorities is ensuring that our veterans have access to healthcare options closer to their homes and their families.  This includes improving veterans' access to services under the Veterans Choice Program and building on the success of the Veterans Care Coordination Initiative at the Fargo VA Medical Center in my home This effort has decreased the wait time for scheduling an appointment under Veterans Choice from 24 days a year ago to 5 or 6 days at present. This initiative can serve as a model to help address delays in scheduling appointments through the Veterans Choice Program across the  We invited Secretary Shulkin, from North Dakota, to see this firsthand, and our Veterans Care Coordination Initiative has since been expanded to[[Page S7088]]the VA facility in Helena, MT, as well. We believe it will be expanded to other locations across the country.  We also passed an extension of the Veterans Choice Program earlier this year and secured $2.1 billion in additional funding for the program. This gives us time to work with the VA on the next phase of the program. In addition to Veterans Choice, we are working to improve local access to long-term care for our veterans.  We secured a commitment from Secretary Shulkin to work with us on the Veterans Access to Long Term Care and Health Services We have now introduced this legislation in the Senate, and a companion bill has been introduced in the House of The legislation would remove burdensome redtape that prevents nursing homes and other healthcare providers from accepting veteran patients. Our bill allows the VA to enter into provider agreements with qualified healthcare and extended care facilities, bypassing complex Federal contracting requirements. This will give veterans more options to access long-term care services closer to their homes, their families, and to their loved ones.  In addition, earlier this year, Congress passed--and the President signed into law--the forever GI bill, which improved and extended veterans' access to education and workforce opportunities. This is part of our efforts to ensure that we are supporting our veterans as they transition back to civilian life and work here at home. These are just a few examples of our efforts to ensure our veterans have the resources and the support they have so richly earned. While we cannot say thank you enough, in this way, we can honor their courage and their sacrifice.  We honor Veterans Day because we have the greatest veterans in the world who have committed themselves to protect our Nation, and in so doing, they have transformed this country into the greatest the world has ever known. May God continue to bless our veterans and this great Nation that they have been protecting and make sure we honor the selfless service of all our men and women in uniform, of all our veterans, not only on Veterans Day but every day.

943,topic-id,1337,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend for that information.  First, I want to start by saying that the majority leader and I and four other Members of the House had an opportunity to visit both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands last weekend since we had our last colloquy.  First, I want to thank the majority leader for organizing that trip and including me on it. It was an eye-opening trip. The majority leader and I have done an op-ed, which will be appearing sometime in the near term, on our observations.  One of the things, Mr.Speaker, that I know the majority leader and I had the opportunity to see, we were in Marathon, where you had housing that was built after Andrew and housing that was built before  Now, the difference was, after Andrew, that extraordinary hurricane, the building code was changed. We saw the stark difference between housing that survived essentially Maria and Irma and housing that did not, and the difference was, of course, that the housing that survived was built to different standards after  The majority leader and I discussed this matter, along with Mr.Bishop, who chairs the committee that oversees both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I think all of us are convinced that it would be penny-wise and pound-foolish not to build back, as Florida did, to standards that can withstand storms of this type.  So I wanted to thank the majority leader for his leadership on this issue.  The majority leader took the extraordinary effort to climb down a river bank, go across the river--the river was very low at that point in time--and then up a very long ladder, because people were stranded on the other side. The majority leader went to see them and assure them that we would not forget them.  We were the first codel to go to the interior of Puerto Rico, as opposed to simply go to San Juan or another large city, so I thank the majority leader for his leadership on that issue.  Mr.Leader, let me ask you about tax reform. That, of course, has been the big issue for some period of time now, but now we have a bill that is not on the floor yet, but was released yesterday.  It is clear this bill will cut taxes, in our view, for the wealthy. I don't know the statistics yet, what the division is, whether it is 80/20, as the initial proposal was, or perhaps a little less than that that goes to those over $900,000 in income. But, in any event, it also eliminates tax preferences that the middle class families rely on, and, obviously, we think it is going to face hurdles in  What I wanted to ask was: When does the gentleman expect the bill to be marked up?  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am excited about his question, because I am excited about this bill.  For more than three decades, we have waited for tax reform. Many people know the challenge of what they have with the government taking more than they should, and the challenge to see individuals raise their paychecks.  Ways and Means has announced that they will start markups next week. I assume that it will take them probably a week to get through the entire bill, going through regular order as we do, and then I would assume that we would bring that to the floor right after. We would like to get this to the American people as soon as possible.  I am willing to talk about the bill, I am willing to talk about the bill in any different manner, because we spent a lot of time working on this.  The very first thing that is going to happen for the American public, come January 1, they are going to get more in their paycheck, because what we do, we take the standard deduction, because in the current law today, a single individual in America, it is only the first $6,000 they have are tax free. Well, that is going to go to 12. For a couple, it is going to go to 24.  We take seven confusing rates and make it four. It is about cutting them. Every rate is lowered except the highest rate.  Then we go and look at: How can we make America competitive? I started my first business when I was 20 years old. Small business is the backbone of this country. Small businesses work harder than almost anybody else. We lower their rate to 25. That is the lowest it has been in 40 years.  Then all this money that is being pushed overseas that we tax too high so people won't bring it back--and there are trillions of dollars there--we are going to have that money come back. And what are they going to do? They are going to invest in  Now, the name of our bill is Tax Cuts and Jobs Just yesterday, I was with a company, We went into the Oval I had worked with this company for quite some time. They started in Bell Labs was part of it, and others. Three companies got together. They are technology; they were building; they were growing. Then what they found was, America's Tax Code was so burdensome on them, that for them to compete around the world, they became a company that domiciled in  Talking to them just the last month or so, laying out our tax bill, they said: You know what, we are so confident in you passing this, we are going to announce that we are moving back to America.[[Page H8476]]  They have $20 billion a year in revenue. They invest $9 billion every year in R&D and manufacturing, those manufacturing jobs we care so much about.  So yesterday, we were sitting in the Oval Office, and this is exactly what the CEO said. You know what he talked about? He grew up in He said: When I turned 18, the greatest engineering school in America gave me an opportunity, MIT, but my parents did not have wealth, but they gave me a scholarship.  He comes to America, gets his education, becomes an American, builds a company. He said it broke his heart he had to leave. He wants to give back to this country that has been so good to him, and he said this tax bill is actually doing it.  So we are creating jobs even before we pass it.  So I am very excited, but, if I may, I wanted to do a little research for you. So we have taken all the IRS tax information, and I broke it down in spreadsheets. So any district that wants to know about it, please come see me, and I will walk you through it.  So I take your district, Maryland's Fifth, currently, 47 percent of your filers in Maryland's Fifth take the standard deduction. They will be better off, because it doubles right off the bat. Another 11 percent of those who itemize their deductions won't have to do that anymore. Instead of spending weeks on their taxes, they will put it on a postcard in minutes. So they are going to get a higher deduction; they are going to get more money. That means even before lowering of the rates, 58 percent of your district is better off from day one.  Now, in addition, we repeal the alternative minimum tax, that So that costs 13,000 of your constituents in your district an average of $3,750. That is wiped away.  As we lower all the brackets, we will create a great deal of savings for everybody else. So I am excited about this.  I would love to look forward to working with you on it, because just as we just passed the CHIP bill bipartisan and the IPAB with more than 70 Democrats on that, I think this has been a very good week for  ",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8475-2.txt,566,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,3.0,November

The gentleman did not mention the $1.5 trillion in additional debt that the passage of the tax bill will result in, but he did talk about some people who are going to be really advantaged.  So I would like to ask the majority leader: Will those people who will be advantaged or, for that matter, disadvantaged have the opportunity next week to testify in a hearing on the substance of this bill?  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I think this is an excellent question.  So, first of all, you are asking about hearings. I caught you yesterday; I caught you on TV yesterday. You were pretty good. You were asked about hearings. This is what you said: A hearing is when you ask the public to come in and say: What do you think? What are your suggestions? How will this impact you?  Since taking the majority--you know what anniversary it is this week? When we rolled this bill out, it was the seventh anniversary of the Republicans winning on that election day for the majority. This is what we campaigned on.  Now, we have been working quite some time. Dave Camp has retired, but when he was with Ways and Means, he put out a Camp proposal. We have been having numerous hearings in those Congresses and this It took us to win the White House, it took us to win the Senate, but, you know what, we have kept our promise.  Let me walk you through the rest of what we have done. Since taking the majority, we have held at least 59 hearings on tax reform with witnesses from all sides on everything from simplification, to closing those loopholes that we have talked so much about together, to creating jobs, to accelerating economic growth. That is not to mention the countless town halls and the forums of Members who have held them in their districts all across.  Now, if we need further witnesses on the burden of our Tax Code, look no further than just me. As I told you, I was 20 when I started that first business. You know the three lessons I learned in my first business? I was the first one to work, I was the last one to leave, and I was the last one to be paid.  I remember investing all that I had. It was just a deli. I had six employees. It was early in the morning, the front was all glass, and here pulled up a little truck from the city, and they were knocking on the door 2 hours before I started. I thought maybe they wanted to give me a key to the city for starting a new business. He wanted to give me a ticket for my sign. I thought that was a little odd, because the sign was bringing more people in that paid more sales tax that paid their salary.  I learned the challenges of starting a small business.  What is so great about this bill is there are going to be so many more Americans who are going to take that risk, start a small business, and be successful, with so many more Americans working.  So I am excited about this, because that is what we have been hearing in our hearings--all those hearings we had, all those town halls, all those years we fought so hard to get to this point.  Mr.Speaker, I think this has been a good week.                              {time}  1130  ",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8475-2.txt,566,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR,2017.0,3.0,November
945,topic-id,1664,"Mr.Speaker, he did not answer my question, however. Will people have an opportunity to testify on this bill? The answer is no. No American will have an opportunity to come to a hearing.  In 1968, the gentleman from California, the majority leader, was not here. I was here. We had hearings over months, both sides of the aisle. Over 450 witnesses testified not on tax bills that may have been offered at some time in the future, including the Camp bill.  When the Camp bill, Mr.Speaker, was reported--actually, it wasn't reported. When it was put on the table by Chairman Camp from Michigan, who is now retired, the Speaker's response was, when asked by the press, ``What are you going to do with that bill?'' he said, blah, blah, blah, blah. In other words, what he was saying was all talk. We are not going to do anything with that bill, and that bill never saw the light of day.  It was paid for, Mr.It was tough love. I didn't agree with everything in the Camp bill, but I congratulate Congressman Camp for having the courage to put a bill on the floor that was paid for, not creating $1.5 trillion in additional debt that our children will have to pay. They are not here to testify either.  I don't want to really get into a debate on the specifics. We are going to have a lot of time to do that next week, and I intend to do it next week, but he talked about small businesses being reduced to 25 percent. They will be if they make over $500,000.  That is why the NFIB is not for this bill, Mr.Speaker, talking about small business. They are the spokespersons for small businesses, and they are not for this bill.  We will talk about the substance, but the process mirrors the process for the Affordable Care Act: no hearings, no witnesses, very, very little time for the public or the Congress to digest the substance of this bill dropped yesterday. It is going to be marked up on That is 96 hours to consider a bill well over 500 pages.  Mr.Speaker, I asked about process. The reason I asked about process and regular order is because regular order provides for input from the people we serve, the public, about whether the bill is good, bad, or indifferent and how it will impact them.  We are going to debate it here. We represent those people. But regular order is hearing from them before we act, not after we act.  Yes, we are replicating the Affordable Care Act: put on the table, quickly passed, jammed through, sent to the And it didn't work, Mr.I don't think this will work either.  I was here in 1986, Mr.Speaker, when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, Bob Packwood, who was the Republican's chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and Dan Rostenkowski from Illinois, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, worked together with Jim Baker, the former Secretary of State but then Secretary of the Treasury, worked with us to[[Page H8477]]come up with a bill that could be passed. And it was passed, Mr.Speaker, with overwhelming votes from both sides of the aisle. It was the last time we passed tax reform. Since then, we have just passed tax cuts.  Under Ronald Reagan, we passed a tax cut in 1981. The deficit increased under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Under George H.Bush, the deficit increased 55 percent in 4 years, 189 percent in 8 years. Under Bill Clinton, the debt increased 36 percent; George Bush, 87 percent after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and we were promised that they were going to energize the economy and dynamic scoring would come into effect and the country would be rolling in clover. Seven years later, we had the deepest recession anybody serving in this body has experienced, Mr.Speaker, and the debt exploded.  Barack Obama, just by contrast, inherited the worst economy any of us has seen--the worst economy--hemorrhaging 787,000 jobs per month in January of 2009. We had to bring the economy out of that deep recession, and we invested dollars. But even given all that necessity and the $700 billion bill that we passed, that George Bush passed, where two-thirds of Republicans were opposed and which kept us out of a depression, Barack Obama increased the debt by 1 percentage point more than George  I say to my friend, the reason for having hearings, the reason for having economic experts like Mr.Bartlett, who worked for Ronald Reagan, who said that tax cuts do not pay for themselves. They say $1.5 trillion. I guarantee you, Mr.Speaker--I may not be here when we can find this out--this is going to be far above $1.5 trillion in additional debt, and my children and my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will be exposed to paying that bill.  It is a shame, Mr.Speaker, that we do not have extensive hearings on this bill in the House and in the My judgment is the Senate doesn't expect to have hearings on this either. They are just going to try to jam it through, Mr.Speaker, and that is not good. That is not good for this institution. Much, much more importantly, it is not good for the present generation or generations to come.  We will debate, Mr.I know you are passionate about the substance. You are very knowledgeable about the substance. We talked about it in private, and I admire the passion that you have and the information that you argue. I may differ with your information, but we will have the opportunity to debate that, I think, next week and the week after.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr.Speaker, the first lesson, if you ever take debate, if you cannot win the argument on the substance of the bill, argue about process; go to process.  But you know what? This is not the beginning of the process. This is the end of the process. For 31 years, we have been working to get here. We had hearings upon hearings. We have gone to the American people. We went to the American people 7 years ago this week, and they made a very big decision: to change the direction.  We went back in 2014, and they made another big decision, and they made one just a short time ago.  I heard you talk about a lot of Presidents, but I think you missed one. Really, this bill is about growth in this country, about job creation, about raising somebody's paycheck.  The history of America, from the beginning of time until 2006, we always averaged more than 3 percent growth. If you just take the last 8 years, if you take the very best year under Barack Obama--and I will go apples to apples. Let's take Bill The growth year under Bill Clinton's worst year is higher than Barack Obama's best year. That is why the middle class is hurting. That is why this tax cut helps the middle class.  What is most interesting, you want to talk about debt? You talked about a lot of You can add up all those Presidents, and you know what? Just one President, Barack Obama, added all that money and more to the debt.  What is more interesting to me, if my friend is concerned about the deficit, I want to ask you this: Why did you vote for a budget that increases the deficit by $6.8 trillion over 10 years? Why would you do that this year? Why would you, as a party, bring that forward as your plan.  Do you know what we are bringing forward? We are going right through the rules. We have gone all through the hearings. We know, even before this bill passes, just as yesterday, that the companies are coming back to America; $20 billion a year in revenue, one company has already announced. They are going to put $3 billion every year into research and development and $6 billion into manufacturing.  I think the debate on process is over. This bill is less than 500 pages.  You talk about us bringing it up? Yes, so the whole American public can see the bill and read it. It is much different than when we talk about your ACA--more than 2,000 pages, and I was here. I watched what was brought right to the floor and jammed through. And you are right; the ACA doesn't work.  We believed in doing something different. We made a promise to the American public--3 days for public viewing. It is longer than 3 days.  We made a promise to the American public that we would make sure you keep more of what you earn, we would create more jobs. You know what happened after that last election? We just went through the second quarter of 3 percent growth.  You and I just talked about the number of hurricanes we just watched, the devastation. People say it probably knocked off 1 percent of growth. You know what the Atlanta Fed just came out with? They are predicting, they think we are going to go to 4\1/2\.  Do you know what? The best days of America are in front of us because of the work we have done. Let's not argue about process, because we know we have been through this process for 31 years. We know what the American public has said. We know in the hearings what they have told us, and we have listened. Now I think is the time to have the courage to lead. Let's take what we heard in those committees and put it into a bill, exactly what we just did.  To have the returns before the bill is even passed of jobs coming back, to me, like I said earlier, this is a good week, but this is going to be a great month.

946,topic-id,998,"Mr.Speaker, we are going to debate the substance of the bill; we are going to debate it fully. We think it will not hold up well under that debate. Therefore, we will have a significant difference.  He is right. The best economy anybody in this House has experienced--the best economy--was the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, period. Guess what we had? We had a little bit of a tax increase. We increased the gasoline tax, and we tried to pay to for infrastructure. We haven't increased it since then.  The Republicans said: You do that, oh, the economy is going to go down the drain. The best economy any Republican has experienced in their lifetime is under Bill We balanced the budget 4 years in a row under Bill Clinton, the only President you can mention that balanced.  It never balanced under Ronald It never balanced under George H.It never balanced under George As a matter of fact, as soon as they took office, they made sure we wouldn't have further balances because they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but they didn't cut spending.  He talks about President I know the majority leader will be interested in these statistics. I didn't count January of 2017 because, after all, that was the Obama economy. Trump had not done anything on the economy, but let's start with February 2017.  Under Donald Trump, 232,000 jobs were created. That is great. That is good. I would say that the Obama economy is still working.  Same exact month a year earlier, not 232, but 237,000 jobs were created under Barack  March 2017, 50,000 under March 2016, 225,000 jobs created under Barack  April 2017, 207,000 jobs. Barack Obama was a little down that month, 153,000 jobs.  145,000 under Trump, 43,000.  Then June of 2017, 210,000 under Donald Trump, 297,000 jobs under Barack  July of 2017, we are getting more recent. Under Trump--now he has been in[[Page H8478]]office a little longer--138,000. What was it under Barack Obama? 291,000 jobs--double.  August of this year, just a few months ago, 169,000 under Donald Trump; 176,000.  Last month we had hurricanes. I will give the majority leader that. We lost 33,000 jobs. Under Barack Obama, same month a year ago, 249,000 jobs created.  As a matter of fact, under Barack Obama, we created 11,773,000 jobs.                              {time}  1145  Under George Bush, 2 million--excuse me--lost under George Bush, private sector jobs, a loss, after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, lost 1,159,000 jobs. The last 12 months of the George Bush administration, 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, we couldn't change economic policy. We were in charge for the last 2 years, couldn't change it, lost 4,568,000 jobs.  Now, as a matter of fact, I have done a little thing for 68 years. Over 68 years, we had 36 years of Republican Presidents and 32 years of Democratic Under Republican Presidents, from Truman to Obama, there were 35,448,000 jobs created, Mr.Under Democrats, in 32 years, 62,669,000 jobs.  Now, I would like to go on to another subject, as we could go on debating this all day, but I will yield to my friend.  Mr.I thank the gentleman for yielding, because you did ask a question in there.  When you talked about Bill Clinton, you asked: What did he have?  Well, when he first came in, he had Democrats in the majority, but all that growth happened because he won a Republican House and a Republican That is when we turned it around with John Kasich as the budget chair. That is when we balanced the budget in those 4 years.  We had to send him welfare reform how many times?  Three times. He vetoed it all the other times and claimed some glory.  But also there is another question you asked. I love a good debate. I love to pick just facts when you don't want to look at the whole picture. The best thing to even just look at if you want to go: Did the election matter? Did the election matter to the American public?  Well, I heard a lot of pundits on the other side say: Oh my God, if President Trump got elected, the market is going to crash.  You know what? Most everyone in America that invests for retirement invests in the market, and President Donald Trump has given them all a raise because we set new records, more than 60 times; that is because of the belief of what they think he could achieve.  When you look at what he has been able to do with regulation, unbelievable.  The few headlines you didn't announce during Obama, when you were doing those jobs, you didn't say anything about Nabisco leaving the country, or Burger King went and domiciled someplace else. Why?  What was the answer that President Obama would have when companies were leaving America because the taxes were too high? We will pass a law to say they can't.  You know the difference that election has made?  We just proposed a tax bill. Companies are now coming to the Oval Office to say: We are coming back. And all that means is more jobs, more money for  I understand that we are going to probably have a philosophical difference of agreement. I believe Americans should keep more of what they earn. I know what you said a few weeks ago. My friend cast his vote in favor of a budget that calls for ``$3.9 trillion in revenue enhancements.''  You know who I think needs the revenue?  The American public. That is why we doubled the standard deduction, and that is for every On day 1 they will get more in their check.  Small businesses, lowest tax in 40 years. All that money that those companies were being pushed out are going to come back.  We can argue all you want about this, but for 31 years we have had this argument. I think the American public is waiting for us to lead.  ",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8475-2.txt,566,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2201, MICRO OFFERING SAFE HARBOR",2017.0,3.0,November
947,topic-id,1428,"Mr.Speaker, you noticed that he didn't talk about any of the statistics I mentioned about job creation under Barack He didn't talk about the 62 million jobs that were created in 32 years, as opposed to the 35 million jobs, just half of what we did in less than 4 years than they had as President of the United  And what he didn't talk about was--he said: You know, we Republicans were in charge of the Congress the last 6 years of the Clinton administration.  That is right.  And what Bill Clinton said: Let's save Social Security first. Let's not cut out revenues that we need to invest in the education and the growth of our economy.  They weren't for that, but they couldn't do anything about it.  Then, guess what happened. They took the They had the House and they had the  Why couldn't you do what was done under Bill Clinton then, when you controlled everything, I ask my Republican friends, Mr.Speaker? Why couldn't you, when you controlled every organ of government, do what you say was done under the Clinton administration, because you were in the minority, very frankly, or you were in the majority and controlled things? Why couldn't you do it when you controlled everything? Why did you leave us with 4.8 million hemorrhaging jobs as you came out of office, and your economic program was still in place that you put in place in 2001 and 2003, and the deepest recession you and I have experienced in our life times?  And I am older than you are. You didn't answer that. You continue to talk about what is going to happen.  I tell the story about the guy who comes in and he wants to be the left fielder for the Nats, and he says: You know, I am going to hit 350 next year.  I said: But you hit 260 last year.  He says: Well, yeah, I know, but this year I am going to hit 350.  And the other guy comes in and says: I would like the same job. I hit 325 this year and I hit 324 last year. Who do you think you hire?  The whole point is, Mr.Leader--I say to the Speaker--is that performance counts, not just talk, not just promises. Because I will tell you, Mr.Leader, I have been here a long time and I heard the same language in 1981 from David He now says it was baloney. I heard the same talk in 2001 and 2003. It didn't work out so well.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am going to go on to another subject because we need to go to another subject, but we need to have this debate because it is critical for my children, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren, and for generations to come as to whether this country is, like we did it under Clinton, on a fiscally sustainable path where we are balancing budgets, or whether we are going to go back to the deep deficits.  He didn't respond, 189 percent increase in the debt under Ronald One person in America, Mr.Speaker, can stop spending: the He can veto spending bills.  In my 37 years, we have never had a veto overridden of a President who vetoed a bill because we spent too much money; not once in the 37 years I have been here, Mr. But I want to go on to another subject that ought to be less controversial because I think the majority of Republicans and I think, unanimously, the Democrats want to see us do what the President, apparently, has asked us to do. And that is, protect the DACA students, the DACA doctors, the DACA teachers.  We have a Dream Act that has been filed. Every Democrat supports it. We want that to come to the floor in this transparent, open process, and I have talked to the majority leader about it.  The President, contrary to Speaker Ryan's advice, rescinded the protections for the childhood arrivals who arrived here through no fault of their own. He said to the Congress, it needs to be done in legislation. He didn't say it needs to be done in legislation with a lot of other things. And the Speaker has said we are going to take one issue at a time. I won't bring out that quote, but the majority leader has heard me use it before.  So I urge the majority leader because I believe he does not want to send these mostly young people who don't know any other country but America, who see themselves as Americans, who have[[Page H8479]]been educated in our schools, serving in our communities, positive participants in growing America like so many immigrants before them, a nation of immigrants. Send me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.  We should have the DACA bill on the floor before we leave for this Mr.Leader, I said this with respect to the Export-Import Bank, that a majority of your party would vote for that if it came to the floor. We got it to the floor and, as I predicted, a majority of your Members voted for it.  I believe that very close to, if not all, a majority of your party will vote for this, and the overwhelming numbers in this House will vote for that bill.  I would urge my friend to bring it to the floor before we leave for the Thanksgiving break on the 16th of I would urge that because we are going to have some very messy 8 days after Thanksgiving, with great workload on our desks; not the least of which is how to deal with the sequester, how to deal with funding government for the balance of the year, what to do with flood insurance, and so many other issues; not to mention our supplemental that we need to do with respect to Houston and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin  So I urge my friend to work with us to bring the Dream Act to the floor, or bring your alternative to the floor. But let us not leave these people, who the President says he loves, who are positive Americans in everything but paper, who have been here almost all of their lives. Some came at 2 or 3 years of age and know no other country. Let's bring a bill to the floor that we can end before we go on the Thanksgiving break, in a united way--we are going to be divided on the tax bill. We understand that--but in a united way on this, where even Rush Limbaugh says we are not going to send these kids home.  I would hope that you could do that, Mr.I believe you have it in your heart to do it, and I would hope that we could do it.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I have great respect for the gentleman.  It is true, we just recently traveled to look at the hurricanes and we had a lot of discussions. We disagree philosophically at times, but I think there is a place that we can find agreement upon.  I listen to you when you speak. I did just hear you ask right before: ``Why couldn't you do it when you controlled everything?''  I kind of ask my friend the same thing. When you controlled everything, the White House, the House, and the Senate, you had a self-proclaimed master legislator as You had an opportunity.  But I know this is the window, and I know President Trump wants to get it done. That is why he put out things that he wants to see done as well. We talked about chain migration. We talked about border security.  We have been meeting--the Speaker and I just had a meeting yesterday with a number of Members about this. We would like to solve this problem overall, and I think it is a place everybody can work together, to secure our border, work on the chain migration problem, and solve this problem for others.  Now, I know there is a 6-month time period here, and I don't want to confuse issues because I would like to focus on this issue as well, but I don't want to have the government shutting down over an issue. You and I know we both discussed things like that, and I never think that is productive with whatever we do; but I look forward to continuing working with you to solve this issue.

147,topic-id,776,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Colorado allowing me an opportunity to speak on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits the sale or delivery of securities that have not been registered with the agency.  A large portion of startups--and, really, these are ideas--rely on small, nonprofit offerings also known as private placements, such as with friends and family. They do a round of offerings in order to raise initial, early-stage seed capital; however, the Securities Act of 1933 does not define what constitutes a public offering or, conversely, a nonpublic offering. As a result, startups may unintentionally violate the act when it seeks to offer securities to potential investors in a private placement.  Let's put that in real Let's make this actually approachable in a way that I think true American entrepreneurs can understand.  The reality is, these are people with an idea, a drive to move forward and to improve something. They go and offer to their family, or maybe ask of their family, to be a part of that dream, to help with some seed capital, to give them a little bit of their hard-earned money to help them achieve their dream.  And, guess what?  They get to take part in the success of that. There is some risk, but there is also reward.  How this really translates is that there might be the doctor who has got a great idea for a new health drink or a new implement to use while he is in surgery. This might be a mom who left the workforce and was taking care of her kids and said: There has got to be a better way of making sure my kids are getting a healthy meal transported to school; or something like that.  These are people who are looking around and saying: I can go make life better not for me, not just for my family, but for others. They are then trying to pursue that.  To address this uncertainty that we have, H.2201, the Micro Offering Safe Harbor Act, would implement a simple amendment to the Securities Act of 1933, by making clear what constitutes a nonpublic offering.  It is going to provide small businesses with needed clarity and confidence to know that their offering is not a Securities Act violation. Think of that. Again, it might be that doctor or that stay-at-home mom who is out there just trying to fund an idea, unintentionally and with no malice or no understanding that they are violating Federal law.  A micro-offering authorized under this bill would allow small businesses or small entrepreneurs to operate with confidence, and the commonsense requirements to be a part of this are such:  Each investor has a substantive preexisting relationship with an owner. This is no fly-by friendship. This is somebody who you actually know;  There are fewer than 35 purchasers or investors; and  Also, the amount cannot exceed $500,000.  If you just divide out $500,000, which is a lot of money, by 35 people, that is less than $15,000 a person. That is $14,285, to be exact. This is not about helping Wall Street somehow, for crying out loud. This is about Main  I believe it is important to note, as the sponsor, Mr.Emmer, had noted earlier, that nothing in this bill would remove or inhibit the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Department of Justice from prosecuting securities fraud.  With antifraud protections still in place, the legislation appropriately scales Federal rules and regulatory compliance costs for these small businesses and entrepreneurs.  H.2201 is a commonsense bill designed to help Main Street and not Wall Simply put, it will allow these small businesses and entrepreneurs, these DREAMers, to access capital necessary for their growth.  As I said, Representative Emmer has done a phenomenal job in shepherding this through. In a 2016 Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee hearing where we dealt with the bill, he had a great quote that said:  ``The problem with the ability of small businesses to effectively use this exemption is--the term `private offering' is not defined in law. Not only does this prevent small business from using the exemption, it leaves businesses who try to use the exemption and can't afford a team of expensive lawyers--which, again, most small businesses cannot--exposed to potential lawsuits and future liability. . . . This legislation will create a bright line safe harbor for small private offerings. It will help entrepreneurs open new businesses and expand existing ones.''  Mr.Speaker, I applaud the hard work of my colleague, Mr.Emmer, on this bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.2201.

493,topic-id,639,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, nationally recognized statistical rating organizations--or NRSROs, as they are known--have been heavily criticized for the role that they played in facilitating the financial crisis.  In the years leading up to the crisis, the government adopted a series of policies that had the effect of conferring a ``Good Housekeeping'' seal of approval on the rating agencies and on their products, including designating certain agencies as nationally recognized--a label that they had put on--and hardwiring references to their ratings into numerous Federal statutes and regulations.  These regulatory privileges and the perception that the government had placed its blessing on the rating agencies' assessments led to a sense of complacency among investors and a failure of private sector due diligence that contributed to mispriced risk and a collapse of market confidence when ratings of certain asset-backed securities were called into question during the credit meltdown of 2007 and 2008.  Mr.Speaker, as a result, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated myriad regulatory requirements on these NRSROs that were aimed at enhancing their disclosure and transparency. While some of these provisions may have been constructive, several created new barriers to entry and further entrenched a type of rating agency oligopoly that has not served investors or the economy well.  The Dodd-Frank Act follows a ``registration, not regulation'' approach. While it does not require the SEC--the Securities and Exchange Commission--to regulate or evaluate the rating agencies' methodologies or models, it does seek to ensure that ratings are based on an objective application of the methodologies and that commercial considerations do not influence ratings decisions.  Specifically, section 932, creates the Office of Credit Ratings at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which imposes more stringent conflict-of-interest regulations on credit rating agencies and gives the compliance officers at these rating agencies additional responsibilities, including filing annual reports with the  While credit agencies must be held accountable, these increased reporting requirements have given the burden to small credit rating agencies and have hurt investors who bear the true cost of these rules. That one-size-fits-all annual reporting requirements imposed by Dodd-Frank on all NRSROs placed unnecessary burdens and compliance costs on small NRSROs, who in no way were a cause of the financial crisis.  As a result of the annual reporting requirements, large NRSROs that can absorb these compliance costs have gotten bigger; and smaller NRSROs, for whom these compliance costs really impose a disproportionate burden, they have been prevented from entering the marketplace and providing necessary competition.  On May 15, 2013, former Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White wrote a letter on behalf of a unanimous commission to Chairman Hensarling of the Financial Services Committee to request the provisions of H.3911 as a legislative proposal. She said: ``Rather than focusing every year on each of the designated eight review areas, allowing a risk-based approach would permit the SEC staff to tailor examinations. . . . As a result, staff could focus limited resources on these specific risks rather than reviewing the designated eight areas, some of which may not present a risk for a particular firm. . . . `'  Consistent with former Chair White's request, H.3911, statutorily changes the annual reporting requirements so that they are risk-based, instead of requiring the burdensome review of all eight review areas currently mandated.  This approach is a commonsense balance that still ensures large NRSROs are regulated while smaller NRSROs are provided necessary relief to enter and thrive in the marketplace.  The legislation unanimously passed the Financial Services Committee last month, and I was pleased to be a part of that.  At this time I would like to commend the bipartisan work of Representatives Wagner and Foster on this important bill. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.3911.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8545-3.txt,2028,HYDROPOWER POLICY MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2017,2017.0,7.0,November

630,topic-id,682,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, in response to the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an organization that, frankly, most citizens might not have any idea exists, much less the effects and the influences on their banking lives, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed to modify internationally negotiated bank regulatory standards, known as the Basel This was going to increase bank capital requirements.  On July 9, 2013, the Federal banking regulators here in the United States--including the Federal Reserve; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FDIC; and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, OCC--all issued a final rule to implement most of the so-called Basel III recommendations, including modifications to capital requirements.  Basel III imposes new rules for high volatility commercial real estate, also known as  Unfortunately, we have a lot of acronyms in the Financial Services space, but you will be hearing a lot about these HVCREs over the course of the next few minutes.  These HVCRE rules are those which the regulations characterize as loans that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property. Loans that finance the acquisition, development, and construction of one- to four-family residential properties, projects that qualify as community development investment, and loans to businesses or farms with gross revenue exceeding $1 million are exempt from this HVCRE classification.  In June of 2017, the Treasury Department released its first report in response to the President's February 2017 ``Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System,'' informing the administration's perspective to regulate the financial system. The report, entitled, ``A Financial System That Creates Economic Opportunities--Banks and Credit Unions,'' calls on regulators to simplify and clarify the definition of these HVCRE loans to avoid the application of excessively stringent postcrisis capital requirements and concentration limits related to such loans, but does not identify specific language and changes.  Additionally, in September of this past year, the OCC, FDIC, and the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that attempted to simplify the regulatory capital calculations for these The proposal would change the current definition of HVCRE and replace it with a new definition related to high volatility acquisition, development, or construction loans. HVADC is what it has been dubbed.  The complexity of the HVCRE definition and its uncertain application are making it difficult for banks to comply.  While we appreciate the various banking agencies' attempt at simplifying the capital treatment of acquisition, development, and construction loans, their proposal actually broadens the number of loans subject to higher capital charge. This actually increases the amount capital banks will be required to carry for these ADC loans--hardly a simplification.  Increases in risk weighting on these loans have had a significant impact on institutions' capital ratios and, as a result, have increased costs to borrowers. If a loan is classified as an HVCRE loan, the lender will face a lower return on its capital as a result of the higher capital reserve requirement, meaning they are going to have to hold more capital. This will lead to increased pricing on the loan, including a higher interest rate for the borrower.  H.2148, Clarifying Commercial Real Estate Loans, introduced by my colleagues Representatives Pittenger and Scott, helps address the uncertainty related to the Basel capital rules and its impact on certain acquisition, development, or construction loans. The bill clarifies the types of loans that should and should not be classified as HVCREs and which types of equity can be used to meet capital requirements.  Currently, that uncertainty is creating confusion and affecting commercial real estate ADC loans by increasing borrowing costs and reducing credit availability, which may be contributing to a slowdown in commercial real estate lending.  I commend the bipartisan works of Representatives Pittenger and Scott on this important bill. Having passed the Financial Services Committee by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 59-1, there is no reason that we shouldn't have the same overwhelming bipartisan support for H.2148 today.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.2148, and I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1430  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8547.txt,2028,CLOTURE MOTION,2017.0,7.0,November

Were it not for our veterans, this Republic would not exist.  I was wondering how I would start out this speech. I did an interview with a reporter who wanted to ask me a number of questions about the current administration and what we were doing for veterans. It turned out to be a 35- or 40-minute interview.  I said I had to go, and he said: I have one more question for you.  This was by phone. So I couldn't look him in the eye, and he couldn't see me.  He said: I have one more question for you.  When you hear that from a reporter, that means the zinger is coming.  He said: Don't you think we could save a lot of money if we didn't fight in any more wars?  I thought for a minute. I said: We probably could, but there wouldn't be any reason for you and me to exist if we didn't fight any more wars, because[[Page S7086]]America is the place where everybody wants to be because we are safe and we are free and we are independent, because we fight and defend what we have as a country. I thought I would bring that up in my speech today because that is the reason we celebrate veterans today. So we give thanks to the men and women who volunteer, who served our country in the wars overseas, in the battles overseas, and, sometimes, in the challenges domestically to protect us and keep us free.  America is a great country. We don't find anybody trying to break out of the United States of They are all trying to break in and for a very good reason. It is a safe and free place to raise a family, to start a business, and to serve in many other ways.  So this year, on the 11th day, at the 11th hour and the 11th minute of November, when we celebrate Veterans Day, pause for a minute to say thanks for those who have come and gone and for those who are still here who fight to serve and protect us.  Always remember that the Congress, shortly after the end of World War I, decided that the 11th day--the day the armistice was signed--of the 11th month, November, with the 11th hour being 11 o'clock in the morning, would be the time the bell would toll to celebrate and pay tribute to those veterans. So at 11:11:11 this November 11, we are all going to toll that bell one more time to give thanks for our veterans for all they have done for us and for all they will do for us in the future.  It is best, when you talk about veterans, to talk about them as the people they were and the people they are, whether they are alive or whether they have passed on. I want to talk about two veterans whose paths have crossed my life to point out why we owe them so much and why we have so much to be thankful for. One of them is Jackson Elliott Cox, III of Burke County, GA, which is the Bird Dog Capital of North It has raised and trained more bird dogs than anywhere else in the country. It is the home of a nuclear power plant, the Plant It is a beautiful rural county in  Jack was my best friend in college. We met in 1962; we graduated in 1966. I will never forget that the last time I saw Jack was when he was shipping out to go to OCS in the Marine Jack had decided when he graduated that it was more important for him to volunteer and fight for our country because of what was going on in Vietnam than do anything else, so he voluntarily joined the Marine Corps, went to OCS, got his commission as an officer, and became a captain in the U.Marine He fought and he died in  I will never forget the last words he told me when we put him on the bus from Waynesboro, GA, to Atlanta, ultimately, to be shipped out. What he said is: Johnny, I am sure I am coming back. Don't worry about me. Just pray for me. But in case I don't, make sure people remember who Jackson Elliott Cox III was.  I said: Jack, I will do that.  Sure enough, 2 years later he was shot and killed by a sniper in He lost his life at the age of 24. He was the finest human being I had ever known, the nicest guy I had ever met, and my favorite friend in all of my life. He was taken from me because he volunteered to serve and fight for our country.  I am going to keep today on the floor of the U.Senate the promise I made to him at the bus station. I want you to know who Jackson Elliott Cox III was. He was a good old country boy from South Georgia who volunteered to serve his country and risked his life and gave his life so that you and I could be here today.  There are thousands of Jackson Elliott Coxes all over the world. In fact, there are millions all over the country. There are hundreds of thousands of them, and we have so much to thank them for because less than 1 percent of our population has worn the uniform, been in the battle, and fought to save us and protect us as Jackson Elliott Cox did.  When you have your chance to meet and become friends with a veteran--and all of you will--remember you owe them a debt of gratitude. At some time, when you get the chance to pay that debt back, do what I am doing today. Don't let their memory ever be lost or forgotten no matter where you go or where life takes you because you wouldn't get to where you are going, had they not allowed you to be safe and free to travel that route.  The second name I am going to mention is Noah Noah was from Ellijay, Noah was a cheerleader at the University of On September 11, 2001, he turned on his television to see 3,000 innocent citizens, most of them Americans, die in the Twin Towers when al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden and the axis of evil attacked our country, took our innocence, killed our people, and changed the world forever.  Noah was a cheerleader. We don't have a mandatory draft anymore. You don't have to serve, and he was not serving. He was going to graduate in a year and a half. He wanted to be an architect.  The next morning, after 9/11, when he left his dorm, he went to the Army ROTC building at the University of Georgia campus. He walked in and said: I want to go to I want to go. After what I saw on TV last night, I want to go fight and get the people who did that to my country and my friends.  They said: No, Mr.Harris you can't do that. OCS is a 2-year program at the university, and you are graduating next year. You don't have enough time to do it.  He said: I will double up on my studies. I will do whatever. I want to go. I want to fight for my country and fight the axis of evil.  They let him in, and he did. He graduated with honors. A few months later, he graduated as second lieutenant from the U.Army at Fort Benning in Before too long, he was in Gazaria in Iraq, a suburb of Baghdad, handing Beanie Babies out of one pocket while the other pocket of his field jacket had his ammunition. He was trying to win over the hearts of the Iraqi children while he was fighting to preserve freedom for them and return their country to some form of a democracy or republic, away from the captives of Saddam  I knew Noah casually. I know his parents well--Rick and Lucy I know they have mourned every day since they lost Noah in Baghdad when he died in an IED accident, but I know how proud they are of what he did and why he did it. I am proud he was my friend, and I am proud to have known him as well. I am proud to be able to stand on the floor of the U.Senate today and talk about Noah Harris and talk about Jackson Elliott Cox, who were exemplary of all the others who have served in the military--men and women, rich and poor, Black and White, who have gone and fought the battle and borne the battle for us so that we could be where we are today.  It kind of reminds me of the person who went to Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia shortly after the Constitution was adopted in Constitution Hall and said: Mr.Franklin, what have you given us?  He paused for a minute and said: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''  We have kept it. We have kept it because we have subscribed to the Constitution but also because we have a militia and a military. We are willing to fight for what we believe in, protect our citizens, and keep our country free. The country that our Founding Fathers gave to us, that was nurtured in the early days of this Republic, which now is hundreds of years old, is still there today for lots of reasons but, principally, the undergirding foundation is a strong and vibrant military.  When Veterans Day comes, give thanks for the veterans you know. Mention a couple of them, as I have done here, so their memory and their names never die, but also so we can lift them up at a time when we pause for just a minute to say thank you for the greatest country on the face of this  Senator Blunt talked about our committee and what we have done this year. I want to take just a minute to reiterate some of the things he said. There are no Democratic veterans and no Republican veterans; there are only American veterans. They don't go to the battlefield as a partisan; they go to the battlefield as an American, and they fight for us whether we are Republicans or They risk their own life and sometimes sacrifice it so that we can do what Ben Franklin said: Keep that republic. We owe them a lot. In fact, in many cases, we owe them everything.[[Page S7087]]  We have had a mess at the VA in the last 10 years. They have been the lead story on USA Today more than any other agency in the government for failures of the VA to do the job that should have been done. Under David Shulkin, the Secretary of the VA appointed by President Trump, under the leadership of our committees in the House and the Senate, and under a commitment to bipartisan service by all our Members--which means we do almost everything unanimously and, if not unanimously, almost unanimously because it is not about getting Republican credit or Democratic credit; it is about doing the right thing for the right people who have done so much for us--we passed the Whistleblower Protection Act this year to give whistleblowers in the VA the protection they need to go and turn in to the authorities those employees in the Veterans Administration who are not doing their job. We have given them the safe harbor they need to encourage them to help us root out problems, and we are doing that.  We passed the accountability bill to shine the light of sunshine on the employees of the VA and to give the authorities in the VA the ability to terminate and fire, if you will, for cause an employee who is not doing the job they should be doing for our veterans. So we hold a standard of accountability up a little higher for our employees in the Veterans  We are magnifying choice so that our veterans can have more choice in their healthcare. We can use the private sector as a force multiplier so that the government doesn't have to hire all the doctors and physicians and assistants to service the We can get them in the private sector as well.  In the 21st century GI bill, we finally made sure that the GI bill applies to everyone, not just World War II or Vietnam war-era veterans but veterans of all conflicts and of all times.  We have done everything we can to see to it that the benefits, which we promised them would be there when they left the military, are there for them in retirement and in their later life. The sacrifices they make are great, and the sacrifices we have made to save our veterans are great.  Today veterans come home from the battlefield 90 percent of the time when they are wounded. They come home, whereas, in World War I, 10 percent came home, and 90 percent died on the battlefield. But because of the advancements we have made in armor and protection and healthcare services, a lot of veterans today live when they would not have lived just 25 or 30 years ago.  The injuries they sustain are far greater than any injuries we have known in warfare before. The signature illnesses are PTSD, post-traumatic stress syndrome, or traumatic brain injury or a prosthesis for an arm or a leg or an eye or some part of the body that is lost in battle. But the trunk of the body is protected by new Kevlar vests that are impenetrable by a bullet, so most of them succumb to IEDs and explosives and things of that nature.  We have the healthcare to provide them with the best possible rehabilitation we can, but you can never really replace a leg or an eye or a body part. Once somebody has sacrificed it forever, they wear the burden of the battle and of war.  We have an obligation, as the Veterans Administration, as the Congress of the United States in the House and the Senate, to see to it that we back up those promises our recruiters made when they came to join the military, to see to it that they get those services from their Veterans  David Shulkin is doing a phenomenal job. My ranking member, Jon Tester, Democrat from Montana, is doing a fantastic job. The House committee is doing a great job. The Members of the Senate are doing a great job.  In a week and a half, we are going to have our final bill of the year which, when we pass it, will make us 8 for 8. We will have totally reformed the VA and worked with the VA to reform it in such a way that our veterans get better service, our taxpayers get more accountability for the dollars we spend, and America remains the great country it has always been--safe and free because of those who volunteer to fight and are willing to die on behalf our country.  So sometime on the 11th day and, hopefully, at the 11th hour and the 11th minute of that hour on November 11, you will pause for a minute and remember I told you that is when we celebrate Veterans Day because, at the time the armistice was signed in World War I, our country decided that would be the perfect time to remember all those who have fought in the past.  Let's look around, and every time we see a man or woman in uniform, stop and say ``Thank you for your service'' because those are the people who are risking their lives so that you and I can do whatever it is we choose to do in this land of the free and home of the brave.  There are lots of things to be thankful for but nothing more important than the men and women of the U.military.

The title of his editorial was: ``The Real Cost of War.''  ``I was in an airport lounge the other day when I saw a woman across the way. Why I kept staring, I don't know. Maybe it was just that she seemed so sad. And then I understood. And I looked away, hoping she had not seen me stare.  ``Because in her lap was an American flag, neatly folded into a triangle and placed in a clear plastic case--a flag folded the way it always is when it is given to a soldier's family as the soldier's coffin is lowered into the grave.  ``I figured her to be a soldier's mother, and I couldn't help but wonder what memories that flag evoked as she held it there.  ``Did it remind her of the first time she had seen her child in the delivery room, or was it the memory of seeing him go off to school that first day, or when he brought home the prize from the science fair, or maybe made the touchdown, or gave her the first Valentine when he wrote out, `Mommy, I love you.'  ``I keep thinking about all the talk in Washington about the high costs of defense and how we have to cut the Pentagon budget before it bankrupts the country.  ``But as I watched the woman, budgets seemed to be such a small part of all of it.  ``No, the real cost of war is not what we pay in dollars and cents.  ``The real cost is what we take from a mother who is left with just a memory--and a neatly-folded flag in a clear plastic case.''  Mr.Speaker, I share that with the House because I do not understand why, after 16 years in Afghanistan, we cannot have a debate on the floor of the House by all the Members here, of both parties, of whether we should continue to stay in Afghanistan or not.

406,topic-id,753,"Mr.Speaker, why, in 2016, would James Comey call the Clinton investigation a matter, not an investigation?  Last time I checked, he wasn't director of the Federal bureau of matters.  Why, in 2016, would then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, one day before the Benghazi report is due to come out, 5 days before Secretary Clinton is scheduled to be interviewed by the FBI, meet with former President Bill Clinton on a tarmac in Phoenix? Why would that happen in 2016?  Why, in the days just following that meeting with the former President, would Attorney General Loretta Lynch, when corresponding with the public relations people at the Justice Department via email, not use her real name and, instead, use the name Elizabeth Carlisle?  Again, it seems to me if you are just talking about grandkids and golf, you could probably use your real name.  Why, as we have learned recently, reported in The Federalist, why would the FBI be reimbursing Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier? Why would that be happening all in 2016?  You know, as the previous speakers have talked about, we have had this focus the last several months on potential Russia, Trump campaign collusion and influence, Russian influence on the election.  It seems to me we know something pretty clearly. The Obama administration Justice Department certainly tried to influence the election. I mean, I think we can see that without a doubt.  What did we learn today? The gentleman from Florida was talking about the dossier. What did we learn today?  It was reported today that the cofounder of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, was meeting with the now famous Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, both before the meeting that she had with Donald Trump, Jr., and after the meeting she had with Donald Trump, I find that interesting. The story keeps getting better.  When James Comey is fired, he then leaks a government document, through a friend, to The New York And what was his objective? What did he tell us?  Under oath, he told us this: Trying to create momentum for a special counsel.  Of course, it can't just be any special counsel. Who is that special counsel going to be?  Bob Mueller, his friend, his predecessor, his mentor and, maybe most importantly, as my good friend from Florida just pointed out, the guy who was running the FBI when the whole Uranium One deal was going down.  I mean, this is amazing. All we are asking for is for the Attorney General to name a special counsel to look into all these questions.  Why was it so critical that James Comey call the matter not an investigation?  Why was it so important that Loretta Lynch not use her real name when she is talking about the meeting she had with Bill Clinton on the tarmac?  Why was it so important that we get a special counsel, and that special counsel be Bob Mueller; so important that James Comey can leak a document, through a friend, to The New York Times, a government document? Why was all this so important?  All we are asking for is to name a special counsel to look into this; and we first asked for this 3\1/2\ months ago. Twenty members of the Judiciary Committee sent the Attorney General a letter on July 27, laying out all these questions and saying: Name a special counsel to look into it.  After all, the taxpayers, the American people, would like the answers. I know the ones in the Fourth District of Ohio would. I talk to them all the time.  For 2 months we heard nothing. So five of us went and met with the Attorney General asking about the July 27 letter, and would they appoint a special counsel. To date, we have got no answer, no response.  So I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for organizing this Special I appreciate my good friend from Florida, the gentleman from North Carolina, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and the gentleman from Arizona who are going to join us as well this evening.  It is time for a special counsel to be named to get the answers for the American people on these fundamental questions. We haven't said them all. There are lots of other questions, but these are the fundamental ones. It is time we had a special counsel get to the bottom of this. That is what we have called for.

290,topic-id,491,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which basically says companies should be protected, not workers.  Imagine, when a firm is jointly owned and operated by the Chinese or the Mexicans or the El Salvadorans, where workers' rights are never protected.  Worker protections in America have long accounted for the reality that the company who writes the check isn't always the company that controls workplace conditions, but if they share control over workplace conditions, they should be held jointly responsible for violations.  I include in the Record a letter from the United Auto Workers talking about the parts industry.         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &            Agricultural Implement Workers of America--UAW,                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million      active and retired members of the International Union, United      Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of      America (UAW), I strongly urge you to oppose H.3441, the      ``Save Local Business Act.'' This ill-conceived bill would      make it more difficult for workers to join together and      collectively bargain to improve working conditions and raise      living standards. This is a bad bill for working people      because it would make it even easier for businesses to      replace full time jobs with precarious temporary employment.       H.3441 overturns long established case law and joint      employer standards found in labor and employment law. It does      this by redefining the term `employer' in a way that would      make it nearly impossible for workers to hold their employers      accountable when their rights are violated.       Disturbingly, businesses and large corporations throughout      our economy have avoided responsibility to their employees by      hiding behind staffing agencies to claim they are not      technically their employer. The net result for working people      has been lower wages and fewer job protections. For example,      within the auto parts manufacturing sector, the National      Employment Law Project (NELP) estimates that temporary      workers earn, on average, 29% less than direct employees of      manufacturers. We have seen how, in the automotive sector,      multinational corporations often hire temporary workers, who      work side by side, doing the same job, for years, with full      time workers and earning significantly less.       H.3441 would also overturn the National Labor Relations      Board's (NLRB) in Browning-The Browning-Ferris      decision was good for working families because it established      that workers could negotiate with their true employer under      fact specific circumstances. In that case, a subcontractor      for Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI), Leadpoint, was unable      to negotiate several basic employment terms without      permission from The NLRB sensibly found that BFI must be      at the bargaining table along with its subcontractor      Under the terms of this bill, that would not be      the case when similar disputes arise in the future.       Economic inequality and a shortage of good paying jobs has      hurt working people and our economy for decades.      Unfortunately, H.3441 would make a bad situation worse.      Congress should reject this bill and instead work to create      more jobs you can sustain a family on.

The two gentlemen I would like to talk about, the two brave Americans, are Ira Schilling and Earl Louis  Ira Schilling is from He enlisted in the U.Marines Corps in October of 1941, at the age of 16. He was 16 years old. After completing his training, Ira was assigned as a rifleman to L Company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, 2nd Marine Division, and he took part in combat operations on Guadalcanal during the final weeks of that bloody campaign.  Ira was discharged from Active Duty in October 1945. In 1948, Mr.Schilling tried to reenlist in the U.Marines He was married at the time. The Marines Corps turned down his request. Undaunted, Mr.Schilling just went over and enlisted in the U.Navy, and he spent another 2 years on Active Duty in defense of this country. Ira is now 92 years young, and he lives in Haughton, LA, and he is a Civil Air Patrol wing chaplain.  Mr.Earl Louis Messmer was born in New Orleans, in the southern part of my State, in 1923. He is very proud--and we are all proud of him--for serving in the Battle of Peleliu from September 15 to November 15, 1944.  That battle was a fight to capture an airstrip in the Western Pacific The United States won. We prevailed due to the bravery of the Army's 81st Infantry Division, of which Earl was a member.  Upon his return from World War II, in 1945, Mr.Messmer went to Tulane  Earl has 2 daughters, 5 grandchildren, and 10 great grandchildren,[[Page S7104]]all of whom are enjoying the freedom of this country for which he fought so gallantly.  Earl has resided in Metairie, LA, since 1942.  It is imperative, in my judgment, that this Veterans Day--and every day--we honor the service and sacrifices made by our women and our men in uniform. That is why I have introduced a bill. It is the 75th Anniversary of the End of World War II Commemorative Coin I say to the Presiding Officer, I hope you will vote for it. This bill would authorize a commemorative coin to mark the milestone anniversary and the historic sacrifices of what has been aptly termed ``the Greatest Generation,'' and this bill will cost the American taxpayer zero dollars.

The least we can do, it seems to me, for those who fought for our freedom, is to ensure that institutions like the National World War II Museum in New Orleans are able to continue their mission to educate future generations about our country's role in World War II and to support the families of our veterans.

344,topic-id,538,"Mr.Speaker, no one likes to pay taxes, but when our Founders dreamt of a nation, they knew that our success would rest on every shoulder. So it is not to make us just citizens of this great country, but stakeholders where everyone chips in, where everyone contributes, where everyone has skin in the game.  It is the only way that a gutsy American experiment could work: if each of us is so committed to what this country stands for that we are willing to give a piece of what we earn to help it succeed. Of course, that willingness hinges on a system that would deliver for all of our people.  We pay into a common good because we also reap from a common investment. We send our kids to public schools. We sleep safe at night under the protection of American defense. We wear down roads and bridges with commutes, with after-school pickups, with delivery runs, and family trips. So we do our part, however begrudgingly, however it might strap us or sting us, and all that we ask for in return is that what we give gets put to good use.  The tax reform bill being offered by my Republican colleagues does not put that money to good use--not the money it takes from hardworking American families.                              {time}  1045  It does not ask families that are living paycheck to paycheck to fork over money that--make no mistake--they do not have so they can invest in affordable housing, so that we can help exhausted parents pay for quality childcare, and so that we can stop middle class kids from being priced out of higher education and ensure that families that are hit by catastrophic medical events don't lose their livelihood--not this bill.  Instead, this bill asks Americans to scrape their bank accounts so that the Trump administration can turn around and use that money to give to the wealthiest among us and make them even wealthier; so that they can make tax cuts for corporations permanent but abandon American workers after a few years; so that they can multiply dividends enjoyed by the 10 percent of Americans who own the vast majority of our Nation's stocks while everyone else gets left behind; so that they can blow a hole in our Federal deficit that again--make no mistake--working and middle class families will be forced to fill with their bare hands for generations to come, for we all know that the moment that this bill passes, you are going to hear those calls for cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security come roaring back from my Republican colleagues.  So for these families, the money that they send to the American Government every year isn't just some meaningless check. It represents the late nights; the double shifts; the school plays and the teacher conferences missed; the bedtimes when you didn't make it home; the vacations you could not take; those endless, countless, thankless sacrifices that you make every single day so that you can take care of the people whom you love.  You deserve a country that will make your contribution count and that will make that investment in your family, too. This bill doesn't even come close.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8604.txt,2172,1445,2017.0,8.0,November

It is hard to stomach yet another attempt to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, in the words of our colleagues, while extolling the virtues of public health programs by cutting grace periods down to 30 days that will result in hundreds of thousands of people losing access to their insurance.  It is hard to stomach a $1 trillion tax cut being proposed for wealthy adults at the same time that our Republican colleagues are telling us that we can't afford to care for sick kids. It is hard to stomach the indifference shown in this Chamber over the course of the past month as CHIP lapses and panic sets in amongst families whose lives depend on this program.  It is hard to stomach an idea that the only way to give them care is to somehow take it away from somebody else, by gutting the Public Health Fund in the midst of an opioid epidemic or scapegoating patients who struggle to afford the monthly premiums and sometimes fall behind.  Why is it always those patients who are asked to sacrifice?  It is always those communities that are asked to do more with less.  Why do we somehow create a false choice on this floor today that leads 9 million families to an impossible choice tomorrow?  For those families, CHIP is not a privilege or a line item in the budget, it is a lifeline.

Credit rating agencies did, in fact, play a central role in the subprime mortgage meltdowns by routinely assigning inflated credit ratings to high-risk structured mortgage products. These ratings, which were issued by agencies operating under conflicts of interests, allowed banks to assume unreasonable amounts of risk and resulted in the loss of trillions of dollars when the mortgages underlying those risky investments began to default.  In the wake of the ensuing financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act strengthened oversight of credit rating agencies, including by directing the SEC to create an Office of Credit Ratings responsible for conducting annual examinations of the rating organizations.  Currently, each rating organization examination must include a review of eight topic areas designed to assess the adequacy of each agency's internal controls, conflicts of interests, and rating methodologies, among other areas.  This legislation, H.3911, is responsive to former SEC Chair Mary Jo White's 2013 request to the Financial Services Committee for legislation that would allow the SEC staff to take a risk-based approach to annual rating organization examinations. Such an approach would allow the SEC to focus valuable resources on the areas where problematic conduct is most likely to exist.  H.3911 is designed to strengthen regulatory efforts rather than provide a basis for reduced accountability. So I do urge the SEC to use the discretion afforded under H.3911 in order to focus on areas that present the greatest risk of misconduct.  It is vital that our ratings organizations are accountable, and I believe this bill is an important step to ensure that the inflated ratings that led up to the financial crisis are not repeated.

631,topic-id,449,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I also rise today to support H.2148, and I want to start by thanking the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.David Scott) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.Pittenger) for their work on this bipartisan legislation, a bill that deals with capital rules for commercial real estate loans, including acquisition, development, or construction loans.  It is critical that Federal bank regulators maintain the strong capital rules that have been implemented after the enactment of Dodd-These rules have made the U.financial system much safer, while protecting consumers, investors, and taxpayers in promoting stable economic growth.  Unlike some proposals that have been introduced that would gut the regulatory framework of Dodd-Frank, I am pleased that this bill reasonably seeks to resolve a valid concern raised by community banks that certain capital rules relating to high volatility commercial real estate, or HVCRE, loans are far too complex. This is an issue that financial regulators like the FDIC have also acknowledged must be addressed and must be fixed.  The problem, in fact, was highlighted in their Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, which was published earlier this year.  In September, financial regulators released a proposal to revise the capital rules to make the calculations more straightforward. This is a good step in resolving this issue.  Although I am supportive of H.2148, there are some concerns that I have heard and that I can appreciate, including that it could provide for more rigid definitions relating to capital rules.  The highly technical standards are important, though, to demonstrate congressional intent. But Congress may not need to act, if bank regulators correct the problem on their own.  In addition, according to the FDIC Inspector General, commercial real estate loans generally account for more than one-third of community bank lending. The GAO found that failure of many small banks in the last crisis were ``driven by credit losses on CRE[[Page H8549]]loans, particularly loans secured by real estate to finance land development and construction.'' We have to be cautious, and we should be sensitive to these risks.  Notwithstanding all of those legitimate concerns that we should keep in mind, I support this legislation and hope that it will send a clear signal to the regulators that they should consider and address any comments on their proposed rule without delay that is fully sensitive to the risks that I have discussed.

Our thoughts are with them and all those affected by what happened in  At the same time, we remember that these heartbreaking events came just 35 days after the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history, when 58 were killed and hundreds were wounded in Las Vegas last month.

While no one policy will prevent every tragedy, we need to come together on commonsense proposals that would save lives.  I appreciate the words of my colleagues about mental illness and funding for mental illness. I think that is very important. I come from Minnesota, where Paul Wellstone was one of the leaders in making sure that mental illnesses got covered by insurance, and I think we need to do that and more.  Another area where we have found some consensus in this Chamber is improving background checks. My colleagues Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey have made that clear, and I supported their background check legislation in 2013. But the fact remains that we didn't pass that bill in the We fell short, and it was a disheartening day.  I remember having the parents of some of the Sandy Hook victims in my office that morning. Yet what happened that day--you have to contrast it with where the American people are. Consistently, whether it is with public opinion polls or whether it is when you talk to people you meet when you are at home, we have seen that Americans from across the political spectrum support commonsense proposals to require background checks, such as requiring background checks at gun shows. And they support that by wide margins.  By the way, I look at this from a State that has a lot of households that have guns. We are a proud hunting And with every proposal I look at, I always think of my Uncle Dick and how he used to love hunting and sitting in his deer stand. I think: Does this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand? And I don't think that the Manchin-Toomey bill would in any way. When I look at these things, I have to evaluate them that way because I know how many proud and law-abiding gun owners we have in our But I don't see that closing this gun show loophole by doing something more about background checks would hurt that hunting tradition in any way.  When I talk to law enforcement around Minnesota, they stress the importance of having effective background checks to stop felons, domestic abusers, and people who are prohibited from having easy access to guns from having that access. If you remember, part of the Manchin-Toomey proposal was to do more on sharing data and getting the data out there. These efforts should not and do not have to infringe on Americans' rights to own guns.  Another sensible measure that came out of the tragedy in Las Vegas, which[[Page S7047]]we should take action on, is Senator Feinstein's legislation to close a loophole that allows bump stock devices to convert semiautomatic firearms into weapons that work like fully automatic guns. Law enforcement recovered 12 of these devices from the hotel room of the shooter in Las Vegas last month.  I hope we can find some common ground. Some of our colleagues across the aisle have voiced some interest in this, and I hope we can do something when we know that would have been helpful in that shooting.  Another area where we can find common ground is in taking action to protect those who are at risk of gun violence from domestic abusers. We were reminded of how important this is again this week, as reports have revealed that the gunman in the Texas shooting had a history of domestic violence, having been court-martialed for assaulting his wife and child in 2012. He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and received a bad-conduct discharge from the Air There are also reports of ex-girlfriends and others who reported similar conduct.  I am sure the facts will be unveiled, but what I do know, regardless of what the facts show right now, is that this connection between domestic violence, stalking--those kinds of activities--and some kind of homicidal behavior is something that has been well established. According to recent research, more than half of mass shootings between 2009 and 2016--that is 54 percent--involved some kind of domestic or family violence.  Before I came to the Senate, I spent 8 years as the top prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county, so I have seen that connection. And I have seen the connection between a history of domestic violence or stalking that later leads to a more serious crime. That is why it is so important that we have protection orders, and that is why it is so important--as I look at the record of the shooter--that these cases be taken seriously, so you actually get that misdemeanor conviction on the record or you actually get a felony conviction or you do something about the stalking behavior when it is reported to law enforcement.  When I was the county attorney in Hennepin County, we would have cases we would sometimes pursue when a victim had reported it and the police had gathered evidence--even if the victim later backed away and was afraid to testify--because we knew it had happened, we had the original testimony, and we had the evidence at the scene. We trained the police on getting the evidence at the scene so that we were able to actually make those cases. And you think about, in that instant, making those cases; no matter how hard it can be sometimes when you have a scared victim, it is really important.  When I was in the county attorney's office, I made prosecuting felons in possession of firearms one of my top priorities. They weren't supposed to have guns, and when they did have guns, we had to take it seriously. I will tell you, some of the most disturbing cases that we saw involved people with a documented history of harassment--of stalking, of domestic violence--because you would see it building and building, and sometimes it would be against one victim, but often we would find out that there were others and that it was a pattern of behavior, and one horrible case would erupt into homicidal violence.  There was one case I had heard of where a woman was shot to death by her boyfriend. He killed her and then killed himself while both of his kids were still in the house. It was ultimately his 12-year-old daughter who went to the neighbors for help. The worst part of the story is that it could have been prevented. In the 2 years leading up to the murder-suicide, the police had been called to the boyfriend's residence at least five times to resolve domestic disputes. Yet somehow the man, with a history of violence like this, was able to have a gun in his hand on the day he killed his girlfriend.  I wish I could say that it was a rare tragedy, but the truth is, studies have shown that more than three women per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners, and over half--this is an average--of the women murdered by intimate partners in the country are killed with guns. Many times these tragedies begin with incidents of stalking.  Research has shown that one in six women has experienced stalking sometime during her lifetime, and 76 percent of women murdered by intimate partners were first stalked by their partner. It is for this reason that a number of years ago I introduced a bill called the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act to close some of these loopholes in our existing laws. My bill would make sure that those who are convicted of misdemeanor crimes of stalking are not able to buy guns. It would also expand the definition of a domestic abuser to include dating partners. The second part--when we had a hearing on this bill on these issues in the Judiciary Committee, even the Republican witnesses who were called supported the dating partner idea because so many States have started to do that.  I introduced the legislation this time. It has been bipartisan in the past, but the Republican Senator on the bill is no longer in the Senate, although it is bipartisan in the But this time I introduced it with Senator Hirono and Senator Feinstein, the only other two women on the Judiciary Committee of 20 members. Congresswoman Debbie Dingell from Michigan is leading the same bill in the House, and her bill, as I noted, is bipartisan.  In 2014, we had a hearing on my bill. As I said, even the Republican witnesses agreed that a major portion of the bill was a good idea. At that hearing, we heard from Sheriff Christopher Schmaling of Racine County in He testified about the connection between stalking and guns being used in violence against women. In his testimony, he told the story of one woman from Wisconsin who, he said, had changed his career. This woman had endured 3 years of a violently abusive marriage before divorcing her husband. She then took out multiple restraining orders against him over several years. That horrible day in 2004, he threatened her with a handgun, beat her with a baseball bat, bound and gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. Through what he described as some good breaks and some great luck, the Sheriff and his partner rescued Teri before she died. As a result of the ordeal, she had a miscarriage and had to have her toes surgically removed. In his testimony, the Sheriff talked about the importance of my bill's provision to extend the protections in current law to include dating partners so that abusers would not be able to buy a gun if they are convicted of beating up their girlfriend or boyfriend, regardless of whether they lived together or had a child.  As the sheriff said, ``Dangerous boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous husbands; they hit just as hard, and they fire their guns with the same deadly force.''  This is a simple point that you would think we could all agree on. Sadly, we still have not been able to pass this bill.  Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the sheriff's written testimony be printed in the  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:written testimony of sheriff christopher schmaling--judiciary committee hearing: ``vawa next steps: protecting women from gun violence''--july                                 30, 2014       Chairman Whitehouse, Senator Grassley, Senator Leahy,      members of the Committee, thank you for hosting this hearing      today, and thank you for the opportunity to testify.       My name is Christopher I am the sheriff of      Racine County, Wisconsin and have been a law enforcement      officer for 19 years. I am a conservative Republican, and I'm      here today to ask you to pass two laws that will protect our      sisters, our mothers, and our daughters by keeping guns out      of the hands of domestic abusers. The first bill is the      Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of      2013, which will block abusive boyfriends and convicted      stalkers from possessing guns. The second is a bill that      would require criminal background checks for gun sales by      unlicensed sellers.       More than half of the women murdered each year are killed      by intimate partners or family members. That's 48 women      killed by husbands and boyfriends each and every month. We      know that people with a history of committing domestic      violence are more likely to become killers--and we know the      role that firearms play: When a gun is present in a domestic      violence incident, the chances that a woman will be killed      increase by 500 percent.[[Page S7048]]       These numbers are tragic. As the top law enforcement      officer in Racine County and over my two decades on the      force, I've seen far too many of these tragic incidents      firsthand.       I want to tell you about one such domestic violence      incident, a tragedy that changed my career. In 2004, Teri      Jendusa-Nicolai was violently abused and left for dead by her      ex-husband. Teri had endured three years of a violently      abusive marriage before divorcing him, and had then taken out      multiple restraining orders against him over several years.       That horrible day in 2004, he threatened her with a .38      caliber handgun, beat her with a baseball bat, bound and      gagged her, and left her in a storage unit to die. My partner      and I were the lead investigators on the case, and through      some good breaks and some great luck, we rescued Teri before      she died. As a result of the ordeal, Teri had a miscarriage      and had to have her toes surgically removed.       Teri is one of the most wonderful people I've ever known,      and has been a tremendous advocate for victims of abuse in      the decade since she was nearly killed at gunpoint. We've      become very close since then, and my eyes have been opened to      the reality of domestic violence and gun violence. I've also      become close with Elvin Daniel, who is sitting here beside me      today, and have been moved by his sister Zina's story.       I'm proud to say we are the first county in the State of      Wisconsin to have a full-time domestic violence specialist.      We work closely with victims to figure out how best to      protect them. We've made this very intimate and very deadly      area a top priority for our department. So much of the crime      we face in Racine County is intimate partner abuse, and any      cop will tell you that domestic violence calls are the most      dangerous calls. The last thing a victim needs, and the last      thing my officers need, is for these dangerous abusers to be      armed with illegal guns.       We respond to domestic violence incidents differently than      other calls, because these are ``heightened risk'' calls--we      send more officers, we go ahead and assume that guns will be      involved, because they are so often involved. Abusers      routinely threaten to shoot my deputies and I upon arrival at      domestic violence calls. In fact, according to FBI data, over      150 law enforcement officers have been killed in action while      responding to domestic disturbances.       I'm proud to have worked on a great domestic violence bill      in Wisconsin in 2014 known as ``The Safe Act,'' a bill that      ensures guns are kept out of the hands of domestic abusers.      This bill was passed by a bipartisan majority and signed by      our Republican governor Scott This year alone,      similar bills were passed with bipartisan support in New      Hampshire, Minnesota, Vermont, and And in      Louisiana, where another Republican governor--Bobby Jindal--     signed the bill into law.       The first bill I'm asking you to pass today is the      Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act of      2013, 1290, introduced by Senator This bill      would close a loophole that allows abusive dating partners to      buy and have guns--simply because they are not married to      their victims. And it would also block people with stalking      convictions from having guns.       Why is this bill so important? I can tell you firsthand      that domestic violence is horrific, whether or not the abuser      and victim are married. When we send our police into danger      to respond to domestic violence calls, we send the same folks      regardless of the couple's marital status. Dangerous      boyfriends can be just as scary as dangerous husbands; they      hit just as hard and they fire their guns with the same      deadly force. In fact, according to FBI data, more women are      killed in America by their abusive boyfriends than by their      abusive husbands.       This past March, just a couple hours from Racine County,      Cheryl Gilberg was killed by her ex-boyfriend in a domestic      dispute. The killer apparently shot Cheryl with her own gun,      after a struggle. According to news reports, she had been      seeking a restraining order at the time of the killing. But      in cases like Cheryl's, a restraining order isn't good      enough. If you've never been married to your abuser, federal      law likely will not stop him from buying a gun.       If Congress passes this bill, federal law will be catching      up with the states. Among the 22 states that prohibit gun      possession by domestic abusers subject to restraining orders,      19 of those states already include abusive dating partners.      And 42 of our states have recognized that dating partner      abuse is a form of domestic abuse by allowing victims to take      out domestic violence restraining orders against their      boyfriends.       The second bill I'm asking you to pass today would require      criminal background checks for gun buyers who shop with      unlicensed sellers. Current federal law prohibits many      abusers from buying guns, but only requires them to pass a      background check if they buy a gun from a licensed dealer.      This is a gaping hole in the law: It means a convicted wife-     beater can slip through the cracks and get a gun simply by      finding a seller who does not have his own gun store.       This is exactly what happened in Dane County: Tyrone Adair      was a domestic abuser who had been convicted of battery      twice, and was legally prohibited from owning a gun because      of a restraining order. So instead of going to a gun store--     where he would have had to pass a background check--he found      an ad for a 9mm Glock in a local paper, and met the seller at      a hardware store. There was no background check, though the      seller did ask, and I quote, ``You're not going to go out and      kill someone, are you?'' Tyrone Adair used that gun on a      horrific murder spree, killing his two daughters--ages 1 and      2--and killing their two mothers.       Background checks work. Sixteen states and DC already      require background checks for all handgun sales, and about 40      percent fewer women are shot to death by their husbands and      boyfriends in those states. And background checks save law      enforcement lives as well: about 40 percent fewer cops are      killed with handguns in those states, as well.       These are the cops that risk their lives when they respond      to domestic violence calls, rushing into the middle of very      dangerous and very intimate situations. We see the terror      that abusers can create when they are armed. We see the      impact on their wives and girlfriends, and on their children.      We're major proponents of community policing in Racine      County, and if I have my officers on the street, working      closely with our residents, I want to know that our laws are      doing everything they can to keep guns out of abusive hands.       So I'm here to speak for victims of abuse and to speak for      my cops. I've made it a priority to talk to victims. I've      seen the escalation over the years, from yelling, to battery,      to homicide. When an abuser has a gun, the victims say to me,      ``Sheriff, is not a question of if he'll use the gun to abuse      me; it's a question of when.'' And I recognize the value of      preventing even one gun from winding up in the hands of an      abuser: one gun may translate into one more lives saved.       So today, I'm asking you to pass 1290, which will apply      the same rules to all abusers, regardless of whether they are      married to their victims or not--and will prohibit convicted      stalkers from having guns.       And I'm asking you to require criminal background checks      for gun sales by unlicensed sellers, and ensure that abusers      don't get a free pass when they buy guns from them--often      strangers they meet online, at gun shows, or through      classified ads. The bipartisan bill introduced last year by      Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey would do just that, and      it has already received the support of 55 senators.       I'm asking you today to stand up against abuse by fixing      our out-of-date laws and passing this common-sense      legislation. Thank you for your time and I look forward to      answering your questions.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7038-4.txt,1826,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,7.0,November
997,topic-id,1401,"I also note that a justice from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania also testified on that day as the Republicans' witness. Even though he did not agree with everything in the bill, he also said: I absolutely agree that we should have boyfriends, dating partners as a part. We have it in Pennsylvania, OK? It is important. As the sheriff said, they can shoot, and they can beat up people just like anybody else.  He was, actually, the Republicans' witness at the hearing. That is why I am happy that in the House of Representatives it is a bipartisan bill, but I would like to see it as a bipartisan bill here in the Maybe they will reconsider this now. Just as the NRA has said that it was looking at the bump stock issue, maybe they would be willing to look at this issue because they wrote kind of a fast memo on this--it is only a page long--back when we had the hearing and when we were gaining support for the bill. Remember that this is very narrow legislation that is focused on making sure that dating partners are covered and also people who are not charged but convicted of stalking. They wrote that the legislation ``manipulates emotionally compelling issues such as `domestic violence' and `stalking' simply to cast as wide a net as possible. . . .''  I want to make this very clear--and I have never addressed this on the floor before--that this was really focused narrowly so that we could gain Republican support. I didn't really think the NRA would support it, but I thought that maybe they would be neutral, and, sure enough, their witnesses at the hearing supported it. We have had Republican Senators support it in the past, and we have also had Republican House Members support it. In going after the bill by saying that it manipulates emotionally compelling issues, well, I would agree in that I am sure that a lot of people shed tears when watching what happened in Texas, and I am sure that they have shed a lot of tears when they have heard the stories from people in their own communities of the victims, of the women who had died at the hands of domestic abusers after years of abuse. So if they want to call that emotionally compelling and manipulative, that is up to them, but I call it the truth.  The other thing they said about this bill--and this was even more interesting--is the part about the stalking,[[Page S7049]]which is a major part of the legislation as well. That part of the bill, as I mentioned, just takes what we know as a signal for trouble in the future and violence in the future, and you would actually have to be convicted of stalking to have the gun protections apply.  The example they used--as I said, it did not make any sense to include this, and it is the only example they used--was of two men of equal size, strength, and domestic status, joined by a civil union or merely engaged or formally engaged in an intimate social relationship, being subject to this prohibition for conviction of simple assault arising from a single shoving match.  Actually, this part applies to the domestic partners. I think they are really taking this in a way that has surprised me since whom we are talking about are boyfriends and girlfriends and domestic violence, but they have changed it into a shoving match in a bar with people who might have some kind of social relationship. I just do not think this is a valid reason for my Republican colleagues to oppose this bill, and I am going to keep bringing this up because it does not make sense to me.  They end by saying that, whatever the case may have been 30 years ago, domestic violence is now taken seriously by the legal and criminal justice systems.  That was the reason they gave for opposing the bill. Really? Look at what we just found that happened in the last week when this was not just a minor example of domestic assault but was a felony. The person was court-martialed, and the person was, basically, detained for a year. Yet, somehow, this was not taken seriously enough through our entire system to show up on a record check. How about all of the reports that had been made by previous girlfriends and other people about his behavior, and nothing had seemed to come up then?  As I mentioned, of the many cases that we had had in our office, even when the victim had gotten scared and decided that she had not wanted to pursue anything, we had felt that we had an obligation to her and to the other women we knew would come after her to pursue those cases, and, many times, we had done that if the police had been trained and they had been able to get the evidence at the scene. Sometimes there had been child witnesses and others, and we had been able to pursue those cases and win them, and we did.  So to say that you don't want to support my bill because you think this system is so great, is working so well, and is being taken seriously by the legal and criminal justice systems after you saw what just happened in Texas, I do not think is true. This memo was written 2 years ago. So I hope they will look at this again and consider supporting my bill.  I conclude my remarks by sharing another story about yet another tragic shooting from my In this one I truly got to know the widow. She is the widow of a police officer in Lake City, This was a case in which the officer, who was a wonderful man in a small town police department, responded to a domestic violence call from a 17-year-old girl who was being abused by her ex-boyfriend. He went to the scene in the middle of the winter. He had a bulletproof vest on and everything because the domestic violence cases can be much more dangerous than people think, and officers know this. He was shot in the head, and he was killed. The 17-year-old girl lived. This officer literally gave his life to save another.  There was a big funeral, and there were law enforcement people there from all over our I will never forget that funeral. I was sitting there in the aisle, and I had learned that the last time that officer had been in that church was to see his own kids--three young children, two boys and a girl--in a Nativity play. He had been sitting right in the front row of that same church, so proud of them at Shortly after that, he was shot. At his funeral, there were those three children walking down the church aisle--the two young boys and the little girl in a blue dress that was covered with stars. I always think about that little girl in that blue dress that was covered in stars. This was domestic violence gone bad. He was a police officer who had shown up at the scene.  When you look at these cases--we can look at the numbers; we can look at the stories; we can look at what has gone on on TV--you see this connection between domestic violence and stalking and then, later, either mass shootings or violence against one person, which happens much more often. It is not a coincidence. It is something that has been well documented.  As we extend our sympathies and prayers to all of those who were affected by that tragedy in Texas and, of course, not too long ago in Las Vegas and in so many other communities and to all of those, of course, who were also victims of that act of terror in New York--we think of all of them--we also think: What can we do to make this better? In this case, when it comes to domestic violence and this specific issue that I know a lot about from my past job, we can do something. So let's pass this bill.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1097,topic-id,1604,"Mr.President, I rise today to call for bipartisan action on healthcare.  I think it was interesting to learn that the citizens of Virginia who voted yesterday listed as their top issue healthcare. There was obviously an issue there where there had been no Medicaid expansion, and they were unhappy with the way it had been handled by the legislature there as well as Republicans who were in charge of the legislature, and they appeared to be pushing for a change.  We have an opportunity here to make a bipartisan change. I think it is exactly the kind of message that we got yesterday. In my State, we have a Republican legislature and a Democratic They came together to do something about some of the rates, particularly in our rural areas. They focused on reinsurance, cost sharing--some of the things in the bipartisan agreement reached between Senator Alexander and Senator We have 12 Democrats and 12 Republicans cosponsoring that bill. Support includes the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Society, the March of Dimes, and the Arthritis Foundation--and those are just the A's.  The American people want us to work together to make fixes to the Affordable Care The day it passed, I said that it was a beginning and not an end. Unfortunately, we have been stymied in trying to make those kind of changes, and this is one bipartisan big opportunity to do it. I think it is a sensible bipartisan approach.  As we all know, both Senator Alexander and Senator Murray held a series of hearings and discussions on commonsense solutions to bring down insurance costs with Senators on both sides of the aisle. There were Governors and insurance experts, and we worked hard to make sure there was some agreement on this bill. I fought for provisions that would help States apply for and receive waivers to give them some flexibility to construct their healthcare system and to bring down the costs without losing Federal funding. That is something my State did. As I mentioned, my State, with a Republican-led legislature and a Democratic Governor, came together to apply for a waiver and a reinsurance provision.  The bill would also expedite the review of waiver applications for proposals that have already been approved for other States that are experiencing certain circumstances--emergency circumstances--where they need to make changes.  The legislation also shortens the overall time period that States would have to wait for the Federal Government to decide whether to approve their waivers.  All of these are good fundamental concepts--this idea that States should have some flexibility, that they should be able to apply for waivers, and that they should be able to get their answers as soon as possible from the Federal That is what this bill is about. Not only does the bill improve the process for waivers and flexibility for the States, like we have seen in Minnesota, where already the projected[[Page S7092]]numbers brought the rates down something like 20 percent, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the Murray-Alexander bill would actually cut the deficit by $3.8 billion over the next 10 years. That is hard to argue with.  It is clear that this legislation could get support from both sides of the aisle to make healthcare better for We have a majority of Senators supporting this bill. So we need to get it done because the longer we wait, the more the markets don't know what is going on, the more confusion that is created, and the more the administration is doing things that sabotages the Affordable Care  We need this stability in the system. Passing the bill would be an important step forward, but we still must do more to bring down the costs for middle-class families. A big part of that is addressing the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. I have heard from people across Minnesota who are struggling to afford the medicine they need. This is about the woman in Duluth who told me that she chose not to fill her last prescription because that one drug would cost a whole 25 percent of her income. It is about a woman in Paul who, even with Medicare, couldn't afford $663 a month for the medicine she needs. It is about someone from Crystal, MN, who told me: I am practically going without food to pay for the prescription. It is heartbreaking that this is happening in  Reducing the cost of prescription drugs has bipartisan support in Congress, and the President has said he wants to get something done. He has said: The drug companies are ``getting away with murder.'' Those are his words. That is what he said.  So what can we do? Republicans and Democrats could come together and act right now. I have a bill that has 33 cosponsors that lifts the ban that makes it illegal for Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs for 41 million seniors. I think 41 million seniors are pretty good at getting bargains and deals, and they deserve to have someone negotiating on their behalf; that is, the government negotiating for Except, why don't we negotiate, like we do for the VA, and like other countries do? We don't negotiate because there is a provision in law that says that the government is not allowed to negotiate on behalf of 41 million seniors with the drug companies. They are just set. Guess what that means. That is a big part of the reason why our drug prices are double the cost of those in Canada--because we are just taking it and we are not negotiating.  Another idea, bringing up Canada, is that Senator McCain and I have a bill that would allow less expensive drugs to be sold in the United To me, that is a way of putting pressure on our own drug companies to put out better prices if they know there is going to be competition.  Senator Grassley of Iowa and I have a bill to stop something called pay-for-delay. That is when big pharmaceutical companies actually pay off generic companies to keep less expensive products off the market. This bill would save taxpayers $2.9 billion. Do you know why? Because right now there is no competition or very little competition, and they are actually paying their competitors to stay off the market. The competitors have decided: Well, I get more money to be paid to stay off the market than if I actually competed.  Think about what a rip-off that is for the American people. We are allowing this to go on while the consumers are paying the price. How much? We know the government alone is going to save $2.9 billion if we stop this practice. Consumers would save most likely around that same amount because they are paying all the copays. Both the government is ripped off and the consumers are ripped off, and the only ones making money off of it are the drug companies.  Another idea is, Senator Lee and I have a bill that would allow temporary importation of safe drugs that have been on the market in another country for at least 10 years when there isn't healthy competition in our own country. Again, if your drug companies that are messing around, charging high prices and not allowing competition in--if you know there might be foreign competition coming in, that is an incentive because you want to then make sure that doesn't happen because you know that if you keep your prices high and you do things to disallow competition, you are going to have some major competition. I don't know how else we bring the prices down without allowing more competition.  I also have a bipartisan bill with Senators Grassley, Lee, Feinstein, and Leahy, which is called the CREATES Act, to put a stop to other pharmaceutical company tactics, such as refusing to provide samples to generic companies that are supposed to be allowed to compete with them. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would save approximately $3.6 billion.  As we hear about tax reform and hear about the debt we might be seeing expand if something like this goes forward, then we ask yourselves: What is not in those bills? Why aren't we saving some money for the American people and reducing the debt by allowing for this competition, by allowing for the samples, by allowing for more generics, by stopping this practice of companies paying each other to keep their competitors off the market?  What this healthcare debate has been about for the last year, where repeatedly there have been attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act--it has been about that. The American people made it really clear, they want to make it about something else. They want to make it about improvements to the system we have now to make it easier for them. One way is the Alexander-Murray bill, which I strongly support. I am one of the cosponsors. It is smart. It works with the States, both Democratic and Republican States--blue States, red We want to see that kind of flexibility. The other way is to take a stand, be willing to take on the pharmaceutical industry, and take on some of the cost issues when it comes to prescription drugs.  Let's come together in the Senate, as an initial move, and pass the Murray-Alexander bill. We must do that, and we must do it by the end of the year. Then we can go on from there to actually do something about the cost of prescription drugs.  I yield the floor.

Her leadership, specifically, for the Virgin Islands, is truly commendable, and just know that we are doing everything we can do under her leadership to help her recover and rebuild.

Our thoughts and prayers are with them tonight.  Mr.Speaker, I rise to discuss the urgent need to preserve temporary protective status for immigrants fleeing famine, war, and violent conditions around the world, especially those countries from within the African diaspora who account for 10 percent of all TPS beneficiaries.  Today, 440,000 individuals from 10 countries reside in the United States under temporary protective status because, as a nation, we have kept our commitment to being a beacon of hope and security for those in need.  The TPS program grants immigrants the right to lawfully remain in the United States for 6 to 18 months. This longstanding practice has been honored for decades through Democratic and Republican administrations because, regardless of political affiliations as Americans, we have always stood for protecting the value of human life.  Sadly, the Trump administration fails to grasp the lifesaving impact of this program.                              {time}  1945  Just last month, the administration announced that it would terminate the TPS designation for Sudan, despite the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the region.  In the coming days and weeks, Mr.Speaker, the Trump administration, unfortunately, will decide the fate of TPS holders from vulnerable countries including Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Let me be clear: failure to renew TPS status would mean[[Page H8515]]deportation for over 300,000 individuals who are working and living in the United  We also know that this issue disproportionately impacts immigrants from countries within the African diaspora. Take Haiti for example. After a devastating earthquake and horrific hurricane, there is an active cholera outbreak and protracted food security crisis. Letting TPS expire for this country would send 50,000 people back to uncertain fates. An influx of people of this size would further destabilize a fragile recovery. That is why I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to the Department of Homeland Security calling for a full 18-month extension of Haiti's TPS designation.  In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of over 250,000 people would strain government services and lead to job displacement in countries besieged by violence, narcotics trafficking, and weak institutions.  Unfortunately, this week, Secretary Tillerson falsely claimed that conditions on the ground no longer warrant TPS designation for these countries. How he came up with that, I have no idea. This is really a shame and a disgrace. That is why members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here tonight fighting for temporary protected status because we cannot turn our backs on our brothers and sisters in their time of need. TPS holders have families, they own businesses, and they contribute to this country in countless ways.  At a time when devastating hurricanes and flooding ravages our neighbors in the Caribbean, the last thing that our government should be doing is turning its back on TPS holders. It is not only TPS holders that we are fighting for. We are also now recognizing, understanding, knowing, and making public--as everyone knows--that millions of undocumented youth are living in fear of deportation because this President and Republicans in Congress can't muster the courage to do what is right.  Our Nation has been and should continue to be a nation of immigrants. From TPS to DACA, deporting innocent young people who came to the United States to escape devastation and violence, or as a child, is not only wrong, it is really cruel, and it is heartless. So that is why we will continue to fight to protect undocumented youth as we work towards comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.  Now we are going to say we are going to continue to fight to make sure temporary protective status is granted for the 300,000 immigrants.

729,topic-id,778,"Mr.Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Espaillat for yielding and for his tremendous leadership and advocacy to ensure that our communities have access to affordable housing, regardless of their income, regardless of their background. I want to thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus and him for leading this Special Order tonight because it is so important that the public really understand the issues that we are dealing with here in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the American people.  Tonight, of course, we are calling on the Trump administration and our colleagues across the aisle for greater investments in affordable housing, including in public housing.  Affordable housing should be a basic right. No one should have to choose between placing food on the table or paying their rent, especially not in the wealthiest country on Sadly, right now, our country is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. Half of all families in this country are forced to spend more than 30 percent of their hard-earned income on housing.  Over 38 million families struggle to pay rent and put food on the table every day because they pay more than one-third of their income on housing. Right now there are only 12 counties in the entire country where a minimum-wage worker is able to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment.  Simply put, the housing crisis in America has reached epidemic proportions. It is really a state of emergency. Nowhere is this epidemic more evident than, for example, in my own district. The average renter in Oakland, California, for example, would be forced to spend a staggering 70 percent of their income on housing if they were to move today--70 percent--and many are being forced out.  In Oakland, the number of homeless individuals increased by 25 percent this year to more than 2,700 people. In all of my county, Alameda County, the homelessness population has increased by nearly 40 percent in the last 2 years to more than 5,600 people.  Now, these people have settled into encampments with all of their furniture and belongings across the streets of cities in my district. It is unconscionable and devastating that this un-American reality persists across the country.  Yet, instead of working to address this crisis, Republicans have slashed funding, mind you, for housing assistance programs to their lowest level in 40 years. In the Republican fiscal year 2018 budget, there are over $200 billion in cuts from programs that everyday families depend on, like SNAP, agricultural subsidies, and housing assistance.  What is worse, the Trump budget slashes the budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development by nearly 15 percent. The Secretary of HUD, I guess, supports this, which is mind-boggling because he is charged with developing housing strategies so that everyone can have decent, affordable housing. To cut it by 15 percent makes no sense.  This endangers the livelihoods of millions of low-income seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, veterans, low-wage workers, families living with HIV and AIDS, which they all depend on affordable housing programs.  Our Progressive Caucus colleagues and I are here tonight to say that, really, enough is enough. We demand affordable housing for every person in our Nation, regardless of who they are and where they live, and we are not giving up.  Earlier this year, I introduced a renters' bill of rights. It is 74, which affirms that all renters have the right to safe, decent, and affordable housing. It calls for greater enforcement of antidiscrimination laws that protect communities of color from burdensome regulations. It calls on Congress to increase funding to protect every American's right to livable and affordable housing.  So as a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I am committed to advancing the American Dream for all, and that is affordable housing. People deserve to have a decent and safe place to live to raise their families.  So to everyone across the country who worry about paying rent or whether they can finally, at the end of the day, buy a home, I say: Keep raising your voices and keep bringing what we call street heat to defend your communities, because you have got allies in the Congressional Progressive You have got them in this House of Representatives, especially We are not going to give up fighting for you.  I want to thank Congressman Espaillat for holding this Special Order tonight because I think the public, given this crisis--and it is a crisis, it is an epidemic, it is an emergency--people need to know we are here fighting for them, and we are going to continue fighting until everyone in America has a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.

843,topic-id,922,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to talk about nutrition and, more specifically, malnutrition. My family and I have traveled across the country doing mission work, from the poorest country in this Western Hemisphere, Haiti; to the plains of Kenya; across Mexico; and throughout Central  On those trips, I went there as a physician thinking that I could help people, but what I quickly discovered was that, despite how many antibiotics or bottles of IV fluids that I had, without proper nutrition, without proper water and sewage treatment, I was simply running into a headwind in a war that I could never win.  Unfortunately, across the globe, there are almost 1 billion people who suffer from malnutrition, and it is a problem that doesn't exist just across the world. It also exists in my own district, in my own communities. We think that actually about 12 percent of the United States households have food insecurity issues, and, in households with children, the number goes up to 16 percent of food insecurity issues.  It would be my opinion, without this hierarchy of needs being met, the hierarchy of the needs of proper water, proper sewage, and proper nutrition, that you will never have a healthy community. Without a healthy community, you will never see economic growth.  This battle against malnutrition is long running. In recent years, many in the hunger community have recognized the value of fighting malnutrition in targeted ways. One way was popularized by Roger Thurow in his book, ``The First 1,000 Days: A Crucial Time for Mothers and Children--And the World.''  Research shows that good nutrition actually begins before conception. Good nutrition starts before conception, continues throughout the woman's pregnancy, and, especially, those first 2 years after a child's birth are very important.  As a practicing obstetrician for 25 years, I see over and over the impact of proper nutrition. Proper nutrition in those first 1,000 days starts with a well-balanced diet and adequate calories. Additionally, we always try to start our prenatal vitamins at least 3 months before conception.  You might ask: Why is that important? What we have found is that if there is adequate folic acid in a woman's body, along with adequate iron, it decreases birth defects, and it decreases premature birth and low birth weights. Specifically, folic acid decreases neural tube defects. So those two vitamins are particularly important that we continue in these diets preconceptually, during the pregnancy, then after for at least the first 2 years.  A child that receives the proper 1,000 days of nutrition has a lower chance of obesity, heart disease, and chronic illnesses. The child is 10 times more likely to overcome serious childhood illnesses and is more likely to fulfill their full God-given potential.  What we know and understand is that the most vulnerable will succumb to viruses, whether it is the elderly or the infants, if they don't have proper nutrition. An investment during this critical time period, these first 1,000 days, not only impacts the development of the child, but results in a higher likelihood of healthiness in generations to[[Page H8603]]follow, allowing the benefits of adequate nutrition to compound over time.  As we in Congress begin to consider the reauthorization of the new farm bill, we have been reviewing many programs targeting hunger and malnourishment. These programs allow our State governments and nonprofits to promote nutrition and assist in providing food for women and children, both here at home and around the globe. I am especially proud of the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program, but what we, of course, call in Kansas the Dole-McGovern International Food for Education program.  This program has provided over 44 million people in low-income, food-deficient countries across the world with a meal during the school time to help those kids do better in school. This is made possible by donations from the U.agricultural products and the kindness of  Food for Peace is another lifesaving food assistance program that, for more than 60 years, has helped tens of millions of people get enough to eat through emergency development and nutritional support programs.  Not only do these programs provide the food necessary to help these countries provide good nutrition for women and children, they benefit U.national security and foster goodwill.  Lending a helping hand to those around the globe is a classic American value, but assisting those here at home is an absolute priority. This is being achieved through the special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, the WIC program as most of us have called it. I have got such great, firsthand experience in seeing how important this WIC program is to pregnant women and breastfeeding women. It is not only the vitamins that we give them, but it is the extra education that we give them to help raise their children in a healthy environment.  So we need to provide Federal grants to these States through the WIC program that are used to provide food supplements and nutritional education to low-income mothers and babies. Nutrition is so critical for these first 1,000 days, it goes far beyond anything that I can say or any statistics I can quote. As we continue to strive for improved national global health, the importance of these first 1,000 days should not be underemphasized.  The United States has an opportunity to make a global statement in advancing this initiative. No matter where you are in the world, you can be assured that community health, economic growth, and quality of life begins with good nutrition.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8602-2.txt,99999999999999,TAXES WILL GO UP EVERY APRIL 15,2017.0,8.0,November

You see, in the process of this investigation, we have learned a fact pattern surrounding the Clinton campaign and potentially the Obama administration's involvement in a targeted campaign using information from foreign intelligence officials against then-candidate Donald  Now, as we know from the recent New York Times report, the Presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee paid for research that was included in the now infamous Russian dossier that was made public in January of this year by Buzzfeed and reported on by  Now we know that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid an ex-British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to compile this dossier with the research provided from Russian intelligence officials.  Now, much of this dossier contains claims that have either not been verified or have been directly refuted. So, Mr.Speaker, it is suspicious enough that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid intelligence officials in Russia for this type of material and false information on President  But we were also beginning to see evidence that raises questions about the very way that the Obama Justice Department may have inappropriately involved themselves into this project, both before and after the 2016 Presidential campaign.  Mr.Speaker, now, if you would, consider the timeline that we are working with here. In April of 2016, the Clinton campaign used the law firm of Perkins Coie to retain Fusion GPS, the firm behind the Russian dossier.  Now, that very same month, in April of 2016, President Obama's campaign began paying more than $900,000 to what law firm?  Perkins Coie, the very same firm used by the Clinton campaign in the creation of the dossier.[[Page H8586]]  Now, we also know that in the weeks prior to the 2016 election, President Obama's FBI tried to reach an agreement with Christopher Steele to pay for the Russian dossier, and the FBI actually ended up reimbursing some of the dossier expenses.  Now, to be clear, the FBI attempted to pay, and then reimbursed, the costs of the Russian dossier that was being orchestrated by Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign. Now, the FBI has refused to answer questions and resisted any transparency on this issue.  So going a step further, we now know that on January 6, President Obama's intelligence officials, led by then-Director of the FBI, James Comey, briefed President-elect Trump on the contents of the dossier.  Now, following that January 6 briefing, there are reports that the Obama administration's intelligence officials leaked to CNN the fact that the President-elect was briefed on the dossier. Four days later, on January 10, the dossier ended up being published by  Now, keep in mind, several media outlets had the dossier in hand prior to January 10, but none of them had printed it since the claims could not be verified.  Now, this timeline leaves us with a myriad of extremely concerning questions, Mr.Speaker, but they can be boiled down into a few specifics: Why did President Obama's campaign begin paying almost $1 million to the very same firm that the Clinton campaign used to fund the dossier in the very same month that the Clinton campaign began paying for the dossier?  The second question: Why did President Obama's FBI attempt to pay Christopher Steele for the Russian dossier? Why was President Obama's FBI involved in paying for a project that the Clinton campaign started and was orchestrating?  Again, the FBI has refused to answer these questions and has resisted transparency on this issue.  And why brief the President at all on the dossier if much of the dossier could not be verified?  Or, I would suggest, if President Obama's intelligence officials had reason to treat the dossier seriously, then why did they wait 2 months after the election to disclose the information on January 6? Why wait?  And why was the President's meeting with President-elect Trump leaked to CNN 4 days after the briefing, if, again, the dossier could not be verified?  Mr.Speaker, the intention of all of this is not to spread theories or to speculate as to what might have happened. The point is to recognize that there are legitimate, unanswered questions about whether the Obama Justice Department involved themselves in a political project targeting then-candidate Donald Trump, a suggestion that has far more evidence behind it than the directionless investigation into the Trump-Russian collusion.  The American people deserve an answer to those questions. They demand answers to those questions, and it is our government's responsibility to find them.

1000,topic-id,1354,"Mr.President, climate disruption is the seminal challenge of our generation. We have seen the impacts occurring all around the world. We see it in the disappearing Arctic ice. We see it in the melting permafrost. We see it in the change of carbon dioxide and methane being emitted from peat bogs, disappearing glaciers, dying coral reefs, and certainly more powerful storms and raging fires.  It is the responsibility of those of us in this generation, in this time, to take action. Indeed, communities across the globe are taking action. They are increasing the energy efficiency of buildings, vehicles, and appliances, and they are replacing carbon-polluting fossil fuel energy with renewable energy. This is such an important issue.  How much do you know about the changes underway? Well, let's find out. Welcome to episode 7 of the Senate Climate Disruption  Our first question is, Since the year 2000, the rate of global carbon dioxide pollution has decreased dramatically, decreased slightly, stayed the same, or increased substantially? Lock in your answers.[[Page S7051]]  The answer is D, increased substantially. Many folks think that because of the actions being taken at the local level and by the community of nations and the Paris Agreement, that, in fact, global CO2 pollution has decreased dramatically, but it has not. The rate at which the pollution is occurring is increasing. So it isn't just the total level. For example, in 1990, we had 354 parts per million; 10 years later, in 2000, we were up to 369.64 parts per million; and in 2017, we were up to 408.8 parts per million. The levels are climbing, but the speed is increasing as well. In that period around 1990, we were increasing about 1\1/2\ parts per million per year; by 2000, it was about 2 parts per million per year; and now we are at 2\1/2\ parts per million per year. So this increase is substantial.  As a community of nations, we have to not only proceed to decrease total carbon pollution, but first we have to get the rate of increase under control.  This brings us to the second question: In September of this year, how many miles did a Proterra bus drive on a single charge? Did this bus set a record by going 270 miles, the distance between L.and Las Vegas, or did it set a record by going 600 miles, equivalent from New York City to Columbia, SC? Did it travel over 1,100 miles, the equivalent distance from Arizona to Arkansas? Did it manage to go 2,092 miles, the shortest distance from the east coast to the west coast in America? Lock in your answers.  The correct answer is It went 1,100 miles. The electric bus traveled 1,100 miles. This bus was a new version of the Catalyst It is called the Catalyst E2 It is produced by It has a battery that is 50 percent larger than the previous version that is being sold commercially--that is the Catalyst That Proterra that is currently being sold has a functional range for the transit agencies that are buying it of over 350 miles, about 350 miles. That is pretty impressive. But by having a battery that is 50 percent lighter and moving quite slowly, driving it slowly, they managed to go 1,100 miles. It is really an indication of the rapid transformation of this particular type of electric vehicle.  Question 3: Warmer weather is contributing to what problem in major American cities? Is the problem caused by warmer weather transit delays? Is it exploding rat populations? Is warmer weather contributing to larger potholes or to longer tourist seasons?  Well, the dramatic answer here is that the warmer weather is contributing to exploding rat populations. Rat breeding usually slows in winter, but if you have a mild winter, that doesn't happen.  Since 2013, the pest control company Orkin has reported significant growth in its services--61 percent growth in Chicago, 67 percent in Boston, 174 percent in San Francisco, 129 percent in New York City, and 57 percent in Washington, DC, right here where the Capitol is located. This is a major economic and health problem. Rats caused $19 billion in economic damage in 2000 from, among other things, eating away at buildings and infrastructure, and, of course, they are carriers of rodent-borne diseases like coli and salmonella. Plus, we just simply don't like having them in our cities.  Let's turn to the next question, question 4. As of today, how many nations in the world are rejecting the Paris Agreement that addresses climate disruption? Is the answer 25 out of the roughly 200 nations in the world or 12 or 3 nations or 1 nation? Lock in your answers.  The answer is not 25 nor 12, and it is not 3. It is now just one nation that is rejecting the Paris Now, until recently there were three nations. You had two nations that had not signed up and one nation that had said it was going to withdraw. The two that had not signed up were Nicaragua and Syria, and the one that said it was going to withdraw was the United States of President Trump made that announcement. But a short time ago, Nicaragua announced it was going to ratify the treaty, and today Syria announced it was going to ratify the treaty. That leaves the United States standing alone as the only Nation that is saying it is going to reject the Paris  Of course, this has a big impact on American leadership in the world, since we worked very hard to bring nations together to craft this agreement. The nations were so impressed that all of them in the world are now participating except us--except the United  Let's go to question 5. Better management of our lands and forests could help reach what percent of the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement? Could better management of lands and forests contribute to reaching 5 percent, or one-twentieth of the goal; or 12 percent, roughly one-eighth; or 25 percent, roughly one-quarter of the goal; or 37 percent, more than one-third of the goal laid out in Paris? Lock in your answers.  The correct answer to this is D, 37 percent, or more than one-third, a surprisingly high number. An international study released last month said the natural climate solutions in guarding the management of our lands and our forests could help us reach more than a third of the goals laid out in the Paris The paper looked at 20 conservation and improved land management actions that help increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. The single most important factor among them is reforestation.  Years ago I heard an individual say: Wouldn't it be great if we could just invent something that could pull carbon dioxide out of the air. Well, we actually have that already. It is called a tree. Growing trees is a very effective strategy in addressing carbon pollution.  Of course, there are issues related to how we manage our forests and making them more resilient to forest fires, where they are less likely to burn and emit carbon. Certainly, there is how we farm and how we take care of other types of lands, including peat restoration and coastal restoration.  Those are our five questions for this edition, episode 7, of the Senate Climate Disruption These questions were ripped from the headlines in regard to the biggest test facing human kind on this planet. It is up to us in this generation to act.  We are the first generation to experience this enormous range of impacts from carbon pollution and a warming planet, and we are the only generation that is able to head off disaster ahead by acting quickly now. We are racing the clock. There is no time to spare. So stay engaged and do all you can to help take this on.  Meanwhile, as we learn more about technology and about the planet, all in the near future, I will bring you Climate Disruption Quiz Episode 8.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Johnson).

1063,topic-id,1063,"Mr.President, we have a very important role in this Senate--to provide advice and consent on nominees. Our forefathers, who wrote the Constitution, envisioned that this power would be used rarely because a President, knowing this power existed, would nominate highly suitable people for the post that they were intended to occupy. But we haven't seen highly suitable people coming through this Chamber this year. In fact, we have seen one person after another fabulously unsuited for the office or position to which they were nominated.  We saw Scott Pruitt, who took on and attacked regulations designed to create clean air across this country time after time, in a very close association with the fossil fuel industry that wanted to allow more particulates, more particulates that cause a tremendous amount of health damage in this country.  We saw Betsy DeVos come through this Chamber, an individual who was nominated to be Secretary of Public Education but had never stepped inside a public school, didn't respect public schools, hadn't had children in public schools, hadn't volunteered in public schools, and wanted to decimate public schools. The best thing we could have done for public schools would have been to turn down that nomination, but this Chamber said: Boy, you know, we are going to do everything we can to damage public education.  Many of us stood up against that and said: No, let's fight for someone who can make public education better, not tear it down. But that is not what we got.  Now we have another individual to be considered on the floor of the Senate, Bill Bill Wehrum was nominated to head EPA's Office of Air and Bill Wehrum has made a career out of working for powerful special interests and attacking any effort to make the air cleaner. Is that a person suitable for this role of protecting the air we breathe and making it better, someone who has sought to make it worse?  During the nomination hearing, I put up a very simple chart. I wanted to understand his thoughts about what was driving climate disruption. I put up a chart showing what NASA data showed for the solar impact, solar flares, and so forth, about which sometimes people say: Well, maybe it is solar flares that are causing the warming of the planet. NASA had data that showed a flat line on that and then a rising temperature.  I said: Is there any sign of correlation between these two lines?  His response was: Well, what do you mean? It is correlation.  He didn't have any understanding of the basics of how to compare one thing to another.  I put up another chart. The other chart showed all of the activities that are considered to be ones that might contribute to global warming, that are not manmade activities, things like the solar flares and volcanic activity. Again, the NASA data showed a flat line and the rising temperature.[[Page S7123]]  I said: Does there appear to be any correlation between this flat line and this rise in temperature?  He again said: I just don't understand the data. I can't really comment on that.  Yet anyone with any basic ability to digest information would recognize that there was no correlation. You didn't have two things moving in the same direction.  Then I put up this chart right here. This chart shows that same temperature, observe the black line, and then it shows the line for rising carbon dioxide. I said: Well, are these things correlated?  Do you see any relationship between one line rising and the other line rising?  Again, he refused to answer.  How is it that we can put someone into a position who cannot even look at and comment on basic data, who has been a hired hand for the fossil fuel industry, who has fought to make our air filthier and more damaging to our health?  That is the nominee we have, a nominee who has sued on behalf of very powerful interests--the EPA, 31 times--to try to degrade the controls for things like mercury, which is a potent neurotoxin that damages the brains of, particularly, our children. Why should we have somebody who wants more mercury in our air in this position to consider air quality? It, certainly, does not make any sense to me.  He did have a chance to serve in this position, in an acting capacity, back in 2006. So he has been there before. He adopted guidelines on mercury emissions that had entire passages lifted word for word from information that had been provided by the industry. The industry did not want to regulate the mercury, and he just took its language and said that that is what we will do, that we will do what industry says. He was not working for the American people. He was working for the powerful and the privileged.  Then he told an EPA staffer ``not to undertake the normal scientific and economic studies'' when crafting important rules. He instructed his staff not to look at the scientific information when constructing rules. What did he want them to look at? He wanted them to just take the language from industry. That is certainly not protecting the public interest. As the New York Times wrote, he has sought to ``elevate corporate interests above those of the public.''  This is not a position in a company. This is not a position in a corporation. This is a position of public trust. He has failed that test. In fact, he has failed it so badly that, although he was nominated in 2006 when there was a Republican majority in this Chamber, his nomination was subsequently rejected by the Back then, we had folks who really, actually cared on both sides of the aisle far more about air quality. Now it seems like the enormous amount of funding from the Koch brothers for campaigns across the country has squelched any consideration from my colleagues about the quality of the air or the quality of our water. This nomination is, certainly, a test of that.  If my colleagues do care about the quality of our air, they will act like their predecessors did back in 2006, and they will reject this nomination. An individual who has betrayed the public trust should not be confirmed to a position of public trust.  Thank you.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7122.txt,1900,1445,2017.0,8.0,November
1106,topic-id,876,"Mr.President, a few moments from now, we are going to come to this Chamber to vote on the nomination of Peter Robb to serve as general counsel for the National Labor Relations  Quite frankly, if we allow this individual to be confirmed, it will be a severe slap in the face to American workers. This is an individual who has made a career out of attacking the ability of American workers to get a fair share of the wealth they create. Yet here is a proposal to put him in a leadership position at an agency whose purpose is to fight to make sure workers get fair treatment. How does it make sense to take someone who has fought to undermine the ability of workers his entire life and put that person in charge of making sure American workers are treated fairly? Certainly, it is exactly the opposite of the argument Candidate Trump made when he said he was going to stand up for American workers. When push comes to shove, the President wants to shove workers down into the ditch.  It boils down to this: The National Labor Relations Board was established 82 years ago in the middle of the Great Depression to protect workers by encouraging and promoting their right to collective bargaining. Think of the power of association so that workers can have the opportunity to have a fair share, to have a basic foundation for their families to thrive. That ability of workers to organize has been behind every advancement we have made as a middle class in Be it the 40-hour workweek, safe working conditions, standard benefits, each and every advance was led by workers' ability to organize. Yet here the President wants to put in place an individual who has done everything possible to take away that right, that ability to weigh in for basic fundamental fairness for workers.  The responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board is more important today than ever. We have seen the impact of policies on behalf of the privileged and the powerful--incomes stagnating while the wealthiest Americans see their riches grow right up to the skyline. We have seen that anti-worker forces throughout our country have led an assault in State after State after State against the right of workers to organize and to secure safe working conditions and fair wages.  Here we are at a time when America's workers have seen four decades in which their wages have been flat or declining while the rich and powerful have stripped off the growing wealth of this Nation for themselves. Income inequality has soared, wealth inequality is massive, and here is one more person being nominated to accentuate that inequality in wealth and in income.  Back in 1981, Mr.Robb was lead attorney on the case to decertify the Professional Air Traffic Controllers The union was striking, and Mr.Robb helped President Reagan break that strike, which resulted in the firing of 11,000 striking workers and, as a commentator at the time said, forever ``undermined the bargaining of American workers and their labor unions.''  When he last worked on the team at NLRB, this nominee was present for decisions that--and this is recounted in a book called ``Right Turn''--``[a]ltered long-standing policy . . . narrowing the scope of activities subject to traditional National Labor Relations Board protections; broadening the permissible range of employer conduct in union representation campaigns; lowering the costs to employers of unlawful activity; and otherwise narrowing or excusing the employer to make changes subject to bargaining without informing unions before the change was made, or by permitting employers wider latitude to end the bargaining process by declaring impasse.''  More recently, Mr.Robb represented Dominion Energy and successfully defeated a union organizing drive at the Millstone Power Station, bragging on his firm's website that he was able to delay the election for ``more than two years after the day the petition was filed.''  As many of you know, he does not want workers to have a fair chance to vote on organizing a union or to work to press for a first contract or to seek fair wages. He has spent his career fighting against workers having that fair shot and defending companies against allegations from union members regarding unfair labor practices--all kinds of unfair labor practices, including age and sex discrimination. Never once in this long career has he been on the side of the American worker--not once; therefore, he has no place[[Page S7097]]at the head of an organization intended to support the ability of workers to organize and to press for a fair share.  It is unthinkable that this nominee would ever even come to this It is certainly part of an endless stream of attacks by the rich and powerful on working Americans that have kept their wages flat and declining for four decades. When are we going to see an end to this sort of oppression by the powerful class against the workers of the United States of America?  There is one act after another by this administration--President Trump and his team--undermining fair wages for workers in this It is outrageous. This nomination is outrageous, and I encourage my colleagues to vote no.

We were barely past our stage of grief as more than 50 people were shot dead and 500 were injured at a country music concert in Las Of course, every single night in this country, parents and brothers and sisters go to bed having lost their loved ones, and 90 people die every day from guns in this country.  I just think it is worth stating that this happens nowhere else other than in the United This is not inevitable. This is not something that we should accept. We are not impotent or helpless to try to change the scope of tragedy that is crippling for families that have to go through this.  I want everyone to take a quick look at this pretty simple chart. The United States has more guns and more gun deaths than any other developed country. It is not close, we are not even in the neighborhood of any of our other G-20 competitor nations. While the President told us the other day that this is a mental illness problem, one cannot explain this outlier status through a story of mental illness because none of these other countries have any lower rate of mental illness. There are just as many people who are mentally ill in these countries as there are in our country.  We cannot explain it by the attention we pay to mental illness. We spend more money on treating mental illness than these countries do. This isn't a mental illness problem. We have to do better in treating people who have psychological disorders in this country, but the reason that we are an outlier nation when it comes to the number of gun deaths and the epic scale of our mass tragedies is explained by something else.  Here is a quick story. This graphic shows the States that have background check requirements on all gun sales in the private sector, and here are the States that have no background check laws beyond those that are required in Federal law. It is a fundamentally different story when it comes to gun-related homicides. In the States that have background check laws, the average rate of homicide is substantially lower--substantially lower--than in States that haven't background check laws. That is because in this country, with the loosest, most lax gun laws in the industrialized world, private citizens are able to get their hands on weapons that are designed not for hunting and not for shooting for sport but to kill. These tactical assault-style weapons are being used over and over in these mass tragedies, and more people end up in harm's way.  Smarter gun laws--just making sure that the right people have guns, not the wrong people--lead to less gun deaths. It is time for us to admit that this is a uniquely American problem and that it deserves our attention rather than our silence, which has been our response every single session that I have been a Member of  This poster shows but a few of the faces that have been lost to gun violence in this country. My small town of Sandy Hook is a broken community. It is a beautiful, wonderful community, but it is a broken community. The ripples of grief that come with losing that number of children--beautiful children--all at one time never really gets repaired. That small community in Texas, Sutherland Springs, will suffer that same fate. It will be a community that will not ever truly repair itself, having lost so many beautiful people at one moment. You can't rewind the clock.  It is increasingly impossible for me to continue to go back to Newtown, CT, and tell the people of that community that even after mass murder after mass murder in this country, at a scale that occurs in no other Nation, our response as a body is to do nothing. It is a level of callousness that is frankly unexplainable to the victims of this violence, and this macabre club of families that have had to deal with the consequences of gun violence is getting bigger and bigger and bigger.  Why? Because the number of people who die by guns is not going down. It is not leveling off. It is exploding. Every year, more people--not less people--are killed by guns in this country, and it seems to be the only problem in which there is zero interest in this body to solve. When a terrorist plows into civilians with a truck in New York City, Republicans in this body are talking about policy change within hours, but after somebody walks into a school or a church or a shopping mall, we are told that there has to be a restraining order on policy debate for days. It is ridiculous, and it is offensive to the families who have gone through this.  So, let's just for a moment set aside the issues that I will admit are unlikely to come up for a vote in this body between now and the end of this session. I think it is unbelievable that universal background checks, supported by 90 percent of Americans, can't get a vote here. I don't think there is another issue like that in the American public, where 90 percent of Americans agree on something and Congress can't even conceive of getting it done.  The only place where background checks is controversial is in the Every single gun owner I talk to[[Page S7036]]in my State wants to make sure that criminals and people who are seriously mentally ill can't buy guns.  Similarly, let's admit what is happening here. It is not a coincidence that the same kind of weapon is used every single time in these shootings. These are copycat shootings in which people see the kind of destruction that comes with an AR-15-style weapon, and they use it again in order to maximize the lethality.  Wake up. Wake up to the reality that these weapons are being used to murder with speed and power, and the killers are watching what happens in Sandy Hook, what happens in Texas, what happens in Orlando, what happens in Las Vegas, and they are repeating the process. They are replicating the weapon. They shouldn't be in the hands of civilians. You can have plenty of fun hunting without an AR-15 or AR-15-style weapon. So let's set aside universal background checks and assault weapons for a moment. I get the politics of this place. I understand those are unlikely to pass.  Why, then, can't we work on the things that we know we agree on? I have listened to dozens of Republicans in the House and the Senate claim that they are for making real the prohibition on automatic weapons. People shouldn't have fully automatic weapons in this country. Nobody should be able to do what that guy did at an upper story window in a hotel in Las Vegas, and the law that we all passed is being ignored by companies that are selling these aftermarket modifications that turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons. The company that sold the modification took it off the market, but only for a couple of weeks. They are back to selling bump stocks again because we have signaled that we are not going to do anything about it.  It is not enough to just tell the ATF to do it. Why? Because the law is vague. The ATF said it was vague in 2010. All we have to do is clarify it, but aftermarket modifications that turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons shouldn't be legal. It seems we have agreement on that because I have listened to many Republicans saying they are willing to take that step. Let's take it and stop talking about it. Put legislation on the floor that says you cannot have an automatic weapon in this country. Let's do it. We agree on it.  I didn't agree with the President yesterday when he said it is a mental illness problem, but similarly we could work together to make sure that people who are seriously mentally ill don't buy weapons. That is the second noncontroversial policy proposal on which we could work together. Let's just admit we are going the wrong way, not the right way.  Earlier this year, Republicans passed a piece of legislation that allowed for 75,000 people in this country who have serious mental illness to be able to get off the list of prohibited purchasers and start buying guns again. These are people who were judged to be so mentally ill that they couldn't deposit a check. They were given conservator status for Social Security purposes. These are people who were so mentally ill, so limited in their cognitive abilities that they couldn't take a Social Security check and deposit it. Those people were prohibited from buying guns. This Congress passed a law earlier this year to say that those people who can't deposit a check should be able to go buy an assault weapon.  If we are serious about trying to stop people with mental illness from getting weapons, let's work together on that instead of moving backward.  Finally, it is an open secret that the existing background check system is broken. Let's not pretend we just woke up yesterday in amazement that the records of people who are seriously mentally ill or have been convicted of crimes aren't ending up on the background checklist.  I am holding in my hand the data that is available to every single one of us about the records that are being uploaded onto the background check system. For the Department of Defense, it is a whole bunch of zeros. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force--zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.  Similarly, States aren't doing their part either. Connecticut uploaded 363,000 felony records onto the NICS system over the course of 2016. Colorado uploaded 10 felony records in 2016. New York uploaded 57,000 domestic violence records in 2016. North Carolina uploaded 261. There weren't 261 people in North Carolina who were convicted of domestic violence crimes in 2016; it is just that only 261 people went up on the list. Many other States, like the Department of Defense, have zeros in all of these columns. Many States are uploading no records onto the system.  Now, admittedly, NICS tries to get those records through other means when States don't give it to them, but it is an open secret that the NICS system is broken. Congress at least tried to make some changes. After the Virginia Tech shooting, Congress did pass a NICS improvement bill, but it has not worked. It gave the Department of Justice the power to withhold Federal funding if States don't upload records. Despite the fact that there are a handful of States that have uploaded no records to NICS--zero--no State has been penalized under that 2007 law. That is not a Republican or a Democratic problem. The Obama administration didn't penalize States, and Republican Presidents didn't penalize Why don't we work together on that?  A couple of years ago, the House passed additional funding to help States, other jurisdictions, upload records. Why don't we find a way to work together to at least make the existing background check system work?  This feeling of helplessness that people have in this country, this feeling of impotence that nothing can be done to change the trajectory of violence in this country, the regular scroll across the bottom of your TV screen telling you news of the latest mass shootings where little kids and senior citizens are being gunned down in churches and schools--that sense of helplessness isn't real; it is a fiction, an invention of the gun lobby designed to make this place feel as if there is nothing that can be done in order to make sure that they can continue to make these obscene amounts of profits. There are things we can do.  I understand that despite the popularity of background checks with the public, we are probably not going to get a vote on that, but let's work together to make sure that automatic weapons can't be in the hands of civilians. Let's make real the very simple premise that seriously mentally ill people shouldn't be able to buy guns. Let's fix the background check system so that, as Republicans tell us over and over again, at least we can enforce existing law. There are ways that we can stop this slaughter, and I don't know how we live with ourselves, how we sleep at night as a body if, in the face of these massacres, we don't even do the stuff we all agree on.

999,topic-id,1969,"Mr.President, whenever a Higher Power is looking down on us as we move through our daily lives, I imagine that He probably doesn't see political borders. I imagine He probably doesn't care much about the distinctions that we create to tell the difference between us and others. He probably doesn't care much about walls and fences. He cares about us as people. He looks at us, at how we conduct ourselves, and at how we treat others.  We spend a lot of time here talking about the arbitrary divisions between us, but in the end, when we face our Maker, it probably is just about how we treated those around us, whether we tried to make their lives a little bit better.  So I am on the floor this afternoon to talk about a handful of my constituents who need our help, young people who we have labeled with the term Dreamers, who came to this country not by their decision but by the decision of their parents, when they were very, very young. They are Americans in every sense of the word. They are beautiful, beautiful young men and women, and they want us to see them as the beautiful individuals they are. They don't want to be labeled. They don't want to be put into the middle of a divisive political dialogue. They just want our help.  We all hear from them because there is no State that doesn't have these kids. There are 800,000 who have officially registered under the existing law that provides them with protection. They are in every single congressional district.  I thought it would be useful for my colleagues to hear from just a few of them today because they can tell the story of why we need to give citizenship, permanent protection, to these kids at the very least, if not their parents and others who have been waiting for a long time for comprehensive immigration reform. They can tell this story better than I can.  Vania from Willimantic is a student at Eastern Connecticut State I want to read what she wrote to me. She said:       I was born in Mexico, and I was brought to the United      States at the age of 3 and have been living in Willimantic      since. I am 19 now. I grew up in Willimantic, Connecticut,      and I consider it my home. It's where I grew up, where I went      to school, where I made friends, and where all my memories      are.       As an undocumented student in the United States, you are      constantly unsure of what your future may hold, but not      because you're indecisive or unsure of what you are going to      do, but rather because you don't ultimately have power of      your own future. At a young age I always knew I wanted to go      to college; however, I also knew that because of my status, I      might have not been able to carry out that goal. However, I      didn't let it discourage me. I like many other undocumented      students did the best we could and constantly strived to be      the best at anything we did, and now, thanks to DACA, all      that hard work has finally begun to pay off.       See, DACA is more than just a legal status; it is the      puzzle piece that many of us have been missing in order to      reach our goals. It has allowed me to get a Social Security      number, a driver's license, but more importantly, a higher      education.[[Page S7050]]       Growing up, I constantly had all my teachers say to me: Do      good in school, try your best at anything you do, stay out of      trouble, and you are guaranteed to go far in life.  Let me step out of her comments for a second. Boy, if that is not an encapsulation of the American dream--``do good in school, try your best at anything you do, stay out of trouble, and you are guaranteed to go far in life''--I don't think I could find a better way to encapsulate what we hope is the story for every single child in this country.  Vania said:       So that is exactly what I did. Most other DACA recipients      did the exact same, but it currently doesn't seem enough for      this government. There is no longer a fight for a work permit      but rather a fight for my human rights. I am just as worthy      to live here and carry out my goals as any other natural born      citizenship. I have done my best, consistently contributed to      society in a positive way. This is my home. I deserve to feel      safe here, and I will continue to fight for that until I do.  Mirka is from Wallingford, CT, and she is a Southern Connecticut State University student. She said:       I came here from Mexico sixteen years ago. I am currently a      senior at Southern Connecticut State University, studying      bilingual education.       We need more good people in bilingual education.       I just started student teaching last week, but all that is      in danger. Besides being able to get a license and work      permit, DACA has allowed me to follow through on my passion      of becoming a teacher. It has given me hope that I have a      future career in education and that I can live my life      without fear of deportation.  An in-need profession--bilingual educators. Somebody willing to devote their life to our kids needs our help.  Faye in Norwalk says:       I am one of the more than 800,000 DACA recipients in the      United I am from Trinidad and Tobago and have been in      the United States almost 19 years. I live in Norwalk, CT, and      I have lived there for about 16 years. It is home to me.  You hear that over and over again: It is home to me.       I am currently a Lead Radiology Scheduler, and I have a      second job working at Ulta, both of which I enjoy. My goal in      working both jobs is to purchase my first home.  That is another very critical component of the American dream--home ownership.       Growing up, I wanted to be a homeowner. I wanted a place      that I could call mine, and with DACA I saw that as a      possibility. Now I'm not sure when or if that would come      through, but I still will continue to work hard because in my      heart I know God is bigger than even this moment, and I know      that we will be victorious. Even in a land that would not      allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house of my      own to call my home. One day I will be called American not      just among my undocumented community but by a  I mean, listen, we have some very articulate people in this body, Republicans and I am not sure that any of us could write something that poignant, that beautiful, and that compelling: I am not sure if any of that will come through, but I am going to continue to work hard because in my heart I know that God is bigger than even this moment, and I know that we will be victorious. Even in a land that would not allow me to claim it as my home, I want to buy a house to call it my home. One day I will be called an American not just among my community but by my  There are 4,900 DACA recipients in just my State alone. I have met a lot of them. Frankly, maybe not everyone is as beautifully articulate as Faye, but, boy, they have done some very impressive things with their lives, maybe in part because they always knew that their status here was in jeopardy and they had to make the most of their time in the United States, not knowing when it would end, knowing that they had opportunities here in the United States that they simply would not and could not have if they ever went home, especially those kids who came here when they were 3 years old, going back home to a place where they might not even speak the language--they certainly know no one--a place where opportunity is farther off even for those who were born there. They worked hard, and they hustled a little bit more, knowing that they might be at risk of some day being pushed out of this country.  They are Every single one of these students, these Dreamers, use the phrase ``This is home.'' And they want our help.  I think this is a moral issue, first and foremost. It is how we treat each other. These people are our neighbors. They are our coworkers.  Eight hundred business leaders--CEOs from companies such as Walmart, Target, Facebook, Pepsi, Kaiser--want them to stay here because they are their employees. They know how much they add to the economic bounty of this country. They wrote to us and asked for us to provide permanent protection for these kids.  Seventy-five national colleges and universities, including all the ones in my State--Yale, Trinity, Connecticut College, the State universities--said the same thing. They want to educate these kids. They see them. They see what stellar students they are, and they just can't imagine the United States deciding to send 800,000 of these incredibly capable kids away.  One hundred eighty-six civil and human rights groups running the gamut say: This is a moral and civil rights issue. Let these kids stay.  Because of President Trump's decision to telegraph the end of the temporary protection for these students, the burden is now on us, Republicans and Democrats, to do something and do something soon. It is hard to describe the psychological toll on these kids right now. I mean, it was bad enough when they were pushed into the shadows. It got a little bit better when they got temporary protection. But now that we have put a clock on, now that they have revealed themselves to the world and put themselves on a list that can allow them to be targeted, there is a little bit of their soul that atrophies every day as they wonder whether we are going to come together and do the right thing. Part of the reason part of them is crumbling inside is because they see themselves as being made political pawns in a bigger game here.  It would be so easy for us to decide to protect these kids. Just do it now. Don't wait until the end of the year. Don't wait until this issue is mixed together with all sorts of other must-pass legislation. Just come together right now and step up and give these kids some degree of confidence that they can be here.  I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues say they want to do that. Why wait? Why push this up until the last minute? Do it right now. It is the right thing to do.  In the end, whoever is up there does not look at borders. He looks at us. He looks into our soul. He thinks about how we treat those who need our help and our protection. And no one needs our help and protection more than these kids right now--5,000 of them in my State and 800,000 of them across the country.  So my plea is simple, Mr.President: Let's do this and do this now. Let's give permanent protection, citizenship, pathways to citizenship, to these beautiful boys and girls, men and women. Don't make this issue about politics. Don't make it about parties. Don't make these kids a bargaining chip in a bigger game. Just do the right thing. I promise you, if you do, you won't regret it.

1077,topic-id,836,"Mr.President, I come to the floor to do what the Trump administration has failed to do; that is, to stand up for working families and fight for an economy that actually works for all, not just for the richest among us.  On the campaign trail, President Trump made promise after promise to workers. He promised to put them first and bring back good-paying jobs to their communities. Yet, since day one of his Presidency, we have seen him do just the opposite. His administration has rolled back protections for workers and families and prioritized corporate profits over working families' financial security.  He has put forth nominee after nominee who puts industry interests above the needs of families, like William Wehrum, President Trump's nominee to lead the EPA's Office of Air and Mr.Wehrum is someone who[[Page S7078]]has worked to undermine the core mission of the office he would oversee. He is a nominee who has demonstrated a willingness to side with protecting Big Business instead of protecting our Nation's most valuable resources and whose independence is truly in question.  Unfortunately, when looking at President Trump's record as a businessman, these decisions do not come as a surprise. President Trump spent decades as a real estate developer, cheating workers and contractors out of their hard-earned pay, and he refused to allow his own hotel workers to join together and advocate for safer working conditions and better wages.  President Trump's vision of our economy is one in which workers bear the burden, and the people who live in gilded towers get the benefit. The contrast with Democrats could not be clearer. Last week, Democrats rolled out an ambitious agenda to reform our labor laws to, once again, empower workers to join together, make their voices heard, and fight for better wages and benefits.  Currently, it is extremely difficult for workers to seek justice when corporations violate their rights, and if we want to rebuild the middle class, we have to change that because workers having the right to organize and join unions helped to build the middle class we have today. For many workers in the 20th century, good union jobs helped them to support their families and climb the economic ladder, but over the past few decades, our economy has worked in favor of corporations and those at the top. As corporate management and special interests have undermined workers in their right to collectively bargain, we have seen, of course, a decline in unions and union membership across the country. This has allowed President Trump and billionaires like him to take advantage of their workers, and it has given workers little recourse in standing up and fighting for better working conditions.  The preamble of the National Labor Relations Act clearly states that it is the policy of the United States to encourage collective bargaining to give workers a voice, allowing them to speak up for fair wages and safe working conditions, and it is the responsibility of the NLRB to ensure that workers' rights are protected so they are not taken advantage of. The NLRB gives workers the opportunity to file charges against corporations when they are illegally fired or retaliated against for exercising their rights, and because President Trump's own businesses have had complaints filed against them numerous times, it is so critical now that the Board is independent and committed to that core mission.  Unfortunately, I have serious concerns about Mr.Robb's commitment to that core mission and to supporting workers' rights so more families, not fewer, have financial security. Mr.Robb has spent most of his career as a corporate lawyer, representing Big Business and seeking to limit the rights that workers are guaranteed under the National Labor Relations Act--the very law he is now asking to be in charge of and enforce. He has defended companies against unfair labor allegations, age and discrimination charges, and unfair wage and hour claims. If he is confirmed, Mr.Robb will have the sole decision-making power as to which cases will be brought before the  Given his long history of defending corporations, I don't believe workers can trust him to act with their best interests at heart or to stand up to President Trump and his vision of an economy that works for those at the top but that undercuts workers' wages, safety, and rights.  I will be voting no on Mr.Robb's nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I know every single one of my colleagues has spoken to working families in his State who feel left behind today--families who work full time and who are saving what they can. They are struggling to make ends meet. It is time that we stop prioritizing corporate profits and start focusing on those workers and our middle class. We can only strengthen our economy if we give workers a voice in it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1093,topic-id,1032,"Mr.President, I appreciate all of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who will be joining us here this afternoon and thank them for their leadership on our legislation and for taking the time to speak today.  We are now exactly 1 week into open enrollment, and it has been 3 weeks since Chairman Alexander and I put forward a bipartisan bill to stabilize our healthcare markets and lower patients' healthcare costs. So I wanted to come this afternoon to talk for a few minutes about what it means that so many people nationwide are signing up for coverage and why there is no good reason for Republican leadership to wait another minute before bringing up our bill for a vote.  It is still early, but what we are seeing so far is that millions of people across our country are going to healthcare.gov to shop for coverage. Some 200,000 signed up on the first day. That is more than double the amount from last year. The vast majority will get tax credits to help cover their costs. In fact, some who are struggling the most will find they can save even more this year because of how our current healthcare system absorbs cost increases.  But there is no question that premiums are going up in many places and that fewer coverage options are available and not every consumer is protected. One woman--Melissa--told the Washington Post this week that she is ``joining the ranks of the uninsured'' for the first time in her life as a 51-year-old. She said that she doesn't qualify for subsidies and that given how much her premiums would increase, her insurance costs would have been more than her mortgage payments each month. Melissa is one of the people paying the price for President Trump's healthcare sabotage and the Republican leadership's--so far--willingness to cheer him along.  It is unacceptable that patients and families are having to take on this burden. Let's remember that when someone goes to sign up for healthcare coverage, they are not doing it as a Republican or a Democrat, they are doing it as a parent or a caregiver or a business owner who wants to stay healthy and financially secure.  Here in Washington, DC, healthcare has become bogged down in politics, but in cities and towns across the country, it is about taking care of yourselves and your loved ones. That is why so many people are going online to shop for coverage despite the President's insistence that healthcare in the United States was going to ``implode,'' regardless of the fact that to make implosion a reality, President Trump--among his many other efforts at sabotage--shortened the enrollment period this year and gutted investments in outreach and advertising and caused premiums for those people to increase by double digits on the average. Patients and families deserve so much better.  I have said it before: The frustrating thing is that all this could have been avoided. Way back in September, Chairman Alexander and I were on the verge of an agreement to stabilize healthcare markets and lower premiums for the coming year and for 2019. Our agreement would have provided multiyear certainty on the out-of-pocket cost reduction subsidies that President Trump decided to stop paying even though the law says he is required to do so. Had we been able to move faster, our legislation would have resulted in lower premiums right away for 2018. But Republican leaders pressed the ``pause'' button on bipartisan negotiations so they could try one more time to jam partisan repeal through the Senate, and we lost a lot of precious time.  Our bill, the Lamar Alexander-Patty Murray Senate bill, would do a lot of good right now and over the next years. If Republican leadership takes up our legislation now and passes it, families would see rebates this year and lower healthcare costs next year because our bill is designed to ensure that the benefit of greater certainty is passed on to patients and taxpayers, not hoarded by insurance companies.  Our deal would also invest in open enrollment and outreach for 2019, so more people would be covered. It would allow States more flexibility to innovate as the Affordable Care Act always intended. It would mark a critical step away from this harmful partisanship on healthcare and toward working under regular order on solutions that make healthcare work better for the people we serve.  Finally, this legislation would send a critical message to patients and families that when Congress sets aside partisan difference and focuses on what is best for our country, we can deliver a result, as Chairman Alexander often says.  More than 200 groups representing doctors, hospitals, State officials, Governors, and patients have endorsed our bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says it would do exactly what it was intended to do--stabilize markets and bring down healthcare costs--while returning $3.8 billion to taxpayers.  Twelve Senate Democrats and 12 Senate Republicans cosponsored it. We are continuing to build support, and there is no question that it would pass here with a filibuster-proof majority if it were brought to the floor. And while the Senate shouldn't need President Trump's signoff to take a position on ways to fix the Nation's healthcare system, the President has supported this process moving forward.  So here we are, and right now it is up to Republican leaders. They can choose to stay in a partisan corner and reject an opportunity to lower patients' healthcare costs in a bipartisan way, or they can do what people across the country want them to do and put patients over politics.  I do want to note that if Republican leaders hadn't gotten the message, voters made it pretty clear last night that they reject the deeply harmful partisanship we have seen on healthcare.  It is well past time for Republican leaders to give up the ghost on TrumpCare, declare it dead, and work with Democrats to get real solutions. That starts with our bipartisan bill to lower healthcare costs and stabilize the markets, because if they don't, they can be sure they will be held accountable.  I yield the floor.

1171,topic-id,1053,"Mr.Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, for letting me participate in this very important debate today.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, but specifically to voice my very strong support for one of the bills of the underlying legislation. That would be H.3043, which is the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.  This legislation, which is sponsored and spearheaded by my good friend and fellow Washingtonian, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, will improve the licensing process for U.hydropower resources by promoting accountability as well as transparency, by requiring greater cooperation among Federal and State agencies, as well as by reducing needless duplication of efforts.  Mr.Speaker, I am a strong, steadfast supporter of hydropower--I admit that--which, as America's first renewable electricity source, has provided our country with low-cost, clean, reliable energy for over a century. In my own home State of Washington, nearly 70 percent of our energy is derived from hydropower.  While there are still some misguided, extreme efforts to breach our dams and remove these critical sources of electric generation, I believe we need to increase our use of clean and renewable resources. By passing the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, we can take a very major step in doing just that.  Mr.Speaker, FERC, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, serves as the lead agency to coordinate hydropower reviews and convene stakeholders to participate in collaborative,[[Page H8538]]transparent public proceedings. However, FERC lacks the authority to improve the hydropower licensing process, including the ability to resolve disputes among agencies and enforce scheduling deadlines.  Far too often, it is those Federal and State agencies, as well as other bureaucratic bodies, that stand in the way of moving these licensing efforts forward. In fact, in response to a House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee hearing, FERC reported that there are 26 separate cases where the Commission has finished its environmental review and is currently waiting for action to be completed by another agency before FERC can issue a decision on any particular project.  Mr.Speaker, the licensing process for these projects should not be taking 10 years or more. Natural gas-fired facilities and other carbon-based energy sources are being approved in considerably less time. Meanwhile, less than 3 percent of the dams in this country produce electricity.  I will continue to support efforts to increase hydropower generation that will provide our country with reliable, stable, and clean energy. We can usher in a new era of U.energy independence derived from our very first renewable energy source by streamlining these processes.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and, particularly, its underlying legislation, H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I thought I had heard everything. The gentleman from Alabama got up and said how proud he is of the Rules Committee and of the process in this Oh, my The fact that the gentleman would get up and say that with a straight face, you take my breath away. It is unbelievable.  Today, we are considering our 49th closed rule of the 115th Congress, officially making this the most closed session in Congress in history, and the gentleman is proud of that.  More than half of the rules Republicans have reported out of the Rules Committee have not allowed any amendments. That means that no Member, Democrat or Republican, can offer their ideas on the House floor.  The gentleman says: Well, we want to prevent killer amendments from being made in order. So all the Republicans that offer amendments to the Rules Committee have killer amendments? It is ridiculous to say that about the Democratic amendments.  In total, just so the gentleman understands this, in total, the Rules Committee has blocked more than 1,300 amendments this year. That is 1,300. They are all killer amendments? They are all not deserving of a debate in the people's House?  They blocked 1,300 amendments, including 955 Democratic amendments. You blocked 260 Republican amendments and 121 bipartisan amendments.  Blocking these amendments has a very real impact. A bad process produces bad policy. Shutting out input from the vast majority of Members, both Democrats and Republicans, may make it easier for you to jam your agenda through the House, but that speed comes at the expense of the policy itself.  When you block amendments, you are shutting down debate on incredibly important issues, issues that this House of Representatives should be debating and voting on.  Here are a few examples of germane amendments that the majority didn't think were worthy of a debate and an up-or-down vote in the These were totally in order.

Unfortunately, many low road contractors in the      construction industry are becoming increasingly skilled in      shielding themselves from legal liabilities through layers of      subcontractors. Contractors use subcontractors or labor      brokers that either pay their employees off the books or      intentionally misclassify them as 1099 subcontractors. When      that is done, income taxes are not deducted, and Social      Security and Medicare taxes are not paid, as well as      unemployment contributions, workers' compensation premium and      overtime.       H.3441 purports to save businesses by making it      extremely difficult for the National Labor Relations Board      (NLRB) and U.Department of Labor to find employers jointly      liable for violations of the law. If enacted it would have      the unintended consequence of promoting a low road      contracting model in which those who willfully commit labor      violations are unaccountable, to the disadvantage of law-     abiding employers and their employees.       This piece of legislation would further induce bad actors      to perfect their efforts to undermine the labor standards in      our industry, making it more challenging for American workers      to achieve access to the middle class. It would also create a      competitive disadvantage to high road contractors who obey      the law. As such, I strongly urge your opposition to this      harmful legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    Sean McGarvey,                                      ____         United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2017.     Re Opposition to HR 3441, the Save Local Business     Virginia Foxx,     Chair, Committee on Education and the Workforce, Washington,              Robert Scott,     Ranking Member, Committee on Education and the Workforce,          Washington,       Dear Chair Foxx and Ranking Member Scott: I write to      respectfully express our opposition to HR 3441, the Save      Local Business Act, because it will provide a safe haven for      unscrupulous contractors in the construction industry who use      a system of subcontractors to deliberately shield themselves      from liability for abusing workers and stealing jobs away      from law-abiding businesses, even as they knowingly profit      from it.       Regrettably, while most companies in the construction      industry are legitimate, responsible employers, we are also      home to many who excel in illegal employment practices. This      fact is well known and widely acknowledged. The trend is for      contractors to use subcontractors or labor brokers who either      intentionally misclassify employees as independent      contractors or, more often, pay employees off the books. They      find two benefits in their schemes. First, through violating      wage, tax, immigration, workers' compensation and other      employment laws, they can shave up to 30 percent off of their      labor costs and underbid law-abiding businesses. Second, if      laws are enforced, contractors use the subcontract      relationship as a shield against liability and replace      offending subcontractors or labor brokers with others that      will do the same.       There is one vulnerability to their schemes. Under the Fair      Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and National Labor Relations Act      (NLRA) these contractors are frequently joint employers with      their subcontractors or labor brokers. The contractors keep      time, supply building materials, discharge workers, provide      training and daily supervision.       H.3441 closes that door by making it exceedingly      difficult to find joint-employer liability. Under the bill,      businesses cannot be joint employers unless they have direct,      actual and immediate control over the essential terms and      conditions of employment--a remarkable reversal of decades of      law. Moreover, a contractor and labor broker need only split      up responsibility over essential terms, and joint employment      is defeated. Indeed, it is arguable that under such an      arrangement there may be no employer at all.       It cannot be forgotten that construction contractors that      scheme to cheat workers out of overtime, wages and the right      to collective action also fail to comply with federal and      state employment tax laws. In Texas alone federal tax losses      from cheating contractors has been estimated to cost the      federal government over 81 billion.       This is not to suggest that legitimate, law-abiding      contractors should not use subcontractors, or that there are      not thousands of legitimate, law-abiding contractors and      independent contractors across this country. But it must be      recognized that abusive subcontracting schemes as described      above are also prevalent in our industry and that this bill      would make it even harder to crack down on these illegal      practices.       Despite its name, HR 3441 is a blue print to violate the      law and drive law-abiding employers out of business and make      it more difficult for working men and women to reach the      middle class. The law needs to protect workers and      responsible businesses--not put them in jeopardy.

It may be cliche to say that small and local businesses are the backbone of our economy, but, at the end of the day, there is no denying that statement. Small businesses truly are the engine that keep our economy moving, and when they suffer, our whole economy suffers.  Just take the last 8 years with the minimal growth that we have had. Since 2015, when the National Labor Relations Board adopted an expanded definition of the joint employers standard, upending decades of precedent and redefining who an employer is, there has been much confusion and ambiguity. For example, since then, there have been over 65,000 letters sent to Congress expressing confusion and asking for clarity in the aftermath of this rule.  This is unacceptable.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today to strongly encourage my colleagues to support the HEALTHY KIDS There are many reasons to support this bill, but, most importantly, it extends the Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, until 2022.

Earlier this year, Hurricane Harvey left a path of destruction across It put a major strain on our communities and resources that has resulted in moments of uncertainty.

Saturday is Veterans Day, a time to recognize our bravest men and women who answered the call to defend our great Nation against our enemies. Words are not enough to say thank you for everything you have endured and sacrificed on America's behalf.  As a fellow veteran, and on behalf of the good families of Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, I want to convey my appreciation to you and your families.  Many of us have seen the perils of war and conflict. Many have been injured in the line of duty, and many have paid the ultimate sacrifice before the altar of freedom.  Because of this display of sacrifice, future generations may enjoy the blessings of what our country stands for: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

31,topic-id,1043,"Mr.Chair, I thank Mr.Rush, our ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding.  Mr.Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.3043.  I support hydropower. It can deliver low-carbon, affordable power if it is well-sited and managed. But these facilities, which are licensed for 30 to 50 years, can do enormous harm to fisheries, agriculture, and recreational cultural resources if not properly overseen. The hydropower licensing process can be more efficient, but electric utilities should not be permitted to operate without license conditions that ensure other public interests are met.  As I look at H.3043 and weigh it against the list of stakeholders with interests in the rivers and watersheds[[Page H8617]]that provide hydroelectric facilities their fuel, I see a bill that is unbalanced, regressive, and dangerous; that will harm farmers, fishermen, boaters, Tribes, and drinking water.  H.3043 will allow private hydropower companies to use public water resources to generate power and profit, but without mitigating the negative impacts of their facilities on others who rely on our rivers, and without complying with modern environmental laws.  H.3043, is a direct assault on States' rights, Tribal rights, and it undercuts major environmental laws, including the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Endangered Species It prioritizes the use of rivers for power generation above the needs of all other water uses, and it inserts the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission into decisions that it has no authority, experience, or expertise to make.  So what this bill will not do is speed up the licensing process. FERC testified before our committee that one of the causes of delay in the licensing process was the failure of the applicant to provide a complete application, yet this bill does nothing to ensure that an applicant provides one. It makes no sense to impose a deadline if there is no clearly defined starting point in the form of a completed application.  How can a State make a decision on a water quality certificate if the applicant hasn't submitted the information that State needs to make that decision?  While FERC requires applicants to submit a complete application on the matters over which it has direct responsibility, the Commission has many times denied a similar opportunity to State and Federal agencies with regard to matters where they have primacy. In fact, FERC has a history of merely consulting with other stakeholders while dismissing their concerns and failing to incorporate minimal resource protections into hydropower licenses.  As an example, FERC recently failed to impose a number of conditions the State of West Virginia included in its water quality certificate for a project on the Monongahela FERC did this in spite of the fact that West Virginia acted in a timely manner. West Virginia acted in accordance with its law and delegated responsibility under the Clean Water  Yesterday, I sent a letter with several of my colleagues to FERC expressing concern over the process it used on this project.  This bill virtually ensures that type of situation will be repeated. Now, a project that is noncontroversial, supported by the State, is likely to be stalled by hearings and other possible litigation that could have been avoided.  Mr.Chair, the truth is that H.3043 treats Federal agencies, State governments, and Indian Tribes as second class citizens in this process. FERC is required to consult with them, but consultation does not ensure they will get FERC's support to fulfill their missions.  In this bill, all of the discipline is applied to government agencies, but none to the applicant. This is especially true in the case of license renewals. Any license that wants to avoid new investments or operating conditions can certainly do so because FERC will grant them automatic annual license renewal for as many years as they need.  Another reason why this bill will not expedite hydroelectric licenses is because, rather than streamlining the process, H.3043 greatly expands litigation opportunities, something that will increase the expense and time required to award a license. It does this by providing for a biased, costly trial-type hearing process to secure decisions in the utility's favor.  Current law allows a single opportunity to challenge an agency condition to avoid undue expense and delay in the licensing process. H.3043 expands the opportunities to challenge agency decisions, allows multiple challenges, and moves the venue for these hearings.  Not even FERC thinks that this is a good idea. In fact, at our hearing on this bill, the Deputy Associate General Counsel of FERC advised the committee to either retain the existing trial-type hearing process or eliminate it altogether.  Well, that advice obviously fell on deaf ears because the bill puts the trial-type hearing process on steroids. In essence, the private hydro companies pick the venue, set the rules, and secure additional points in the license process to challenge conditions that Federal resource agencies or FERC seeks to impose on a license to protect public interests. FERC warned that this change would increase the expense, complexity, and the length of licensing process--hardly the traits you would associate with streamlining.  Ultimately, the bill is a bad bill because it is bad for Native Americans; it is bad for the environment; it is bad for recreation; it is bad for farmers and agriculture; and H.3043 is bad for States, that will now find it much harder to protect water quality and manage the waters within their boundaries.  Maybe that is why the bill is opposed by States, Tribes, the outdoor recreation industry, and more than 150 national and local environmental organizations.  Opponents of the bill include the Western Governors' Association, the Southern States Energy Board, the National Congress of American Indians, the Environmental Council of the States, the Outdoor Alliance, the National Wildlife Federation, the American Rivers, Trout Unlimited, and the League of Conservation Voters, among many others.  Perhaps the ultimate condemnation comes from FERC, which, in testimony before our committee, disputed claims that the bill would streamline the licensing process, noting that the legislation ``could increase the complexity and length of the licensing process.''  Hydropower facilities are using our most precious resource: water.  I don't think it is too much to ask that facilities awarded long-term licenses and free fuel share the rivers with others.  Mr.Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill.  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8614-2.txt,887,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,8.0,November
650,topic-id,457,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to H.3922, a partisan bill to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, as well as community health centers and other public health programs.  It pains me to be here today, because this should not be a partisan bill. I have tried for months to negotiate with Republicans to develop a bipartisan compromise, but House Republicans chose to spend the first 9 months of this year trying to repeal the Affordable Care They failed, but now House Republicans are using the reauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as a way to once again sabotage the  Make no mistake, Mr.Speaker: if Republicans can't repeal the ACA outright, they will cripple it any time they can.  This time, Republicans are risking the healthcare of nearly 9 million children and the care of families all around the country that use community health centers. They are risking that care because this partisan bill has no chance of ever becoming law.  By taking this route, Republicans are guaranteeing that CHIP and community health centers will not be reauthorized until the end of the year, and that is extremely unfortunate.  Mr.Speaker, I strongly support CHIP, our community health centers, and all of our public health programs that are extended in this bill. These programs have traditionally been bipartisan, but the bill before us extends these programs by taking billions of dollars away from the Affordable Care Act and undermining  In short, this Republican bill offers a false choice. On one hand, it strips healthcare away from upwards of 680,000 Americans and guts the Prevention Fund, which pays for immunization and vaccines, lead poisoning prevention, opioid treatment, and many other important programs; on other hand, it reauthorizes these important programs. Democrats strongly support reauthorization of these programs, but we reject the way Republicans are paying for them.  Mr.Speaker, there are so many other policies that save money, countless alternatives that Democrats have offered to Republicans for months. Yesterday I offered an alternative that would have provided a robust reauthorization and extension of these important programs, and it was paid for in a commonsense way.  My alternative would have changed the timing of payments to Medicare Advantage This approach was recommended by both the GAO and the Office of the Inspector General, but Republicans rejected it in the Rules They wouldn't even allow it to come before the full House for a vote. And why is because they would rather use reauthorization of CHIP and community health centers as another way to sabotage the Affordable Care  I simply reject that approach and strongly urge a ``no'' vote.

Mr.Speaker, it is critical that we authorize CHIP and community health centers, but slashing essential public health funding is not the right way to do it.  Treatment of chronic diseases accounts for 75 percent of our Nation's healthcare spending, and many of these diseases can be prevented. Unfortunately, H.3922 does not do that at all.

The massive cuts to this funding will be devastating to my Central Valley of California district. My district has the largest number of tuberculosis cases in California for children under 5 years old. Children in this age group are more likely to develop life-threatening forms of TB since their immune systems are less mature. Public officials in my district are relying on funding from the Prevention Fund to address TB outbreaks.  It is troubling that Republicans are using CHIP reauthorization to take core public health services away from kids.

So if someone misses a payment on their insurance, they currently have 90 days to make up for it. Under this bill, they will only have 30 days.  Now, the CBO estimates that over 500,000 people will lose their health insurance and have to reapply for next year because of this reduction in the grace period. I know my colleague from the other side says: Well, that is too bad because they have the responsibility to pay it.  But the fact of the matter is that a lot of people have a hard time paying their monthly premium, and we should not be passing legislation that ends up with half-a-million people losing their health insurance.

That is the unifying factor in our Democratic Caucus in the  Mr.Garamendi, I thank you for your diligence in always coming to the floor and speaking truth about the numbers, about what they mean to America's future, and also about making it in So much of that is violated by what the Republicans have put forth.  I thank you for starting with the budget, because a budget should be a statement of national values. What is important to us as a nation should be reflected in how we allocate our resources. That is how we Democrats have always thought of it and acted upon it.  That is not what is present in the Republican budget on which these taxes are predicated.  Would it be a statement of your values to take $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid and give a $1.5 trillion tax cut to corporate America while, at[[Page H8592]]the same time, saying to working families you are going to have to pay what little--hit them on their deduction on SALT, the State and local taxes, and rubbing salt in the wound by saying that corporations don't have that deduction taken away from them and, at the same time, in this tax plan, making it advantageous for corporations to send jobs overseas by having them pay a lower tax for a factory they set up abroad than they would pay in the United States?  It is just not right. It is just not fair.  You have been a champion, along with Mr.Hoyer, on making it in Again, this tax proposal that the Republicans are putting forth does violence to all of that.  And thank you for pointing out the structural nature of what they are doing to the budget. The Republicans, our colleagues, are supposed to be deficit hawks. We agree that we must pay as you go. That has been our modus operandi until the Republicans came along and removed that: You want something? Pay as you go.  Republicans contend to be deficit hawks, but that must be an endangered species because none of them seem to recognize or acknowledge the damage they are doing to our fiscal soundness as we go out not just in the first 10 years, which is damaging enough and structurally horrible enough, but in the following 10 years. And we in Congress, when we make proposals that have a budget impact, have to account for not only the first 10 years, but the second 10 years.  Mr.Speaker, in the second 10 years, the horror of what the Republican tax bill does to the budget is a hemorrhaging--a hemorrhaging. This tax bill, when Members vote for it, if they do, will be an assault on our children's future. It is not only fiscally unsound, it is morally ungrounded because it says to our children and, in my case, our grandchildren: You are going to have to pay the bill.  The sad part of it is it has an impact on the budget. It comes back and says, well, we have so much deficit and so much debt service, so much interest on the national debt, we are now going to have to make further cuts in education, in research and development, in all of the initiatives that produce innovation.  Innovation begins in the classroom. They make an assault on the classroom in this tax bill. It is going to get worse when they try to pay for it.  Then, of course, it is fiscal engineering so that they can go after Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security once again. They have never really believed in They say it should wither on the vine, and in this bill, they do violence to it.  But let's just talk about what this does to the State of California, my colleague, because our Golden State, which we are proud to represent, is a great economic resource to the Nation--to the It contributes enormously to our balance in trade, whether it is agriculture from your area, innovation, entertainment, whatever it is. California is a big producer of favorable balance of trade for  Without California and without the industries that it has spread throughout the country, we would be in an even worse trade situation than we are now for all the giveaways that the Republicans are giving in the trade issue.  But let me just talk about this and what it means to people in their homes at their kitchen table when they are trying to pay the bills, establish their own priorities, make ends meet.  It is shocking, Mr.Speaker, it is absolutely shocking that 14 of our colleagues from California voted for a budget, and now many of them are proposing to vote for a tax bill, that will hurt their constituents to the tune of tens of thousands of their constituents.  Doug LaMalfa, the First District of California, around 100,000 households in his district claim the SALT deduction to the tune of thousands of dollars, and they will lose that.  Tom McClintock, around 100,000 or more claimed the deduction, and that is 36 percent of the households in his district, and they will lose thousands of dollars.  How does Paul Cook explain to his constituents, 57,000 of them who have claimed the deduction, that he is going to cost them thousands of dollars by increasing their tax bill?                              {time}  2015  Jeff Denham, he is really going to have to explain it very hard to a large percentage of his constituents as to how he is increasing their tax bill by thousands of dollars.  David Valadao, tens of thousands of his constituents will get the bad news if he insists on voting for this bill, which will cost them thousands of dollars.  Devin Nunes, tens of thousands of his constituents will pay the price for his lack of courage in a vote to go down the line with the Republicans to give a tax break to the wealthiest corporate America at the expense of their constituents, a direct expense and cost to their constituents.  Kevin McCarthy says to corporate America: We will give you $1.5 trillion tax cut, and guess who is paying for it? Around over 100,000 of my constituents to the tune of thousands of dollars.  Steve Knight: Don't worry, my constituents, we are giving the tax cut to corporate America, $1.5 trillion, and we are taking it out of your pocket, you are paying more.  Sadly, Ed Royce has the largest number of people who will be affected, close to 100,000 people, and they will be spending thousands of dollars more in the taxes that they pay because of  Ken Calvert, the same thing, tens of thousands paying thousands of dollars more.  Mimi Walters, how does she explain to her constituents, tens of thousands of them, that they will be paying thousands of dollars more in taxes? Why? To give a tax break to the top 2 percent: 80 percent of the tax break goes to the top 2 percent, 50 percent of it goes to the top 1 percent, $1.5 trillion goes to corporate  Dana Rohrabacher, the same thing, tens of thousands of people will be paying thousands of dollars more.  Darrell Hopefully Darrell won't vote for this. Hopefully some of these constituents will make sure that their Member of Congress knows that they see what is happening. Darrell Issa, well over 100,000 constituents paying thousands of dollars more.  Duncan Hunter, the same thing, around the same number. Well over 100,000--well over 150,000 paying thousands of dollars more. That represents about a third of his district.  But, as I said before, to rub salt in the wounds, while they are saying to their constituents, ``You are going to pay more because we are taking away your deduction,'' they are saying to corporate America, ``Your deductions for State and local taxes you keep.'' It is just remarkable.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8590.txt,905,SAVE LOCAL BUSINESS ACT,2017.0,7.0,November
608,topic-id,386,"And I underestimated them because I know they would question them, so I gave a conservative view. It is worse.  But you bring up the State and local, what SALT means, State and local taxes. The State and localities, did you see there is a letter--I don't have it right here--from the mayors of scores of cities in California asking the Members of Congress not to vote for this because of the provision that is in there that undermines their ability to address the education needs of their constituents, of the people in those towns and cities, the public safety issues? We had a firefighter come testify as to what it means to public safety, to law enforcement, to meeting the needs of people so that they can learn, that they can work, that they can raise their families, and to do so in a way that everyone pays his or her fair share. That is not the case here.  So, again, it is a boon to the megarich corporate special interest and a bust to the middle class. It also is very harmful to small business.  While the Republicans will say this is good for the middle class, it is not. They give with one hand something and take with another, so they can set the banquet table for the superrich corporate America and throw some crumbs to the middle class and say:[[Page H8593]]I am just telling it the way it is.

That is part of what is now. If time allows, and after the gentleman says his remarks, I will go into some of the specific ways in which cruelty is demonstrated in this budget. But right now, I just want to say this is a letter to the California delegation from 24 cities with their seals at the top and the signature of their mayors, some of them Republican, who have asked not to pass a bill that has this provision in it.

But it is not just California, it is across the country.  We are speaking from our experience. We are holding the California Republicans accountable. But every one of the Members who votes here is doing an injustice to the ability of States and local governments to do their job. We are cutting taxes. Now you go raise them so you can get the job done. So it makes matters even worse when you see what else is there.  Some of the cruelties that are in the bill, I mean, macrowise we know that this is a big transfer of wealth from middle class people to corporate America and to the superrich. We know that it is unfair to the middle class and will raise taxes on the middle class. It will increase the deficit. It is a legacy assault on our children's future. In addition, it deprives us opportunity cost to our budget in the near-term.  But there are some things in here that maybe are illustrative of the fact that this is not a statement of anybody's values that you know.  Let's talk about education for a moment. First of all, with all due respect, Mr.Speaker, one of the dumbest moves in this bill, with stiff competition, but one of the dumbest moves in this bill is the cut to education. Nothing brings more money to the Treasury than investing in education: early childhood, K-12, higher education, postgrad, lifetime learning. And in this bill, they, of course, make an assault on education.  For example, if you have a student loan, right now you have a $2,500 deduction for your interest payment on the loan. Not in this bill. Make that zero.  What? What did the middle class ever do to the Republicans that they are going to take away a deduction for interest on student loans when it is hard enough to save up and pay for college?  Next, now let's just go down to grade school. You are a teacher and you bring to school supplies for the classroom because your district is too poor to afford all of the things that the children would like to have. Right now, you get a tax deduction for what you bring to the classroom, but not in this bill. They have to take that away so they can give a tax break to the superrich so that schoolteacher isn't even compensated adequately, is sacrificing her personal funds, gets a tax break, but they take it away because the top 2 percent are desperate for their tax cut. But I don't think they are. I have more faith in the people of our country to say: Let us pay our fair share and let's do what is right.  But the list goes on on the things about lifetime learning and employers being able to provide for the training of workers: bye-bye.  Let me just tell you this one, since we are talking about education and children. In the bill, right now you get a tax credit to help you with adopting a child.                              {time}  2030  Such a joy to a family. If you are adopting a child with special needs, a tax credit. Not now. They have got to take that tax credit away from you. You don't need it anymore because[[Page H8594]]they have got to give it to corporate  If your employer decides that their place of business wants to help you with adoption, they get a deduction for helping you with your adoption. Not under this bill. Say good-bye to that.  Tax credit to the family adopting, tax deduction to the employer all gone so they can give the top 1 percent of our country 50 percent of this benefit at the cost of America's working families.  If you have medical needs, since 1944, you could deduct medical expenses for extraordinary medical needs. Very important to America's families. Not anymore. Say good-bye to that because we have got to take care of the superrich, so the pressure is on you.  The list goes on and on, but it gets personal. For families, it makes a difference as to whether their children can go to college. It makes a difference as to whether they can make ends meet with their medical expenses. It makes a difference if they don't have their State and local tax deduction. Again, this is across the country. We are speaking from our California experience.  It would take all night to go through the sins in this tax bill. I just wanted to give you a touch of some of those and how they directly impact America's working families while they profess that they are helping them. Not true.  Then they say: Oh, it is going to pay for itself.  Never has, never has. Don't take it from us. Bruce Bartlett, who is part of this supply side economics leadership as well as the trickle-down economics, said: We never said it would pay for itself. Anybody who says it does, it is not true. It is nonsense.  He even went on to say it was BS, as I am allowed to say on the floor of the House in its initial form.  These other things they say that just aren't true--oh, they take the name of Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt in vain, and even President Ronald Reagan: Oh, this is what they did.  No, this isn't what they did. They had over 400 people to testify, 30 hearings over a period of a couple of years, and worked in a bipartisan way to iron out so that it would have sustainability. That is the only way you get a good tax bill, is if it is bipartisan and sustainable.  So, in any event, this is a moment of truth for the American people, and we want the truth to be known.

I know both sides are guilty, but these are a couple of examples that I think rise above the norm and are so egregious that I could not let them stand.  Right now, Members of the minority party and their friends in the media are doing everything they can to stop us from changing the Tax Code this year. Their complaint about healthcare was that we weren't doing it in regular order. Now we are doing tax reform in regular order. The bill that we are working on in the Senate will go to committee as soon as next week. It will be marked up with amendments from both sides. At the right time, it will then go to this floor, and we will have amendments--again, from both sides--and we will vote that bill, up or down, into law or not. But Members on the other side are actively spreading numbers in studies that are based on false assumptions and have been proven to be untrue. I want to highlight a couple tonight, but there are many others.  On Monday, the Tax Policy Center released a study saying that the House plan, which was released last week, to change the Tax Code would raise taxes on 25 percent of American families. The minority leader said this on that day:       This analysis makes clear that over one quarter of      taxpayers will see a tax increase under the Republican plan,      all in the name of giveaways for the wealthiest Americans and      biggest corporations. Republicans want to take away middle      class deductions for people with student loan interest and      medical expenses so that the rich can exploit bigger      loopholes and corporations can pay lower taxes.  That study by the Tax Policy Center didn't even survive a full day. It was retracted later that afternoon. It is not even publicly available online today to review any longer. Do you know what is, though? The statements that came out of that report that day--false statements, just like the one I just gave, and many others highlighting that this study was reality. Maybe even worse is that these are false stories that are still running through the[[Page S7122]]media, as if they were true, as if they were facts.  The website Vox posted a story about this study titled, ``The numbers are in, and House Republican tax bill raises taxes on nearly a third of Americans.'' Surely, they posted an update saying that the study has been retracted. They say that they will update the story once new numbers are released. In the meantime, this headline and this story are still in existence as if they were still true. Why wouldn't they take down the story? Why wouldn't they change the headline until new numbers are available?  I wish this were a single, discredited study we are talking about and that this were the only time something like this has happened since we started to have this debate about changing the Tax Code and making America competitive again. Unfortunately, it is not.  Multiple Members of the minority party said that the tax framework supported by President Trump would raise taxes on families earning less than $86,000 per year. One of my colleagues said: ``On average, middle class families earning less than $86,000 will see a tax increase under the Republican `tax reform' plan.''  Another colleague said: ``The average tax increase on families nationwide earning up to $86,100 would be $794.00 per year.''  Here is another one: ``The average tax increase on families nationwide earning up to $86,100 would be $794.''  You begin to think that there is a common thread among many Members in this body about this same story. This talking point is so wrong that even the Washington Post later that day came out and said so. It gave this claim four Pinocchios, which we all know is their highest number against a falsity. That is the worst rating you can get on their fact checking.  The Washington Post's full ruling said:       Democrats have spread far and wide the false claim that      families making less than $86,100 on average will face a      hefty tax hike. Actually, it's the opposite. Most families in      that income range would get a tax cut. Any Democrat who      spread this claim should delete their tweets and make clear      they were in error.  That is from the Washington At least one statement making this claim is still up, and I haven't seen a single statement admitting error. These are but a couple of examples. There are many more.  As one last example, House Minority Leader Pelosi has called changing the Tax Code ``a Ponzi scheme.'' Virtually every Democrat has called it a ``betrayal of the middle class.'' Clearly, the facts do not back up these claims.  The minority party is doing all it can to stop us from getting this done this year because it makes good politics somehow. That is the only explanation I can think of.  Answer this for me; it doesn't make any sense: Why would someone oppose giving the middle class a tax break? Why would someone oppose making America competitive again? Why would someone oppose bringing billions of dollars of U.profits back to the United States so that they can be reinvested in the economy and create jobs? I don't understand it.  It is time for people in Washington, and even in this body, to stop doing what is best for their own political self-interest on both sides, frankly, and start doing what is right for the national interest. That right now--in the next few days--is clearly one thing, and that is fixing this archaic Tax  Every person in this body is responsible to some degree for the archaic nature of this Tax Both parties are responsible. If they were acting in our national interest, we would be hearing about the study showing that, on average, Americans are projected to get a pay increase of somewhere between $4,000 and $9,000 under this plan. We would be hearing about how families making less than $86,000 a year are actually getting a tax cut. Again, that is a point even the Washington Post has acknowledged.  We would be hearing about how lowering the corporate tax rate, ending the tax on repatriated earnings will make us more competitive with the rest of the world. We would be hearing about the economic growth that could result from these potential changes.  We have a historic opportunity before us to deliver results and make a difference in the lives of all There are Members of the minority party, however, who have supported these changes in the Tax Code right up until the point when President Trump took office. But that is no excuse for this nonsense that is going on right now.  I think it is our role, on both sides, to call out these untruths. It is also our responsibility to stop this nonsense. What the American people want are facts. They don't want fake news. They want to know that we are here doing their work for them, to make sure that we make America competitive again.  I say to the Presiding Officer, like you, I live in the real world. I have dealt with the nonsense that came out of these bodies that affected our Tax Code in a way that kept us from being competitive. It is time we change that. We have to get it done this year so that we can ignite economic growth next year and give relief to the middle class, who have suffered so much over the last 8 years.  I yield the floor.

411,topic-id,1186,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Mr.Speaker, we have been entreated to claims of collusion with our government, people high in our government with Russia for over a year now; since the last election happening this very day a year ago, we have been entreated to this.  So I thought I would bring some sense to this confusion about what we know as the Uranium One deal. Even I didn't know a whole lot about it, so I did a little research to understand the timeline and what exactly happened here. I want to talk to you about that this evening.  On June 8 of 2010, the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, also known as Rosatom--the Russian state, not some private organization. It belongs to Vladimir Make no mistake about it--announced plans to purchase a 51.4 percent stake in the Canadian company Uranium  Now, why do we care? Well, we care because this announcement had significant strategic implications for the United States since Uranium One's international assets included 20 percent of the United States' uranium reserves.  Now, due to uranium status as a strategic commodity, the $1.3 billion deal was subject to the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS; CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United And they care because uranium is important. Do you know why? We make nuclear bombs out of it--that is why it is important--and so do other countries. And maybe so do terrorists if they get their hands on it. So we care.  Now, the CFIUS panel is made up of nine department heads and agencies, including, at that time, Secretary of State Hillary Okay, fair enough. Now, CFIUS went through the approval process at what we would consider an unusually rapid pace, approving the sale of one-fifth of our uranium reserves, the United States' reserves, to a Russian, Vladimir Putin, state-owned enterprise in less than 5 months. Five months. I mean, they did that in 5 months. We have been investigating allegations of President Trump and Russia for about 12 months now. In earnest, less than 12 months, but, certainly, the claims have been made since the night of the election, yet they got this done in 5 months. Okay, that is good.  CFIUS proceeded at this pace despite national security concerns raised by Congress--people right here said: Hey, 20 percent of our uranium shouldn't go to Vladimir That doesn't make sense to us.  The FBI had extensive concerns, tying Rosatom's main executive to a U.racketeering scheme. My colleague has already talked about bribery, extortion, racketeering. Both Secretary of State Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder--whose FBI, by the way, produced the evidence--voted in favor of the deal. Interestingly enough, who was in charge of the FBI at the time? Our friend, Robert It just is a little too coincidental for me. I am sorry, it is just a little too coincidental.  After the sale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, assured both Congress and the public that the uranium sold could not be exported because neither Uranium One nor Rosatom, Vladimir Putin's organization, had an NRC export license. So even though we had control of 20 percent, he could never do anything with the 20 percent except leave it in the United  And, by the way, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission still hasn't granted a license to export any of that material to Rosatom or to Uranium One to this day.  But despite the public statements, somehow it got exported because an NRC memo showed the agency approved the shipment of yellowcake uranium from the Uranium One mines in the United States to Canada through a third party. Additional shipments of the uranium were made to Europe, and they were authorized as well by the And where they went from Europe, who knows. The NRC doesn't know. At least if they know, they aren't telling us. We have asked. We certainly don't know. Maybe Rosatom knows.  The question you should have is: Why? Why would the United States do this? What was in our interest to sell 20 percent of our uranium? Was it that we needed $1.3 billion? I suspect not.  In an attempt to avoid congressional scrutiny, the NRC did not provide a direct export license to Uranium One, but, instead, it amended an existing license for a logistics company to allow it to export Uranium One's uranium, which was, in effect, the United States' uranium, our uranium.  The NRC was able to amend this export license because of two policy changes resulting from the Russian reset orchestrated by Secretary Again, look, it might be innocent. It might be completely innocent, but it deserves more scrutiny, certainly.  The two things--the two policy changes were: the Obama administration reinstated the U.S.-Russian civilian nuclear energy cooperation agreement in May of 2010. Shortly thereafter, in 2011, the Commerce Department removed Rosatom from a list of restricted companies that could not export nuclear or other sensitive materials or technologies. They still didn't have a license, but they were removed from the list.  Nine months after the Commerce Department did that, the removal of Rosatom from the list, the NRC issued the license amendment to the third party allowing for uranium of the United States to be exported from Uranium One mines through Canada, and eventually on to Europe, and who knows where from there. The license amendment stipulated that the exported uranium must be returned to the U.Now, this did not occur. Instead, the Department of Energy approved the movement of uranium from Canada to Europe, and that was it. It is gone, folks. It is just gone.  It is now clear that the previous administration took every conceivable action to clear the path for Rosatom to purchase Uranium One and to enable the export of that uranium. The Russians got it. Vladimir Putin got the uranium.  In taking these extraordinary measures in support of Russian state-owned enterprise, the Obama administration, with the aid of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Attorney General Eric Holder, put our national security at risk.  Mr.Speaker, it is far past time to thoroughly--marginally, how about to marginally investigate this deal--the Obama administration's actions and the Clinton family's role and their foundation's role. You only need to ask[[Page H8588]]one question about all this: Why? Why would we do this? Why would the United States agree to this? Why did this deal happen the way it did happen? No other deals happened that way. Why did this one happen this way? Why is there no independent investigation into these matters at this point? Why? And why is there no special counsel?  We are here tonight to call for a special counsel so that we know the truth, so if there is Russian involvement in the United States' national security, whether it is our election, or whether it is our uranium that they could use to make an atomic bomb, the American people need to know. They should know. They should have all of the evidence.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8583-6.txt,2157,TAX POLICY,2017.0,7.0,November

1098,topic-id,494,"Mr.President, there are a number of matters where we disagree in the U.Senate, and they range from deeply held foundational beliefs to the smallest details of legislative language. Despite these disagreements, I believe there is a lot we can all agree on.  I hope I speak for every Member of Congress in saying that in this great Nation of ours, hard work should always be rewarded. If you play by the rules and do the right thing, you should have an opportunity to earn a good life for yourself and for your family. Our mothers, fathers, and others before us have worked hard to ensure that we have a fair shot at the American dream. Unfortunately, it feels like the fabric of the American dream has started to fray for far too many families. Even more troubling, we are seeing nominees from this administration who seem committed to actively unraveling the support and the protections that help workers get ahead.  Today we are considering the nomination of Peter Robb to be general counsel of the National Labor Relations Mr.Robb would be responsible for ensuring safe working conditions and fair compensation for American workers. He would be tasked with protecting the treasured right of workers to engage in good-faith negotiations with their employers.  However, a brief look at Mr.Robb's career reveals a clear track record of working to undermine our Nation's workers and middle class on behalf of corporate executives. To Mr.Robb's credit, he is not trying to hide his record or run away from his record. All you have to do is visit his firm's website, and you will see the experiences he is proud to display. I believe it is a preview of how he will approach his position at the National Labor Relations His self-proclaimed accomplishments include: advising large corporations on mergers, acquisitions, and plant closings; securing labor injunctions; and bringing suits against labor organizations.[[Page S7093]]  When someone tells you who they are, believe them. While I certainly believe that every American and corporation is entitled to vigorous representation by their lawyers, I also believe Senators must evaluate every nominee's full body of work. Let's be clear about how Mr.Robb has chosen to spend his professional life: helping management close plants and cut jobs, suing unions, delaying workers' rights to collectively bargain, and defending companies that violate workplace safety and fair pay laws.  At a time when corporate profits and executive compensation have skyrocketed and worker wages are stagnant, I have no confidence in Mr.Robb's ability to be a neutral arbiter between labor and management, let alone advocate for the safety and the well-being of America's working men and women. Our Nation's workers deserve a nominee who will protect their right to negotiate for fair pay and safe working conditions, not someone who has spent his entire career litigating against workers. I will be voting against Mr.Robb's confirmation, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7072-4.txt,2113,TAX POLICY,2017.0,8.0,November

I don't know that I have ever had that said about a bill that I have submitted, so I am very happy to be here today and to be able to support the Veterans Fair Debt Notice  Mr.Speaker, as you heard, this bill offers a commonsense fix to frustrations that veterans in my district and across the country have experienced with VA's debt management system.  Veterans in Maine have called my office shocked to find out that they owe VA money. Some are confused by the letters they receive. Others are told by VA that they have missed important deadlines to dispute, to seek forgiveness, or to create a payment plan for the alleged debt.  Regardless of whether the debt is real or a mistake by VA, we shouldn't make it so hard for veterans to know their rights and obligations.  We have seen single mom veterans who can't get a home loan and newly transitioned servicemembers who struggle to reintegrate with garnished pay, recouped tax returns, and reduced disability payments, all because of assigned debts they knew nothing about after notifications got sent to the wrong place or ``lost in the mail.''  In response, H.3705 directs VA to work with veterans service organizations to develop standard notification letters that are written in plain language. It also directs VA to explore how to inform veterans of debts more quickly by sending notifications electronically, like an email, in addition to standard mail.  It requires VA to study why so many veterans have not received notifications in the mail, as well as steps VA can take to improve its address database and the costs using certified mail.

This bipartisan legislation makes commonsense reforms to the high volatility commercial real estate loan process and clarifies the existing regulations to help simplify real estate financing in high volatility markets, including economically depressed urban communities.  The complexity of the current HVCRE definition, combined with the failure of Federal regulators to clarify and define HVCRE rules and how and where they are to be applied, has made certain that these development loans have become way too expensive. This has increased borrowing costs and reduced credit availability.  These failures directly impact local communities. We have seen fewer jobs, less economic growth, and increased costs for community projects, in addition to setbacks for local banks and developers.  My bipartisan legislation addresses many of these concerns by broadening the types of equity the developer may place towards the heightened risk requirements of an HVCRE loan. We also clarify which types of loans should and should not be classified as We must codify and improve the HVCRE rules to ensure market and industry stability.

Of course you are aware of Irma and We Americans, unbeknownst to ourselves and the work[[Page H8519]]that we have done, also exacerbated food insecurity in Haiti by placing individuals, causing the cholera epidemic that is there. Unbeknownst to ourselves, when we came there to give support to Haiti, we Americans brought the cholera epidemic that is now ravaging Haiti and has taken about 10,000 people.  Additionally, Hurricane Matthew exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians, 22 percent of the population, in the grips of an acute food security crisis.  I have many Haitians who are in my community in the U.Virgin Islands, and we count them as some of our hardest workers, and we recognize the impact that sending so many of these people back would have not only on the loss of jobs here and the work that those individuals are doing in the United States, but on the economy of Haiti itself.  There is no infrastructure that will support the 50,000 people going back to Haiti at this time, and that economy will probably completely collapse without the remittances that the Haitians who are living in the United States would be able to bring to that country.  Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS designation would be twofold: such actions would be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and run counter to congressional efforts to improve American relations in the region through the recently passed United States-Caribbean Strategic Engagement Act, Public Law 114-291.  So the 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan, Haitian, and Salvadoran immigrants await a mass deportation decision on temporary protective status, and we are requesting--we are urging, Mr.Speaker--that this Congress would continue to urge the Department of Homeland Security, and use our own powers, to ensure the safety of those individuals, ensure the safety of the stability of the economies of our near neighbors, of Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, and El Salvador, and urge the U.Department of Homeland Security for their protections not to expire and not to put these people into difficult choices of returning to countries that still face many of the same extraordinary conditions that led to the initial grant of TPS or remaining in the United States without lawful immigrant status.  We believe that this is the right thing to do, that this Congress wants to do the right thing, that the Trump administration's 2018 proposed budget cut, budget request to Congress, for example, proposes to reduce foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean to levels not seen since 2001. Because of that, the remittances of these individuals is even more important. Remittances from the United States to El Salvador equal $4 billion; Honduras, $3.3 billion; to Haiti, almost $2 billion. Using GDP estimates from the World Bank, remittances make up more than 15 percent of the GDP for El Salvador, Honduras, and  Therefore, if we are going to reduce the budget in terms of foreign aid to these countries, it is important that we do not allow the collapse of these countries. It will not only bring economic collapse, but we know it is very likely to bring political anarchy and political disruption, as well, to countries that are instable as they are, countries where we are looking to bring stable democratic governments. Ensuring that individuals are allowed to stay here in this country and provide those remittances, provide the support that is necessary to grow those economies, embed democratic ideals, will be most beneficial to us and to ensure the stability of the Western Hemisphere at this time.  Mr.Speaker, this is an imperative that is important to this country, imperative to the United States, and we are grateful that we have had this time to share this information with you, with the American people, with this We are urging our colleagues, urging Members of this Congress, to work with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, individuals you have heard tonight, Mia Love, Cedric Richmond, Yvette Clarke, Donald Payne, Val Demings, Barbara Lee, all the members of the Congressional Black Caucus and others who urge that this support be enacted not only by the Department of Homeland Security, but by this  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

994,topic-id,3500,"Mr.President, I don't know where to begin. I want to speak about the tax reform proposal but will start by responding to my colleague from Maryland--and he is a colleague and friend--to say that he must be talking about a different tax reform proposal than we are talking about because, frankly, so much of what he said is not consistent with the legislation that I have seen the House proposing and certainly not consistent with the legislation we are talking about here in the  Let me start with his claim that there is a $1.5 trillion tax cut for big corporations. That is simply not true. You can look at the House proposal because it is now out. You can see the fact that it does have tax relief, and it has tax relief targeted at middle-class families. He is right about the fact that it has a lower rate for our multinational businesses, but he also knows that our current system is absolutely broken, and what is occurring is precisely what he is suggesting might occur if we were to change the code, which is companies and jobs and investment are going overseas.  He talked about the fact that we haven't had hearings. Since I got elected to the Senate in 2010, we have had 70 hearings in the committee I serve on, which is the Finance I would encourage people to look at what we did 2 years ago. We set up five bipartisan task forces on tax reform. I cochaired one of them. It was actually on the very topic my colleague was talking about.  I would encourage him to look at the working group paper on international tax reform and the need for us to go to a lower rate--20 percent--to be competitive, to get just below the other industrialized countries, and then to have the opportunity to go to a new type of tax system that enables us to bring back the money that is locked out overseas. Unbelievably, there is $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of earnings that are overseas. Much of that could be brought back, and that is what this tax proposal does.  Significantly, that report my colleagues will see was coauthored by two Members of this body, one Republican and one Democrat, because all of these task forces, these working groups, were bipartisan. My colleague in that effort was a Senator from New York by the name of Chuck Schumer, who now happens to be the Democratic leader.  So I think there is a consensus, at least in the real world, about the fact that our current Tax Code is hopelessly broken and we have to fix it. And if you are against helping our companies to stay American companies, that must mean that you believe that they ought to become foreign companies, which is exactly what is happening. To me, it is an outrage that the U.Congress is allowing this to happen.  Ernst & Young, which is a public accounting firm, recently came out with a study showing that 4,700 companies that have become foreign companies over the past 13 years would still be American companies if we had the kind of tax reform proposal that we are proposing. In other words, if you had this 20 percent rate I talked about, this competitive international system, you would have 4,700 more American companies here, providing jobs, making investments, contributing to their communities.  It does matter that a company is headquartered here versus headquartered overseas. We have done an analysis of this. We have done an investigation of this. We have determined that when companies leave, they don't just change their headquarters, they take investment and jobs with them.  I would refer my colleagues to the work of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations; again, bipartisan work about the fact that we have to fix this broken Tax  The Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan group here on Capitol Hill that gives us advice on the impact of tax reform on the economy, on deficits, on revenues, has a report which says that if you do lower the business tax rate to make these companies competitive--again, the alternative is going overseas--the benefit of that goes to shareholders, goes to workers. They say in their analysis that 70 percent of the benefit goes to higher wages and more benefits for workers.  Think about it. That makes sense. If a company is not competitive, they can't pay the kinds of wages we want them to pay. We want to get wages up. They can't pay the kinds of benefits we want them to pay. We want to get benefits up.  So although I hope that we can have a spirited debate about aspects of this legislation, we should stick to the facts. We should not attempt to make this yet another partisan issue in this town, where we are attacking something not so much on the merits but because the other side thought about it.  I will tell you, when you look back historically, it isn't just the working group that Senator Schumer and I cochaired on this international front where we have to get this rate down. We have to become competitive. We have to save our jobs here. But look at another bipartisan effort that is talked about a lot and is not agreed to by all Democrats or all Republicans; that is, the Simpson-Bowles proposal. This was several years ago. They looked at the tax policy and deficit issues. Simpson-Bowles--totally bipartisan, supported by a bipartisan group of U.Senators who, at the time, were on that commission--said that we ought to go to this lower rate and territorial system. This is not a partisan issue or at least it hasn't been until now. Let's not make it one.  Yes, it is true that there is tax relief in this proposal. The proposal the House has proposed--the proposal the Senate is likely to propose later this week--does have tax relief, and we believe that tax relief is appropriate.  We believe we have to give middle-class families in my home State of Ohio and around the country a little break right now. Why? Because they are seeing their expenses go up, especially healthcare, but also other expenses. I say ``especially healthcare'' because that is the single largest increase in expenses; it is in the healthcare area--deductibles, copays, premiums--but also on food, housing, and other costs, including tuition if you are trying to send your kids to school. These expenses have skyrocketed, yet wages are flat, meaning people are facing this middle-class squeeze.[[Page S7045]]  We hear a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle about the fact that we want to help the middle class. One way to help is to help the family budget, to get a little relief to these families so they can make ends meet and not just live paycheck to paycheck.  It will also help the economy. It will help get more money into the economy to buy that car, to buy that appliance, to help move the economy forward. It is part of this reform bill--yes, it is--and we are proud of it.  We also provide some tax relief on the business side to help small businesses. These are the so-called passthrough companies. About 90 percent of the businesses in America don't pay their taxes as companies. They are not corporations in that sense. They pay their taxes through their individual tax return. They are called passthrough companies. Some call them LLCs, subchapter S, or sole proprietors or partnerships. These companies tend to be smaller companies, they tend to be family-owned. They need a little help too. So the proposal does provide significant relief for those small businesses. In the House proposal and the Senate proposal, it is hundreds of billions of dollars out of the $1.5 trillion tax relief. We think that is appropriate.  Finally, again, on the business side, it will help make companies competitive to get the rate down so they can attract investment into America rather than having that investment and jobs going out of America, which is what is happening now. There are 4,700 companies that would be American companies today if we had this tax proposal in place over the last 13 years, but we didn't, and we should learn from that. It is Congress's responsibility to act to keep that from happening in the future.  That is what this tax reform is about. It is about three things. It is about a middle-class tax cut allowing people to keep more of their hard-earned money. We think that is appropriate in these times.  It is about helping to make our companies more competitive because we want more jobs and higher wages. Part of dealing with the middle-class squeeze is to provide a little help with the family budget with tax relief. Part is to get wages up. When people look at this tax reform proposal--right, left, or center--they are going to say the same thing: This is going to incentivize more investment. Some think more, some think less, but that investment in a tight labor market, as we have right now, is going to result in more competition for these workers, therefore, pushing wages up. That is what we want. That is what this is about. It is exciting.  Third is to level the playing field internationally so American companies will not be going overseas. That is the whole point. We are not doing this tax reform proposal to encourage companies to go overseas. We are doing this tax reform proposal to incentivize them to stay in America and to attract more foreign investment here in this country so an American company can pay that premium for a foreign subsidiary, rather than the other way around now, where American companies are not just inverting. We have heard this word ``inversions,'' going overseas and buying a foreign company. They are actually being taken over by foreign companies.  That is the reality. We can't let it continue. We have to stand up and be counted, stand up for the middle class, stand up for our workers who are now competing with one hand tied behind their back, whether it is a big auto company like in my home State of Ohio--I toured five of these auto factories over the last couple of weeks, talked to them about the tax reform proposal and how it would work. They gave me their input. It is going to help. By the way, it is going to help whether you are a U.company or a foreign company. If you are a foreign automaker here in America or you have other foreign investments, a lower rate and immediate expensing--in other words, being able to write off your investments and equipment as you make them--that is all good for you too. So it will have both, the desired effect of helping American companies be competitive but, also, if you have foreign direct investment in your State and your community, they should be encouraged to put more money in America rather than somewhere else. If you are a Japanese automaker and you are looking around the world asking: Do I put that next investment in China, do I put it in Tokyo, do I put it in Europe and Germany, or do I put it in America, you will like this proposal because you will want to invest and be part of this too. That will help us give this economy a needed shot in the arm.  There has been a lot of talk--and I heard it again today on the floor--that this is going to be bad for the deficit. I think there will be about $44 trillion of new revenue coming in, estimated, over the next 10 years. Yes, out of that amount of money, we are suggesting a $1.5 trillion tax cut relative to the score--the budget--we have to use.  What does that mean? About $500 billion of that is simply saying, the Budget Office says the existing tax policy in place is only temporary. Some of it is only temporary. These are the so-called extenders. We know that is unlikely because we have always pretty much made these permanent, including a big one called bonus depreciation, which is most of that. Right away we think the way it is scored is not fair so we get down to about $1 trillion in tax relief over 10 years, again, with $44 trillion coming in.  What does that mean? It means you have to have a little more economic growth than is projected in order to not have a deficit and actually pay down the deficit through more revenue coming in. I think that will happen. Why do I say that? Because the projections we have to use are very conservative. The Congressional Budget Office is what we are using, and we are obliged to do that, which is fine. It is a nonpartisan group. They are saying economic growth over the next 10 years will average about 1.9 percent of growth. The average over the past 30 years is about 2.5 percent. So they are saying our economy is not going to grow as fast as it has in the last 30 years. We will see. In the last two quarters, the economy grew at 3 percent and 3.1 percent so they don't seem to be on track with where the economy is going right now.  More importantly to me, these proposals are pro-growth proposals--whether it is help with regard to the business rate, which gets it below the rate of other industrialized countries rather than the highest rate in the entire industrialized world, which is where we are now. We have the highest rate in the industrialized world, and we are getting it below the average. That will increase investment and economic activity and jobs and, therefore, revenue.  If it is the immediate expensing,--again, where you can write down your investments right away--that will increase investment in jobs, according to all the economists who look at that. They may differ on how much.  If you look at the international side, where we are going to bring back some of that $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion that is stuck overseas, that certainly is going to be invested here in this country and help with regard to economic growth.  There are a number of provisions. I talked about the small business provisions earlier which will help small businesses to be able to innovate, to be entrepreneurial, which is what we need more of--more new starts. That is going to help.  All of that together is going to help with economic growth. How much? Instead of the 1.9 percent conservative estimate they have made for the next 10 years, let's say it grows 0.4 percent more than projected. I would attribute at least that much to this tax reform proposal because of what we just talked about, but if you believe it is going to grow at 0.4 percent more than projected; in other words, instead of 1.9 percent, 2.3 percent--2.3 percent growth would be below the average over the last 30 years--then you will actually see the deficit start to come down because of this tax reform proposal because the revenue will be there, not just to make it revenue neutral, but beyond that we will actually pay down the deficit. We haven't done that in a while.  Back in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, we went through this before. We began to reduce the deficit annually. Do you know how it happened? Constraining spending helped, and that is part of our challenge in the Congress--how do we get our hands around the spending--but second is growing the economy. In that[[Page S7046]]case, the capital gains rate of taxation was reduced. Then, suddenly, in the late 1990s, about $100 billion of revenue that nobody expected showed up in the coffers. That is how we got to a so-called balanced budget a few years early because tax revenues were greater than expected.  I believe this will happen again. I believe that when you look at this proposal, it is conservative in the sense that it says: Yes, let's provide needed middle-class tax relief. Let's also do these things to grow the economy. Let's assume that because of all this, we are going to be able to improve the economic performance that is projected.  It is a pretty disappointing projection. Let's face it, 1.9 percent growth isn't great for any of us. It isn't great to deal with the issues of poverty. It isn't great to deal with the issues of entrepreneurship and innovation. It isn't going to help us to afford the entitlements that are growing. We need better growth than that, we want more growth, and I think tax relief is the single-most important thing we can do right now.  Yes, we should have more regulatory relief. Yes, we should do better in terms of getting the cost of healthcare under control. People are concerned about costs rising so fast, and we haven't been able to grapple with that issue. Yes, we should do more on worker training. We have a skills gap in this country. We have jobs available, and yet we don't have the skilled workforce to take those jobs. Yes, we can do more in terms of helping grow the economy through education and other things, but the one policy area that is crying out for reform is our tax system. It is antiquated. It is out of date. It is driving jobs overseas. It makes no sense. It can be simplified, and this simplifies the Tax It can be made more fair, and this makes it more fair by helping the middle class more. It can encourage economic growth, and it does so through small business relief and relief for our multinational companies. It can help bring back trillions of dollars stuck overseas. That is what this does. That is the whole idea here.  I am excited about this opportunity. The House of Representatives is working on their legislation now in committee. Next week, that will shift to the Senate and the Senate Committee on We will have the opportunity for an open process. As I noted, we have already had 70 hearings in the Finance Committee just over the past 7 years since I have been in this We have had working groups, including the bipartisan one I mentioned earlier, the five bipartisan working groups of that committee.  We will have the opportunity at our hearing next week to have an open process--anybody can offer an amendment--and open discussion. We will have an interesting debate. It will be spirited. As we saw here today, we have some differences of opinion, but let's stick to the facts. Let's not make this partisan. Let's stick to the merits. Let's try to help the American people and our economy.  Then we will come to the floor of the U.Senate, and the same thing will happen--an open process. Every desk you see in here represents a Senator who will have the opportunity, should he or she wish, to offer an amendment, to have a debate, to discuss the issue. It will be spirited at times, but, again, I hope it will lead to a result that actually helps do the things we were elected to do: to give our constituents--the people we represent--the chance to have a better life; to give middle-class families a little relief as they are facing this middle-class squeeze; to help grow this economy from the middle out, from the bottom up, from everywhere; to give us the ability to say, once again, that America is that shining example, that beacon of hope and opportunity for the rest of the world. That is what this is about.  Let's not blow this opportunity. Let's get it done, let's get it to the President's desk for his signature before the end of this year, and let's make good on the commitments we have made to our constituents to help create a better economy and a better future.

They have worked together, side by side, to try to find some common ground while still retaining and protecting the principles they all hold with regard to how health insurance, long term, should be approached.  Coming to a bipartisan agreement on this very important piece of legislation[[Page S7100]]is only the first step. As you know, a deal was announced last month to give States permanent flexibility to avoid some of ObamaCare's most crushing mandates, while also temporarily authorizing the cost sharing reduction, or CSR, payments for 2 years. That is what the piece of legislation we are referring to in this particular case, the Alexander-Murray legislation, would do.  This agreement is a win for conservatives who have spent the past 7 years promising to relieve the American people of ObamaCare's skyrocketing premiums, limited choices, and Federal chokehold. For the first time since ObamaCare was forced onto the American public, the Alexander-Murray legislation is an opportunity to provide permanent, meaningful opportunities for States to opt out of some of ObamaCare's most egregious mandates under the 1332 waiver program, while making healthcare more affordable for their constituents.  As a former Governor, like my colleagues Mr.Alexander and Mr.King, I understand that the best decisions are made at the State and local levels, not by Federal bureaucrats. Empowering States with new opportunities to innovate and strengthen their individual health insurance markets in a way that meets their citizens' unique needs is a first step toward repealing ObamaCare and allowing the marketplace to once again be competitive and innovative.  In exchange for the permanent 1332 waiver changes, we have agreed to temporarily authorize the administration to make CSR payments for 2 years, similar to the provisions of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which 49 Republican Members of the U.Senate supported earlier this year.  Recall that President Trump announced recently that he would stop the CSR payments after a Federal court found them to be illegal because they had not been appropriated by Not surprisingly, the previous administration had continued making these payments, a practice that President Trump rightfully and correctly stopped after months of warning that he would do so. We applaud the President for returning this appropriations decision to its constitutional place--with  We also recognize that there are millions of Americans who will face steep premium increases come January as a result of this challenging decision. This is in addition to the already skyrocketing premium increases that Americans are facing because of ObamaCare, because of the concept on which it was built. The American people did not ask for ObamaCare, and they shouldn't be unfairly punished.  By extending these payments for only 2 years, our legislation will stabilize the market and help provide a smooth transition as we continue to work on a full repeal and replacement. Providing a smooth transition away from ObamaCare has been included in every serious Republican healthcare plan to date. We have to have a transition in order to move away from the existing healthcare plans. In fact, I cannot think of a single GOP colleague who doesn't support a smooth transition so that we don't hurt families as we move away from our current, unworkable system.  It is also important to point out that Alexander-Murray is merely a step one in the total repeal and replacement of Because of House and Senate rules, the 1332 waiver changes outlined in our bill are not eligible to be included in budget reconciliation legislation, which is the vehicle being used to repeal and replace ObamaCare by congressional Republicans and which we continue to work on. We need both bills. This is a two-step process.  We fully expect there to be an opportunity for us to finish the full repeal and replace of ObamaCare next year and are united in our desire to get it across the finish line. But 1332 waiver changes found in this bill require bipartisan support in the Senate, period. It requires 60 votes. That is not available to us or is not part of the remaining part of the challenge of the total repeal and replacement. We need both bills in order to get this done.  We have also included additional assurances within this bill to make certain our bill does not bail out insurance companies, as Senator Alexander stated earlier. CBO, or the Congressional Budget Office, confirmed this in the October report, noting that it benefits taxpayers and low-income policyholders, not insurance companies.  I also want to point out that there is also a fiscal case to be made for continuing the CSR payments in the short term. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--once again, the CBO--found that the Federal Government will be on the hook to subsidize care of the individuals who otherwise would receive premium assistance via the CSR payments.  The CSR payments have ended. Insurers who stay in the individual marketplace will be forced to raise their prices to compensate. Instead of costing $7 billion, as it did this year under the use of CSRs, the CBO estimates that the disruption caused by abruptly ending the CSRs will cost the Federal Government an average of $25 billion annually, more than four times the current rate.  The fact that ObamaCare is failing is not a partisan issue. Members of both parties have acknowledged that it is rapidly sinking. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe it is fixable. Republicans believe we have to go in a different direction. Democrats have refused to admit the failure. They recognize it is sinking--they think it is fixable--but, until now, have been unwilling to make any concessions to the law they were solely responsible for creating.  We must seize the opportunity to provide States with much needed relief from ObamaCare and show that States are far better at coming up with health insurance rules which are tailored to their individual needs. The only tradeoff is in fulfilling our promise to stabilize the individual market temporarily while we continue our work to repeal ObamaCare and replace it with a truly competitive market-based system. In the meantime, States will already be given that option under our plan.  Let me just share this. Sometimes when you look at a bipartisan piece of legislation, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will point to the fact that they want to stabilize the market now. Republicans will point to the fact that we need to stabilize the market and provide the opportunity for the full repeal and replacement to become effective. ObamaCare started in 2009. It was passed in 2009. Yet it took until 2014 for all of the impacts to actually begin to accumulate--5 years. To undo it, it will take time for the States to create their fixes.  We have to pass the legislation, and the HHS has to create the rules. Then, at the local level, at the State level, the State legislatures have to create the laws once again that were torn apart by ObamaCare in the first place. Then their divisions of insurance and their departments of health have to actually create the rules. The insurance companies that are out there that want to compete once again have to be able to contract with doctors and hospitals. They have to go on out and not only write the contracts that will comply with the law and the regulations, but then they also have to go on out and market that product to individuals.  The exchange from one contract under ObamaCare to a contract with a competitor, which is when insurance carriers can actually offer different types of products to group plans or to individuals, will take time. That transition can hardly be done in less than 2 years, thus the need and the offer in all of the Republican proposals to take this 2-year time period and actually help the American people get through this very difficult time without hurting them more than the pain they will have already felt with the continuation of It simply takes 2 years to make any reasonable transition happen.  Once again, I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr.Alexander, and the way in which he has created a team effect, a team plan, on getting this through. I also acknowledge the hard work of Senator Murray and her working side by side with Senator Alexander in trying to find common ground so her colleagues see the importance, from their perspectives, while, at the same time, those of us on this side of the aisle reflect on the first step in a long-term goal of the repeal and replacement of  For the first time, we have a chance. For the first time, we have an opportunity to take a step statutorily, with[[Page S7101]]a 60-count vote, in actually making changes to the substance of It is high time. It is time to get started. It is time to move forward.  I thank all of our colleagues for working side by side in at least slowing down the damage which has been occurring and which will continue to occur until we get the full replacement of ObamaCare behind us.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgS7098.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2201, MICRO OFFERING SAFE HARBOR",2017.0,8.0,November

48,topic-id,317,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, which undercuts Federal-Tribal treaty and trust obligations. In fact, parts of this bill specifically eliminate protection for Tribes and ensure that dams and other hydropower projects do not harm Tribal fisheries, livelihoods, or violate treaty rights.  This is unacceptable. Not only does this undermine Tribal sovereignty, but it flies in the face of our moral and legal obligation to protect Tribal treaties, land, and resources under the Federal trust responsibility.  I am especially disappointed that the majority had the opportunity to fix this issue, yet walked away from the table. Even though I brought this up as an issue to fix in committee, the majority rushed this bill through committee for a House vote without adequately addressing Tribal concerns.                              {time}  1430  Furthermore, the majority refused to make in order my amendment, meaning they denied the fix to empower Tribes to set reasonable conditions on hydropower projects to protect their reservation and resources. In fact, the letter sent by Democratic Ranking Member Pallone requesting a hearing to allow Tribal input and Tribal participation on this particular issue was left unanswered.  So I say this to those Republicans who do support Tribal sovereignty and self-determination: You can still fix this issue and improve the Federal hydropower licensing process, simultaneously, while still protecting Tribal treaty rights, by supporting the Rush substitute amendment.  Join the Democratic Rush amendment that includes language to empower Tribal governments to determine when a project may harm their Without this fix, this bill undermines Tribal governments and harms resources and lands, therefore, putting energy profits above Tribal treaty rights.  I urge my colleagues to take a stand. Do not ignore your responsibility to Tribes when it matters most. Support the Democratic substitute amendment sponsored by Representative Rush that preserves the responsibility of the Federal Government to honor treaty obligations and protect Tribal resources.

28,topic-id,592,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.  Mr.Chairman, while Members on both sides of the aisle support hydropower, unfortunately, the bill before us today is deeply flawed and will not modernize or improve the hydropower licensing process. Instead, Mr.Chairman, H.3043 would place private profits above the public interest by giving priority of our public waterways to industry in order to generate power and profits over and above the rights and the interests of Native Tribes or farmers or fishermen, boaters, and other stakeholders who also rely on these public rivers and streams.  Mr.Chairman, it is very important for us to remember that hydroelectric licenses can span between 30 and 50 years, and, under existing law, a license holder can be granted automatic yearly extensions in perpetuity without even having to reapply.  Mr.Chairman, this issue is far too important for us not to get it right this time. And what does H.3043 actually do?  This bill will make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, the lead agency over the licensing process and will require Native Tribes, the States, and other Federal resource agencies to pay deference to the Commission, even in areas where FERC has absolutely no expertise or statutory authority, including on issues regarding agricultural water use, drinking water protection, fisheries management, and recreational river use. How absurd, Mr. Additionally, Mr.Chairman, H.3043 would expand and alter the trial-type hearing provisions on the Federal Power Act, essentially rigging the process in favor of industry by providing multiple new entry points to challenge conditions designed by Federal resource agencies.  Mr.Chairman, the threat of these timely and costly hearings may be used to coerce agencies to propose weaker conditions, and, at the same time, this bill also shifts the venue for these hearings to FERC, which is another very obvious handout and handover to industry.  Mr.Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee, we heard, repeatedly, that a major[[Page H8616]]cause for licensing delays was due to incomplete applications that do not include all the pertinent information that is necessary to issue a decision.  Mr.Chairman, H.3043 does nothing, absolutely nothing, to address this very, very serious issue. In fact, this bill will implement strict timelines on Federal resource agencies, States, and Tribes, but does not require applicants to submit all of their information to these agencies before the clock actually starts ticking.  Mr.Chairman, FERC, itself, the very agency that will be charged with implementing this grossly bad bill, FERC, itself, disputed claims that this bill would streamline the licensing process, noting that the legislation ``could increase the complexity and the length of the licensing process.'' These are FERC's words, FERC's words before the committee.  Mr.Chairman, we cannot allow hydropower facilities to claim a monopoly over our public waterways without mitigating the negative impacts of these facilities on others who rely on these resources and without, at the same time, without complying with modern environmental laws.  H.3043, Mr.Chairman, is opposed by States, opposed by the Native Tribes, opposed by the outdoor recreation industry and by more than 150 national and local environmental organizations.  Mr.Chairman, it is for all of these reasons that I, too, stand in concert and side by side with Native Tribes, the outdoor recreation industry, and the other 150 national and local environmental organizations. It is for these reasons that I, too, must oppose this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We      greatly appreciate the concerns of these members and the      amount of time they spent discussing tribes and dam      relicensing. I think many of them were aware of the degree to      which the placement of dams has negatively affected a number      of reservations, flooding some and damaging salmon runs at      others. While there was universal agreement that the rights      of tribes and states must be protected, there was not      agreement on whether HR 3043 accomplishes that laudable      intent. I must tell you that the bill does not do so.       First understand what the Federal Power Act (FPA) now says.       Under provisions that have been in effect for decades,      state governments, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, are able      to set water quality standards at hydro dams. Such conditions      are mandatory. Allowing states to establish water quality      standards, a key aspect of Federalism that many in Congress      have always fought for, was a lynchpin of the grand bargain      reached when the Clean Water Act became law. While Federalism      has not really benefitted Indian tribes, we are surprised      that the Congress would weaken the ability of states to      protect the public in this fashion. We hope you will read      what many states have said in letters to the Committee, i.e.,      HR 3043 weakens their ability to ensure their standards are      met during the licensing process. Letters of this nature have      come from entities as varied as the Western Governors      Association and the Southern States Energy       Also under the longstanding language of Section 4(e) of the      FPA, Cabinet Secretaries with authority over ``federal      reservations'' are directed to ensure that a proposed hydro      project doesn't negatively affect a reservation or interfere      with its congressionally designated use. These include all      lands and marine reserves in the Federal estate from Indian      reservations, to National Forests to Wildlife      Section 18 of the FPA deals with the establishment or      modification of fishways to ensure fish can pass over these      dams. The Secretaries of Commerce (for NMFS) and Interior      (for USFWS) deal with fish passage and the Secretaries of      Interior (for BIA, BLM, USFWS and NPS) and Agriculture (for      USFS) deal with protecting federal reservations. They have      the authority to propose mandatory conditions on hydro dams      to ensure their operation protects these federal resources      that belong to all       The legislation weakens the conditioning authority for      protecting state water quality, for fishways and for federal      reservations by transferring significant decision-making      authority to Under the bill, FERC and the license      applicant can challenge the necessity of a condition and have      that challenge heard via a trial-type hearing only at FERC      before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at that agency.      Under present law, decisions such as these are heard by ALJs      in the agency making the recommendation, where the expertise      resides. This provision in the bill is legislating forum      shopping and directing that the decision be made before an      entity whose expertise is in areas such as energy markets and      safety at power plants. FERC and its ALJs have no expertise      relative to Indian treaty rights or the Federal Land Policy      and Management Act among many bedrock laws and FERC testified      before the Committee that they do not want to be given this      newfound authority. While having trial-type hearings at FERC      and authorizing FERC to set all manner of schedules in the      permitting process will certainly create countless billable      hours for attorneys representing license applicants, it will      do nothing to protect the interest of Indian tribes or the      public at large, and as stated above, is directly contrary to      state authority under the Clean Water Act and Secretarial      authority now found in the Federal Power       Yesterday we heard that this process will expedite      licensing but if that is the goal then wouldn't it make sense      to determine when an application for a license is complete?      Tribes repeatedly asked the hydropower industry to clarify      that matter in the bill but they refused. Why? Existing      hydropower dam licenses were issued decades ago before any      environmental statutes were on the books and many of those      dams are fish killers. Under the present law, when a license      expires the operator can automatically get annual extensions      allowing it to operate under 30-50 year old standards. These      extensions can go on for year after year with the operator      not having to spend any money to mitigate the damage to fish      or other resources. This is more than ironic considering that      the hydropower industry is telling Congress that they need      the legislation to ensure certainty and time frames in the      relicensing process. Additionally, the bill is drafted in      such a fashion that FERC can set schedules that are so      abbreviated that Tribes, Cabinet Secretaries or States who      wish to comment and perhaps undertake a fishery study when      necessary may not have the time to properly prepare suggested      or mandatory operating conditions. It is noteworthy that FERC      told the Committee that they don't see the legislation      actually streamlining the application process. Also, we      checked today and could find no tribes in support of this      bill.[[Page H8622]]       We believe the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute      (AINS) incorporates much of what the majority proposed in HR      3043 while incorporating many changes that are reflective of      the input that the Committee received from states and tribes      who took the time to relay views and concerns to the      A key part is the requirement for a negotiated      rule-making to improve and expedite the hydro licensing      process by bringing in states, local governments,      stakeholders and tribes to FERC to develop a process that      will enable FERC to make decisions on license applications      within a maximum of three years.

First, the bill would give FERC, an agency with no relevant      experience or capacity, the responsibility for determining      the scope of environmental review that Interior, Commerce,      States and even Tribes should undertake.       Second, H.3043 would upset the careful balance that now      exists under federal law and let FERC set the timeline on      case-by-case basis for agencies to impose mandatory 4(e)      conditions and other requirements, including Section 18      (fishways) and Clean Water Act permits. The consideration of      hydropower licenses is a complicated process that must      consider the impact of a project on watersheds and numerous      species of fish and wildlife before giving operators 50-year      licenses to take power from these ecosystems. It takes time      to do the necessary studies to determine what types of      conditions can best protect these watersheds, including      sensitive fisheries habitat, and the resources not only for      Treaty-reserved Indian Reservations and resources, but also      for the multiple users of these watersheds, including      recreation, commercial fishing, and agriculture. If FERC's      past actions are any guidance, FERC will impose unrealistic      deadlines that the agencies will not meet. This bill will      return the Nation back to a time when hydropower projects      flooded Indian lands, extirpated entire species of salmon,      and destroyed critical cultural resources.       Third, this bill would allow FERC for the first time to      make a determination that a mandatory condition is      inconsistent with the Federal Power This would undermine      the Supreme Court's decision in Escondido Water v.      La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.765 (1984), which      held that the FPA provides no authority to FERC to impose      restrictions on the 4(e) conditions submitted by the      Secretary of The current process affords the      hydropower industry ample opportunity to consider and respond      to potential Sections 4(e), 18, and Clean Water Act      conditions. Hydropower licensees can (and in fact do)      actively participate in the process by which these conditions      are deliberated and set. And while these conditions are not      subject to modification by FERC, they are subject to judicial      review, and FERC is free to express its disagreement with the      conditions, so that FERC's views can also be considered by      the courts.       Finally, the bill requires the Agency imposing these      conditions to prepare a written statement that the Agency      gave equal consideration to power generating interests in      issuing its 4(e) conditions. Currently, if a hydroelectric      project is located on federal lands, including Indian      Reservations, the only consideration the Secretary has is to      impose conditions that protect those reservations. There is      no consideration of other interests. This has been the law      for almost ninety years.       We urge you to continue to work with Tribes and other      stakeholders to improve the hydropower licensing process for      all interests and not simply for the industry.           Sincerely,                                                  Bill Sterud,                                                         Chairman,     Puyallup Tribal                                  ____                                             Snoqualmie Tribe,                                                    June 21, 2017.     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     Washington,     Frank Pallone, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,                Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf      of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, we write to express our      continued concerns regarding proposed changes to the federal      hydropower licensing approval process. The proposed changes      would abrogate the federal government's overarching trust      responsibility to Indian tribes and its ability to uphold      tribal treaty rights. Our Tribe is particularly concerned      that current legislative reform efforts to consolidate      hydropower approval authority within the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission (FERC) unduly favor the interests of      private industry at the expense of tribes, local and state      governments, natural resources, and local citizens. As our      trustee, we urge you to ensure that any hydropower      legislation passed out of the Committee will only strengthen      Tribes' ability to give input on hydropower licensing      decisions at hydropower facilities.       The Snoqualmie Tribe is adamantly opposed to legislative      reforms efforts that seek to undermine current mechanisms      that ensure adequate consideration of the effects of a      proposed hydropower project on affected Indian lands and      natural resources. In particular, the proposed changes to      4(e) and 18 of the Federal Power Act and 401      of the Clean Water Act would enable FERC to disregard      mandatory conditions imposed by federal and state land      management agencies. Disregarding the established expertise      and mission of such agencies to evaluate and mitigate impacts      to Indian lands and natural resources directly undermines the      federal government's ability to fulfill its trust and treaty      obligations to Indian tribes. For example, 34 and      37 of the draft legislation would allow FERC to effectively      waive conditions necessary to implement the Northwest Power      Act, Endangered Species Act, or the Clean Water Act if a      state, tribe, or federal agency cannot meet a FERC deadline.      Additionally, the proposed schedule of 120 days to complete      all ``federal authorizations'' is unworkable in practice and      will inevitably lead to such waivers.       It is imperative that any legislative reforms to the      hydropower permitting process adequately consider and      mitigate the impacts to Indian lands, Tribal sacred sites,      and natural resources. Historically, American Indian tribes      have experienced disproportionate negative effects when dams,      including hydroelectric projects, were approved without      adequate tribal consultation or consideration of the effects      on surrounding natural resources. For example, in the past,      hydropower dams have flooded Indian reservations resulting in      the permanent loss or damage to Tribal lands and sacred      sites.       Given the Snoqualmie Tribe is a signatory to the Treaty of      Point Elliot of 1855, the federal government has an      enforceable fiduciary obligation to act as trustee on the      Tribe's behalf. Of critical significance to our people is      Snoqualmie Falls, a 268-foot waterfall that is the place of      our creation history and our most sacred site. The Falls are      an essential part of our cultural and religious practices      where we pray, conduct sacred ceremonies, and traditionally      buried our dead. Our Tribe is all too familiar with the      negative impacts of inadequately planned hydroelectric dams      on our culture, lands, and very way of life. For more than      100 years, Snoqualmie Falls has been hampered by the      diversion of its water for a hydroelectric dam that      significantly reduces the strong flow of water and the mists      coming from the Without these, our religious practices      are severely limited and we cannot fully engage in our      cultural heritage.       The current draft hydropower reform legislation does not      appropriately balance various stakeholders' interests and,      instead, prioritizes private industry interests above the      federal governments' responsibility as trustee to      Accordingly, we urge the Committee to ensure that legislation      passed out of the Committee strengthens Tribes' ability to      give input on hydropower decisions.       Thank you for your consideration on this very important      religious and cultural issue to our We look forward to      working with the Committee to ensure any hydropower reform      efforts are suitably tailored to uphold the federal      government's trust responsibility to Indian peoples and      protect tribal treaty rights.           Sincerely,     Snoqualmie Tribal                                  ____                                       Skokomish Indian Tribe,                              Skokomish Nation, WA, June 21, 2017.     Re Proposed Amendments to the Federal Power     Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone, Jr.,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone: I write to      again express the Skokomish Tribe's strong objections to the      amendments to the Federal Power Act that are now being      considered by the House Energy and Commerce       If this bill is enacted as approved by the Committee, it      would represent one of the most significant roll backs of the      federal trust responsibility since termination. For more than      ninety years the Federal Power Act directed Interior and      other land management agencies to impose conditions on      hydroelectric projects to protect federal lands including      federal Indian Reservations and Treaty protected resources.      However, in the first forty years, the federal land      management agencies largely ignored this responsibility. As a      consequence of this abdication to the Skokomish Tribe, our      Reservation and our resources paid a very high price.[[Page H8623]]       Our story is but one of many across Indian country. In the      1920s Tacoma City and Light received a license for the      Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish The      entire flow of the North Fork of the Skokomish River was      diverted from its channel and sent to a power house on Hood      Canal (a bay of the Puget Sound). The dewatering of the North      Fork completely destroyed a premier salmon run, with grievous      economic and cultural consequences for the See      generally, City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 62 (D.     2006); Skokomish Indian Tribe v. United States, 410 F.3d 506,      509-510 (9th 2005) (en banc revised). In terms of direct      impact on the Skokomish Reservation itself, the dewatering of      the North Fork resulted in an approximately 40% reduction in      the flow of the Skokomish River mainstem. This change in the      hydrology of the Skokomish River caused one-third of the      Reservation to be flooded. Skokomish v. United States, 410      F.3d at 509-510, see also id. at 521 (dissenting opinion of      Judge Graber). In short, this project almost completely      destroyed the Reservation and the fishery for which the      Reservation was established.       The original Cushman Dam license expired in 1974 and the      Skokomish Tribe spent significant time, energy and resources      to ensure that the United States would not once again      abdicate its responsibility to the Tribe and sought      conditions on the new license that would protect the      Skokomish At every turn Tacoma and the      hydropower industry fought the However, in 2006, the      Skokomish Tribe won the right for the Department of the      Interior to exercise its Federal Power Act 4(e) conditioning      authority to protect the Reservation and the City of      Tacoma, Washington v. F.E.R.C., 460 F.3d 53, 59 (D.     2006) (``Cushman'')       As a result of this decision, the Cushman project is now      being operated in a manner meant to reverse the more than 80      years of damage to the Skokomish These changes      are slow but, over time, there will be improvements to the      flow of the mainstem and flooding will lessen. Reservation      lands that are waterlogged and useless will be restored and      productive for the Tribe and our members again.       The bill now before the Committee would essentially reverse      the decision that my Tribe fought so hard for, and will let      FERC set the timeline for 4(e) mandatory conditions and other      conditions, including Section 18 (fishways) and Clean Water      Act The bill goes on to require the agency to      imposing these conditions to give equal weight to power      generating interests. Again, this would significantly      undermine the federal trust responsibility to my tribe and      others. If a hydroelectric project is located on Tribal      lands, then the only consideration the Secretary has is to      impose conditions that protect that There is no      balance of other interests. This has been the law for almost      ninety years. The Tribe is at a loss for why Congress would      want to change this now.       Furthermore, the bill before the Committee seeks to have      FERC, an agency with no experience or capacity, the      responsibility for determining the scope of environmental      review that Interior, Commerce, States and even Tribes should      take.       A change to the Federal Power Act is not needed. First,      sections 4(e), 18 and the other related provisions of the      Federal Power Act, establish proper checks and balances in      the licensing process. While FERC is examining a broad range      of issues in connection with the license application or      renewal, the Interior Secretary can bring to bear Interior's      knowledge and expertise regarding the needs of Indian      country, the potential impact of the project on the Indian      reservation, and address measures to ensure the proper      protection of that reservation. Other sections of the Act      likewise establish appropriate checks and balances by      recognizing and giving effect to the responsibilities and      expertise that such other agencies have on natural resource      management--such as that provided by Interior's Fish &      Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce on fisheries      and fish passage facilities as well as the vital and      longstanding authority exercised by States and Tribes in      setting water quality standards under the Clean Water      While hydropower is clean energy, it is clean only because of      the important role that these other agencies, with the      necessary expertise, have in addressing terms and conditions      for hydropower licenses. FERC does not have the technical      capacity to make these decisions.       The current process affords the hydropower industry ample      opportunity to consider and respond to potential Section      4(e), 18 and Clean Water Act conditions. Hydropower licenses      can (and in fact do) actively participate in the process by      which these conditions are deliberated and set. And while      these conditions are not subject to modification by FERC,      they are subject to judicial review, and FERC is free to      express its disagreement with the conditions, so that FERC's      views can also be considered by the courts.       Finally, while the current process may take time to      complete necessary studies and vetting of potential      conditions, any delay in renewing licenses does not harm the      hydropower licensees. As a general matter, until the license      renewal process is completed, hydropower licenses are able to      operate under their existing licenses which, in our      experience, typically do not have many of the conditions      needed to protect Indian reservations or natural resources.       We urge you to oppose amendments to the Federal Power Act      that would undermine the federal trust responsibility to      protect Indian Reservations or that would alter the Interior      Secretary's authority under section 4(e), the provisions of      section 18, or the Clean Water           Sincerely,     Charles ``Guy''                                  ____                 National Congress of American Indians  The National Congress of American Indians Resolution MKE-17-005 title: to oppose proposed hydropower amendments to the federal power                                   act       Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of      American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine      blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in      order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the      inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights      secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United      States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are      entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States      and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of      Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better      understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian      cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and      welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit      the following resolution; and       Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)      was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest      national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native      tribal governments; and       Whereas, Indian Tribes are sovereigns that pre-date the      United States, with prior and treaty protected rights to      self-government and to our Indian and Alaska Native lands;      and       Whereas, the conservation and preservation of tribal land      and resources is a priority for all tribes and a critical      component of the federal trust responsibility; and       Whereas, fish are a sacred resource for many tribes; and       Whereas, the production of electricity through hydropower      dams includes impacts to water quality, waterways, wildlife,      recreation, livelihoods, customary and traditional      activities, and treaty resources within and outside Indian      and Alaska Native lands; and       Whereas, the impacts of hydropower projects located on      federal lands often extend far beyond the confines of the      specific lands on which the projects are sited; and       Whereas, some members of Congress and representatives from      the hydropower industry have proposed amendments to the      Federal Power Act that would (a) weaken the current      protections Indian tribes have through the Mandatory      Conditions requirements under Section 4(e) and Section 18 of      that Act, (b) roll back efforts to restore fish populations      through the requirement of fishways, and (c) unnecessarily      limit the available time and scientific information available      to federal agencies in deciding what Mandatory Conditions      should be included with a license; and       Whereas, these proposed amendments to the Federal Power Act      would not improve the federal hydropower licensing process,      which is an important source of protections for tribal lands      and resources, but rather weaken these critical protections.      Now therefore be it       Resolved, that the National Congress of American Indians      (NCAI), its leadership, and its executive staff shall call on      the U.Congress and the Administration to oppose all      proposed amendments to the hydropower provisions in the      Federal Power Act that would remove or lessen the protections      currently afforded tribal governments, tribal lands, inherent      reserved rights, treaty rights and other tribal resources      under the Federal Power Act; and be it further       Resolved, that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI      until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.                             certification       The foregoing resolution was adopted by the General      Assembly at the 2017 Annual Session of the National Congress      of American Indians, held at the Wisconsin Center in      Milwaukee, WI, Oct 15, 2017-Oct 20, 2017, with a quorum      present.

61,topic-id,323,"Mr.Chair, the substitute amendment that we will consider shortly provides Indian Tribes with authority to speak for themselves with respect to the hydropower licensing process.  Currently, Mr.Chair, the agencies of the Departments of the Interior and Commerce proposed conditions to protect Tribal reservations.

As sovereign entities, Tribes have a status different from that of States and Federal agencies. They should be negotiating on their own behalf to protect their own interests.[[Page H8624]]  Mr.Chair, hydropower projects, a number of which were designed and built over the objections of Tribes, resulted in devastating losses of Tribal lands and fisheries.  We can and must do better. Hydropower projects can be designed, upgraded, and operated in ways that lower the environmental costs and preserve other important uses of the river.  Current law and current regulations already provide for consultation with In fact, under the integrated license process, applicants are required to consult with Tribes 5 years before the current license expires if they plan to seek a renewed license.  The integrated license process was designed specifically for the more complex, controversial hydropower projects, either new projects or relicensing of existing projects.  Mr.Chair, many applicants, however, request and are allowed to pursue their license under the traditional license process that includes less opportunity for consultation. FERC should be denying some of these requests, but each and every one of them are granted by  When this happens, controversial projects run into predictable problems that bog down the license process. This is an administrative change that FERC could make that would require no new legislation and would improve the license process.  Mr.Chair, this bill does nothing--absolutely nothing--to speed up this problem or fix the process that we have been discussing.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

64,topic-id,3068,"Mr.Chair, I include in the Record letters from: Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, California State Water Resources Control Board, Western Governors' Association, State of Washington Department of Ecology, Environmental Council of the States, and Association of State Wetland                                                 State of Vermont,                                  Agency of Natural Resources,                               Montpelier, VT, September 12, 2017.     Re Comments in Opposition to Hydropower Policy Modernization          Act of 2017, H.3043.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The Vermont      Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR) would like to express      strong concerns over the proposed Hydropower Policy      Modernization Act of 2017, H.3043. While VTANR supports      efforts to improve and streamline current hydroelectric      licensing processes, the Agency strongly opposes legislative      efforts to diminish States' ability to protect water quality.      Several provisions of H.3043 would essential curtail the      State authority under Section 401 of the[[Page H8625]]     federal Clean Water Act, effectively constraining State      agencies' ability to use their independent authority to set      license conditions, making it more difficult to protect      natural resources.       VTANR strenuously opposes provisions of H.3043 that      eliminate or reduce States' delegated authority under Section      401 of the federal Clean Water Act to develop mandatory      licensing conditions protective of natural resources. State      agencies serve an essential role in the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing process for      hydroelectric facilities. H.3043 would designate FERC as      the lead agency over federal authorizations related to      applications of hydroelectric projects for a license, license      amendment, or exemptions. As the lead agency, FERC would      establish and control the timeline for licensing review and      process for hydroelectric projects. H.3043 appears to give      FERC the authority to create a schedule reducing the time a      State would have to get necessary scientific studies      completed and reviewed to determine specific conditions      needed to protect water quality, as required under Section      401 of the federal Clean Water This would effectively      permit FERC to license a facility before a thorough review of      the environmental impacts could be completed. Vermont uses      its Section 401 authority to issue water quality      certifications with conditions to ensure projects are built      and operated in a manner consistent with State environmental      laws and protective of the environment and public health.       In addition, a provision of H.3043 provides applicants      with an opportunity to a trial-type hearing before a FERC      Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of      material fact. Under the provisions of H.3043, the      decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge would be final      and not subject to further administrative review. Currently,      conditions included in a Section 401 water quality      certification become mandatory license conditions and cannot      be altered or modified by Further matters of material      facts related to Section 401 water quality certifications for      hydroelectric facilities are heard at the State level by      courts or boards that are familiar with a State's water      quality standards and other environmental laws. The allowance      for the trial-type hearing before FERC could undermine the      States' authority granted under Section 401, making it more      challenging to protect water quality and natural resources.       Through decades of decisions, federal courts have affirmed      the authority of States to impose conditions in federal      licenses issued to hydroelectric projects under Section 401      of the Clean Water These decisions recognize that States      have the primary responsibility to ensure State water quality      standards and other environmental laws are met. H.3043      would undermine this authority by including a provision that      would allow FERC to seek resolution between it and States at      the federal level, elevating the dispute to the secretary      overseeing the federal statute. In the case of the federal      Clean Water Act, H.3043 appears to allow FERC to negotiate      with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      or Secretary of Army, who are responsible for Clean Water Act      on the federal level, to settle a dispute with between it and      a state, effectively cutting States out of the process.       Vermont's interest in protecting natural resources is as      important and relevant today as ever, particularly because a      large number of hydroelectric facilities in Vermont are      slated to begin the federal relicensing process over the next      five years. FERC issues licenses to hydroelectric projects      for a term of 30 to 50 years. As such, many of the projects      scheduled for relicensing will likely need significant      changes in operations to meet modern water quality standards      and to restore State water resources from impacts of project      operations. As drafted, H.3043 would reduce VTANR      delegated authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean      Water Act, creating ways for project operators to circumvent      state regulations during the licensing process to allow them      to operate in a manner that would continue to degrade the      environment and resources of the       VTANR recognizes the importance of hydroelectric generation      in meeting renewable energy goals. We urge you to consider      how the federal process can be improved without undermining      the very checks and balances that have helped hydroelectric      generation be viewed as a sustainable and renewable energy      source.       We appreciate your consideration of these comments on H.     3043 and look forward to solutions that improve our energy      security and infrastructure while protecting the environment.           Sincerely,                                             Julia Moore, P.E.,                                      ____                                                  California State                                Water Resources Control Board,                                     Sacramento, CA, May 17, 2017.     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone:   comments in opposition to provisions of house of representatives discussion drafts: (1) hydropower policy modernization act of 2017; (2) promoting closed-loop pumped storage hydropower act; and (3) promoting         hydropower development at existing non-powered dams act       The California State Water Resources Control Board (State      Water Board) would like to express its concerns with the      following House of Representatives Legislative Discussion      Drafts: (1) Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017; (2)      Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act; and (3)      Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Non-Powered Dams      Act (collectively Hydropower Discussion Drafts). While the      State Water Board supports the goals of energy infrastructure      modernization, it opposes several provisions as drafted      because the Hydropower Discussion Drafts would reduce or      eliminate essential protections for California's natural      resources.       The Hydropower Discussion Drafts would seriously impact the      mandatory conditioning authority of the State Water Board      under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, as well as similar      authorities of federal agencies. State and federal agencies      serve an essential role in the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission's (Commission) hydropower licensing process. The      Hydropower Discussion Drafts designate the Commission as the      sole lead agency over federal authorizations related to an      application for a license, license amendment, or exemption      for a hydropower project. As the sole lead agency, the      Commission would establish and control the timeline for the      hydropower licensing process for all aspects of federal      authorization, including Section 401 of the Clean Water      As such, the Commission could limit the State Water Board and      federal agencies' time to complete their respective actions      which could adversely impact the agencies' ability to comply      with necessary state and federal laws and may negatively      impact public and environmental health.       As noted in this letter, the State Water Board is      particularly concerned about provisions of the Hydropower      Discussion Drafts that would undermine states' authorities      under Section 401 of the Clean Water As former Chief      Justice Rehnquist observed, there has been a ``consistent      thread of purposeful and continued deference to state water      law by Congress.'' (California v. U.(1978) 438 U.645,      653.) This ``cooperative federalism'' is epitomized by      Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which authorizes states      to set conditions to protect the waters of their states, and      provides that review of conditions of certification is in      state court, not by federal agencies. In so doing, Section      401 preserves both state authority and the integrity of state      procedures and state institutions in overseeing how state      agencies exercise that authority. Consistent with Congress'      usual respect for state rights in this area, this structure      must be preserved. The Hydropower Discussion Drafts      inappropriately place limitations on state rights in this      area by placing Section 401 of the Clean Water Act in the      definition of Federal Authorization and under the      Commission's jurisdiction.       The State Water Board recognizes the importance of      hydropower as a clean energy source that helps provide grid      reliability and supports the goal of promoting efficiencies      in the Commission's licensing of hydropower projects. To      promote such efficiencies, in 2013, the State Water Board      entered into a memorandum of understanding with the      Commission to coordinate pre-application procedures and      schedules between the two agencies. Since implementation, the      memorandum of understanding has improved coordination between      the State Water Board and the Commission, and is beginning to      streamline portions of the licensing process. The State Water      Board acknowledges that it has a pending backlog of water      quality certification applications, due in part to      California's recent drought, and we are committed to acting      upon these applications as expeditiously as possible. The      State Water Board opposes provisions of the Hydropower      Discussion Drafts because they may result in harm to      California's water quality and associated beneficial uses,      public lands, and fish and wildlife by removing key state and      federal authorities designed to protect the environment and      the public enjoyment of the environment. Specific comments      and concerns are provided in Attachment Key provisions of      the Hydropower Discussion Drafts are provided in Attachment B      for ease of reference in reviewing the State Water Board's      comments.       I appreciate your consideration of these comments and look      forward to solutions that improve our energy security and      infrastructure while protecting the environment.           Sincerely,                                                   Felicia Marcus,                                      ____                               Western Governors' Association,                                                      May 1, 2017.     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: Western      Governors recognize the importance of renewable energy      sources, including hydropower, as critical components of an      all-of-the-above national energy portfolio. The West accounts      for nearly 70 percent of the nation's hydroelectric power      generation, and the Pacific[[Page H8626]]     Northwest is the nation's largest hydropower-producing region      Western Governors support improving the efficiency of      existing hydropower systems and increasing the amount of      electricity generated from new, retrofitted, or relicensed      hydroelectric facilities.       States are vested with primary authority to manage water      within their borders, and they have the authority to develop,      use, control and distribute water resources within their      boundaries. As expressed in section B(1)(a) of WGA Policy      Resolution 2015-08, Water Resource Management in the       ``While the Western Governors acknowledge the important      role of federal laws such as the Clean Water Act, the      Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act,      nothing in any act of Congress or Executive Branch regulatory      action should be construed as affecting or intending to      affect states' primacy over the allocation and administration      of their water resources.''       Western Governors are concerned about provisions in Section      34, ``Hydropower Licensing and Process Improvement'' of the      proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.      Portions of the language included in the published discussion      draft of this proposal are identical to language of Subtitle      B, ``Hydropower Regulatory Modernization'' of the proposed      North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015      (H.8).       On July 18, 2016, Governor Steve Bullock and Governor      Dennis Daugaard provided correspondence (attached) to the      Committee, expressing the Western Governors' concerns over      the language included in Subtitle B of H.8, which would      have designated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      (FERC) as lead agency fol all hydropower authorizations,      approvals, and requirements mandated by federal law,      including hydropower facility licenses and amendments, as      well as all permits, special use authorizations,      certifications, and opinions. The Governors requested that      this language be removed or amended so that existing state      hydropower licensing authorities are not replaced, or in any      way impeded, by FERC jurisdiction.       Western Governors request that the language in Section 34      of the proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017      be removed or amended so that states' existing hydropower      licensing authorities are in no way usurped by FERC      jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this important      matter.           Sincerely,                                                 James Ogsbury,     Executive                                  ____                                              State of Washington,                                        Department of Ecology,                                    Olympia, WA, November 3, 2017.     Re Hydropower Regulatory Modernization Act of 2017.     Frank Pallone, Jr.,     House of Representatives, Washington,     Greg Walden,     House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: I am      writing to express my concerns with the Hydropower Regulatory      Modernization Act of 2017, H.3043, which would amend the      Federal Power Act to modify certain requirements. The      Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) supports the      ostensible intent of this bill to gain efficiency in the      licensing of hydropower projects. In addition, we support the      goal of improving the certainty and timeliness of the      hydropower licensing process. However, provisions in H.     3043 that modify the authorities of the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission (FERC) would impede or invalidate      states' independent authority provided by Section 401 of the      Clean Water Act (CWA 401) to establish license      conditions that protect water quality.       Our residents and tribes harvest salmon from the Puget      Sound up through the Columbia River, and our farmers grow      hops in the Yakima River basin. They also depend on water as      a source of energy to power their homes and communities, and      our industries rely on abundant and consistent energy to      build aircraft in Everett, power data server farms in Quincy,      manufacture car bodies for electric vehicles in Moses Lake,      and process apples along the Wenatchee River basin. Balancing      the need for clean energy with the need for safe water      supplies begins with the proper management of water as a      resource, and it is one of the major focal points of this      legislation.       Decades of federal court decisions interpreting CWA      401 have established the states' authority to require      conditions in FERC licenses that are necessary to protect      water quality. These decisions recognize and affirm the basic      principle of federalism embodied in the CWA that states have      a primary role and responsibility to ensure state water      quality standards are met.       Ecology implements the state's Water Pollution Control Act      (RCW 90.48). As the state water pollution control agency, we      are responsible for implementing federal water pollution      control laws and regulations, including state water quality      certifications required by CWA 401 for any federal      permit or license that result in a discharge to state waters.      Ecology has developed durable partnerships with the      hydropower industry in Washington State--the largest of any      state in the nation--and has a successful record of      accomplishment in expediting water quality certifications      that are incorporated as FERC license conditions.       In an effort to improve H.3043, my team worked for      several weeks with two members of the National Hydropower      Association along with staff at the Chelan County Public      Utility District in Washington Our objective in these      discussions was to maintain the intent of this legislation      while also protecting states' authority provided in the CWA      401. Although the group did not reach full consensus,      significant progress was made to put forth alternative      language that would remove ambiguity regarding FERC and state      authority. My team identified a number of changes in language      that are necessary to protect independent state authority to      condition and certify FERC licenses. If provided more time,      and engagement directly with your committee, I am confident      that all parties can reach a mutually-satisfactory policy.       Ecology appreciates Congress' effort to streamline the FERC      licensing process, however, the addition of 34(b)(2)      OTHER AGENCIES AND INDIAN TRIBES, would require states' water      quality certification process to follow a schedule under the      requirements of the FERC, rather than the schedule in CWA      401. The timelines and independent state authorities      granted by CWA 401 must remain intact, as both are      essential for states to issue water quality certifications.      States must also retain the ability to practice a ``withdraw      and reapply'' process that has proven necessary for some      complex hydropower licenses. If FERC is provided authority to      oversee and set a timeline different than that provided under      CWA 401, it undermines states' ability to ensure      effectiveness and certainty for protection of water quality.       Meanwhile, 34. HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS      IMPROVEMENTS (b) designates FERC as the lead agency for      federal authorizations related to a license application,      license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower license.      H.3043 34. HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS      IMPROVEMENTS (d) also requires states to adhere to deadlines      established by FERC, effectively reducing the amount of time      a state would have to complete scientific studies necessary      to determine whether water quality standards and requirements      would be met in accordance with CWA 401. This will      likely create pressure on states to utilize existing      information (SEC 3 (b)) rather than new studies to make these      determinations.       In Washington State, work thus far to provide CWA 401      certifications for licensing of hydropower facilities have      been timely, responsive, efficient, and protective of the      state's water quality. While additional work remains, durable      partnerships and a strong track record form a solid      foundation to build upon.       In summary, Ecology opposes this bill in its current form      because:       FERC will have undue influence on the ability of states and      tribes to obtain environmental data and information via      studies that are necessary to write CWA 401      certifications to protect waters in their jurisdiction.       It would lock state and federal natural resource agencies      into a no-win situation. Agencies will be forced to make      regulatory decisions based on incomplete applications that      lack the necessary technical information, which would put      agencies at risk of missing new FERC deadlines resulting in      litigation.       We believe this bill provides enough ambiguity for      individuals to attempt to preempt state CWA 401      authority. The bill as written could result in legal      challenges and protracted litigation on how the extension of      FERC's authority conflicts with states' rights to protect      water quality and quantity.       Finally, Ecology views many elements of this modernization      bill as unnecessary. In July 2005, FERC restructured its      process and implementing the Integrated Licensing Process      (ILP) that effectively streamlined FERC's licensing process.      Over the course of 12 years, Washington State has provided      water quality certifications for 16 FERC issued licenses as      well as 10 license amendments. The ILP has proven to be a      predictable, efficient, and timely licensing process that      continues to ensure adequate resource protections. This bill      would eliminate the flexibility available in the current      system and return to a traditional approach that is less      responsive to environmental concerns and more susceptible to      litigation.       We urge that the provisions of H.3043 that would have      the effect of curtailing state authority under CWA 401      be significantly improved or stricken from the bill.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you to      oppose H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization      This bill is a devastating assault on our nation's rivers and      the people and wildlife that depend upon them. Its passage      would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing,      tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge      utilities.       Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many      hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now      were first constructed before virtually all modern      environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing      proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure      that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with      modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to      the environment, while still providing reliable electricity,      only arises once in a generation or two.       The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between      power and non-power values has existed for almost a century.      Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers,      a right which can and should be compatible with responsible      electricity production. However, H.3043 upends that      balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to      special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the      fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.     3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the      line, ahead of every other user.       We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and      Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation      interests who raised serious concerns about its many      provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee[[Page H8628]]     chose to make no changes to reflect the constructive      suggestions that the Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward      that would improve the licensing process while maintaining      environmental protections. The Committee also failed to      solicit testimony from states, tribes, and federal natural      resource agencies whose authorities will be usurped by the      Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.3043 is      enacted. You are now being asked to vote on a bill that no      state, tribe, or conservation organization publicly supports.      The bill under consideration today will only benefit power      companies at the expense of every other user of a waterway.       H.3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing      process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an      aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state      agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process.      There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide      the agencies with the information they deem necessary to      quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or      Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic      where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly,      agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either      exercise their authority without necessary information (which      exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the      schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and      tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush      decision making, potentially making it more difficult to      protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered      species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.       Other provisions of H.3043, such as the changes to the      Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the      requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct      costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside      of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the      requirement that scientific decisions be made only by      political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of      how H.3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of      power companies.       In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal      treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing,      commercial fishing, whitewater boating, water quality,      municipal water supply, fire safety, flood control, or any      other purpose other than generating power, we urge you to      vote NO on H.3043.

Dear Representative: The National Wildlife Federation, with      over 6 million members and supporters and its affiliate      organizations from 51 states and territories across the      country, represents a broad diversity of political views,      mirroring the nation. Regardless of party affiliation, these      members want their families to be safe, their water to be      clean, and ecosystems to be healthy in order to support our      nation's wildlife. It is important, then, that any large-     scale energy project, including hydroelectric, uphold those      values as well. While NWF believes that the United States      should pursue a renewable energy future, the country should      do so while seeking to minimize harm to local ecosystems and      wildlife and gather input from those near hydroelectric      facility sites. This is especially important as hydropower is      not without environmental impacts, including greenhouse gases      released from reservoirs associated with dams. In order to      weigh all impacts as well as the benefits, proper review      processes should be followed and corners cannot be cut.      Because of these long-held standards, NWF opposes H.3043,      the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.       The National Wildlife Federation has long supported robust      environmental review processes. Federal and state governments      should approach projects with a genuine interest in      determining negative effects on the environment, wildlife,      and local communities. H.3043 includes provisions that      place arbitrary deadlines on project reviews, even when it is      clear that a proper study will take longer. Unfortunately,      this bill would remove our experts in natural resources from      the review process and usurp states' rights to enforce their      own standards for hydropower projects. Additionally,      considerations of energy supply would be required alongside      protections for endangered species, fisheries, and cultural      sites, contradicting existing laws. If passed into law, H.     3043 would likely create confusion and litigation. We have      seen in the past how large-scale hydroelectric projects have      not always considered potential negative effects. We should      learn from our past mistakes, not repeat them.       While there was a hearing on this bill, only the Federal      Energy Regulatory Commission testified, leaving out important      voices. Among those voices left out were tribal leaders,      states, and local officials who will be required to abide by      these new rules. Not only does this legislation limit input      from those near proposed hydroelectric projects, but it also      does so for those who live near existing dams seeking a      permit renewal. This legislation would constrict the review      processes for dams approaching their 50-year review mark. It      is important to make sure that these projects, which were      built before our current rules were put in place, remain up      to the standards we set for human safety and minimal impact      to the environment, economically important fisheries, and      recreation sites.       In short, while this bill and its proponents claim to help      our nation move toward a more sustainable and climate-     friendly future, we need a system in place that can consider      our energy needs in addition to the economic, environmental      and cultural needs of our communities. Since climate change      is the most significant challenge of our time, we urge the      committee and supporters of this legislation to have a      transparent and robust discussion, not only of our energy      needs but also of potential impacts from hydropower such as      wildlife and greenhouse gases. For all of these reasons,      National Wildlife Federation recommends you oppose H.3043.           Sincerely,                                                     Jim Lyon,                           Vice President for Conservation Policy,     National Wildlife                                  ____                                             Outdoor Alliance,                                                 November 6, 2017.     Re H.3043, Hydropower Policy Modernization     Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are      writing to ask you to oppose H.3043, the Hydropower Policy      Modernization If enacted, this bill would have      significant negative impacts on outdoor recreation and its      associated local economic benefits and would remove      opportunities for meaningful local public involvement in      hydropower licensing.       Outdoor Alliance is a coalition of nine member-based      organizations representing the human powered outdoor      recreation community. The coalition includes Access Fund,      American Canoe Association, American Whitewater,      International Mountain Bicycling Association, Winter      Wildlands Alliance, The Mountaineers, the American Alpine      Club, the Mazamas, and Colorado Mountain Club and represents      the interests of the millions of Americans who climb, paddle,      mountain bike, and backcountry ski and snowshoe on our      nation's public lands, waters, and snowscapes.       Our members directly participate in licensing processes for      hydropower projects in partnership with state and federal      resource agencies. The authorities granted to federal      agencies under the Federal Power Act, Clean Water Act, and      Endangered Species Act have helped ensure that hydropower      operations balance our society's need for power with the      benefits of flowing rivers. These benefits include important      economic contributions generated through the outdoor      recreation economy, and outdoor recreation may be one benefit      of hydropower under certain circumstances.       Outdoor recreation powers a vast economic engine valued at      $887 billion annually with much of this activity focused      around water-based recreation, including rivers affected by[[Page H8629]]     hydropower operations. The National Hydropower Association's      own website, which promotes the benefits of hydropower,      states that ``Swimming, boating, fishing, camping, skiing and      hiking are just some of the recreational activities that take      place year-round and across the country at sites developed      and supported by the hydropower industry.''       We are concerned that H.3043 will severely limit the      ability of local communities to advocate for recreational      benefits in hydropower licensing. If passed, H.3043 will      shift responsibilities away from states, federal land      managers with locally-based recreation staff, and affected      communities, and instead place exclusive authority within the      hands of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).      FERC is a regulatory agency with no local field staff,      frequently with only the ability to participate in one or two      site visits in all. As a result, FERC staff are unlikely to      have experience and familiarity with local resources and      values. The end result of H.3043 would be outcomes that      are detrimental to outdoor recreation and local communities.       While hydropower provides certain benefits, it also always      comes with significant impacts. This legislation would upset      an important balance and the cooperative approach to      hydropower licensing that effectively ensures that the      interests of local communities and their interests in outdoor      recreation are represented. Outdoor Alliance finds the      hydropower provisions of H.3043 to be deeply problematic,      and we oppose any effort to diminish the ability of citizens      and public resource agencies to ensure that hydropower      licenses include provisions to protect the public river      resources that are important to them.           Best regards,                                                Louis Geltman,                                                  Policy Director,     Outdoor                                  ____                                              TROUT Unlimited,                                                 November 6, 2017.     Re Trout Unlimited opposes the ``Hydropower Policy          Modernization Act of 2017'' (H.3043) and we urge          members of the House of Representatives to vote against          this legislation.       Dear Representative: H.3043 is due for House floor      consideration this week. We urge you to reject the bill and      instead to develop a bill worthy of broad stakeholder      support.       Hydropower is an essential component of our nation's energy      mix. Hydropower produces energy with low hydrocarbon      emissions, but can and does cause massive impacts to      watershed health and fisheries habitats. Striking a balance      between power and nonpower values, such as fisheries habitat,      is essential.       To that end, the Federal Power Act assigns oversight and      conditioning roles for the natural resource agencies to      ensure adequate protections or conditions related to project      effects on underlying lands, waters and related resources.      These authorities, in particular sections 18 and 4e of the      Federal Power Act, and section 401 of the Clean Water Act,      contain some of the most useful fisheries conservation      provisions in state or federal statute and are critical to      minimize and mitigate impacts to trout and salmon habitats,      covering issues like fish passage, instream flow below the      project and water quality and quantity issues.       H.3043 would significantly disrupt efforts to balance      power and nonpower values in the licensing process and for      all the wrong reasons. If the goal of the bill is to make the      licensing process more efficient and expeditious, Congress      should support the funding and information needs of the      resource agencies, not penalize or further constrain their      participation. H.3043 instead would hamstring tribes,      states, and federal resource agencies from review and      conditioning of FERC licensed hydropower projects by imposing      overly restrictive timelines, adding new process hurdles for      debating agency requirements on applicants, and greatly      restricting the scope and basis on which resource agencies      can require conditions or investments to protect non-power      resources impacted by the project.       The harmful bill could not come at a worse time. Dozens of      projects coming up for relicensing soon. Many of them haven't      been reviewed since being originally licensed 30-50 years      ago. It is more imperative now than ever to ensure strong      review of these projects.       Instead of H.3043 Congress should support smart process      improvements that will benefit applicants and operators while      supporting strong protections to balance nonpower values.      Smart improvements would include support for incremental      upgrades, promote ongoing investment and ongoing study during      the life of licenses so that we aren't starting from scratch      every 30 to 50 years. A smart approach would ensure that the      regulatory requirements for states, tribes and federal      resource agencies to permit and condition these projects is      fully supported early in the process to reduce conflict and      delay. H.3043 misses these opportunities, focusing instead      placing arbitrary constraints on environmental review and      conditioning agency authorities that will result in increased      conflict during licensing.       As we have said a number of times before, Congress should      take adequate time to hear the views of the tribes, as well      as the state and federal resource agencies about existing      process hurdles and potential solutions before legislating      changes to hydropower project licensing procedures and      standards. Some in the industry blame delays and cost      overruns on agency inaction and bad decisions, yet the      committee has so far not called them to testify. If the      committee wants to have a thoughtful legislative process, it      needs to hear from the agencies who some claim to be the root      of the problem. Although the Energy and Commerce committee      and its subcommittee on Energy and Power held hearings on      this bill and related hydropower legislation, those hearings      did not include these constituencies. Again, we urge the      committee and the House to take the time to do the      deliberative process in the right way, and build broad      support for bipartisan legislation.       The most balanced and efficient way to bring new hydropower      online, is to ensure that the development is well-sited and      appropriately mitigated from the start and to support and      encourage early and often investment in evaluating and      improving operations over time.       This bill fails the test of carefully balancing power and      non-power values, such as trout and salmon fisheries and      river restoration. Specifically, we urge the House to support      and defend--and not weaken as this bill does--resource agency      authorities and mandates--including the Clean Water Act,      Endangered Species Act and Federal Power       We urge you to vote against H.3043.           Sincerely,                                                      Steve Moyer,     Vice President of Government                                  ____                                                 November 7, 2017.       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members      and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you to      oppose H.3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization      This bill is a devastating assault on our nation's rivers and      the people and wildlife that depend upon them. Its passage      would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing,      tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge      utilities.       Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many      hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now      were first constructed before virtually all modern      environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing      proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure      that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with      modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to      the environment, while still providing reliable electricity,      only arises once in a generation or two.       The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between      power and non-power values has existed for almost a century.      Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers,      a right which can and should be compatible with responsible      electricity production. However, H.3043 upends that      balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to      special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the      fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.     3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the      line, ahead of every other user.       We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and      Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation      interests who raised serious concerns about its many      provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee chose to make no      changes to reflect the constructive suggestions that the      Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward that would improve      the licensing process while maintaining environmental      protections. The Committee also failed to solicit testimony      from states, tribes, and federal natural resource agencies      whose authorities will be usurped by the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.3043 is enacted. You are      now being asked to vote on a bill that no state, tribe, or      conservation organization publicly supports. The bill under      consideration today will only benefit power companies at the      expense of every other user of a waterway.       H.3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing      process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an      aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state      agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process.      There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide      the agencies with the information they deem necessary to      quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or      Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic      where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly,      agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either      exercise their authority without necessary information (which      exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the      schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and      tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush      decision making, potentially making it more difficult to      protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered      species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.       Other provisions of H.3043, such as the changes to the      Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the      requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct      costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside      of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the      requirement that scientific decisions be made only by      political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of      how H.3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of power      companies.       In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal      treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing,      commercial[[Page H8630]]     fishing, whitewater boating, water quality, municipal water      supply, fire safety, flood control, or any other purpose      other than generating power, we urge you to vote NO on H.     3043.

SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Hydropower Policy      Modernization Act of 2017''.     2. HYDROPOWER REGULATORY       (a) Sense of Congress on the Use of Hydropower Renewable      Resources.--It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) hydropower is a renewable resource for purposes of all      Federal programs and is an essential source of energy in the      United States; and       (2) the United States should increase substantially the      capacity and generation of clean, renewable hydropower that      would improve environmental quality in the United       (b) Modifying the Definition of Renewable Energy to Include      Hydropower.--Section 203 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42      U.S.15852) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``the following      amounts'' and all that follows through paragraph (3) and      inserting ``not less than 15 percent in fiscal year 2017 and      each fiscal year thereafter shall be renewable energy.'' ;      and       (2) in subsection (b), by striking paragraph (2) and      inserting the following:       ``(2) Renewable energy.--The term `renewable energy' means      electric energy generated from solar, wind, biomass, landfill      gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current, and thermal),      geothermal, or municipal solid waste, or from a hydropower      project.''.       (c) Preliminary Permits.--Section 5 of the Federal Power      Act (16 U.S.798) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``three'' and inserting      ``4''; and       (2) by amending subsection (b) to read as follows:       ``(b) The Commission may--       ``(1) extend the period of a preliminary permit once for      not more than 4 additional years beyond the 4 years permitted      by subsection (a) if the Commission finds that the permittee      has carried out activities under such permit in good faith      and with reasonable diligence; and       ``(2) if the period of a preliminary permit is extended      under paragraph (1), extend the period of such preliminary      permit once for not more than 4 additional years beyond the      extension period granted under paragraph (1), if the      Commission determines that there are extraordinary      circumstances that warrant such additional extension.''.

(3) The project is located in sufficiently close proximity      and has environmental conditions that are sufficiently      similar to other projects that are eligible to participate in      the pilot program so that watershed-wide studies and      information may be developed, thereby significantly reducing      the need for, and scope of, individual project-level studies      and information.       (e) Designation of Individual Projects as a Single Group.--     The Commission may designate a group of projects to be      considered together in a consolidated licensing process under      the pilot program established under subsection (c). The      Commission may designate such a group only if each licensee      (or applicant) for a project in the group, on a voluntary      basis and in writing, agrees--       (1) to participate in the pilot program; and       (2) to a cost-sharing arrangement with other licensees (or      applicants) and applicable Federal and State agencies with      respect to the conduct of watershed-wide studies to be      considered in support of the license applications for the      group of projects.       (f) Project License Terms.--The Commission may change the      term of any existing license for an individual licensee in a      group designated under subsection (e) by up to 5 years--       (1) to provide sufficient time to develop a consolidated      study plan for--       (A) studies for individual projects in the group, as      necessary; and       (B) relevant watershed-wide studies for purposes of the      consolidated licensing process under the pilot program      established under subsection (c) that will be applicable to      each project in the group; and       (2) to align the terms of the existing licenses such that      they expire on the same date.

86,topic-id,2740,"Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record letters of opposition to H.3043.                                    Kalispel Tribe of Indians,                                        Usk, WA, November 8, 2017.     Re Opposition to H.3043, the Hydropower Policy          Modernization     Greg Walden,     Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,              Frank Pallone,     Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf      of the Kalispel Tribe of Indians, we write to once again      voice our opposition to H.3043, the Hydropower Policy      Modernization As stated by Kalispel Vice Chairman      Raymond Pierre during testimony before the House Natural      Resources Committee in April, H.3043 goes much too far in      trying to address inefficiencies in the federal hydropower      licensing process and will create more problems than it      resolves. If enacted, H.3043 will allow hydropower      operations to undermine the purposes of Indian reservations      and destroy with impunity tribal trust resources. We      respectfully call on you to oppose this legislation.       The Kalispel Tribe resides on a 5,000-acre reservation on      the Pend Oreille River in northeast Our      reservation was created to provide our people with a      permanent home, including the ability to use our river and      its resources like we have since time immemorial. This      purpose has been undermined by the construction and operation      of the Albeni Falls, Box Canyon, and Boundary hydropower      projects on the Pend Oreille The Box Canyon Reservoir      flooded ten percent of our reservation. In addition, these      facilities have combined to transform our free-flowing river      into a fragmented system of reservoirs in which native fish      struggle to survive while invasive species thrive. Many      Kalispel no longer trust or use the river because of its      altered ecology.       One of the Tribe's highest priorities is limiting any      additional loss of reservation lands and remedying the      cultural disconnection to the Pend Oreille The Federal      Power Act (``FPA'') offers the Tribe its most potent tool in      achieving these objectives. No other federal statute affords      the same degree of protection to the tribal nations whose      reservations are occupied by a Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission (``FERC'')-licensed hydroelectric project.       Section 4 (e) of the FPA authorizes the Secretary of the      Interior to develop mandatory conditions for the approval of      FERC licenses that impact Indian reservations. In our case,      these conditions are the only way to mitigate longstanding      and otherwise unaddressed environmental and cultural impacts      caused by FERC-licensed projects. The Pend Oreille Basin will      be the recipient of significant conservation investments to      restore connectivity and other habitat characteristics that      make those projects consistent with the purposes of the      Kalispel Indian Reservation because of the 4(e) conditions      and Section 18 fishway prescriptions in the Box Canyon and      Boundary FERC licenses. This conditioning authority also      makes it much more difficult for hydroelectric projects to      further flood Indian lands, which is a recurring problem      across the United       H.3043 does not improve the federal hydropower licensing      process, but instead weakens its protections for impacted      tribal nations. H.3043 detrimentally impacts the Section      4(e) conditioning regime and undermines its effectiveness in      protecting Indian H.3043 would overturn the D.     Circuit Court of Appeals decisions in Tacoma v. FERC, which      held that the Department of the Interior has mandatory      authority to develop appropriate conditions to protect Indian      reservations under the FPA and that FERC has no authority to      reject these conditions because Interior did not meet FERC's      truncated schedule. H.3043 would force the Department of      the Interior to comply with FERC's schedule. This change will      impair the Department of the Interior's ability to fully      examine each project and if it misses a deadline, tribal      interests will not be considered until the next relicensing,      often fifty years later.       H.3043 would empower FERC to determine the scope of the      environmental review for 4(e) conditions. This change creates      a new burden for FERC in an area in which it lacks expertise.      It also would require the Department of the Interior to      consider the balance of energy production against its trust      responsibility to Indian lands. Interior's only interest in      the current process is the protection of Indian lands and      that should remain its focus--it is not an arm of       Finally, H.3043 would overturn the Supreme Court's      decision in Escondido v. FERC, 466 U.765 (1984) by giving      FERC the authority to make a determination that a 4(e)      condition or fishway prescription is inconsistent with the      This fundamentally changes the FPA and undermines the      Department of the Interior's ability to protect Indian lands      and tribal resources.       The Kalispel Tribe urges the House of Representatives to      reject H.3043. The bill elevates hydropower interests at      the expense of tribal rights. If this bill is enacted the      Kalispel Tribe will suffer so that hydropower licensing may      proceed without protecting tribal lands and trust resources.           Sincerely,                                                      Glen Nenema,                              Chairman, Kalispel Tribe of Indians.[[Page H8639]]                                       ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2017.     Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     Washington,     Fred Upton,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Walden and Chairman Upton: As Members of the      Subcommittee on Energy with strong interest in facilitating      improvements in hydropower operations, development, and      licensing, we write to urge you to schedule another hearing      on this critical topic. We believe a hearing with      representatives of states, resource agencies, and Native      American Tribes is vital to having a full understanding of      how the 2005 hydropower license process reforms are working      and what changes may be necessary to further improve the      licensing and relicensing process to reduce delays and costs      for all parties involved.       Hydroelectric power provides substantial, virtually carbon-     free, baseload energy at low cost to our manufacturing sector      and to residential and commercial consumers. It is an      important asset that we believe is essential to maintain.       At the same time, however, it is clear that while      hydroelectric generation is essentially free of air emissions      relative to fossil generation, it is not impact-free. Absent      mitigation, hydropower has major negative impacts on fish and      wildlife populations, water quality and other important      physical and cultural resources, particularly if it is poorly      operated or sited. In addition, increased demands for water      creates significant challenges of water supply management in      some regions. All of these competing interests must be      balanced in issuing a license. The Federal Power Act (FPA)      respects states' authorities to manage water resources      according to state laws allocating water rights. And, the FPA      authorizes states and federal natural resource agencies to      place conditions on hydroelectric licenses to preserve water      quality, protect public lands and Native American      reservations, and ensure proper fish passage to preserve      healthy ecosystems and fisheries.       We were very encouraged by the substance and tone of the      Subcommittee's March 15, 2017 hearing entitled ``Modernizing      Energy Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities to      Expanding Hydropower Generation.'' The comments and      contributions from witnesses and Members on both sides of the      aisle were constructive, measured, and thoughtful, leading us      to believe that great potential exists to develop legislation      to improve the process for licensing hydroelectric generation      and pumped storage in this country.       However, the hearing provided an incomplete record with      regard to the process of hydroelectric licensing. In order to      move forward on considering any legislative changes to      current law in a knowledgeable manner, the Committee must      hear from those who propose the conditions included in      licenses: states, federal resource agencies, and Native      American Each of these entities has a unique role in      the licensing process stemming from its equally unique      responsibility for overseeing water rights and managing the      many demands on a river and its use. Neither power      generation, nor any other single use of a river, should      dominate the decision making process.       We look forward to working with you on this matter and      respectfully urge you to hold a second hearing with these      witnesses prior to consideration of any legislative proposal.      Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are      writing you on behalf of the members of The Association of      Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), Environmental Council of      States (ECOS), and The Association of State Wetland Managers      (ASWM) to express our concern with provisions of H.3043--     Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. If enacted as      written, the draft bill would modify Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing requirements under the      Federal Power Act, and may conflict with the states'      authority under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to protect      water quality and provide critical input on federal dredge      and fill permits to wetlands and other waters under 404.       Under the CWA and a state's own laws and regulations,      states are responsible for advancing the attainment of clean      and healthy waters. Section 401 of the CWA requires states to      certify that projects impacting navigable waters will comply      with applicable water quality standards and other state      requirements. Additionally, 401 certification is required for      federal dredge and fill permits to wetlands and other waters      under Section 404. Under this framework, states and      permittees have efficiently been able to balance      certification of hydropower facilities while ensuring that      water quality standards are met initially or through remedial      actions. By weakening 401 authority, H.3043 would      harm the ability of the governmental entity with primary      responsibility for water quality protection.       Additionally, H.3043 places FERC in control of      permitting timetables and limits time extensions. This could      restrict states' abilities to gather necessary data and      scientific studies for permitting, which are crucial to      reaching collaborative, science-based conclusions. Rushing      scientific studies and data gathering would result in federal      agencies making regulatory decisions without sufficient      technical information, and may lead to litigation and less      effective oversight of hydropower facilities.       H.3043 needlessly impairs state authority granted under      the CWA, and undermines ``cooperative federalism,'' a core      principle of the Act and the Administration's approach to      environmental law. The bill will not improve permitting      efficiency, and will likely result in water quality standards      being even harder to achieve. ACWA, ECOS and ASWM welcome the      opportunity to discuss revisions that would better preserve      states' rights under CWA Section 401 and ensure the      protection of state water resources.

Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The State of      Maryland (``Maryland'') provides the following comments on      the House of Representatives Bill 3043 (H.3043)--     Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. Although      Maryland generally welcomes reforms that streamline the      Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing      process, Maryland strenuously opposes any provisions in H.     3043 that would have the effect of curtailing State authority      under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to establish license      conditions to protect water quality. Several provisions of      H.3043 essentially serve to constrain state agencies use      of their independent authorities, making it more difficult to      protect water quality.       States serve an essential role in the FERC hydropower      licensing process when they review applications under Section      401 of the Clean Water Act in order to determine whether the      construction and/or operation of the facility will meet state      water quality standards and requirements. These reviews often      result in applicants conducting additional scientific studies      and states putting in place requirements (conditions) to      ensure that State water quality standards and requirement are      met. These types of conditions are essential for ensuring      that existing and new hydropower projects are built and      operated in a manner that is consistent with state and      federal environmental laws and are protective of the      environment. These conditions then become conditions of the      FERC license.       H.3043 designates FERC as the lead agency over federal      authorizations related to an application for a license,      license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower project.      This bill requires states to meet deadlines established by      FERC in a schedule that FERC develops for the licensing      action. Further, this bill places limits on FERC's ability to      easily grant extensions to the deadlines. As the lead agency,      FERC would establish and control the timeline for the      hydropower licensing process and it appears that H.3043      gives FERC the authority to create a schedule that would      reduce the amount of time a state would have to get necessary      scientific studies completed and to assess whether water      quality standards and requirements will be met as required      under Section 401 of the Clean Water Further, not only      does this legislation likely place pressure on states to      complete their water quality reviews more quickly using      existing information, it also provides applicants with an      entitlement to a trial-type hearing before a FERC      Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of      material fact. Moreover, this legislation declares the      decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge to be final and      not subject to further administrative review. This allowance      for a trial-like hearing[[Page H8640]]     combined with pressure to use existing science and meet      strict deadlines together makes it even more challenging for      states to protect water quality.       Finally, applications for amendments to existing licenses      which qualify as a project ``upgrade'' (which is determined      by FERC as to whether a proposed amendment qualifies as an      upgrade) obtain even more expedited processing by In      these cases, it appears that FERC would be the decision      maker, not the state, with regard to whether the desired      amendment to project operations would affect water quality.       Decades of federal court decisions interpreting Section 401      have established the states' authority to require conditions      in FERC licenses necessary to protect water quality. These      decisions recognize and affirm the basic principle of      federalism embodied in the Clean Water Act that states have      the primary role and responsibility to ensure state water      quality standards are met.       Maryland's interest in protecting water quality is as      important and relevant today as ever, particularly now as      FERC considers the relicensing of the Conowingo hydroelectric      dam on the Susquehanna River in The Susquehanna      River provides approximately 50 percent of the fresh water to      the Chesapeake Bay and is an important driver of the Bay's      water quality. A joint study funded by Maryland and the Army      Corps of Engineers concluded that the Dam's loss of capacity      to trap sediment and associated nitrogen and phosphorus      pollution (nutrients) adversely affects the health of the      The precise nature of the Dam's adverse impacts on the      health of the Bay and the circumstances under which they      occur are currently the subject of additional study. What is      clear, however, is that any new FERC license for the Dam will      have to contain appropriate conditions to address sediment      and associated nutrient transport and ensure that Maryland's      water quality standards are maintained. Without appropriate      conditions Maryland may not be able to meet its commitment to      achieve EPA's Total Maximum Daily Loads (``TMDL'') for the            In impairing the states' primary roles and responsibilities      under Section 401 to fashion conditions in FERC licenses,      H.3043 relegates the states--the entities with the      greatest interest and expertise in protecting state water      quality--to bystander or second-class status. Maryland      strenuously objects to the provisions in H.3043 that would      make it more difficult for Maryland to ensure water quality      through the Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality      certification process.       Maryland's concerns with the legislation's impact on the      Conowingo hydroelectric dam relicensing process could be      addressed by making clear that nothing in the legislation      alters Section 401 of the Clean Water Act with regard to      State authority, role, responsibilities, process and      timeline. Further, the legislation should clearly indicate      that state actions associated with Section 401 requirements,      including the assessment of water quality standard      achievement and resulting conditions, are not eligible for a      trial type hearing by a FERC Administrative Law Judge for      purposes of resolving disputes of material fact. Maryland      urges that the provisions of H.3043 that would have the      effect of curtailing State authority under Section 401 of the      Clean Water Act be stricken from the bill.

87,topic-id,469,"Mr.Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Rush amendment in the nature of a substitute, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it as well.  Mr.Chairman, hydropower is backed by Members on both sides of the aisle. We all support hydropower, but the process for how we license these projects is far too important for us to get it wrong.  While many Members on the minority side have objections to the underlying bill, H.3043, due to its negative impact on States' rights and States' prerogatives under the Clean Water Act, my substitute amendment addresses these issues in a more responsible way.  Mr.Chairman, H.3043 will not modernize or improve the hydropower licensing process, but, rather, it simply places private profits for industry over the public interest.  Mr.Chairman, we certainly need a more balanced approach, such as the one provided in my substitute amendment, which contains bipartisan provisions that were included in the hydropower package that both sides agreed to in a fit of bipartisanship last December in committee.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment contains several provisions to improve the licensing process while also offering incentives to the hydropower industry.  This substitute contains a requirement to set up a new licensing process, but, unlike H.3043, it protects the rights of Federal resource agencies, States, and Indian Tribes to impose conditions in accordance with modern environmental laws.  My substitute also amends the definition of renewable energy to include all hydropower, just as H.3043 does; however, it expands the goals for Federal purchasing of renewable power beyond the 15 percent included in H.3043 as an objective, not a mandate.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment also contains a ``reward for early action'' provision that authorizes FERC to take into account a licensee's investments made over the course of their license in order to improve the efficiency or environmental performance of their hydropower facility when setting the term of their new license.  Mr.Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee, we heard, repeatedly, that a major cause for licensing delays was due to incomplete applications that do not include all the pertinent information necessary to issue a decision.  While H.3043 does nothing to address this issue, my substitute does so by directing FERC and other Federal resource agencies to convene a negotiating rulemaking with all the stakeholders to develop a process in which a completed license application will be evaluated and issued or denied within a period of not more than 3 years.                              {time}  1515  Mr.Chairman, my amendment preserves States' and Tribal authorities by directing FERC and the Secretary of the Interior to issue guidance on best practices for engagement with Indian Tribes in the hydropower licensing process.  Mr.Chairman, we cannot allow industry profits to supersede the interests of Native Tribes, States, and other important stakeholders.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

315,topic-id,230,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.3441.  The right of workers to collectively bargain under the National Labor Relations Act is essential for them to secure fair wages and working conditions. For workers to be able to bargain effectively they have to have someone across the table to bargain with, the party or parties that control their hours, wages, benefits and work environment. Negotiation with themselves would be a futile exercise.  H.3441 would eviscerate the definition of an employer to the point that not only might the true employer not have to come to the table but it might be possible that no employer would have to come to the table.  Current joint employer standards take into account modern hiring trends, where about three million people work for temporary staffing agencies, working for companies that do not directly pay them, and ensure employee protections.  The recent NLRB General Counsel determination in Freshii--where a restaurant franchisor with over 100 stores was not held to be a joint employer because its control over its franchisees was generally limited to brand standards and food quality and did not exercise control of the terms and conditions of employment of its franchisee's employees--illustrates the pathway available to franchisors. I am concerned that this legislation actually harms franchisees by making them responsible for decisions dictated by their franchisors.  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.3441.

1085,topic-id,2191,"Mr.President, whether one is a progressive, a Democrat, a conservative, a Republican, or somewhere in between, there is a deep understanding in this country that we are living in a rigged economy, and people are increasingly angry and frustrated about the growing inequality and unfairness they see all about them.  It is hard to believe, but in the United States of America today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent--one-tenth of 1 percent, bottom 90 percent. A study came out fairly recently indicating that in the United States of America today, the three wealthiest people in our country--Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett--now own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people. Three people own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people.  Meanwhile, while the very, very rich get richer, some 40 million Americans are living in poverty. These are people who are struggling today to figure out how they put food on the table for their kids, how they put gas in the car in order to go to work, how they pay their electric bills, how they deal with childcare. There are 40 million people living in poverty. The middle class is disappearing. People are working two or three jobs. For the first time in the modern history of this country, young people may well have a standard of living lower than their parents'.  On top of all of that, we remain the only major country on Earth that doesn't guarantee healthcare to all of our people. Twenty-eight million people today have no health insurance. Many more are underinsured. And if our Republican colleagues get their way, they are going to throw another 20 or 30 million people off of their health insurance.  It is not only the reality of grotesque levels of inequality that is making the American people despondent and angry; it is the reality that the people on top, with their wealth and power, can access lawyers and accountants who are able to manipulate the system to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else. That is the essence of what a rigged economy is about and what I want to say a few words about today.  In my view, one of the great crises facing our world--and we are in a world of many crises--is the rapid movement toward international oligarchy in which a handful of billionaires own and control not just a significant part of the American economy but a significant part of the world economy. Needless to say, this is an issue that does not get a whole lot of discussion because, in general, the more important the issues are, the less discussion they get within the corporate media or within the political world that we live in here in the  Let me reiterate. One of the great crises that we face is that a handful of billionaires are moving this entire planet toward an oligarchic society in which the people on top not only have incredible wealth but incredible political power as well.  This last Sunday, a group of investigative journalists released over 13 million files known as the Paradise Papers exposing just how horrific this situation has become. These papers show how a handful of oligarchs in the United States and throughout the world get richer by hiding their wealth and their profits offshore to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. The list of individuals implicated in the Paradise Papers include billionaires such as the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, Carl Icahn, and Robert It includes large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of It includes large multinational corporations such as Apple, Nike, and It includes members of the Trump administration, such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steve  Let's be clear. Offshore tax evasion is a major problem not just for the United States but for governments throughout the world. This is really quite unbelievable. In the year 2012, the Tax Justice Network estimated that at least $21 trillion--$21 trillion, a number almost beyond comprehension--is being stashed in offshore tax havens around the world. Imagine that. There is $21 trillion flowing into tax havens in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Luxembourg--all these places around the world where the billionaire class and large corporations are stashing their money not only to avoid taxes in the United States but to avoid taxes in Great Britain, France, Germany, et cetera.  There is a funny thing about these guys. All of these billionaires love veterans, and they love the military. They want to see us rebuild the infrastructure, and they want to see our kids get a good education. But you know what, they don't want to pay taxes to make that happen. They want ordinary people to pay the taxes. Republicans here want to increase military spending by $50, $60 billion. It is not the billionaires who are going to pay the taxes on that--they have their money in the Cayman It is the working class, the middle class, upper middle class who will pay, not the billionaires. They love America--except when it comes to accepting their fair share to make sure that we continue to provide the services our men, women, and children need.  The situation has become so absurd--and this is really how crazy it is--that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is now the home of nearly 20,000 corporations. This particular building in the Cayman Islands is called the Ugland It is five stories. I know that you can squeeze people into a building--sometimes three or four people live in a room--but I think it is a little bit hard to understand how 20,000 corporations function in a five-story building. Of course the answer is that 20,000 corporations do not function in this five-story building.[[Page S7084]]It is all a fraud. It is simply a mailbox address for 20,000 corporations that are in this building in order to avoid paying their taxes. They are stashing their profits and their wealth in corporations that use this building as a mailing address.  I know we are busy talking about so-called tax reform here, but in the United States alone, offshore tax evasion costs our government about $166 billion in lost revenue each and every year. That is a lot of money that could be used to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure--our roads, our bridges, our water systems. One trillion dollars--that is 8 or 9 years of that $166 billion--could create up to 15 million good-paying jobs. That is money that could be used to provide universal pre-K for our children so that when kids get ready to go to school, they will be prepared to do the work there. But instead of cracking down on offshore tax schemes, President Trump and my Republican colleagues in Congress are working overtime to pass legislation that would make this absurd situation even worse.  At a time when corporations are making recordbreaking profits, my Republican colleagues want to slash taxes for companies that are shifting American jobs to China and American profits to the Cayman At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, President Trump and the Republicans in Congress want to cut taxes for billionaires by repealing the estate tax on families who inherit over $5.5 million. I think the American people grasp the unfairness and the absurdity of the Republican tax proposal.  The top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. The very, very rich are getting richer while the middle class is shrinking, and the Republican response is to give massive tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent--two-tenths of 1 percent. These are families like the Walton family, the wealthiest family in America, who owns Walmart, who would get up to a $50 billion tax break; and the Koch brothers, who have enough money to spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to elect rightwing candidates to  There are massive tax breaks for billionaires and at the same time, an effort to throw up to 30 million people off of the health insurance they have, massive cuts in education, in nutrition, and in the programs that working families desperately need.  Instead of providing even more tax breaks to very profitable corporations and to billionaires and President Trump's Cabinet, maybe--just maybe--it might be a good idea to close offshore tax loopholes and demand a fair, transparent, and progressive tax system.  I hope the American people are catching on--as I believe they are--to what a fraud the Republican tax proposal is. Today, one out of five major, profitable corporations already pays zero in Federal income tax. You can't do much better than paying zero in Federal income tax and be a profitable corporation, but that is what is going on. Republicans want to make that even worse, and then they want millions of middle-class people, by the end of the decade, to be paying more in taxes. That is absurd, and I hope the American people stand up and demand that we do not go forward with that proposal.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, on another issue, I want to mention that there is a crisis in primary healthcare, and unless Congress acts immediately, that crisis is likely to become much worse. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to healthcare because Congress has still not renewed funding for the community health center program, which expired on September 30.  Our Nation's community health centers provide affordable, high-quality healthcare to more than 27 million people. What community health centers do is not only provide high-quality primary healthcare but also dental care, mental health counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs. Community health centers not only save lives, they also end up saving money. What they do is keep people out of emergency rooms and keep people out of hospitals because people can now go to the doctor when they should. The savings are also, really, quite significant. Investing in community health centers keeps people healthier, keeps people alive, and saves taxpayers' money.  Not only do we have to renew funding for the Community Health Center Program, but we must also improve and expand the National Health Service Corps, one of the, really, very positive health programs that the Federal Government runs. What this program understands is that for a variety of reasons, including the fact that many young people leave medical school being $300,000, $400,000 in debt, it is very hard to get young doctors, dentists, nurses, and nurse practitioners to underserved areas in rural America or in urban What this program does is provide debt forgiveness and sometimes scholarships for young graduates of medical school or nursing school or dental school and says: If you are prepared to practice in an underserved area, we will forgive your loans. That is a big deal in attracting providers to areas in which we desperately need them.  The bad news is that, as every American knows, this Congress and this country are very politically divided. That is no great secret. The good news and the truth is that in terms of community health centers--Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the founders, who worked with Republicans--from the inception of the program, there has been a widespread understanding on both sides of the aisle that communities all over America in every State in our country are benefiting from community health centers whether they are in rural areas or whether they are in urban areas or anyplace else in between.  What I am very happy to note is that there is excellent legislation--bipartisan legislation--here in the Senate, introduced by Senator Roy Blunt and Senator Debbie Stabenow, that would reauthorize these successful programs for 5 years and provide modest increases in their funding. This program not only has the support of virtually, perhaps, every Democrat or every Member of the Democratic Caucus, but I think it has at least 9 or 10 Republican cosponsors. I believe, if that bill were to be brought to the floor of the Senate, it would pass with overwhelming support because every Senator here knows of the excellent work that is done by community health centers from one end of this country to the other.  I hope that this issue will get the attention it deserves. It should have been funded at the end of the fiscal year. It wasn't. I just talked to a physician in Burlington, VT, who works for a community health center. They are worried, and doctors and nurses all across this country are worried, as are patients, about the lack of reauthorization of this very important bill.  I hope that this bill will get moved very quickly along with the CHIP program. There is bipartisan support for it, and I hope that we can get it to the floor and get it passed as quickly as possible.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr.Chair, I rise in opposition to the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017 because it weakens States' rights to protect their own water quality.  Under the Clean Water Act, States have the right to protect their water by setting water quality conditions on hydropower licenses. This bill would constrain that authority, forcing States to issue rushed conditions using incomplete scientific data, or surrender their authority to issue conditions at all. In short, the choice that States have to protect their water and their people is to either do it poorly or not at all.  We had a fix for this. We had an amendment to H.3043, but it was not made in order. It would have preserved the critical role States play in protecting local water quality by exempting their rights under the Clean Water Act from the bill.  For Marylanders in my State, this issue is bipartisan and hits close to home. FERC is currently considering the relicensing of a hydroelectric dam on the Susquehanna The Susquehanna provides 50 percent of all of the freshwater that reaches the Chesapeake Bay, making it a critical driver of the Bay's water quality. Any new FERC license will need to have conditions that protect the Susquehanna and the Bay from the sediment and nutrient pollution built up behind the dam. That is why even Republicans in our State, the secretary of the environment, and secretary of natural resources sent a letter urging Congress to strike the provisions in this bill that would limit Maryland's ability to set water quality conditions.  I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in this body, who so often remark on the importance of protecting States' rights from usurping Federal agencies, have refused to protect States by bringing this critical amendment to the floor.

295,topic-id,733,"Mr.Speaker, once again the Republican majority is offering a bill that would harm working families. It has nothing to do with saving local businesses, small businesses, and has everything to do with limiting workers' rights and taking away workers' wages.  Between 2005 and 2015, 94 percent of net job growth was in alternative work like temporary, contract, and on-call jobs. This isn't our parents' workplace anymore, where one employer sets the rules and pays the wages. Today, a corporation can set workplace rules while a temp agency or subcontractor pays the wages. Today's workers need to be able to bargain with both and to hold each accountable for labor law violations.  Instead, this bill moves us backward. It would prevent working men and women from bargaining for better wages and benefits and safer working conditions with the corporations that have decisionmaking power over their workplace.  It would allow corporations to rob working women and men of their earned wages without giving those workers the right to recover. The annual cost of wage theft is estimated at $50 billion this year.  It would immunize bad corporate actors and put small and big businesses who respect their workers at a competitive disadvantage.  This bill is a bad deal, and workers know it.  I include in the Record a letter from the AFL-CIO and its 12 million members.  If you support better wages and better jobs, vote ``no'' on this bad bill.                                                       AFL-CIO                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.                           Legislative Alert       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 12 million working      women and men represented by the unions of the AFL-CIO, I am      writing to urge you to oppose H.3441, the ``Save Local      Business Act.''       Proponents of the legislation claim that it is designed to      repeal the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB's) 2015      decision in Browning Ferris Industries, in which the NLRB      clarified its legal test for determining whether two      employers are joint employers of certain employees. In fact,      H.3441 rolls back worker protections so they are weaker      than when Congress adopted the National Labor Relations Act      in 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938. It is      harmful legislation that will undermine workers' pay and      protections on the job.       Browning Ferris concerned a group of workers on a recycling      line at a facility owned and operated by Browning The      workers were supplied by a staffing agency--     Browning Ferris controlled the facility, set the hours of      operation, dictated the speed of the recycling line,      indirectly supervised the line workers, and had authority      over numerous other conditions of employment. In order to      ensure that the employees' right to form a union and bargain      over workplace issues was protected, the NLRB held that      Browning Ferris was a joint employer of the line workers      along with This fact-intensive decision reflected      the realities of the arrangement at Browning Ferris and was      rightly decided in order for the line workers to have a      meaningful right to bargain over their terms and conditions      of employment.       Before the ink was dry on the Browning-Ferris decision,      business groups and Republicans in Congress began attacking      the decision, claiming it dramatically changed the law and      undermined the franchise business model. (Browning Ferris is      not a franchise case, a fact specifically noted by the NLRB      in its decision).       In our view, these attacks on the Browning Ferris decision      are overblown and misguided. In today's fragmented      workplaces, with perma-temps, contracted workers, agency      employees, and subcontracting becoming ever more prevalent,      it is more important than ever to make sure our laws protect      workers and ensure they receive the wages they are due and      that their right to join with their co-workers to bargain for      improvements on the job is protected.       H.3441 takes the law in the opposite direction,      radically changing both the National Labor Relations Act and      the Fair Labor Standards Act by instituting a new test for      finding employers to be joint employers that is more      restrictive than any agency or court has ever adopted. As a      practical matter, the legislation eliminates joint employment      from the NLRA and the Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning that      many workers in subcontracting or staffing agency      arrangements will be left without recourse for wage theft and      will have no meaningful bargaining rights. The bill weakens      worker protections and allows corporations to evade their      responsibilities under the law.       We urge you to reject this harmful and misguided proposal.

This bill would increase Medicare part D and part B income-related premiums, charging higher income seniors the entire cost. This is a structural attack on Medicare, and that is why the AARP, which supports the Children's Health Insurance Program, opposes this bill. Imposing a 100 percent premium is unfair because these seniors already pay more, and it will drive many out of Medicare altogether, undermining its solvency.  To make matters worse, the Republican income threshold is not based on current income, but on a 2-year period. So, for example, seniors' income is volatile, and if you sold your home, you could get a massive premium penalty, even if you used the money you got from selling your home to buy in to assisted living and that money wasn't available.

Over 10 years ago, President Bush nominated Mr.Wehrum to head the Office of Air and Radiation at the He was rejected because his 6-year record as an employee at the EPA told the Senators all that they needed to know. As the ranking member, Jim Jeffords, put it at the time: ``Mr.Wehrum's disdain for the Clean Air Act is alarming.'' If you disagree with the foundational Federal law that we use to keep our air clean, then it is hard to believe that you can competently lead the EPA's efforts when it comes to protecting our right to clean air. A decade later, nothing has changed. Mr.Wehrum has done nothing that should change our minds about his ability to lead the  This, of course, is part of a pattern. This administration continues to nominate anti-science, pro-pollution, climate-denying people to lead the U.agencies that are in charge of science and climate.  Scott Pruitt has denied a century's worth of established science and basic facts that say that climate change is real, urgent, and caused by humans. He now leads the 1 Federal Agency that is charged with working on climate change.  Then there is Jim Bridenstine, who hopes to lead NASA, which is one of our Nation's top science agencies. He, too, is still on the fence about climate change.  Meanwhile, 13 Federal agencies, including the EPA and NASA, just published a dire report that reads that greenhouse gases released by human activity are to blame for rising temperatures and severe weather throughout the world.  This is why Mr.Wehrum should not go any further. It is really very simple. Our own government scientists say that climate change is real, urgent, and caused by humans.  If you do not want to take their word for it, here in the United States in this year alone, a record number of category 4 hurricanes killed dozens of people and destroyed or damaged entire communities in the southern United States and Puerto Wildfires killed dozens of people and burned more than 8.4 million acres in the Droughts lasting for months wiped out farmers' crops and forced ranchers to sell livestock in the The city of Seattle had soot on cars from the wildfires.

There have been 15 severe weather events this year that have resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion. That is what insurance companies and reinsurance companies consider to be the threshold. They consider a big event--a catastrophic event--from an insurance standpoint to be a $1 billion event. We had 15 of them this year in the United In the past 10 years, the U.Government has spent more than $350 billion in helping communities recover from severe weather, and that is before our getting through with the various and necessary disaster supplemental budget requests that are coming down for Florida, Houston, and Puerto  Look, severe weather is a reality or whatever you want to call it. If you feel uncomfortable politically calling it ``climate change,'' fine, but severe weather is actually already happening. It is now a moral issue, and it is a fiscal issue. It has taken a huge toll on our economy, on the American taxpayer, and on local communities. For the most part, we do not budget for[[Page S7094]]these costs because we have decided that these are one-time events, but they just happen to be one-time events that are occurring more and more frequently and that are costing more and more.  Because of the leadership vacuum that Scott Pruitt and Donald Trump have created, States and cities and the private sector have been stepping up so that the United States can stay on track to cut carbon emissions and fight climate change. Yet the Federal Government still has a responsibility here, not just a moral responsibility but a legal one, for the climate will keep changing, the costs will keep rising, and more and more people will feel the effects. Instead of stepping up so that our Federal debt does not balloon and our coastlines do not erode and our security is not threatened, this administration keeps nominating people like Mr.Wehrum to deny that climate is an issue and that the government ought to act.  Throughout his career, Mr.Wehrum has demonstrated antipathy for the very laws that he is now going to be tasked with upholding. When he held this position in an acting capacity in the 2000s--in other words, he was filling in until he was confirmed but was never confirmed--he was sued dozens of times for not doing his job. Time and again, the courts found that, in fact, he was putting special interests over science and over the public good. This is not just a rhetorical statement. These are 27 times that Mr.Wehrum lost in court for exceeding his authorities under the law.  Here is where he kept getting specifically into trouble. Mr.Wehrum is a former lawyer for the very industries that the EPA regulates--chemical companies, utility companies, the auto industry. This is the experience that he relied on while he worked at the EPA, which is fair enough so far, but when the Agency started working on a rule that regulated pollution from powerplants, Mr.Wehrum took language from his former law firm--again, which represented powerplants--and gave it to the EPA to put into the rule. In other words, the EPA did not look to experts and scientists to decide how best to regulate powerplants; it looked to the powerplants' lawyers.  Mr.Wehrum's job was to protect clean air and public health, and he failed at that job by siding with special interests over that mission. The courts actually stepped in 27 times, and he lost 27 times. One case went all the way to the Supreme Court under Mr.The EPA said that it did not have the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from automobiles, but under U.law, the EPA must regulate all emissions that are damaging to human health and welfare, and the Supreme Court has acknowledged that carbon pollution fits that description.  Just to be clear, under the EPA's responsibility to administer the Clean Air Act, the EPA does not just have the authority to regulate carbon emissions; it has the obligation to regulate carbon emissions. In other words, anything that is airborne that causes harm to people, to public health, must be regulated. The EPA does not simply decide which of these airborne pollutants must be regulated; it has to regulate all of those pollutants that cause damage to public health. Clearly, carbon fits that category on a commonsense level, but the Supreme Court also decided that. There have been more intense storms, as we have seen from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and others, that are certainly bad for human health and well-being, and the Supreme Court has agreed. The EPA has the authority and the obligation to regulate these greenhouse gases.  We do not need to go through this again. Mr.Wehrum has already shown that he is not the right leader for the He will not commit to taking the necessary steps to address severe weather. He will not fight for clean air. He will fight for his former clients. This is not an accusation. It is based on exactly what he did when he was in the same position. It is the reason the Senate rejected him 10 years ago.  With this kind of information in front of us, there is no way we can put Mr.Wehrum back in charge of the office that is tasked with regulating carbon pollution, not when we are facing a planetary emergency, not when the fiscal and human costs of inaction are so clear. The EPA needs leadership that understands the crisis we are facing and that understands and is willing to do everything in its power to address it. Mr.Wehrum has clearly demonstrated that he is not the right person for this job. I will vote no on this nominee, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor.

Unfortunately, Senate Republicans are mimicking the House in trying to rush through their bill as well. It is said, the Senate Republicans will unveil a plan of their own, although I don't expect there to be that much difference between the two.  What has united the Republican tax reform efforts so far in this Congress has been a stubborn desire to reduce taxes paid by big corporations and the superrich. That is the core. The middle class ends up with the leftovers. Shockingly, millions in the middle class will actually see a tax increase, not just a handful but a large number. This morning's New York Times did an analysis. According to them, one-third of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes next year under the House bill, and by 2026, nearly half of all middle-class families would pay more in taxes--almost half.  Here is the newspaper article. This is the New York They defined the middle class as households between $50,000 and $160,000--the backbone of Here is their headline. I don't know if you can see it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions of Middle-Class Families.'' Here is the headline again printed a little larger so everyone here in America can see it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions of Middle-Class Families.''  That is the case. They did their analysis. By the way, you say: Well, that is mainly in the coastal Even if it is not one-third, it is probably about 20 percent in the poorest of Large numbers of middle-class taxpayers in every State in this Union--coastal, noncoastal, New York, California but also Wyoming, Utah, and Nebraska--would pay a significant tax increase.  Looking at the House bill, you can see why. Republicans either reduce or eliminate several middle-class tax deductions. The elimination of the personal deduction, for example, which lets families deduct roughly $4,150 for each person in the household, would be costly to families of three or more. If you have a lot of kids, this bill is bad for you. Taxwise--if tax policy influences behavior--they are trying to discourage bigger families. What does that say? Ending the personal exemption makes the Republican tax plan an anti-large family bill.  In many cases, the new benefits provided to the middle class are insufficient to fill the gap created by the loss of popular deductions, and, worse, many of the benefits are temporary, expiring after several years. So while some in the middle class may get an initial tax break, down the line, the break disappears, and taxes start to go up.  As pointed out by David Kamin, a professor of tax law at NYU--and they have a great tax department, proudly from New York--Republicans have reduced the value of middle-class tax breaks significantly over time.  To meet their desires not to increase the deficit by too much--although $1.5 trillion is a heck of a lot--instead of reducing the tax breaks on the biggest corporations or the very wealthiest, they reduced them on the middle class. So in 5 years' time, the $300/person family credit is gone. The child tax credits--unlike the personal exemptions they replaced--lose value over time because they are not indexed. They only increase with inflation. The Republicans use the same gimmicks to make the value of middle-class deductions, like the standard deduction, lose value over time.  So while some middle-class families may see a tax decrease in the very short run, a considerable number see a hidden tax increase a few years later. They have front-loaded the benefits to disguise a tax hike in the outyears.  Look at this chart. Now, our Republican colleagues picked the perfect family to benefit from their tax break. This middle-class family, when they proposed it, is a family making $59,000 a year. Well, the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy looked at the Republican plan and found over one in five taxpayers, those earning between $56,000 and $150,000--the heart of the middle class--would see an average increase of $1,350 by 2027. Here it is. This is not a family who has medical expenses or kids in college--they lose those deductions--or a large mortgage or from a State with high personal income and sales taxes. This is the plain-vanilla, hand-picked family chosen by the Republicans to highlight the benefits of their plan.  It is true. In the first year, they get a break around $1,100, but over the years, they get an increase. By 2027, even this hand-picked Republican family gets a tax increase. The bottom line is, the Republican tax plan is like a ticking timebomb for many hard-working, middle-class families. Working middle-class families see a tax increase because the Republican plan reduces their benefits over time.  Meanwhile, tax giveaways for the wealthiest Americans and huge corporations get better over time. The estate tax exemption goes up from $11[[Page S7035]]million to $22 million for a couple, and then it is permanently repealed by 2023. The corporate rate cut and passthrough cut also stays permanent--a boon to wealthy shareholders. Middle-class tax deductions and credits expire. Deductions for corporations and the wealthiest are permanent or even get better.  As Mark Mazer, the director of the Independent Tax Policy Center, said, ``You could create a plan that just cuts taxes for middle-class people. That's not what this is.'' Yet that is how Republicans are selling it.  A few days ago on Hugh Hewitt's show, my friend the majority leader said that ``at the end of the day, nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase'' under the Republican bill. Again, that was Mitch McConnell: ``Nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase.'' Well, if Leader McConnell was referring to the House bill, that is just a bold-faced lie, and he ought to retract it, but to give the Senator the benefit of the doubt, maybe he is referring to the Senate tax bill still under consideration. Let's see.  In the Republican bill, will nobody in the middle class get a tax increase? We will wait and see. If past is prologue, I doubt it because the House said no middle-class person would get an increase, then their bill walloped the middle class. One-third get an increase immediately, and then half get an increase over the next 10 years.  I would remind my Senate Republican colleagues that their House Republicans sold their bill as a middle-class bill--a middle-class tax cut--and then put together a plan that raises taxes on millions of middle-class families, one-third of all families making between $65,000 and $150,000.  If the Senate bill follows the same path, promising universal, middle-class tax cuts but delivers smoke and mirrors and hidden tax increases, it will get clobbered in the court of public opinion, as it would deserve.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1069,topic-id,2026,"Mr.President, over the past decade, the American economy has generated enormous wealth for wealth holders but, painfully, less work and less pay--fewer good-paying jobs--for workers. Average folks are having a harder time keeping up with the ever-rising costs as the rich get richer and corporate stocks soar.  Our economy would surely benefit from the kind of tax reform that gives small businesses and working Americans a break, while asking the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share. ``Their share'' doesn't mean they are doing something illegal; it simply means that as wealth goes up and so much money agglomerates to the top, for the good of the society, the wealthiest should pay more.  Unfortunately, the Republican Party has decided to pursue a partisan tax bill that would spin our economy even further out of whack, lavishing tax giveaways on the wealthy and corporate America, while raising taxes on millions of middle-class families over 10 years.  A New York Times analysis found that next year, the House Republican tax plan would cause taxes to go up on one-third of all middle-class families. Those are families who make--I believe it is between $56,000 and $150,000. One out of three in that middle-class, upper middle-class group is going to pay more in taxes, while those at the highest end get huge breaks. By 2026, taxes would go up on nearly half of all middle-class families.  I want to salute someone I almost never agree with--Senator At least yesterday, he had the courage of his convictions to say that no middle-class person should pay more, even in New York and But that is not the case with this bill. Large numbers of people throughout the country will pay more. Large numbers of middle-class people and people struggling to the middle class will pay more.  So when Speaker Ryan says that under the House plan ``Everyone enjoys a tax cut all across the board,'' as he did yesterday, he is fibbing. I really want to use the ``L'' word, but to be nice, I won't. But Speaker Ryan, explain to us how you can say with a straight face: ``Everyone enjoys a tax cut all across the board.''  Every independent analysis and the more honest Republicans say that some middle-class people--a good number of middle-class people--get a tax increase. So Speaker Ryan, take it back. Start telling the truth about your bill. We know you are under pressure, but you have always been an honorable man, and this tax bill is tying you into a pretzel when it comes to telling the truth about it.  Look at what is done here. The personal exemption, which benefits large families, is gone. Yes, the standard deduction doubles, but if you have four, five, six children, you still pay more, even before they start whacking your State and local deductibility or your college loan deductibility or your healthcare deductibility.  Stunningly, the deduction for catastrophically high medical expenses is also gone, meaning that among the hardest hit under this plan would be some of the most vulnerable taxpayers. Eight million Americans deduct their out-of-pocket medical expenses because they are over 10 percent of their income. They plan their finances around this deduction. These families have someone with a chronic condition--maybe an elderly parent who has Alzheimer's, maybe a family with a young kid who has cancer.  I met a lady at the airport yesterday. Her name was I didn't know who she was. She came over to me pleading. There was sadness in her eyes. She said: My son needs an orphan drug. It is very expensive. If I can't deduct the expenses, I don't know what I[[Page S7074]]am going to do. I won't be able to afford the drug. How can our Republican colleagues be so heartless and cruel? I know that you want to reduce taxes on corporations, but why do you have to do it at Bridget's expense?  Of course, the House bill takes an ax to State and local deductibility, a bedrock middle-class deduction that affects nearly every State but hits high tax States, like Virginia, the hardest.  Any House Republican who watched the returns in the Virginia elections last night must be shaken by the overwhelming Democratic turnout in suburban areas. According to pollsters, the 1 issue was healthcare, and this deduction goes. But overall, suburban Virginia said no to the Republican way. Suburban families will be the ones hit hardest by the elimination of State and local deductions in States like Virginia but also in Washington, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Minnesota, and  Just last night, we learned from reporting that the Senate bill is likely to go even further regarding the State and local deduction--full repeal. There are some from my State in New York saying: Well, we have a compromise. A, the compromise still eliminates three-fourths of the deduction, but, B, that compromise is going bye-bye. The Senate is going to get rid of it. You can be sure it won't come back in a conference committee.  So I say to my House colleagues, particularly those from suburban districts: Stop the elimination of the State and local deduction now before it is too late. If it happens and you vote yes on this bill, you will be to blame. There is no way to duck and cover behind the SALT compromise any longer because the SALT tax writers have made clear that they want to repeal it entirely in the Because of the stricter Senate budget rules, the Senate language is likely to win out over the House language.  Make no mistake about it, a full repeal of the State and local deduction is coming down the pike one way or the other. Voting to advance the GOP bill is a vote to fully repeal State and local deductibility. I say to my Republican friends from all those suburban districts where a high percentage of people use the State and local deduction: If you think the results in Virginia and New Jersey were terrible for you, wait until you pass a bill that raises taxes on large swaths of middle-class families in your district.  The debate over the State and local deduction is illustrative of the central problem my Republican friends have with their tax bill. Every time you pull in one direction and change something to solve a problem, you have to push in another direction, and you end up creating a new one. It is like pushing on a balloon.  Just this morning, Speaker Ryan said the phaseout of middle-class deductions would never happen. They are only there to ``game the Senate rules.'' Well, if there is no phaseout, the real cost of the bill will be much higher. I say to my Senate friends who have talked about making sure we don't let the deficit go out of control that Ryan is saying we are going to let the deficit go out of control and game the Senate rules because the phaseout of middle-class deductions will not happen. If there is no real phaseout, the real cost of the bill will be much higher. It is a tough pill to swallow to anyone in this setting on the Republican side who believes in deficit reduction and who believes about $1.5 trillion--their rule--is about as high as you can go.  All of this is because our Republican colleagues are rushing this bill through. Something like this takes care. It takes hearings. It takes discussion. It takes experts. It takes affected groups all weighing in. That takes a while. That is how it is supposed to work. That is how the Founding Fathers wanted it to work. That is how we did it with the last successful major tax reform bill in 1986. I was there, and I know.  To rush a bill of this magnitude through the Congress in a span of a few weeks, with only one party doing the work, is reckless, it is irresponsible, and it will lead to a very bad result. It is why our Republican colleagues have such problems.  I repeat my plea to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Take a step back and consider doing tax reform the right way--bipartisan, through the committees, input from both sides. We have shown, as in healthcare, when we try, we can work together. The Senator from New Hampshire is on the floor. She was one of the leaders in that.  Earlier this year, we came to a good budget deal. Senators Alexander and Murray put together a reasonable compromise on healthcare. We can do it again on tax reform. We Democrats want to do real reform, but our Republican friends must abandon this partisan, secretive, reckless process that will lead to no good for them and for the country and come to the table with  One final point on the matter, Republicans repeatedly promised that the $1.5 trillion reduction in the corporate tax rate proposed by the Ryan-McConnell tax plan will lead the average American family to receive a $4,000 raise. Yet corporate profits are already at record highs. Wages are relatively stagnant. So color us skeptical that showering corporations with new tax brackets that will result in them having even more money will end up creating higher wages for workers. Far more likely what it will create is another round of stock buybacks and dividends, which, by and large, benefit corporate CEOs and the wealthy.  You don't have to take it from me. David Marberger is the executive vice president and CFO--chief financial officer--of Conagra, which I believe is a major Fortune 500 company. Here is what he told his shareholders this fall, the CFO of Conagra: ``In terms of if there is a corporate tax reduction and there's more cash, we bounce back to our capital allocation''--more stock buybacks.  Republicans think a corporate tax cut without guardrails would boost wages, and we disagree. Later this morning, Democrats will urge our Republican colleagues to put their money where their mouth is and prove us wrong. We will be offering an amendment that would snap back taxes to the old corporate rate if corporations actually fail to boost their workers' wages. It is that simple. Put your money where your mouth is. The only thing you are hanging your hat on, on this bill, which so hurts so many middle-class people is, well, everyone will get a big wage increase because we are reducing the corporate rate. We challenge you to accept our amendment. If the wages don't go up, the corporate decrease in taxes is repealed.  We are simply telling Republicans, don't write checks to corporations that their employees can't cash. If Republicans fail to support this amendment, they will confirm that their tax bill is a farce. They really don't believe it, when it comes to boosting wages for working  Mr.President, one final word on the nomination of Mr.Robb to the The NLRB protects workers' rights to form or join unions, bargain collectively with their employers, and act concertedly for mutual aid or protection. It is not clear to me, from reviewing Mr.Robb's background, that he believes in the mission of the agency.  In his experience as a labor and employment lawyer, he has defended companies against workers' unfair labor practice allegations, age and sex discrimination charges, class action age claims, and wage claims. The website of Mr.Robb's law firm brags about his efforts to delay and defeat union organizing at the Millstone Power Station in He was the lead counsel on the notorious Reagan-era case, which decertified the air traffic controllers' union. That resulted in President Reagan firing 11,000 traffic controllers and barring them from Federal service.  The general counsel for the NLRB sets the priority cases and determines when to bring charges against employers. It is a crucial role. Peter Robb's record shows he is not up to this job, and he will not defend workers in an agency designed to defend workers.  I will be voting no and urge my colleagues to do the same.

8,topic-id,340,"Mr.Speaker, I first want to say, ladies and gentlemen who are here, thank you for being here. I am from Dallas, Texas, and I stand in sorrow for my fellow Texans and the country, for those from Sutherland Springs, Texas, outside of San Antonio, who suffered the mass shooting of this weekend.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today also to highlight an issue that is impacting first-time home buyers in Over the past 8 years, the Department of Justice has penalized many mortgage lenders who participated in the Federal Housing Administration's mortgage insurance program, a program that provides access to mortgages for some of America's first-time home buyers.  Unfortunately, the Department of Justice still continues, even today, to use the False Claims Act to impose penalties on mortgage lenders, many of whom were guilty of only material deficiencies in the loan applications, minor issues that, years later, people came back and tried to find a mistake so that they could pin the tail, pin a fine on some mortgage lender.  My colleagues and I have objected to these actions by the Department of Justice because many of the shortcomings in these loan applications were never intended as efforts to defraud anyone, but merely technical oversights, perhaps facts that might have not been completely known at the time of the loan application.  Many long-time mortgage lenders have exited this program because they cannot risk opening themselves to the penalties that have been imposed, I think, unwisely, by the Department of Justice for mere technical shortcomings of these loans.  So I have been a part of Members who are asking the Department of Justice to impose a moratorium to review what they are doing on the use of the False Claims Act to pursue such violations until the FHA can complete its own taxonomy, which is a set of standards that would impose penalties commensurate with the severity of the offense.

920,topic-id,183,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to call on the Department of Justice to impose a moratorium on its practice of using the False Claims Act to demand settlements from America's mortgage brokers for perceived violations in the loans these lenders made under the Federal Housing Authority's mortgage insurance program.  Simply put, intentional efforts to defraud the Federal Government should be prosecuted and pursued to the fullest extent of the law. However, as the FHA has worked to provide further clarification on the law, the Department of Justice has, unfortunately, focused their efforts on attacking honest mortgage brokers, lenders, and first-time home buyers for infractions as small as a clerical error or a small technical mistake.  The FHA, in conjunction with HUD, is close to finalizing a taxonomy that would allow for a specific and transparent penalty to be imposed for a specific violation of the FHA application loan process. But as Brian Montgomery, the nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Housing, told the Senate Banking Committee last week, the Department of Justice has stepped in front of the We should correct this circumstance.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8646-4.txt,1548,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,8.0,November
1070,topic-id,1187,"Mr.President, it is hard to read or to listen to the news these days without hearing about Russia's interference in our American democracy, its influence peddling, and about the misinformation that has[[Page S7075]]been spreading on social media. I have bipartisan legislation that would address an aspect of this. This legislation is cosponsored by Senator Todd Young, and it is legislation that would give law enforcement the tools they need to create greater transparency about foreign individuals and entities that are operating in the United States in the interest of other governments. It would make it easier for the public to better track information they are receiving, particularly from governments that are hostile to the United  This bill would give the Department of Justice necessary authority to investigate potential violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which is also known as We have heard a lot about that. This was legislation that was passed during the thirties, as there was fear about the rise of Nazism and Hitler in Germany and the effort to spread propaganda in the United  This would allow the American public to clearly trace where information is coming from and who is paying for it. I think, in this age of misinformation, that is especially important to the public.  At a time when our law enforcement officials, foreign policy experts, and leaders continue to grapple with the extent of Russia's intrusion into our democratic elections, this legislation is more urgent than ever. The need for this legislation is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the case of Russian propaganda networks like RT America and Sputnik Both networks continually propagate and share content and programming that are designed to very subtly confuse and influence audiences worldwide. If you have ever listened to either of those channels, you will know there is just this subtle difference in how they present information.  In the United States, RT America is available on cable TVs across the country. It is considered to be one of the most high-profile assets in Vladimir Putin's vast $1.4 billion propaganda machine.  According to an assessment made public by the U.intelligence community in January, RT is the Kremlin's ``principal international outlet,'' and it is integral to Russia's information warfare operations across the globe. The Kremlin selects the staff for RT and closely supervises RT's coverage, including disinformation and false news stories designed to undermine our democracy. If you have any question about that, watch RT here. It is on the cable network here in the DC area.  RT News has publicly boasted that it can dodge our laws by claiming to be financed by a nonprofit organization and not by the Russian Recently, the Department of Justice asked RT America to, in fact, register as a foreign agent. RT rejected an entirely reasonable request from the Justice Department to respect our laws. They refused to register.  How did we respond? Well, we continued to allow RT America to spread its disinformation and false narratives. This is unacceptable. We responded that way because we don't have the teeth we need in the law to be able to enforce it. That is what my legislation with Senator Young will do. That is why it is so important. It would strengthen FARA by giving the Department of Justice authority to compel foreign organizations to produce documentation to confirm funding sources and foreign connections. This new investigative authority was requested by the Department of Justice, and it is supported by the Government Accountability Office, the Sunlight Foundation, and the Project on Government This is a good government piece of legislation.  In fact, if this authority that we have in our legislation were in place today, the Justice Department could immediately investigate RT America and publicly expose its ties to the In the absence of such authority, all the Justice Department can do is ask RT to voluntarily adhere to FARA regulations and hope the propaganda outlet complies. What are the odds of that? Pretty slim. Clearly, based on RT's refusal to comply with FARA, the Kremlin is well aware of the limitations that are inherent in our law.  As we wait for this commonsense legislation to move forward, the Kremlin, RT America, and Sputnik continue to wield their harmful propaganda and attempt to influence the American public.  Since the publication of the intelligence community's January report on Russia's interference in our 2016 Presidential election, we have learned that Moscow spent millions of dollars buying ads on social media sites and search engines, often using the very clips that had been aired by RT on its YouTube channel.  Last week, representatives of American social media companies testified before Congress and illustrated the lengths the Kremlin went in order to deceptively spread divisive propaganda, all seemingly without a trace or any clear indication about the origins of these ads and RT's news blasts.  The misinformation included numerous reports run by RT News on supposed U.election fraud and voting. So they spread, and they clearly intended to spread confusion about our elections in 2016 to try and encourage people to believe our elections don't work, to undermine our election process. They talked about machine vulnerabilities. They claimed the results of U.elections could not be trusted and did not reflect the people's will. Sadly, too many people saw those stories and believed they were real.  These are not just random examples of fake news. These stories are part and parcel of a broader influence campaign designed and directed by the Kremlin's leadership and pedaled by government-funded trolls in Petersburg and other front organizations. So in the same way that Russia is building up its military force, its navy, its ability to operate in space, and its missile program, it has also built up its propaganda campaign in ways that are designed to undermine Western democracies. If we don't pay attention to this, then shame on us.  We are, of course, a resilient democracy. We are confident that our values and institutions will prevail in the free marketplace of ideas. Our Constitution, unlike Russia's, protects the right of individuals and organizations to spread Russian viewpoints, disinformation, and, even, outright lies. But no organization, including RT America or any other front outlet for a country that is hostile to the United States, has the right to conceal a foreign funding source and thumb its nose at requests from our Department of  The American people have a right to know if RT America is a Russian propaganda organization that takes its direction from the They have a right to know who is funding those programs and what kind of misinformation they are spreading.  To that end, I urge my colleagues to put an end to the Kremlin's charade by supporting the Foreign Agents Registration Modernization and Enforcement Let's give the Department of Justice the tools it needs to investigate and expose RT America and to fight back against the Kremlin's interference in our democracy.

1094,topic-id,1283,"Mr.President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, and congratulate her and Senator Alexander on being able to reach agreement to move forward to address the uncertainty in the marketplace.  Like Senator Murray, I also want to begin with what we are seeing going on in this open enrollment period. Despite all of the efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, to shorten the time[[Page S7090]]period in which people can sign up, to make it more difficult by having the site closed for part of Sundays, we are seeing a record number of people enroll in the initial days of open enrollment.  According to news reports, on the first day alone, about 1 million people visited healthcare.gov and more than 200,000 people selected a plan for 2018. That is almost double the number who signed up last year on the first day.  For anybody who is still thinking about it, you have until December 15, so sign up early. As my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Hassan, says, it is the best Christmas shopping you can do--take care of your healthcare. Go to healthcare.gov and shop around, get the best deal, and enroll during this open enrollment period.  This surge in signups is especially remarkable in light of the widely publicized efforts by the Trump administration to depress enrollment. The administration has slashed the advertising and outreach budget by 90 percent, cut the open onrollment period by half, and shut down the marketplace website for 12 hours on Sundays, taking away valuable weekend hours when people have free time to explore plans.  I think the healthy volume of enrollments sends two very important messages.  First, it shows again that ordinary citizens, faith groups, insurance navigators, and other private organizations have done an amazing job of filling the outreach void that has been created by this effort by the administration to cut back on letting people know about the website and how to enroll. Those folks have spent countless hours getting out the word that the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land and that those who qualify for financial assistance can purchase high-quality, affordable coverage.  The second message that I think is important from this strong enrollment is a message that has been echoed in recent public opinion polls. It is one that we saw in the turnout in the Virginia elections last night. It is that a clear majority of the American people support the Affordable Care Act, that they reject efforts to sabotage it and they want Members of Congress to work together to strengthen it, just as Senator Murray said.  I am very pleased that we have come together in the Senate to do just that. We have come together in support of bipartisan efforts led by Senator Murray and Senator Lamar Alexander, the chair and ranking member of the HELP They have come together to stabilize the Affordable Care Act and the marketplaces and bring down premiums. I am proud to be one of the 12 Democrats who were original cosponsors with 12 Republicans of this legislation. This balanced agreement, which was negotiated by Senators Alexander and Murray over many months, is our best bet for restoring stability to the marketplaces in the short run and giving us the time we need to negotiate longer term to deal with other changes to the health law to make it work better.  I am especially pleased that the Alexander-Murray agreement provides for the continuation of cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, which are payments that are necessary to keep premiums, deductibles, and copayments affordable for working families. They are extended for 2 years in this bill. Without these payments, the cost of coverage will skyrocket, insurers will leave the marketplaces--as we have already seen, as the Trump administration has said they are going to discontinue those payments--and millions of people will lose their health coverage. This is an opportunity for us to keep that from happening. Both Democrats and Republicans have recognized that these cost-sharing reduction payments, these CSRs, are an orderly, necessary subsidy that keeps down the cost of health coverage for everyday  In recent months, I have heard from hundreds of people across New Hampshire about the enormous difference that healthcare reform has made in their lives. We are a small State--we have just over 1.3 million people--but nearly 94,000 Granite Staters have gotten individual health coverage through the Obama marketplace, and nearly 50,000 have gotten coverage thanks to the Medicaid expansion, which had bipartisan support in New So that is about a tenth of New Hampshire that is covered either through the Affordable Care Act or through the expansion of And for us in New Hampshire, it has been particularly critical in responding and providing treatment to those people with substance use disorders.  Patricia Tucker has written to me. She is a substance use disorder counselor in Northfield, NH, and she talks about how grateful she is for the Medicaid expansion. She writes:       I am seeing people come for help that were not able to get      help in the past because they couldn't afford it. They are      getting help and remaining abstinent. If one mother gets      clean, this affects so many others.  She goes on to say:       [I treat] one mother who has two children. She now cares      for these children and has a full-time job. In the past, she      lived off the state and did not care for anyone, including      herself. Multiply this by thousands, just in New Hampshire,      and this makes such a big difference.  And think about how across the country we have affected people with substance use disorders because they can now get treatment.  I agree with Patricia Tucker and so many others who have contacted me about the Affordable Care We are grateful for the progress, and we refuse to be taken backward. That is why the bipartisan agreement hammered out by Senator Alexander and Senator Murray is such an important breakthrough. This agreement stands on its merits as a good-faith, win-win compromise. But just as important and maybe even more important, these two Senators have given us a template for bipartisan negotiations on other critical matters that lie ahead, including tax reform, reauthorizing the community health centers and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and reaching an agreement on the 2018 budget.  The Senate is at its best when we observe regular order, when we honor the committee process, and when we work across the aisle and make principled compromises and get big things done for the American people.  In a Senate that is nearly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, bipartisanship is the only productive way forward. This is how the great majority of Americans want us to conduct the Senate's business, and this is especially true on matters such as healthcare and tax reform that impact families in New Hampshire and all across  I am grateful to people across our country who have gotten out the word about the health insurance open enrollment period that began on November 1 and continues through December 15. I am heartened by the surge in enrollments. I am encouraged by bipartisan progress in the Senate to stabilize the health insurance marketplaces. I certainly hope the leadership in the Senate allows this bill to come to the floor because we know we have the votes to pass it.  Instead of partisan efforts to undermine the law and take health insurance away from people, let's embrace the spirit of the Alexander-Murray agreement. Let's work together in a good-faith, bipartisan fashion to build a healthcare system that leaves no American behind.  Thank you, Mr. I yield the floor.

424,topic-id,213,"Mr.Speaker, in a time of national strife that we see our Nation in every now and then, it is good to remember history.  Mr.Speaker, 180 years ago yesterday, a man named Elijah Parish Lovejoy was run out of Louis city for writing and publishing an abolitionist newspaper called the Louis He then moved across to Alton, Illinois, where he continued to advocate the end of slavery.  On the 7th of November, 1837, Lovejoy received a new press. Many of his printing presses were thrown into the river. When he got the new press from the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society, the local slave owners heard about the arrival of the new machine and they decided to destroy it.  A group of his friends attempted to protect it, but during the attack, Lovejoy was shot in the head and died. Elijah Parish Lovejoy was America's first martyr to freedom of the press. Of course, we debate the press, but the press is still an important institution in our society.  In 1952, the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award was established and it is given to a member of the newspaper profession who continues the Lovejoy heritage of fearlessly defending freedom.  Mr.Speaker, I think it is important to come back and remember a great moment in our history.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8608-3.txt,1527,SAVE LOCAL BUSINESS ACT,2017.0,8.0,November
575,topic-id,167,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Republican tax plan. As I have said many times before, this plan gives tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations, over the needs of American families, while adding a predicted $2.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.  Particularly devastating for New Jersey is the partial elimination of the State and local tax deduction. More than 25 percent of New Jerseyans would face a tax hike over the next decade due to this change.  Per person, New Jersey taxpayers paid $3,478 more in Federal taxes in 2015 than they received from the government, more than any other Not only would the bill aggravate this disparity in New Jersey, it would also eliminate vital deductions that give relief to those burdened with high medical costs, student debt, and unexpected losses due to natural disasters.  Mr.Speaker, I will not support a one-sided plan that harms New Jersey and those who are most in need of tax relief.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8606-3.txt,1818,BILLIONAIRES-FIRST TAX BILL,2017.0,8.0,November
140,topic-id,755,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, the Securities Act of 1933, which, obviously, was put into effect after the Depression or while it was going on, governs current law regarding the sale and purchase of securities like stocks, bonds, or options. The intent behind this law is to require that investors receive necessary information about the securities and to prevent fraud when they are sold.[[Page H8610]]  To achieve this, the Securities and Exchange Commission currently prohibits the sale or delivery of securities that have not been registered with the agency, with some limited exemptions. Today, these exceptions are usually limited to those transactions made with sophisticated investors who understand the associated risks.  H.2201 would weaken the Securities Act unnecessarily by adding an entirely new exemption for certain issuers while removing important disclosure requirements.  Let me say that again: while removing important disclosure requirements, in other words, to know what you are buying.  It would leave investors vulnerable to fraud by allowing companies to sell unregistered securities without the important guardrails that apply to these transactions today. It is part of the majority's agenda that prioritizes deregulation above all else.  Through the Congressional Review Act and many other bills, the majority has been relentlessly attacking safeguards that protect consumers--risking our health, our safety, and our finances. This is all in order to make it easier for corporations to engage in questionable business practices.  Who loses in the giveaway to big corporations and bad actors? The American people do.  Mr.Speaker, I have always believed that a bad process leads to a bad product. This week has put the majority in the history books for all the wrong reasons.  Closed rules completely block Members from offering amendments on the House floor, and just yesterday, with the 49th closed rule of the year, this majority broke the record for becoming the most closed session of Congress in history. That is a long time.  Let me repeat that. This session of the 115th Congress is the most closed session ever. In fact, our present Speaker has not had an open rule.  This is not some arcane matter. More than 1,300 amendments have been blocked this year through the restrictive rules. It has prevented action on matters that touch nearly every sector of society.  This week we saw another mass shooting in a church. Families gathered together in a small Texas town, and a man with a gun came in and killed 26 of them and wounded 20 more. One family lost eight of its cherished members. Those killed in that attack equal 7 percent of the small town's entire population.  Now, this Congress could work together and actually stop these tragic murders because this is the place where we can do that, but under the majority, we can't even get a vote on any measure that would do anything about it.  If you care about whether we send troops to war in Afghanistan and Syria--if you care--then closed rules matter.  If you care about protecting whistleblowers or reducing government spending, then closed rules matter.  If you care about whether we build the President's offensive border wall with Mexico or strengthen ethics in the executive branch, then closed rules matter.  If you care about protecting the nearly 800,000 young DREAMers nationwide, then closed rules definitely matter.  The majority has used restrictive closed and structured rules to prevent debate and votes on these and many, many other important matters from ever happening here on the House floor.  Each of us has been elected to do our job representing our constituents by amending legislation on this floor, but because of the closed process, we are being prevented from doing our jobs.  Bills routinely come before the Rules Committee that haven't even been fully considered by the relevant committees. Such a bill is before us today.  When Speaker Ryan took the gavel 2 years ago, he said: ``Only a fully functioning House can really, truly do the people's business.'' Well, Mr.Speaker, we are not doing the peoples business. We are unable to do the job we were sent here to do. We are unable to take action on the things our constituents care about most.  It is no wonder that this Congress is the most unpopular Congress in recent memory. It is past time that we return to regular order and start tackling the major issues that we face.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-11-08-pt1-PgH8609-4.txt,1069,0915,2017.0,8.0,November

Mr.Speaker, unnecessary, partisan bills like this one take up valuable floor time when we could be considering important legislation to extend expired programs like Perkins loans, which help low-income students finance their education, or to address gun violence. The American people are frightened of an agenda that prioritizes deregulation and corporations above all else.  Democrats have been pushing for votes on the House floor on amendments that would actually address the[[Page H8612]]major problems we are facing today. That includes everything from climate change and our military's role abroad to protecting the DACA recipients and addressing the gun violence epidemic that is tearing communities apart. But we have been blocked at every turn.  The majority has gone to unprecedented lengths to prevent any kind of real debate from happening. We have proof of that because they have used closed and structured rules to block more than 1,300 amendments so far this year. So far, this session is the most closed session of Congress since Congress began.  It is no wonder that just 13 percent of the public approves of Congress under this leadership.

297,topic-id,242,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.3441, the Save Local Business  I have heard from employers across my district in many industries--agriculture, higher ed, staffing agencies, hospitality, and construction--about this issue. Under the flawed NLRB standard, not only employers are confused, but employees, as well, have little certainty as to their status with multiple employers.  Mr.Speaker, for 25 years, I owned and operated a construction company in Lancaster County, and we were operated as subcontractors. Back then, the employer-employee relationship was clear. There was no question about which employer was responsible for each employee.  The Browning-Ferris decision creates confusion about who works for whom, discouraging many larger contractors from giving small subcontractors a job for fear of increased liability. Mr.Speaker, had that existed when I was growing a company, it would have made it more difficult to expand our business and create more jobs in our community.  The Browning-Ferris decision was politically motivated and upended a decades-old standard that worked very well among employers and employees. According to the HR Policy Association, litigation regarding the joint employer standard is at a record high. This decision, Mr.Speaker, has been a jackpot for trial lawyers.  It is time Congress takes action to provide clarity for the thousands of businesses, both large and small, who are ready to expand and create jobs. The Save Local Business Act will provide this clarity, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgH8566.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,7.0,November

1002,topic-id,1499,"Mr.President, I first wish to thank my friend, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, for his very important words.                        Nomination of Peter Robb  Mr.President, I rise at this point to say a few words about one of President Trump's nominees whom we will be voting on in a few minutes.  The National Labor Relations Board is a crucial tool for protecting working men and women in Michigan and across the country. The right to collectively bargain, the freedom to be able to bargain for fair wages, good benefits, retirement security, safe and fair workplaces--all of these things depend on a National Labor Relations Board that works--that works for people.  Perhaps no person at the NLRB is more critical to protecting these rights than is the NLRB's General When a worker believes that the law has been violated and brings their concern to the National Labor Relations Board, it is the General Counsel who investigates. If the employee is found to have violated the law or the freedoms and rights of working men and women, it is the General Counsel who takes action to make things right.  Unfortunately, while President Trump talks a lot about having our workers' backs--he certainly said that a lot in Michigan--his actions speak much louder than his words. That is certainly true in the case of his choice for General Counsel, Peter  Mr.Robb was voted out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in October without any Democratic support--and there was a reason for that. The reason is that during his career, he has shown so little support for working men and women across our country.  When Dominion Energy's workers at the Millstone Power Station in Connecticut attempted to use their freedom to organize--one of the freedoms in America is to be able to come together, to be able to organize, to be able to collectively bargain on behalf of yourself and others to make sure you are able to get fair pay and a pension and safe working conditions. But when the people at the Millstone Power Station in Connecticut attempted to do that, Mr.Robb, who represented Dominion, delayed the election for more than 2 years. Not only that, he bragged about it on his law firm's website--making people who wanted to exercise their freedom to collectively bargain and to organize wait for 2 years.  Mr.Robb also was lead counsel on the case that led to 11,000 air traffic controllers being fired--people, again, who were part of a union and could collectively bargain for safe conditions and good pay and pensions. They were fired and barred from Federal service. It was a watershed case in the history of union suppression, in taking away people's freedoms.  While he worked for a Reagan-appointed NLRB member, longstanding[[Page S7053]]policies changed to weaken the government's ability to enforce the rights and freedoms of working men and women.  With stagnant wages and rising healthcare costs and worries about pension cuts and workplace discrimination, frankly, I know working men and women in Michigan and across the country have enough to worry about. They shouldn't have to worry that the person who is supposed to have their back is, instead, looking for ways to strip away their freedom to organize on the job.  That is why I will vote no on Peter Robb, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.                               Healthcare  Mr.President, I wish to turn now to another very important topic. I have been speaking about workers, and now I wish to speak about our children and standing up for our children.  Every year, 9 million children receive health insurance through a very successful program called the Children's Health Insurance Children from low- and middle-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid--working families--are able to receive healthcare through CHIP, and every year, 25 million people, including 300,000 veterans and 7.5 million children, receive medical care from community health centers in cities and towns and rural communities all across Michigan and across the country. That is 9 million children who can see a doctor when they get sick or hurt, and that is millions of parents who don't have to lie awake at night, worrying about what will happen the next time their child falls, breaks an arm, gets strep throat, or something even worse.  Thanks to Republican inaction, these millions of parents do now have to worry.  It has been 38 days since the Republican leadership let funding expire for the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers--38 days and counting--38 days when we could have been working together to fund these important programs. Yet that didn't happen, even though they have bipartisan support. That is 38 days of telling children and hard-working families who use these programs that they don't matter as much as other things we are doing.  For the longest time, the Children's Health Insurance Program and community health centers have received strong bipartisan support, and that is true today. If these programs--a bill that came out of the Finance Committee and a bill that Senator Roy Blunt and I have introduced--were brought to the floor, they would get strong bipartisan support--if we could get them on the floor.  We are hearing from more than 1,000 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart Association, the March of Dimes, and the National Association of Counties, all urging us to take up the CHIP bill and to pass it--the 5-year extension, which is so critical.  Senator Hatch on the Finance Committee, of which I am proud to be a member, has worked with Senator Wyden, with me, and with others to put together a good bill, a 5-year reauthorization of CHIP, on a bipartisan basis, and 70 Members of this body, led by Senator Roy Blunt and myself, have signed a letter of support for continuing funding for community health centers. Senator Blunt and I, with eight other Democrats and eight Republicans, have put in a bill to do that.  We know the support is there. The problem is, we cannot get it brought up on the floor as a priority for the  As I mentioned, this crucial funding expired 38 days ago--more than a month ago. Over those 38 days, the Senate has taken up 54 record rollcall votes, Republicans passed their budget, and we have considered 16 nominees. But we haven't considered over the past 38 days the 9 million children who depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program to stay healthy and the 25 million patients who use community health centers.  We might be 38 days late, but there is no time like today to make children and families a top priority. These programs are a big deal in my Before CHIP, too many hard-working families in Michigan couldn't afford to take their children to the doctor. Now, 97 percent of our children in Michigan can go to the doctor. Moms and dads can take their children to the doctor because of what has been put together around health insurance, making health insurance available in Michigan--the highest percentage ever--97 percent.  Last year, Michigan's community health centers treated more than 680,000 patients, including 12,710 veterans.  Having access to health insurance and healthcare we know is life-changing and even lifesaving.  Just ask Jan of Davison, MI, whose daughter Suzi was covered by MIChild--what we call CHIP, actually MIChild--in Suzi was diagnosed with ADHD as a child and later with bipolar disorder. In Jan's words:       Without having access to quality health care, we would have      been lost. And thanks to MIChild coverage, we are able to      afford the help she so desperately needed.  Today, Suzi is a high school graduate and plans to go to community college.  Albert, a resident of Owosso, MI, knows the value of community health centers. He had graduated from high school and was taking college classes. He had a great full-time job with health benefits. He said that it was like a dream come true--until it stopped. Work dried up. In a matter of months, Albert lost his job, his insurance, and his home.  He fell into a deep depression--and many of us would have done the same. But Albert was lucky. A friend noticed that he was struggling and urged him to visit Great Lakes Bay Health Within 2 weeks, he had a medical appointment; 3 days after that, he was speaking with a community health center counselor. As Albert said, ``It happened so fast, there was no time for me to fall through the cracks.''  Today he is running a local business and has his confidence back. He has lost 50 pounds and stopped drinking. He has rebuilt his relationships with his family. And he is now giving back to the very clinic that changed his life, serving on the board of Great Lakes Bay Health  All of the children and the people who receive coverage and care from CHIP and community health centers can tell their stories.

I would like to also thank the ranking member from Minnesota for his good-faith effort and his work. We worked in a collaborative way to address his concerns.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to thank my colleague from Columbus, Joyce Beatty; and my other colleague from Columbus, Pat Tiberi, for their work in a bipartisan fashion for making this bill better, helping this bill pass the I hope we can get it passed in the Senate here shortly as well.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud to speak today in support of the bill that will designate the National Veterans Memorial and Museum being built in Columbus, Ohio, as America's National Veterans Memorial and  The National Veterans Memorial and Museum will serve as a civic landmark to honor, connect, inspire, and educate all Americans about the service and sacrifice of our Nation's 22 million veterans. It will be the only public museum of its kind that exists for the exclusive role of sharing the experiences of veterans across all eras, conflicts, and branches of military service.  You might ask: Why would we want to do this in Columbus, Ohio?  Well, first and foremost, Ohio has the sixth largest veterans population in the United States, and it is easily accessible to almost anyone in the United We are within a 10-hour's drive of almost 60 percent of the veterans in the United  I believe that it is going to be a great opportunity to have not everything in Washington, D.C., but have it out in the rest of the country.  Ohio is a great place of military history. Ohio was recently selected to be the future home of the United States Veterans Affairs National Archives in Dayton, and that will make sure that military records dating back to the Revolutionary War are kept there.  Ohio is the birthplace of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and that is one of the earliest adopted veterans service organizations.  This museum will also be, and is, supported by veterans service organizations around the country, and we want to thank them for that.  A lot of veterans have worked hard to make that happen. For example, Colonel Tom Moe, a Vietnam veteran and a POW who flew 85 missions, is leading Veterans' Outreach for the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, and he is part of the Veterans' Advisory Committee working closely with the VSOs across the country to make sure this museum is truly a national reflection of veterans and their stories.  Additionally, the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation is managing this project. They are a 501(c)(3) that will operate, fund, and manage the museum, led by a national board of directors, including veterans, veterans service organizations, and the families of America's veterans. This 501(c)(3)'s mission will remain focused on ensuring that the museum conveys the reverence owed to our veterans of yesterday and today, as well as tomorrow.  Mr.Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Roe for his leadership in this legislation and allowing this to go through regular order through the Veterans' Affairs There were hearings. It was a collaborative process, and we worked to address some issues from the other side of the aisle. We worked in a good-faith effort.  I think we came up with a good solution that ensures that this museum will have the highest standards and will be representative of the national designation in a way that we can all be proud of.  I am convinced that both the minority and majority staff wanted to make this museum the greatest it can be, and I want to thank them for all their efforts.  We were able to hear from VSOs testifying in support of this museum that included The American Legion, the VFW, the Paralyzed Veterans of I believe that through their testimony and our work, there was a lot of great information that was exchanged, and we are excited to move forward with the National Veterans Memorial and  One last point is that this museum was funded with private donations. It requires no Federal funding to open the doors. I believe that is another competitive advantage.

436,topic-id,1012,"Mr.President, today I wish to pay tribute to an Alabamian who has spent more than two decades in public service, Peggi  Many people in Washington, DC, know Peggi as the executive assistant and gatekeeper to the former Alabama Senator, Jeff Sessions, who is now the U.Attorney For more than 20 years, Jeff Sessions has been a strong leader on the issues of legal reform and immigration. In order to speak with Jeff Sessions on any issue, you had to go through  Peggi has earned praise from the countless people she has worked alongside throughout the years. Here are a few statements from her former colleagues.  Attorney General Sessions stated:       Peggi has been at the center of everything we have      accomplished in public service. She loves America and its      ideals, is smart, decisive, loyal, and a total professional.      She speaks up for the high principles she believes in, and      for two decades has been the key point of contact in our      office for thousands of Alabamians and Americans all over the      She has provided invaluable service to me, the      Nation, and the so many who she trained and mentored. Though      we will miss her marvelous contributions, we wish her all the      best as she and Kevin embark on this next adventure.  Kate Hollis, then-Senator Sessions' former scheduler, said the following:       For 14 years I had the pleasure of working side by side      with Peggi for Senator Jeff We were a great team      and became great friends during that time. I can attest that      she was one of the hardest working people in the United      States Senate who always went the extra mile to assist      Senator Sessions and our staff, as well as our constituents      from the great State of  Pete Landrum, former military legislative assistant under former Senator Sessions, stated:       Peggi Hanrahan is a great colleague and friend. She is a      person that can be depended on when things are good or when      things are bad--it doesn't matter.  Danielle Cutrona, counselor to the Attorney General, said:       Peggi is an institution in our office. Her loyalty and      dedication to then-Senator, now Attorney General Sessions and      to his staff has been unwavering. I am grateful to have had      the opportunity to work with Peggi all these years and will      miss her tremendously.  Michael Brumas, former press secretary for Senator Sessions, said:       The phrase `best in the business' certainly applies to      Peggi Hanrahan, who served for more than two decades as Jeff      Sessions' executive assistant, first in the Senate and then      at the Department of In many ways Peggi was the      backbone of the Senate office, with a knack for solving those      administrative dilemmas that always crop up in a busy Senate      office as well making sure the senator stuck to his active      schedule--not always an easy task.  Senator Sessions' first chief of staff in the Senate, Armand DeKyser, said the following:       From the earliest days of Senator Sessions' tenure when      Peggi began sitting just outside Jeff's transition office,      she never was more than 20 feet from his desk. She was THE      constant among all the many staff that worked for Senator and      now Attorney General Jeff Her calm demeanor      combined with a wonderful work ethic are so very vital to the      successful operation of a complex staff operation. She was      composed, efficient and trustworthy on the most harried of      days--a presidential inauguration, a swearing-in, or even the      fateful 9/11 day. Even on a normal day--if there is ever one      of those--Peggi's demonstrated support both up and down the      ladder of responsibility was one of her best traits and one      most admired by all.  Alan Hanson, now Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, said:       Peggi Hanrahan is a national treasure. She is both a      trusted confidante and an invaluable colleague. While she      will be sorely missed by all of us, her retirement is both      hard earned and well deserved.  Paige Hanson, a former Sessions staffer, said:       While I know the Attorney General will miss the benefit of      having Peggi around, we are truly happy for her and grateful      for her service and friendship.  Stephen Boyd, former communications director for Senator Sessions and now Assistant Attorney General, said:       It is difficult to overstate the important role that Peggi      played for all those years in the Senate office. If things      got done, it was usually because Peggi made it happen. Her      service to then-Senator and now Attorney General Sessions,      the Senate, and to the people of Alabama has been tremendous.      She is one of many who asked not for recognition[[Page S7014]]     or public appreciation, but only for the opportunity to serve      her country alongside a leader she respected. It was a      pleasure to work with her for many years, and I certainly      hope that she enjoys the retirement that she has clearly      earned.  Finally, Rick Dearborn, Senator Sessions' longtime chief of staff and now White House Deputy Chief of Staff, said:       Peggi Hanrahan was an extraordinary member of Senator      Sessions' former Senate staff. She is part schoolmarm, part      drill sergeant, with a pinch of traffic cop and a spoonful of      soft marshmallows all rolled into one. Indispensable in the      Senator's office, Peggi made it all run. She organized the      Senator's office, our lives, his life, kept up with all our      constituents and friends back home, both with personal notes      she and the Senator would spend significant time on and      checkup calls. She'd place those calls with his good friends      back home, often early in the morning and after hours. She      was, along with Kate Hollis, the Senator's scheduler, the      glue that held us all together. It would have been impossible      to manage the Senator's office without her. She was my Senate      colleague, my teammate, and continues to be my very dear      friend. I wish her and her husband Kevin the absolute best as      they enter the next chapter of their lives, separate from the      two institutions they served so well, the Senate and the       On behalf of the people of Alabama, I want to join all of those who are wishing Peggi and Kevin a very happy retirement.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-11-06-pt1-PgS7013-2.txt,99999999999999,0915,2017.0,6.0,November

281,topic-id,1781,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding and for his continued leadership on behalf of America's workers.  Mr.Speaker, more and more employees today are working for a company whose name is not on the front of their office building. Instead of hiring employees directly, companies are renting employees from staffing agencies. Let me say that again. Companies are renting employees from staffing agencies and then evading responsibility for upholding the rights of those workers, even as they profit from their work.  For decades, sensible joint employment standards under the Fair Labor Standards Act have ensured that workers can hold employers accountable for violating wage and hour laws.  Instead of refining those standards to reflect the complex relationship between workers and employers in today's economy, this legislation sets a dramatically and intentionally narrow standard so that no large corporation can be held accountable if their contractors violate workplace laws.  Mr.Speaker, I include a letter of support in the Record, a letter by the National Employment Law Project and signed by more than 200 organizations opposing H.3441 because it opens the door to widespread wage theft and hurts law-abiding small businesses.     Paul Ryan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House of Representatives,     Washington,     Virginia Foxx,     House of Representatives,     Washington,     Robert Scott,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairwoman Foxx and      Ranking Member Scott: The undersigned organizations write in      opposition to H.3441, the so-called Save Local Business      Act, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)      and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to prevent      workers from holding more than one employer jointly      accountable for wage theft, child labor, equal pay      violations, or unfair labor practices even when the employers      jointly exercise and share control over working conditions.       Under our nation's long-standing laws dating back as far as      the late 1800s, employers who share control with their      subcontractors over working conditions may also share      accountability as joint employers for violations of workers'      rights so that they will provide better oversight of working      conditions, and in so doing, ensure broader compliance with      basic labor and employment laws.       H.3441 seeks to dramatically narrow the long-standing      definitions of ``employer'' in the FLSA and NLRA and it is      neither good for workers nor for law-abiding businesses. H.3441 opens the door to widespread wage theft and worker harms in    occupations across the economy, including in our nation's growth                                industries       The bill would undermine protections for millions of      workers across the economy, especially in low-wage sectors      where subcontracting is common: construction, agriculture,      garment, janitorial, home care, delivery and logistics,      warehousing, retail, temp and staffing, and manufacturing,      just to name a few.       Wage theft and other workplace dangers are prevalent in      many of these jobs, and even under current law, millions of      workers today are no longer sure who their boss is--and      indeed, have no way to navigate the intricacies of companies'      contracting relationships to ascertain who is responsible for      workplace violations. When there's no clear line of      accountability, work conditions are more likely to      deteriorate: pay declines, wage theft increases, and      workplace injuries rise. In addition, outsourced jobs pay      less--sometimes as much as 30 percent less--than in-house      jobs, likely due to a lack of worker and subcontractor      bargaining power. In today's economy, we should be looking      for ways to increase workers' pay and economic security, not      laying the groundwork for more sweatshops.       When a subcontractor cannot pay, joint employer standards      ensure that workers have remedies against the contracting      company for the legal violations. Workers should be able to      recover when cheated out of wages, exposed to dangerous      working conditions, or otherwise treated unlawfully.        This bill would also impede workers from bringing equal      pay claims to close the gender pay gap. Because the Equal Pay      Act is a part of the FLSA, and uses the FLSA's definition of      an employer, H.3441 would make it harder for subcontracted      workers to hold their employers accountable for gender-based      pay discrimination.    The bill actually hurts, not helps, law-abiding small businesses       Although framed as a bill to help protect the independence      of small businesses, including those that operate as      franchisees, the bill would in fact insulate corporations,      including franchisors, from liability. Unscrupulous      businesses that employ abusive labor contractors to cheat      workers would gain a competitive advantage over law-abiding      businesses. In addition, franchisees whose business practices      are all but dictated to them by larger corporations will be      hung out to dry for decisions that aren't their own, without      any indemnification from the entity that often all but forces      labor and employment violations on them.       Corporations that engage low-road contractors and then look      the other way gain an unfair advantage over companies that      play by the rules, resulting in a race to the bottom that      rewards cheaters. It's one reason why the job quality of what      were formerly middle-class jobs in America is suffering      today. Working people struggle enough in today's economy.       Don't let Congress make this worse by legislatively rigging      the system in favor of corporations that don't care about the      workers who build their businesses. Oppose H.3441.

282,topic-id,175,"Mr.Speaker, from 2001 to 2013, Wal-Mart was contracting with three warehouses in my community, and those warehouses contracted out their staffing to a company that was accused of committing egregious wage and hour law violations.  Thanks to the FLSA joint employer standard, 1,700 warehouse workers were able to reach a $22 million settlement to collect the pay that they were owed from their employer. Under this bill, they would likely have gotten nothing.  The questions we face today are: Will millions of workers, like the warehouse workers in my district, lose what little power they have left to fight against wage theft; will organized workers lose the basic right to bring all responsible parties to the table to collectively bargain for better wages and workplaces; will shrewd corporations be allowed to claim immunity from the laws that protect employees; and, most of all, will the people's House stand with the people or stand with the corporations that continue to rig the economy against the American worker?

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.3122, as amended, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act of 2017, and thank the bill's sponsor, the congressman from Pennsylvania (Mr.Cartwright), for introducing it.  Veterans who served during wartime, and their spouses, may be eligible to receive pension benefits if they meet certain income and other eligibility requirements. Such veterans and survivors may also be eligible for additional financial benefits, known as Aid and Attendance, if the applicant needs assistance performing personal functions required in everyday living such as bathing, feeding, and dressing.  Now, VA does not charge veterans and their families to apply for Aid and Attendance benefits. In addition, veterans service organizations, such as The American Legion and VFW, offer free assistance to veterans and their families who wish to apply for this benefit.  Yet, in all parts of the country, some individuals attempt to charge fees for helping veterans apply for Aid and Attendance benefits. According to organizations, such as AARP and the Federal Trade Commission, senior veterans have increasingly become subject to scams involving insurance agents and financial planners trying to convince veterans to make quick decisions about pursuing Aid and Attendance in addition to their pension incomes. Some scammers use false representations such as suggesting automatic entitlement to benefits.  Of greater concern, though, are those who help the veteran restructure financial assets in order to qualify for pension and/or Aid and For example, moving financial assets into a pooled-asset irrevocable trust might render a veteran eligible for pension and Aid and Attendance, despite having assets in excess of the qualifying income thresholds.  While it appears that this would benefit the veteran, what these salesmen do not tell them is that this type of restructuring might preclude them from Medicaid eligibility because of rules such as a 5-year look-back period, which considers whether one has moved substantial assets at less than market value.  H.3122, as amended, would require that VA post warnings on its website about dishonest individuals who would charge fees to this very vulnerable group of veterans and their families to help beneficiaries apply for pension with Aid and Attendance benefits.  Now, this bill would also require GAO to submit a report to Congress on the types of standards used by Federal and State agencies intended to protect vulnerable populations from financial exploitation, an analysis of the types of financial exploitation facing veterans who are eligible for Aid and Attendance benefits, and any other gaps and efforts to address these issues.  H.3122, the Veterans Care Financial Protection Act, enjoys broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives as well as from our veterans service organizations. I want to also acknowledge the work of the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chairman Mike Bost and Ranking Member Elizabeth Esty for their efforts to protect veterans.

Mr.Speaker, H.3562 requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide funding for home adaptations for severely disabled veterans within the Vocational, Rehabilitation, and Employment, or VR&E, program.  Currently, VA provides severely disabled veterans assistance to lead a more independent life through the VR&E program, which can include help with adaptive housing. However, as their name suggests, VR&E counselors are primarily trained to provide vocational and employment assistance, and they do not necessarily have the expertise to provide the best guidance on adaptive housing.  The agents and contractors who are part of VA's Specially Adaptive Housing program, however, do have this expertise. The SAH program is specifically geared towards helping severely disabled veterans with adapting their homes to be equipped for independent living.  Therefore, in order to better serve severely disabled veterans, this bill authorizes the SAH program to provide assistance to home adaptations for[[Page H8504]]VR&E-eligible veterans. The amount of assistance would be capped at the same level of funding that is currently provided to SAH-eligible veterans.  This is a solution that puts the right VA employee in charge of assisting a disabled veteran to adapt their home. This will also reduce the workload on VR&E counselors, allowing them to spend more time helping veterans with employment services.

993,topic-id,1440,"Mr.President, we are getting close to making tax relief for Americans a reality. Last week the House released its tax reform bill, and this week we expect the Senate Finance Committee to release our version. In the coming days, the tax committees in both Houses will review the bills, and then we will debate them on the floor and develop a final version.  After years of economic stagnation, Americans are ready for relief. They are ready to keep more of their hard-earned money. They are ready to finally see a real pay increase, and they are ready for access to more economic opportunity. That is what our tax reform bill is going to provide.  To start with, our bill is going to put more money in Americans' pockets by lowering their tax rates and doubling their standard deduction. Under our bill, a family making $24,000 a year or less will not be paying any taxes, and families making more than $24,000 a year will be paying significantly less than they are paying today. We are also going to help families by substantially increasing the child tax credit, and we are going to simplify and streamline the Tax Code so that it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they qualify for so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filing their taxes.  But that is only the beginning. Americans don't just want to keep more of their hard-earned money. They also want to be making more of it, but Americans have had a hard time doing that lately. Wages have been stagnant for years, and new opportunities have been hard to find.  So in addition to reforming the individual side of the Tax Code, we are going to reform the business side so that we can give Americans access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set them up for a secure future. In order for individual Americans to thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive.  Thriving businesses create jobs, they provide opportunities, and they increase wages and invest in their workers. Right now, though, our Tax Code is not helping businesses thrive. Instead, it is strangling both large and small businesses with high tax rates. Small businesses are incredibly important for new job creation. They play a huge role in the economy in my home State of South Dakota and other States all across the country, but the high tax rates that too many small businesses currently face can make it difficult for them to even survive, much less thrive and expand their operations.  So we are going to lower taxes for small businesses so that they can grow and hire new workers. We are also going to allow small businesses to recover their capital invested in things like inventory and machinery more quickly, which will free up capital so they can use that to expand and create jobs. Right now it can take small businesses years, or in some cases even decades, to recover the cost of their investments in equipment and facilities. That can leave them extremely cash poor in the meantime, and, needless to say, cash poor businesses have a hard time expanding, hiring new workers, or increasing wages. Allowing small businesses to recover their investments more quickly will mean more jobs and more opportunities for American workers.  In addition to high tax rates on small and large businesses, another thing that is decreasing jobs and opportunities for American workers is our outdated worldwide tax system, which is discouraging American companies from investing their profits here at home in American jobs and American workers. Having a worldwide tax system means that American companies pay U.taxes on the profit they make here at home as well as on part of the profit they make abroad once they bring that money back to the United The problem with this is that American companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they too often end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits and, I might add, at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no surprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, in new jobs, and in increased wages.  Between 1982 and 2003, when the U.tax rate was much more competitive with those other countries, there were 29 corporate inversions where U.companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014, when other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and shifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions.  Our tax plan addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our outdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. What does that mean? By shifting to a territorial tax system here in the United States--a move, I might add, that is supported by Members of both political parties--we will eliminate the double taxation that encourages companies to send their investments and operations overseas. Combine that with a reduction in our high corporate tax rate, and we can provide a strong incentive for U.companies to invest their profits at home in American jobs and American workers instead of abroad.  Business tax reform is essential to reversing the economic stagnation that we have seen in recent years. The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the tax reform framework that Republicans have presented will boost economic growth by[[Page S7042]]between 3 and 5 percent. That is good news for the economy. More specifically, however, it is good news for American workers, who can expect to see their incomes rise as a result. A study from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent, where it is today--the highest, as I said, in the industrialized world--down to 20 percent, which is more competitive with our competitors around the world, would increase average household income by $4,000 annually. Think about that. Reducing the tax on businesses in this country would increase average household income for families in America by $4,000.  A Boston University professor and public finance expert, Larry Kotlikoff, found that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent would increase household income by $3,500 per year on average. This was most recently confirmed by Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor and former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, who noted in the Wall Street Journal this week that corporate tax reform is likely to boost household income by $3,500 per year.  There are lots of analysts, lots of experts who are looking at these proposed changes to the Tax Code and the tax reform that we are attempting to get through the Congress this year and onto the President's desk, and they have concluded that not only will it reduce taxes--the tax burden, the amount of tax that is paid by middle-income families in this country--but the reduction in the rates on businesses will also increase the number of opportunities for better paying jobs and higher wages and it will raise that annual income--that average household income--that is so desperately in need of a boost.  It has been a rough few years for the American economy and for American workers. I think all you have to do is to look at the numbers and you know that most Americans haven't seen a pay raise in almost the last decade. But with comprehensive tax reform, the next few years--and the next few decades, for that matter--can look very, very different.  Republicans' tax reform legislation is going to provide direct relief to hard-working Americans, and it is going to create the kind of economy that will give workers access to more jobs, to better opportunities, and to higher wages, not just for the near term but for the long term.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, to put the final touches on our bill and to take it up in the committee next week. Then, I hope we can bring that bill to the floor of the Senate and have an open debate, process amendments, and pass something through the Senate that we can conference with the House of Representatives, put it on the President's desk, and move our economy in a direction that will provide a brighter and more prosperous future for American workers and American families.  It is time to give the American people some relief.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING The Senator from  ",CREC-2017-11-07-pt1-PgS7038-4.txt,1534,VETERANS DAY,2017.0,7.0,November
1090,topic-id,1340,"Mr.President, I appreciate the kind words of Senator Hoeven and his affinity toward veterans. I am here to talk about our veterans as well.  I come at it from three different perceptions. I chair the Military Personnel Subcommittee in the Senate Armed Services We are trying to work on things to make sure that when somebody goes out of Active Duty into veteran status, we make it as productive as it can be, making sure they enter back fully into the workforce, the education opportunities, and all the kinds of opportunities that are afforded them as a result of serving in our armed services.  I also want to take a minute to talk about the person who served but never wore a uniform, and that is the husband or the wife or the children whom, on this Veterans Day, we should also thank.  A lot of times, when I have an opportunity--I live in Charlotte, NC, where we have nearly 800,000 veterans. It is one of the largest populations of any one State--I make a point to get to the airport a little bit early so I can go up to the USO and just spend a moment meeting with people who are there transitioning from Active Duty and veterans to thank them for their service. Oftentimes, I will thank a man or woman, and they will say: I didn't serve; my husband or my wife did. I will say: By virtue of your being a military spouse, you served, as did your children.  On this Veterans Day, let's make sure we expand those thank-yous to include everybody who is affected when somebody is deployed in a dangerous place or even serving in peacetime. It is a great sacrifice, and it is one we should always show our gratitude for.  As I said, in North Carolina, we have about 800,000 veterans. We also have one of the highest military concentrations of any It is the home of the Global Response Force at Fort Bragg, with over 65,000 men and women serving and 38 generals. You go down closer to the coast and you get to Jacksonville, NC, where we have Camp There is a debate over the pronunciation so I will pronounce it both ways, but there we have nearly 45 percent of the Marine Many people don't realize that. Stationed out of North Carolina, we could go to Seymour Johnson, we could go to New River, or go to Cherry Point and see these men and women serving every day--and the ones who served before them who are now part of our veteran population. We should thank them all for their current service or their past service.  I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Arkansas, I want to thank you for your service because you served bravely in combat positions before entering the That is another amazing thing about the veterans. They continue to serve. If you go to a coffee shop, you may see a huddle of veterans around somebody who is organizing the event. That is probably a veteran making sure veterans are speaking with each other and working through some of the challenges some of them have when they are put in very difficult situations or, if you go into a community center, you will almost always see a veteran there continuing to serve, even after they ended their Active-Duty service.  On Veterans Day, we should make it a point to go to every person we know who is a veteran and thank them. We should make sure that everybody we see in uniform--I will be at the airport probably Thursday evening or I will make it a point to go to every single person I see in uniform and thank them for their service. We owe that to them for all they do for us.  I think, on the one hand, we need to think about veterans, especially on Veterans Day, but as Senator Hoeven said, we need to think about them every day. As a Senator, the way we do that is not just by thinking but by doing. What more can I do in my capacity on the Veterans' Affairs Committee or in my capacity on the Senate Armed Services Committee to make service easier and safer? After they move out of Active status to veteran status, what more can we do for them? There are a lot of things we can do; one is to make sure they get an opportunity to have a job that, in many cases, will leverage the skills they learned when they were in the military into private sector jobs.  Mr.President, you and I sponsored a bill--the VALOR Act--that will be brought up before the Senate that helps to actually expedite the process of having those who have served in the military to get hired. It makes it easier for employers to put them in apprenticeship positions, where maybe they leverage some of the skills they learned while on Active Duty but get them in good-paying jobs to support themselves and their families.  There are a number of other things we have to do for others who are veterans that I think are particularly important. When we talk about post-traumatic stress or talk about traumatic brain injury, those are, in some cases, invisible wounds of war. We need to make sure and understand why it is that nearly every day 20 veterans take their lives through suicide. To what extent could that be something we just simply didn't know about that veteran? Why are they disproportionately more likely to do it? Many of them, incidentally--the veterans today who have this disproportionately high amount of suicide incidents--are veterans from the Vietnam war. We need to figure out how to reach back to that population--a significant number of whom never seek VA medical services--to provide them with the resources they need to work through these sorts of challenges.  We need to make sure healthcare is available across the map. We need to recognize that challenge in North Carolina is vastly different than the same challenge in, say, South  We have a State population of 10 million people--almost approaching 1 million veterans. When you include the spouses and families, it is well above it. We need to make sure they are getting healthcare and services where it is most convenient for them. I think some of that will be providing them with a choice to go to the doctor who makes the most sense for them. A lot of it will be providing a brick-and-mortar presence of the VA so they can be[[Page S7089]]among other people who are actually dealing with the same sorts of circumstances, and they are actually being served by--about half the population in our veterans hospitals and our healthcare centers are veterans themselves.  This is a very important part of the broader solution we need to provide to our veterans as we continue to build a relationship with them for the rest of their lives. We will never finish all the work we should do. We will keep on making installments into a debt we can never repay, but what we need to do on November 11 is support our veterans by showing our gratitude and our thanks for their service. On this Veterans Day, make an extra effort to thank a veteran. Thank a veteran spouse. Thank the child of a veteran for their service to this great We will never be able to fully repay the debt we owe them, but we can make a lot of installments as individual citizens and as Members of this As long as I am in the Senate, that is what I intend to do.

40,topic-id,519,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the ranking member of our subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois, for his leadership and hard work on the subcommittee and for yielding me this time.  Mr.Chairman, I want to express a few concerns with the bill before us. But first, let me say that I support hydropower and believe it must be maintained as an important part of our generation mix.  Hydro is an excellent source of reliable, zero-emissions electricity generation. In order to address climate change and increase clean energy production, it is, indeed, critical that we make licensing and relicensing of these projects feasible.  This is an important issue for my home State of New Hydropower resources produce 19 percent of New York State's total electricity generation in 2016. The average age of New York's hydropower facilities is over 50 years, and many projects are expected to go through the relicensing process in the next 15 years.  I want to reiterate that Members on both sides of the aisle want to see these projects developed within reasonable timelines. I understand the current challenges in relicensing and the desire to bring greater certainty to the process. However, I do not think the bill before us would address those concerns in a balanced approach, which takes into account the legitimate concerns of State and Tribal governments and environmental stakeholders.  The process that produced this bill was flawed from the beginning. The committee failed to hold a hearing to understand the concerns of State and Tribal governments or Federal resource agencies. These entities would be those whose authorities may be limited by FERC under this legislation.  The bill enables FERC to set a schedule that may limit State and Tribal governments and other Federal agencies from having the time to fully consider and, yes, set conditions on license applications.  An enforceable FERC schedule, outside the control of these agencies, may create a perverse incentive for applicants to slow-walk their responses to information requests from other agencies and State governments, effectively running out the clock and preventing conditions from being required on the application.  Our water resources are precious. Different stakeholders have a variety of expectations and demands--power generation, recreation, wildlife and fish habitat, drinking water, and agriculture. Managing these resources effectively is about balancing those often-competing interests.  The Democratic alternative addresses the schedule concern by allowing stakeholders to be involved in the creation of the schedule-setting process. But I also believe FERC has some of the necessary tools already in the underutilized Integrated Licensing Process which encourages all stakeholders to engage in a robust, information sharing process up front.  Now, finally, to set the record straight, I listened intently as the gentlewoman from Washington State, the sponsor of the bill, spoke to the fact that the Standing Rock Sioux were, indeed, represented at hearings, that they had a witness at the FERC hearings. They were there to discuss pipelines and not hydro.  Mr.Chairman, so I am opposing this bill today, but I hope we can move forward with a truly bipartisan process in the future to improve the licensing process while respecting the needs of all stakeholders.

The House Republican plan rolled out yesterday, rolls over the middle class and those looking to ascend the middle class. It cuts the estate tax, a tax that only affects a few thousand of the wealthiest American families, all while raising taxes on the lowest income bracket from 10 to 12 percent.

27,topic-id,968,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.3043, the Hydropower[[Page H8615]]Policy Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation, introduced by my friend and colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is an important step toward modernizing our energy infrastructure, creating jobs, and, yes, strengthening our economy. I want to thank her for her commitment to this issue.  The committee went through regular order with the bill. We held two hearings on background issues, one legislative hearing, and both subcommittee and full committee markups, where the bill was agreed to by a voice vote. Following the markups, bipartisan committee staff held more meetings to hear from over a dozen Tribal governments to gather additional views.  I think that the resulting bill strikes a careful balance. Changes were made to increase State and Tribal consultation requirements, and a very strong savings clause was added to protect States' authorities under the Clean Water  Hydropower is an essential component of an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this country. Hydropower is clean; it is renewable and affordable base load power. It is good for consumers' electricity bills, and it is also good for jobs, which is why labor is strongly supportive of this legislation.  There is a tremendous opportunity to expand hydropower production on existing nonpowered dams. Less than 3 percent of the dams in the U.S., approximately 2,200 dams, produce electricity. There are also opportunities to improve the process for the projects that are due for relicensing. By 2030, over 400 existing projects, with almost 19,000 megawatts of capacity, will begin the relicensing process, and these projects, in fact, may be at risk.  Fixing the licensing process would also improve safety. Upgrading the performance of existing dams and utilizing existing nonpowered dams, canals, and conduits would enable investments, which would address aging dams and, yes, improve overall safety.  The duration, complexity, and uncertainty of the hydropower licensing process creates significant challenges that prevent investments that would create jobs and benefit consumers. The licensing process for a new hydropower development project can last over a decade and costs tens of millions of dollars--significantly longer than the time that it takes to construct a natural gas-fired power plant of the same size.  This legislation, H.3043, would level the playing field by modernizing the permitting process without compromising environmental protections. The bill improves administrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency. It requires balanced, timely decisionmaking and reduces duplicative oversight from the multiple Federal agencies that review hydropower applications.  This bill brings certainty and timeliness to the licensing process by enhancing consultation with Federal, State, and local agencies and Indian Tribes, and it requires FERC to establish a process for setting the schedule for review.

This bill also contains provisions to expedite the approval process for an amendment to a license for a qualifying hydro project upgrade.

Hydropower delivers clean, reliable, and renewable power 24 hours a day, unlike other renewable power sources which fluctuate with time of day, weather, sun or wind, or lack thereof.  California has a long history of hydropower generation. In 2014, California, alone, produced 14,000 megawatts of electricity from hydropower facilities--again, clean, renewable, and reliable. You turn on the switch, hydroelectric power.  My district in northern California is home to two of the largest facilities in the country: Oroville Dam and Shasta Each of these facilities delivers cost-efficient power, provides flood control, and generates significant local economic activity for the community via stored water and recreation.  With local input, which is very important, we need to address the streamlining of this process and expanding renewable hydropower production in this country to pave the way for new jobs and affordable power to consumers everywhere.  Relicensing permits ought not be a wish list for every special interest, but, indeed, on measures of the power that can be generated.

I just want to make a couple of points to my colleagues as we close debate on the general debate on this bill.  This isn't a new bill. A lot of us in this body on both sides support an all-of-the-above strategy. It includes safe nuclear. It includes clean coal. It supports energy efficiencies, renewables, wind, solar, and hydro.  This bill, H.3043, is not a new bill. In fact, the provisions, almost to a tee, in both the House and the Senate version last year in a bill that ultimately didn't get conferenced to President Obama, we didn't really have any disagreements on the hydro section. We came to an agreement and the House passed the bill as it relates to the hydro bill. And the Senate bill passed, as I recall it, 92-8, pretty overwhelming, pretty bipartisan. In essence, the same provisions that we have here.  I got to say that, throughout the process, we listened to the concern raised by some of the stakeholders, including States and We made a number of significant changes to the version of the bill as compared to the version again last year that added more strength, more hurdles to go through.  The biggest change, frankly, that we made was taking the hammer away from FERC to compel agencies to stick to a deadline. Consequently, no permits are going to be granted by default because of a missed deadline. But we also inserted new State and Tribal consultation requirements with a very strong savings clause that clarifies that nothing shall affect the Clean Water Act and other environmental laws. That wasn't in the bill last year. That is new this year.  So I think that we have accommodated the concerns, particularly when many of the Members that are here in this Congress that were there last Congress actually voted for the provisions we had, certainly in committee as well as on the Senate floor.  Again, I just want to read into the Record page 17, line 23: ``No Effect on Other Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, section 14 of the Act of March 3, 1899 (commonly known as the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899), and those provisions of subtitle III of title 54, United States Code, commonly known as the National Historic Preservation Act, with respect to an application for a license under this part.''

I do so with some hesitancy against my good friend, but I would say that this amendment would strike and replace the base tax with language that would add additional layers of red tape and bureaucracy already to the permitting process.  The bill itself, H.3043, contains essential permitting and licensing reforms to ensure that renewable hydropower remains an important part of our all-of-the-above approach to energy, something that many of us on both sides of the aisle support.  We know that the permitting process has been broken. We have heard from FERC over the years and project developers who have been stuck for more than a decade because of bureaucratic delays.  We also know that we need to improve coordination. There are lots of moving parts with multiple permits required and sometimes dozens of agencies that are involved, but this bill, H.3043, brings transparency and predictability to the process by empowering the State and Federal agencies to actually sit at the table with FERC to identify issues of concern and resolve them before they result in unnecessary delay.  The bill, H.3043, as we have said a number of times over the last hour, ensures that States and Tribes are an integral part of that process. The word ``consult'' appears no less than a dozen times in the 30 pages.  Without these important changes to the law, States and Tribes may continue to be left out of the important decisions relating to hydropower licensing.  Again, I remind my colleagues that this is a new provision that we added. This wasn't in the bill last year as we debated this title and approved it in committee and saw it move again on the Senate floor with a vote that, as I recall, was 92-8.

In 2008, the financial crisis taught us many lessons. It also highlighted how NRSROs regularly gave high ratings to mortgage-backed securities. As we now know, these mortgage-backed securities led to one of the largest financial collapses, which some economists have put on par with the Great Depression of the 1930s.  In 2010, with the passage of Dodd-Frank and in an attempt to prevent previous mistakes, these organizations were hit with new requirements aimed at enhancing their disclosures and transparency. Unfortunately, the one-size-fits-all annual reporting requirements mandated under section 932 of Dodd-Frank placed unnecessary burdens and compliance costs on small NRSROs that were in no way the cause of the financial crisis.  Contrary to what some might believe, more regulation doesn't solve everything; in fact, it doesn't solve most things.  After the Office of Credit Ratings was created in 2012 and the new requirements were put into place, smaller NRSROs found it difficult to enter the marketplace. Ironically, the large credit rating agencies--which, again, had a hand in the financial crisis--are getting bigger, driving out small credit rating agencies and making it clear that these new regulatory requirements missed their intended mark and placed unnecessary requirements on smaller  Mr.Speaker, a move to a risk-based model will alleviate the burden on small NRSROs and provide competition while continuing to maintain oversight and transparency over the industry. The marketplace needs this fix. As the chairman noted in a 2013 letter, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White concurred with these conclusions.  Let's be clear. This bill does not eliminate reporting requirements for credit rating agencies; instead, it simply makes the criteria required in annual reports risk based.

This relationship is paramount to every worker's success. It is a relationship that impacts their paycheck, their schedule, their benefits, and the future of their career.  Unfortunately, under the Obama administration, we repeatedly saw government bureaucrats pursue regulatory policies that harmed workers and small businesses. The National Labor Relations Board's decision in Browning-Ferris is a prime example.  In that decision, the Board placed itself squarely in the middle of the employer-employee relationship by redefining what it means to be a joint employer.  The Education and the Workforce Committee has been fighting to roll back this extreme joint employer scheme since it first took effect, and for good reason. It discarded settled labor policy and blurred the lines of responsibility for decisions affecting the daily operations of local businesses across this country. Quite simply, the scheme is a threat to jobs, entrepreneurship, and local employers across the country.  I have heard from small businesses and franchises across my district about how the new joint employer scheme will upend small businesses, undermine their independence, and put jobs, livelihoods, and dreams at risk.

By the way, all those costs generally--guess who pays for them? The ratepayers. People paying their electricity bill end up paying for all this incredible, out-of-control review and regulation.  As the committee worked on this legislation under the able hand of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, Mr.Upton, we solicited feedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this. We made a number of changes to address the concerns. We had hearings, and we had lots of other individual discussions and roundtables. We added new provisions to ensure that States and Tribes are consulted early in the licensing process to identify and resolve issues of concern.  We also made sure that State and local governments could recoup the cost of reviewing applications and conducting studies.

We solicited feedback from all stakeholders as we crafted this legislation and made a number of changes to address the concerns raised. We added new provisions to ensure that states and tribes are consulted early in the licensing process to identify and resolve issues of concern. We also made sure that state and local governments could recoup the costs of reviewing applications and conducting studies. We even added a strong savings clause that clarifies our intent that nothing in this bill shall be construed to affect any requirement of the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, and other environmental laws.  In recognition of the regular order committee process, H.3043 sailed out of committee unanimously by voice vote. The supporters of this bill, especially labor and industry organizations, recognize the vital role it will play in supporting job growth, local economic development, and providing much-needed reforms to the licensing process.  H.3043 seeks to modernize the permitting process by improving administrative efficiency, accountability, and transparency; requiring timely decision making; and by designating Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the lead agency is approving permits. You may be asking yourself, `why is this process in need of reform?' The answer is simple. As my colleague from Washington likes to point out, it can take up to 10 years or longer to license a new hydropower project of relicense an existing facility. Further underscoring the need for this legislation is the fact that by 2030, over 400 existing projects with over 18,700 megawatts of capacity will begin the relicensing process.  Mr.Chair, this emissions-free energy resource should not be bogged down in bureaucratic red tape any longer. It's past time we modernize this grossly outdated licensing process, so we can get projects to market faster and streamline those projects in need of relicensing. At the end of the day, this important legislation promotes hydropower development, creates jobs, and provides consumers across the country with continued access to clean, affordable, and reliable baseload power generation.

649,topic-id,829,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we are here today to consider a very, very important public health bill, H.3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS This legislation funds a 5-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, along with a 2-year extension of community health centers and numerous other critically important public health programs.  This bill will deliver quality healthcare and peace of mind to millions of The patients and families helped by this legislation are our neighbors and our friends. More than 8 million children receive CHIP-funded coverage, and more than 25 million patients are served by our community health centers and other important programs.  This 5-year funding of CHIP marks one of the longest extensions of the program since it was created 20 years ago. The policy we are considering mirrors the bipartisan policy that has been introduced and voted out of our sister[[Page H8457]]committee in the United States  Funding for these important programs expired September 30. The committee worked on a bipartisan basis well before this deadline to try and reach a bipartisan agreement on a range of policies to offset the costs of this very critically important funding extension.  Three times, at the request of the Democrats, we delayed committee action--three times. We tried to find offsets that were agreeable as we have always been able to do before. Unfortunately, that was not the case this time. These delays meant Congress went past the deadline of September 30.  While States still have rollover CHIP funds available and the next wave of community health center funds won't go out until next year, we cannot wait any longer. Patients cannot wait any longer. Patients need care, these critical programs need funding, and we must move forward.  In my district alone, there are 12 federally qualified health center organizations, with 63 delivery sites. They leverage $41 million in Federal money in order to serve more than 240,000 patients in Oregon's Second These health centers--and I have visited many of them--are prevention and public health in action, often serving as the main provider of care for people for hundreds of miles around.  We are also extending the National Health Service Corps and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program. Now, Mr.Speaker, these are really important workforce programs that place qualified providers into some of the most underserved areas of our country.  In addition to community health centers and the workforce programs, this bill extends the funding for the Special Diabetes Program and the Family-to-Family Health Information centers, the Personal Responsibility Program, and the Youth Empowerment These locally based, patient-centered organizations provide comprehensive services to those most in need.  Moreover, this legislation eliminates 2 years of the across-the-board cuts to Medicaid allotments called for under the Affordable Care Act, We delay those cuts for disproportionate share hospitals for 2 years. Medicaid DSH funding represents an important component of many State Medicaid programs and is particularly relied upon by many States to help provide additional resources to key safety net providers.  Now, while this relief is only temporary and does not address the larger structural challenges under ObamaCare, it would give Congress time to explore what budget-neutral approaches there might be to allocate existing DSH dollars on a more equitable and fair basis. In my State alone of Oregon, hospitals have told me this relief in this bill, just for them, represents $6.8 million over the next 2 years that they can use to help low-income people get access to hospital care.  Now, in paying for this package--and this is the area where we have the most disagreement with the Democrats--we have taken a fiscally responsible approach, like using existing funding streams for prevention and public health efforts, ensuring high-dollar lottery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so its limited resources can be prioritized for the most vulnerable, and stopping individuals on the Affordable Care Act's exchanges from gaming the system.  The bill also asks Medicare's wealthiest 1 percent, people who are retired and making $40,000 a month--not a year, a month--to pay about $135 more for their Medicare just on parts B and D that is already subsidized by 75 percent, just a little more so we can fund children's health insurance for 5 years.  While it was not ultimately possible, unfortunately, to reach consensus on some of the policies to offset the new funding in this bill, there is broad bipartisan agreement on the core policies contained in this legislation, and I believe there is bipartisan support for many of the reasonable and fiscally responsible offsets contained in H.3922.  Mr.Speaker, this is good legislation. This is long-overdue legislation. It reflects the good work done by your House Energy and Commerce Committee, and I urge my colleagues to put politics aside today and ensure these vital programs get the funding extensions they need. We are over the deadline. It is time to act.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-11-03-pt1-PgH8449-3.txt,1596,EXECUTIVE CALENDAR--Continued,2017.0,3.0,November

717,topic-id,574,"Mr.Speaker, today, Members of this House can deliver peace of mind to parents of over 8 million low-income children who depend on the Children's Health Insurance The House can extend funding for important public health programs, including resources for the critical work community health centers do in our communities and in my district and yours. This bill will help deliver much-needed healthcare resources to our friends and fellow citizens in the Virgin Islands and in Puerto  Yet we have heard complaints about how this package is paid for. Well, let us be clear how this bill funds healthcare for kids and important public health priorities like community health centers.  In paying for this package, we have taken a fiscally responsible and reasonable approach. Our bill funds kids' healthcare by allowing States to dis-enroll lottery winners--these are winners making $80,000 or above--from the low-income Medicaid program. We ensure high-dollar lottery winners are removed from the Medicaid program so that those resources can go to Medicaid-eligible, low-income people in our districts.  Our bill directs funding from the Prevention and Public Health Fund to finance important prevention and public[[Page H8473]]health needs, like funding the National Health Service Corps, Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education, Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, and community health centers. If these are not important programs for prevention, wellness, and public health, I don't know what are.  Our bill before us today, which I predict will have bipartisan support, directs funds from the Prevention Fund for important public health priorities that have long had bipartisan support. We are using a bipartisan fund to pay for bipartisan healthcare support for health and wellness, which was its intent from the beginning.  Most recently, nearly every House Republican and Democrat supported this idea just a year ago. Just a year ago, when we passed the 21st Century Cures Act, we said: Here is a health and wellness fund and a Prevention Fund that makes sense for cures, make sense for, we believe today, our community health centers, and for Children's Health  Our bill also asks the wealthiest among us, the 1 percent of beneficiaries, those making $40,000 a month, over half-a-million dollars a year--that is an individual--to pay a little more to help fund health insurance for low-income children. I think they are willing to do that, and I think we should be as well.  On multiple budgets, President Obama said this is a reasonable way to pay for other priorities. That was bipartisan. It is bipartisan today.  These reasonable pay-fors have been opposed by some in the Democratic leadership. Some House Democrats want to use children's healthcare and funding for community health centers as a bargaining chip for a bigger end-of-the-year goulash, yet kids and our frontline providers can't wait any longer.  In just a few weeks, States like Minnesota run out of funding for the Children's Health Insurance At the request of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we have agreed to postpone it time and again, but time has run out. The negotiations did not end as we all hoped they would.  But we can't wait any longer. It is time for this House to deliver peace of mind to the families that rely on these critical programs. It is time to vote ``yes.''  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and to approve the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Many veterans rely on their housing stipend to pay for their housing while they are attending school; and, therefore, it can be necessary for them to show proof of their housing allowance as proof of income.

It is appropriate that we are doing it the week of Veterans  But I want to remind people, this is what is possible, Mr.This summer, the New York Times wrote a story, and it said, if you really want to know how Congress is supposed to function, look at the VA They were pointing out, these are not easy things.  People, Mr.Speaker, may think, well, everybody supports veterans, but it is hard to get policy right. It is hard to find funding. It is hard to agree on the best way to deliver it. But I would have to say, the last 2 days are proof positive of it. We can do it. We must do it. We are obligated to do it.  When people think of Veterans Day, ways that you can observe Veterans Day, I am always of the belief that the best way to honor veterans is to attempt to live our life in a manner that reflects the dignity and the sacrifice that they gave in their service.  As we sat here today, it may be easy to take it for granted. The public gets frustrated over what happens or what doesn't happen here. The idea that there are billions of human beings on this planet who don't get the chance to self-govern, who don't get the chance to openly and freely debate, to try and[[Page H8566]]craft a society we want to live in, and we do it here because of the sacrifice that was given to keep this Nation free.  So the work we do here--and it is often said, you shouldn't get a pat on the back for doing what you are supposed to do. That is not what this is about. This is about a recognition that this Nation cares deeply about the daughters and sons who will serve us. This Nation expects the Congress to make sure that they are cared for in a manner that reflects their sacrifice, and they want us to do it in a bipartisan manner that celebrates the idea of self-governance.  So with that, I would say, Mr.Speaker, I am proud to support this piece of legislation as the final piece of this package. I am proud of the work and to call my friend from Florida a dear friend, someone who I know that, between you and your father, has given decades of service to our Nation's veterans.

Under current law, a veteran can receive only a live organ donation from another veteran receiving the transplant at a VA hospital.  This is one of those pieces of legislation that, I think, when many of us saw it brought forward, makes great common sense. It is the right thing to do. I understand possibly why they put that in there. But all of us know that it is going to be that exact scenario that it is going to be a family member or someone near who is going to want to do the transplant.

We also understand that with that comes changes in behavior, and there are reasons that people are removed from service, and I am incredibly proud that this committee has taken this issue head-on. Of those who are removed because of issues that they started to acquire from their service in uniform, this legislation is going to ensure that those people with less than honorable discharges get the care; specifically, focusing on military sexual trauma, the idea that we have warriors in uniform who are assaulted, in many cases, by fellow servicemembers, and because of the inability to reintegrate in that unit, they are discharged with less than honorable paper, precluding them from getting the services that they have earned.  With more than 20 veterans a day--and I think those numbers are probably low--taking their own lives, this issue of making sure that all servicemembers and all veterans have access to mental healthcare, removing those barriers, is of prime importance.  Secretary Shulkin has made the first step in this. Mr.Coffman has continued to make sure that this committee stays focused on this, continuing to add more and more access.

Telemedicine and medicine, in general, is changing so rapidly, we need to make sure that barriers are not put in place, especially for rural veterans, and many of us have them all over.  Last week, I did a field hearing in International Falls, Minnesota, which, by the way, will be 1 degree tomorrow for all of you, just so you know. Those folks are veterans. They have served, but they are miles from a VA facility. The technology that we have, and we know it works, allows them to get that.  If we have veterans sitting on State borders, if we have veterans sitting in remote areas, it sometimes makes it difficult. It will give VA the tools it needs to remain a leader in the use of telehealth technology.  I am particularly thankful to Representatives Thompson and Brownley for their leadership. They identified a problem, worked on it, and came up with a workable solution that we can put into statute, making sure, the bottom line, again, that every veteran, regardless of geographic location, gets the best, most advanced care possible.

373,topic-id,1966,"Mr.President, our EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, has a little problem. You see, the Supreme Court has ruled that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Therefore, under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, which Pruitt leads, is legally obligated to regulate greenhouse gases. They must do this as a matter of law.  Moreover, the EPA has determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger the public health and welfare of current and future generations, and Scott Pruitt has said he will not contest that endangerment finding. He is stuck with it. Why? Because he knows it is a contest he would lose by a landslide. The climate denial nonsense he espouses has never passed peer review, it is not real science, and it would get buried in any forum where facts and truth matter.  That is also likely why the White House released the Climate Science Special Report, part of the National Climate Assessment we mandated by law without significant alteration. Scientists had prudently disclosed what they sent to the White House so everyone could compare what went into the White House with what came back out of the White That put the White House in a box, and caught in that box, the White House went ahead and released the report without alteration.  The Climate Science Special Report affirms that climate change is driven almost entirely by human action. It warns of a worst-case scenario, where seas could rise as high as 8 feet by the year 2100, which is the scenario our home State planners are looking at for Rhode Island and which I know has occasioned dire forecasts for the Presiding Officer's home State of The report details a wide array of climate-related damage already unfolding across the United Here is what the report says: ``It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.'' The document reports: ``For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.''  No convincing alternative explanation. Well, we actually knew that because climate denial has all along been bogus, phony propaganda created by the fossil fuel industry and pushed out through its array of phony front groups. Nobody but the ignorant would seriously believe their nonsense, least of all in Congress, except for the fact that the propaganda is backed up by ferocious political artillery and an implacable fossil fuel industry position to deny, deny, deny as the ship goes down.  This will be a disgrace whose odor will last a long time as history looks back and recounts a Congress so subservient to the fossil fuel industry that it would ignore unanimous real science and go instead with the flagrant, self-serving falsehoods of the industry with the world's biggest conflict of interest--an obvious plain conflict of interest. It is a sickening display of what our Founding Fathers would plainly describe as corruption, and we are supposed to act as if things are normal around here. Things are not normal around here--not since Citizens United, for sure.  Things are also not normal at That Agency of the U.Government has been corrupted. There is no straighter way to say it. The EPA now answers not to the public interest but to the special interest of the fossil fuel industry through its new Administrator, Scott Pruitt, whose entire history is one long exercise in subservience to the fossil fuel industry. If he is not bad enough, check out the creepy coterie of fossil fuel lackeys he is surrounding himself with. It is another disgrace, but given the fossil[[Page S7055]]fuel's control over Congress, the legislative branch is compliant and complicit in the industry takeover, and this body has yet to utter a peep of dissent as our national EPA sinks into banana republic status.  Last week, I talked about the phony tricks Pruitt is using to undo the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan is an annoyance to certain folks in the fossil fuel industry that has long underwritten Pruitt's political ambitions. So for their sake, something had to be done. Well, given the Climate Science Special Report that the White House just released, they couldn't really mess with the science--at least not without it blowing up in their faces--so they reverted to some tricks.  One trick was to recount the cost-benefit calculations of climate change and count only domestic effects of an international danger. Now, the Climate Science Special Report the White House just released says: ``The climate of the United States is strongly connected to the changing global climate.''  Nevertheless, Pruitt made the decision to count only the domestic effects of domestic emissions. That trick neatly wipes a major fraction of the harm the fossil fuel industry is causing right off the books. It doesn't affect the actual harm, just the accounting of the harm. In my example, it wiped two-thirds of the harm off the books in a neat feat of accounting trickery.  Of course, that still leaves one-third of the harm to account for so they took another whack at that, and their trick there was to juice the discount rate. In years to come, prompt action now on climate change would prevent things like sea level rise washing over our coastal infrastructure, unprecedented wildfire seasons burning our forests, and disruptions in agricultural yields from drought and flood extremes. The Clean Power Plan would achieve between $14 billion and $34 billion in future health benefits, also, like prevented illnesses and deaths, but all those things happen in the future, which brings in this matter of the discount rate.  The discount rate discounts the present value of things that happen in the future based on a percentage. Here is a simple example. If you assume a discount rate of 5 percent, that means anything 1 year from now is worth 5 percent less than it would be right now. So $10,000 of something in 10 years would be worth $6,000 today. If you assume a discount rate of 10 percent, that means $10,000 of something in 10 years is only worth $4,000 today. You can jiggle the discount rate to lower the present value. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of future harms.  A report this year from the National Academies of Science confirms this: ``The rate at which future benefits and costs are discounted can significantly alter the estimated present value of the net benefits of that rule.''  Now, the George Bush administration recognized that ``[s]pecial ethical considerations arise when comparing benefits and costs across generations.'' The Bush administration guidance urged lower discount rates when a rule is expected to harm future generations. I will quote them again. ``If your rule will have important intergenerational benefits or costs, you might consider a further sensitivity analysis using a lower but positive discount rate,'' wrote the Office of Personnel Management at the time.  That describes exactly what we face with climate change. Our carbon pollution today will hurt generations far off in the future as, for instance, temperatures and sea levels inexorably rise decade after decade and properties and land are lost to the sea.  In 2015, the Federal Government settled on a 3-percent discount rate to estimate the out-year costs of carbon pollution to society. That was the recommendation of leading economists, the top researchers from top universities putting forward credible analysis from the scientific community.  In our new, industry-friendly Pruitt analysis, they jacked that rate from 3 percent up to 7 percent. They more than double it. There is little actual analysis. They just picked a higher rate and what a payoff for Pruitt's fossil fuel friends. At 7 percent, future harms, injuries, and losses count for far less. Indeed, with this trick, Pruitt wiped away nearly $18 billion in predicted harm from carbon pollution. Remember, again, nothing changes in the real world. The harm to future generations is unchanged. That is a given in either scenario, but like that domestic-harm-only trick, this is an accounting trick to help the fossil fuel industry dodge accountability for its pollution. It doesn't change the situation on the field; it just changes the score on the scoreboard.  Contrast the Pruitt fossil fuel-friendly nonsense with real, peer-reviewed science. In real, peer-reviewed science, we can now calculate not only the harm of carbon pollution but how much individual fossil fuel companies have contributed to that harm. A peer-reviewed study in the scientific journal Climatic Change tells us that a few major fossil fuel producers are responsible for as much as half of the recorded global surface temperature increase, and the study demonstrates a method for attributing their corporate share of the harm to Chevron, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, Devon Energy, among about 50, investor-owned carbon producers. You can take the emissions data from that climatic change study and factor in well-established social cost of carbon estimates and approximate individual corporations' responsibility for climate damages. Those companies ought to be taking a hard look at what they are reporting to their shareholders about this because they are under strong legal obligations to report out-year risks to their shareholders.  The National Climate Assessment Climate Science Special Report that we first talked about was developed by dozens of leading scientists, from 13 different Federal agencies, detailing the extent of climate change driven by manmade greenhouse gas emissions and the urgent need to address it. That report is as solid as it gets. The report is stark. Temperatures are climbing. Seas are rising. Ocean waters are becoming more acidic. Fires are more frequent and more severe, and fire seasons are longer. Storms are stronger and more frequent, as we have seen particularly menacing coastal  Downwind States like Rhode Island cope with air that carries more particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and other lung-constricting pollution.  Fishermen haul in foreign catches full of fish their fathers and grandfathers would hardly recognize. Woodsmen harvest in distressed and changing forests. Farmers till land subject to extremes of both more frequent drought and more severe flood.  The inescapable science is compiled by the top experts from throughout the Federal Government and is concurred in, I believe, by every single State university in this country, which not only understand climate change, but they teach climate change. There is every single National Lab in this country--the Labs we fund and trust--the armed services, and our national intelligence assessments. It is virtually impossible to find anyone not on the payroll of the fossil fuel industry who disputes this. It shows that climate change touches every corner of the country already, not later.  Up against that study, up against that unanimity of legitimate science, Pruitt puts a bunch of accounting tricks cooked up for him, I believe, by a conflicted and corrupting industry.  We cannot let fossil fuel hacks like Pruitt and his merry crew prevent America from responding to the reality around us.  This week it has been reported that Nicaragua and Syria have joined the Paris climate agreement. They were the two outliers. That was the company the United States was in with President Trump's decision to remove us from the Paris climate agreement--Nicaragua, Syria, and the United States of That is some company. Now, even Nicaragua and, just today, Syria have joined. At some point our national reputation is put at hazard. Our national reputation is put on the line when we can't do what is obviously right because we can't tell one greedy industry: You have had enough--no more.  It is time we treated this issue honestly. When we can't do that, don't tell me history will forget. It seriously is time to wake up. This is corruption in plain view.  I yield the floor.

1075,topic-id,1138,"Mr.President, one of the great privileges of this job and the honor of representing Oregon in the U.Senate is seeing the way Oregonians of all backgrounds and beliefs come together to support those who wear or have worn the uniform of the U.military. When it comes to honoring our veterans, Oregonians and so many across the country think in terms of patriotism, not politics and certainly not partisanship. There is not a Democratic or a Republican way to support our veterans; there is an American way.  Recently, I was very pleased to join Senator Moran and Senator Tester to introduce bipartisan legislation that would expand the presumption to veterans exposed to Agent Orange in the Korean Demilitarized The VA currently presumes that veterans who served in the Korean DMZ from 1968 to 1971 were exposed to Agent Orange, but there is evidence that veterans were exposed to toxins all the way back to 1967. Our bipartisan bill would extend the presumption date back, making it easier for veterans to apply for and receive care and benefits.  It is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. As we head to Veterans Day, I want to make it clear that I am going to do everything I can to make this bill law soon.  Given the fact that we will all be home this weekend, I also want to take a few minutes to discuss another bipartisan piece of legislation that is important to the welfare of our veterans and a proposal that recently became law.  A few years ago, I learned that wounded members of the National Guard and Reserve were losing out on benefits under the GI Bill for time they spent in rehabilitation and recovery. These are men and women who put their lives on hold to serve our country abroad, and when they suffered injuries in the line of duty, their time spent recovering didn't count toward GI Bill benefits, even though it did for Active-Duty servicemembers in the same situation.  I think it is an understatement to say that is certainly a real head-scratcher, to not stand up for our Guard and Reserve to make sure they are not losing out on benefits under the GI Bill for the time they spend in recovery and rehab. In effect, the Federal law was adding insult to injury by robbing wounded guardsmen and reservists of benefits they earned and should have been receiving all along. Estimates show that more than 20,000 servicemembers across our country were affected.  I approached our friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Boozman, and he graciously agreed to team up with me. Senator Boozman made it clear that a fellow from Arkansas and a fellow from Oregon were going to team up, leave the politics behind, and fix an injustice. We brought together a bipartisan group. We worked with the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and we were able to get the bill across the finish line. As of now, wounded guardsmen and reservists will get the education benefits they have rightly earned.  Especially today, when people are asking about the divisiveness and polarization that now consumes so much of the political debate, I wanted Senators to know that I really appreciate Senator Boozman always trying to be constructive and a problem-solver. And this is one problem that is getting solved.  The law will apply retroactively, meaning that eligible veterans who already lost out will be made whole. Because it is so counterintuitive for servicemembers to lose benefits for being wounded--just think about that, servicemembers losing benefits for being wounded--many of our veterans haven't learned they were missing out. They never knew they were missing out. That is why I am very pleased, as I know Senator Boozman is, that our law applies retroactively to all service after the 9/11 attacks.  I think it is true that success has a thousand parents, and if I thanked everybody on both sides of the aisle for all the work that went into this important bill, we would be here until suppertime tonight. But I do especially want to thank our colleagues, Senators Markey and They lent important support along the way, as did Chairman Johnny Isakson and Ranking Member Jon Representative Mark Takano of California has also been an exceptional advocate in the other body.  I also wish to give a special thank-you to MAJ Steve Warren, a Department of Defense fellow in my office at the dawn of the process. He is considered a real rock star in terms of working for veterans. He did so much to bring this injustice to light and then worked diligently toward a solution. I think it is the judgment of everybody involved that without Steve's inspiration and perspiration, it would have been hard to see this injustice fixed and our even being here today, as we head to Veterans Day, to talk about it.  I close by way of saying that in this time of partisan rancor and the back-and-forth that consumes so much of the political debate in Washington, I think what we have shown with this piece of legislation and its importance is that our veterans continue to be a unifying force. This good will comes from a deep respect for the All-Volunteer Force and for the sacrifices made by military families. It also stems from an appreciation for the role our veterans play in so many communities. In Oregon, our vets are small business owners, coders, mill workers, and educators. They help students at the Youth Challenge Program in Bend, and they help us fight fires. And suffice it to say, this year those fires were big, they were long, they were brutal, and we saw fires nobody could have even believed could happen, such as the one that jumped the Columbia  It doesn't mean that Congress, even with this legislation, always gets it right with respect to veterans. There is a whole lot more to be done, particularly ensuring timely access to top-quality healthcare through the VA or outside of it and ensuring that guardsmen and reservists get treated fairly and equitably.  I want to say this again on the eve of our taking time out specifically to honor veterans--although in our State, we believe that every day is really Veterans Day--I want to renew my pledge to the people of Oregon that I and my staff will keep working until our vets receive the care and treatment they have earned. We hope the success of our GI Bill Fairness Act demonstrates what can be done when the Congress sets aside all this business of trying to point score on partisanship and puts veterans first.

Here we are today. I think we need to follow this because it has led to that.  Without going too much into all the stuff that has already been said, we can talk about how the Obama administration approved the sale of the Canadian mining company with significant U.uranium reserves to a firm owned by a Russian The NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, assured Congress and the public the new owners could not export any raw nuclear material from the American shores. No uranium produced at either facility may be exported, the NRC declared November 2010 in a press release. We found out that is not true.  As has been brought up, over 20 percent of our uranium is going into the hands of Beyond the mines in Kazakhstan, which are among the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave Russia control of one-fifth of all uranium production capacity in the U.
