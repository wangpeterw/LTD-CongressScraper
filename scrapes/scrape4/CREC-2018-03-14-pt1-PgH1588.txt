                 CELEBRATING CONGRESSWOMAN MARCY KAPTUR

  (Ms. SANCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my dear friend, 
Marcy Kaptur, from the Ninth District of Ohio.
  Earlier today, the Speaker and minority leader honored Marcy for 
hitting a historic milestone. She is the longest serving woman in the 
history of the House, which is quite an accomplishment.
  Ever since joining Congress, Marcy has been blazing trails, and I 
have been honored to know her for many years and to work with her on 
important issues impacting working families.
  She has been a steadfast advocate for labor unions, fighting to 
ensure that hardworking men and women get paid a decent wage, and she 
has been fighting efforts to ship good American jobs overseas. Marcy 
knows that labor unions are a critical part of our country, creating a 
middle class and moving us all forward.
  She has also been a strong advocate for our military and national 
security.
  Her work is far from done. I know she will continue to be a powerful 
voice in our Caucus, and I look forward to many more years working with 
Marcy on issues that are important to the American people.
