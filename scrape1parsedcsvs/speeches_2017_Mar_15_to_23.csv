After earning a degree in agriculture from Louisiana Tech and a master's in entomology from LSU, Ray went on to pioneer the stale seedbed conservation tillage system, known today as no-till, used across the South to enhance crop production.  In 1989, Ray presented to Congress an application to charter the Federal Land Bank of North He has served on the board of directors for the Federal Land Bank, as a board chairman of the Louisiana Land Bank, and as a leader of numerous State and Federal agricultural organizations.  Ray and his family still farm cotton, soybeans, sweet potatoes, Irish potatoes, corn, vegetables, cattle, hay, wheat, and pine trees.  He is a tremendous example of a Louisiana farmer making his life and a living off his land.

It is recognized as one of the top programs in the He has been instrumental in advocating forestry education at the technical school and university levels so that we can have sustainable and productive working forests.  Buck continues to serve the forest industry today, and I look forward to working with him in my role on the Working Forest Caucus on behalf of foresters across the country.  Mr.Speaker, Louisiana is one of the top agricultural States in the Nation, and I am proud to serve on the Agriculture Committee here in Washington to represent our State's farmers, foresters, and ranchers.  But the real contributions to our State agricultural prowess can be traced back to folks like Ray Young and Buck Vandersteen, men who have spent their lives enhancing the industry that is so vital to Congratulations once again for being inducted into the Louisiana Agricultural Hall of It is an honor that is well deserved.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2188-2.txt,2244,IT IS CRUCIAL TO REPEAL AND REPLACE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,2017.0,20.0,March

My patients have dealt with skyrocketing premiums, unaffordable deductibles, and a formulary so restrictive it is an insult to call it a real treatment.  Medicaid expansion is no better and gives only the illusion of sound coverage. These patients can't find doctors. They can't find specialists who will see them, which results in more hospital admissions, more unnecessary hospital referrals, more expensive trips to the emergency room, and higher costs to the program and to the taxpayers.  There is nothing compassionate about cramming more people into a failed system just so politicians can score political points.

I have received thousands of calls, emails, and social media messages regarding this topic from constituents opposing a repeal and sharing their stories of how the Affordable Care Act has helped them and how terrified they are of losing their coverage. I would like to share just one of those stories.  Daria from Redlands wrote to me about how Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is called a lifeline in her[[Page H2174]]family. Daria, who suffers from a debilitating and rare disease, closed her letter by saying: ``There are tens of millions more like me. American citizens, Moms and dads. Working hard, struggling with illness. Loving our families through hardship and disease. All of us--these tens of millions of American families, would be absolutely devastated by the loss of our insurance coverage.''  Mr.Speaker, what would you say to Daria about your plan that would cut Medicaid and raise the cost of insurance on families like hers while giving tax breaks to the uberwealthy?

1081,topic-id,1292,"Mr.President, President Trump's nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be a member of the U.Supreme Court is being considered this week in the Senate Judiciary Soon, the nomination is likely to move to the floor for debate.  Some have suggested that instead of allowing a majority of Senators to decide whether to approve the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, there should be first a cloture vote to determine whether to cut off debate. Cutting off debate requires the approval of 60 Senators, so if 41 of the 46 Democratic Senators vote not to cut off debate, there would never be an up-or-down majority vote to approve Judge In other words, the 41 Democratic Senators would have filibustered to death the Gorsuch nomination.  Filibustering to death the Gorsuch nomination--or any Presidential nomination, for that matter--flies in the face of 230 years of Senate tradition. Throughout the Senate's history, approval of even the most controversial Presidential nominations has required only a majority vote. For example, in 1991 President George H.Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme The debate was bitter. The Senate confirmed Judge Thomas narrowly, 52 to 48. Although the Senate rules allowed any Senator to try to filibuster the nomination to death, none did. In fact, Senate rules have always allowed Senators the option to filibuster to death a Presidential nomination; yet it has almost never happened. According to the former Senate Historian, with one possible exception, which I will mention in a minute, the number of Supreme Court Justices in our country's history who have been denied their seat by filibuster is zero. The number of Cabinet members in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. The number of Federal district judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster is zero. And until 2003, the number of Federal circuit judges in our country's history who have been denied their seats by filibuster was zero.  Senator Everett Dirksen did not filibuster President Lyndon Johnson's Presidential nominations. Senator Robert Byrd did not filibuster President Reagan's nominees. Senator Howard Baker did not filibuster President Carter's nominees. Senator Bob Dole did not filibuster President Clinton's nominees. During most of the 20th century, when one party controlled the White House and the Senate 70 percent of the time, the minority never filibustered to death a single Presidential nominee.  On the other hand, there have been plenty of filibusters on legislation--so many that in 1917, the Senate adopted a cloture rule as a way to end filibusters. The rule was amended in 1949, 1959, 1975, 1979, and 1986--always in response to filibusters on legislation, never on nominations. It was the 1975 change that established the current cloture standard of 60 votes to end debate except on amendments to the standing rules of the  Filibustering a Presidential nomination has always been treated differently than filibustering a legislative matter. The filibuster of legislation is perhaps the Senate's most famous characteristic. It has been called ``democracy's finest show, the right to talk your head off.'' As the actor Jimmy Stewart said in the movie ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington,'' ``Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this floor until those people have heard everything I've got to say, even if it takes all winter.'' That was Jimmy Stewart in ``Mr.Smith Goes to Washington.''  The late Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia described the importance of the legislative filibuster in a different way. He said in his last speech:       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing      body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the      protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this      since the Senate first convened.  In fact, the whole idea of the Senate is not to have majority rule on legislation. Throughout Senate history, the purpose of the legislative filibuster has been to force consensus on issues, to force there to be a group of Senators on either side who have to respect one another's views so they work together and produce 60 votes on important matters, as we did on the 21st Century Cures bill and as we did on the bill fixing No Child Left  Nominations have always been treated differently from legislation. For example, under rule XIV, any Senator could bring legislation directly to the calendar bypassing committees. There is no such power for nominations. Senate rules allow debate and therefore the possibility of filibuster on a motion to proceed to legislation. Debate is not allowed on a motion to proceed to nominations.  In summary, while Senate rules have always allowed extended debate or filibusters, the filibuster was never used to block a nomination until recently. As I mentioned earlier, it was never used to block a Cabinet nomination, never used to block a Federal district judge, and until 2003, never used to block a circuit judge, and never used to block a Supreme Court Justice in the country's history, with one possible exception. That was in 1968, when President Johnson sought to elevate Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief When it became clear the Senate majority wouldn't agree, Johnson engineered a 45-to-43 cloture vote so forces could save face and appear to have won something. Fortas then asked the President to withdraw the nomination.  Other than the Fortas nomination, the filibuster was never used to block any judicial nomination until 2003 and 2004, when Democrats decided to use the 60-vote cloture requirement to block 10 of President George Bush's nominations. This unprecedented action produced a threat by Republicans to change the Senate rules, to make it clear that only a majority vote is required to approve a Presidential nomination. There was a negotiation and eventually five of Bush's nominations were approved, five were blocked and the rules were not changed. Then, in 2011 and 2013, Republicans returned the favor--as often happens around here--by seeking to block 5 of President Obama's nominees for the circuit court by insisting on a 60-vote cloture for[[Page S1878]]each. Republicans alleged that President Obama was trying to pack the circuit court in the District of Columbia with three liberal judges.  To overcome Republican objections, Democrats invoked the so-called nuclear option. They broke the Senate rules to change the Senate rules. The new rule eliminated the possibility of 60-vote cloture motions for all Presidential nominees except for the Supreme  That is where we stand today. There have been other examples of minority Senators filibustering nominations to death, all of them during the last three administrations and all involving sub-Cabinet nominations. Of course, there have been delays in considering nominations. My own nomination in 1991 as U.Education Secretary was delayed 51 days by Democratic Of course, I thought unnecessarily.  President Reagan's nomination of Ed Meese as Attorney General of the United States was delayed a year by a Democratic No one has ever disputed our right in the Senate, regardless of who is in charge, to use our constitutional duty of advice and consent to delay and examine and sometimes cause nominations to be withdrawn or even to defeat nominees by a majority vote.  As we approach a vote on Judge Gorsuch on the floor of the Senate, it is useful to remember that the tradition of the United States Senate, for 230 years, has been to treat legislative matters and nominations differently. Filibuster to death legislation, yes. Filibuster to death Presidential nominations? Should the Gorsuch nomination come to the floor soon, as I believe it will, overwhelming Senate tradition requires that whether to approve it should be decided by a majority vote of Senators, and there should be no attempt by the minority to filibuster the nomination to death.

1111,topic-id,1370,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions earlier today.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       2017 Food and Drug Administration User Fee Reauthorization       The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and      Pensions will please come to order. We're holding a hearing      today on ``FDA User Fee Agreements: Improving Medical Product      Regulation and Innovation for Patients Part 1.''       Now, Senator Murray and I will each have an opening      statement, then we will introduce our panel of witnesses.      After our witness testimony, senators will have 5 minutes of      questions. The subject of today is the Food and Drug      Administration's medical device and drug user fees. It seems      like a long time ago, but it really wasn't that long ago,      that Congress passed the 21st Century Cures 94 Senators      voted for it, President Obama and Vice President Biden were      strongly in support of it. So were Speaker Ryan and Mitch      McConnell, who called it ``the most important piece of      legislation in the last       It came through this committee and I thank the members of      the committee, especially for resolving our differences of      opinions and making it possible to reach a consensus. That      bill was about the moving medical products, drugs and devices      more rapidly, in a safe way, through the investment and the      regulatory process into the hands of patients and doctors      offices.       Today, we are talking about really implementing that great      goal, one that shows so much promise for virtually every      We're here to talk about how we continue the fund      the Food and Drug Administration, the agency responsible for      making sure the promising research supported by 21st Century      Cures actually reaches patients.       We will hear from witnesses from the agency itself to tell      us how the user fee agreements will improve the agency's      abilities to regulate medical products and promote      innovation. We will hear from patients, device manufacturers,      and brand and generic drug manufacturers in a second hearing,      which is tentatively scheduled for April 4.       I want to thank the witnesses for taking the time to      testify today. We respect the great amount of expertise and      service that you've given for our country. I want to thank      you also for moving so quickly to implement the 21st Century      Cures I noticed specifically that the provision      involving regenerative medicine was published with about a      month after President Obama signed the law.       The first medical product user fee agreement was enacted in      1992. FDA worked with the drug manufacturers to hammer out an      agreement that the agency would collect user fees from drug      manufacturers in exchange for more timely, predictable      reviews. The agreement was a success--it decreased review      times and increased patient access to medicines.       Before September 30 of this year, 4 different user fee      agreements need to be reauthorized: The Prescription drug      user fee is the first one. Now it's common around here to      call it PDUFA, I'm not going to do it. I just can't stand      PDUFA, and MDUFA and GDUFA and the other So I'm going to      call them if you don't mind, the prescription drug user fee,      which accounted for over 70 percent of the brand drug review      budget in       The second one is the Medical device user fee, which      accounted for 35 percent of the medical device review budget      in 2015.       The Generic drug user fee accounted for 70 percent of the      generic drug review budget. Biosimilar user fee accounted for      7 percent of the biosimilar review budget.                 Consequences of Failing to Reauthorize       So a lot of the money for the FDA comes from these      agreements with manufacturers of prescription drugs and      devices.       The authority for FDA to collect user fees for medical      product review will expire on September 30 of this year--six      months from now.       Now this is probably the most important part of what I have      to say this morning. If we do not move quickly to reauthorize      these agreements, the FDA will be forced to begin sending      layoff notices to more than 5,000 employees to notify them      that they may lose their jobs in 60 days--that's what they      have to do by law.       A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the      reviews of drugs and devices submitted after April 1, only a      few days away.       For example, if we do not pass these reauthorizations into      law before the current agreements expire, an FDA reviewer who[[Page S1887]]     gets started reviewing a cancer drug submitted to the agency      in April would be laid off on October 1, before the reviewer      is able to finish his or her work. The sooner we reauthorize      the agreements, the better--to give patients, reviewers, and      companies certainty.       In addition to harming patients and families that rely on      medical innovation, a delay in reauthorizing the user fees      would threaten biomedical industry jobs and America's global      leadership in biomedical innovation.                      Process for reauthorization       I am hopeful that this committee, and this Congress, can      work in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize the user fees      before the August recess.       Congress must pass legislation reauthorizing and updating      the fees to support the recommendations contained in what are      called ``commitment letters'' sent to Congress in       Now these commitment letters are part of the agreements      between FDA and industry--they establish the agency's      commitments, such as timelines for application review or to      put out guidances in exchange for the fees Congress      authorizes. The letters were transmitted to Congress in      January of this year.       So today's hearing is not the first time members of      Congress or the public is hearing about the recommendations      for reauthorization.       In Congress, while we were working on the 21st Century      Cures and after it was signed into law, the HELP Committee      had 15 bipartisan briefings, some of which were in      conjunction with the Energy and Commerce Committee in the      House of Representatives as well, so we could hear from FDA      and industry about the reauthorization. The first of those      briefings was back in late 2015.       Outside of Congress, the FDA posted meeting minutes after      every negotiation, and held public meetings to hear feedback.       So the content of the commitment letters, and the changes      to the fee authorizations, should not be new, or a surprise,      for any member of this committee.       After the April 4th hearing, I hope to move to mark-up the      legislation in committee as soon as possible.       This is the first time that the user fees have sunset in      the first year of a new administration, so we are starting      hearings a little later this year than we did in 2012.       In order to get this done on time, any additional policies      that Senators may want to attach need to be broadly      bipartisan, related to human medical products, and non-     controversial in order to avoid slowing the package down.            How reauthorization builds on 21st Century Cures       There are many improvements in the commitment letters and      fee structure in these reauthorizations to be excited about.       The prescription drug and medical device reauthorizations      include many provisions that build on the work of 21st      Century Cures, such as: involving patients in drug and      medical device development, dedicated staff to assist in the      development and review of rare disease drugs, improved      timelines, increased guidance for drug and device combination      products, and modernizing the clinical trial process.       There are important structural reforms. Each agreement      contains reporting measures built both by FDA and by      independent third parties, so we can see how the changes are      working. FDA is going to work to implement full time      reporting by 2022, so Congress, patients, and medical product      manufacturers will have a better picture about how resources      are being used at FDA and understand what is needed to do      what we ask.       The biosimilar and generic drug user fee agreement includes      additional staff and resources to approve more biosimilars      and more generic drugs, which provide more competition and      lower drug costs.       These are just a few of the highlights of the      reauthorization and commitment letters. It is a good      agreement for patients, and I look forward to working with      Senator Murray and all the members of the Committee to get it      done expeditiously.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1886-2.txt,1695,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,March

1446,topic-id,1480,"Mr.President, today I come to the floor to express my opposition once again to the possibility that the Tennessee Valley Authority--the TVA, as we call it--might raise our electric bills and waste more than $1 billion buying electricity the region does not need by agreeing to purchase power from the Clean Line Energy Partners' proposed Plains & Eastern wind power transmission project.  Congress has a responsibility to conduct oversight of TVA's decisions and also to ensure that TVA is fulfilling its missions, as defined by the TVA Although TVA does not receive any Federal funding from Congress, TVA is a Federal corporation, and its board members are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the  The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the committees responsible for the oversight of TVA, have held hearings to discuss TVA's budget and policies.  So as a U.Senator, today I am here to exercise my oversight responsibilities on Clean Line Energy Partners, a Texas-based company, is proposing to build giant, unsightly transmission towers from Oklahoma, through Arkansas, to Tennessee--known as the Plains & Eastern Clean Line--to carry comparatively more expensive, less reliable electricity to Tennessee and other Southeastern  For the first time ever, Federal eminent domain will be used over the objection of the State of Arkansas and both of Arkansas's U.Senators to acquire the land necessary for the transmission line. In order to move forward with the construction of a single 700-mile, high-voltage, direct current transmission line, Clean Line Energy Partners must find utilities in the Southeast that are willing to purchase the power produced by an Oklahoma wind farm and transmitted by the Plains & Eastern Clean For this reason, Clean Line Energy Partners and their supporters have been urging the Tennessee Valley Authority to agree to a long-term power purchase agreement for wind power.  In November, shortly after the election, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said: ``We strongly encourage TVA's Board of Directors to immediately contract for at least 1,000 megawatts of wind power on the Plains and Eastern Clean Line.'' Why the rush, I would ask. The answer is this: Federal subsidies for wind power--subsidies that waste billions of dollars of taxpayer money each year--end after 2019. A petition being pushed by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy urging TVA to purchase the power spells this out. They said: ``Critical deadlines regarding the Federal production tax credit for wind power are fast approaching. . . . The time to contract for low-cost wind power is now.''  So last December, I wrote to the TVA and said: ``There should not be a rush to approve any proposal from Clean Line Energy This is a big, expensive decision and should be left to the new board next year.''  While this decision should be left to a full TVA board when all of its members are confirmed, I don't know why either a board with three vacancies, which is what we have today, or a complete board with all of its members confirmed would even consider approving such a deal. A contract with Clean Line Energy Partners could cost TVA ratepayers more than $1 billion over the next 20 to 30 years, the typical length of such an agreement. TVA would be disregarding its mission to provide low-cost power to the region if it were to contract for power the region doesn't need regardless of the source of the electricity.  In recent years, according to TVA, power demand throughout the Tennessee Valley has declined.  In 2013, TVA began working with its customers to develop a long-term plan to meet the region's power needs through 2033. In 2015, when TVA completed its Integrated Resource Plan, that plan concluded--this is TVA talking--that ``there is no immediate need for new base load plants after Watts Bar Nuclear Unit 2 comes online and upgrades are completed at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant.'' As a result of this conclusion, because TVA did not need power, TVA decided last year to sell the unfinished Bellefonte nuclear power plant.  For the foreseeable future, TVA has said it doesn't need any new baseload power and doesn't plan on any major new capital construction projects. This is good news for ratepayers because it means TVA can reduce debt and keep electric rates low. So why would TVA announce that it doesn't need new power for the next 15 years, sell a nuclear power plant capable of producing reliable baseload power for the next 60 years, and then turn around and buy unreliable wind power that might only be available for 20 or 30 years until the turbines break down?  TVA is, generally speaking, on a very good path. Its leadership has made sound decisions that will benefit ratepayers and our region. To fulfill its mission to provide safe, clean, reliable, and affordable power for the region's homes and businesses--that is its mission--it has opened the first nuclear power reactor in the 21st century. And I may say, going back to Senator Whitehouse's speech, nuclear power is[[Page S1924]]emission free--no sulfur, no nitrogen, no mercury, no carbon. Nuclear power produces 60 percent of all of our carbon-free electricity. TVA is also placing pollution control equipment on all of its coal plants and is completing new natural gas plants. The TVA has done this while reducing its debt and reducing electric rates, which is good news for jobs and economic development in the region. Even if TVA did need more power, which it has said it does not, TVA should not agree to buy more wind power which is comparatively unreliable and expensive.  A look at TVA's previous experience with wind power illustrates how unreliable it can be, especially in our region. In 2001, TVA opened its first commercial-scale wind project in the It is generous to say that it has been a failure. This project on Buffalo Mountain near Knoxville has the capacity to generate 27 megawatts of electricity; however, according to TVA, in 2016--last year--the Buffalo Mountain wind turbines produced only 4.3 megawatts on average. Capacity is 27 megawatts and generation was 4.3 megawatts--that is just 16 percent of their rated capacity. In other words, these turbines, which cost as much as $40 million to build and must cost millions more over the life of the contract, produce little electricity and little value to TVA's ratepayers.  Wind usually blows at night when consumers are asleep and don't need as much electricity. Until there is some way to store large amounts of wind power, a utility still needs to operate gas, nuclear, or coal plants when the wind doesn't blow. For example, take a recent TVA peak summer day. On July 26, 2016, Tennessee Valley homes and businesses consumed 29,512 megawatts of electricity--nearly all of TVA's capacity of 33,000 megawatts of electricity. Part of TVA's capacity on that day included contracts for nearly 1,250 megawatts of electricity produced by wind power. However, at the peak demand during the day, when power is most urgently needed, those wind turbines with a rated capacity of 1,250 megawatts actually delivered only 185 megawatts of electricity. So on a day when the Tennessee Valley needed power the most, wind turbines provided less than 15 percent of their rated capacity and less than 1 percent of the total electricity needed to power our region's homes and businesses.  Not only is wind power unreliable, it can be more expensive than nuclear, which also produces zero emissions, or natural gas, which is low emission.  TVA is currently completing a new 900-megawatt natural gas plant for roughly $975 million that will improve air quality in Memphis and be one of the most efficient natural gas plants in the world. Natural gas plants usually operate for at least 30 years and according to TVA can provide power in as little as 20 minutes to meet peak demand during hot summer afternoons and cold winter nights.  Last year, TVA opened the country's first nuclear power reactor in the 21st century, Watts Bar 2, at a cost of $5 billion. Watts Bar 2 will safely provide 1,150 megawatts of power more than 90 percent of the time for the next 40, 60, and possibly even 80 years, all of it emission free, no sulfur, no nitrogen, no mercury, no carbon.  The point is, TVA has concluded that it doesn't need more power for the foreseeable future; therefore, its board should resist obligating TVA's ratepayers for any new large power contracts, much less contracts for comparatively expensive and unreliable wind power. Instead, TVA should continue to provide low-cost, reliable power to the region because that boosts economic development throughout the Tennessee  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

So I want to, again, thank my colleague, Mike Gallagher, for his leadership in rallying the freshman class, both Republicans and Democrats, on an issue that I think, because of this unique time in the history of our country, a time that I think calls for bold action, he is seizing the opportunity and heeding that call on behalf of our freshman class. And so I am deeply grateful for his courageous leadership.  Our country, the greatest experiment in liberty and democracy, was conceived by men of great principle; men who were committed to leading, to governing; and, yes--and I know this isn't popular--to compromising; making difficult decisions and putting the Nation's interest above their own personal interest. They were also men who never envisioned a lifelong career in politics.  In 1819, only 1 percent of Representatives had served over 16 years. Now, 20 percent of Representatives have served over 16 years. The current scenario where Members of Congress serve for 15, 20, even 30 years, is inconsistent with the Founders' view of citizen statesmen. We need an environment that encourages politicians to do what is right not by their party or some special interest, and certainly not to secure their long-term career goals, but to do what is right for their fellow countrymen.  I think passing legislation to implement term limits across the board is a good step in the right direction. I am grateful to be a part of this body and a part of this freshman class.

95,topic-id,912,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the American Health Care  ObamaCare has failed, and we need to replace it. It has made health care inaccessible for many of the Americans it was created to help. Our premiums have skyrocketed, small business growth has been stunted as it can't expand due to health care regulations, and employees have seen their hours cut. Individuals are forced to purchase healthcare coverage they do not want.  Over the past 2 years, I have met with many Nebraskans in my district. I keep hearing about the broken promises of ObamaCare and the tight stranglehold this law has created for the American people. I have heard from a young mother who had to pay for the whole bill of the delivery of her child. The ACA plan she was on had a $12,000 deductible, and that plan didn't help her one cent.  Another citizen from Omaha, Jeanine, was happy with her healthcare insurance for decades. Five years ago, she was paying $323 a month and was satisfied with the coverage she had. Four years ago, she was told by her insurance company that she would have to pay more because she would need additional coverage, like maternity coverage, even though she was past that stage in her life. Two years ago, that insurance plan of Jeanine's jumped to $690 a month--double.  However, her health insurance company had another policy under ACA which she could switch to. She did so for $150 a month with a $550 credit. At least, she had that plan until her insurance company dropped that ACA policy and sent Jeanine searching for another policy. Now Jeanine is on an ACA policy that covers her primary doctor but not her dentist or her pharmacy. All Jeanine wants is a healthcare plan that fits her needs. She does not want the Federal Government telling her what coverage she must purchase.  Imagine for just a second that you have been happy for decades with a product you use, and one day the government comes in and tells you that you don't know what is best for you. They force you to pay more, and in return you get something that doesn't work. ACA is like the government telling you that you need to buy an expensive, fast, shiny sports car with all the bells and whistles, when all you wanted was a less expensive economy car to get you around town. But later you find out that that fancy sports car is actually a lemon.  That is exactly what happened to Jeanine and countless other Americans when ObamaCare forced them to coverage they did not want or need. This is more than a failed system. It is wrong to the core, and this is what the American Health Care Act is designed to fix.  The American Health Care Act is a step in the right direction, and we are fulfilling our promises to repair the problems that ACA has left us. This legislation repeals major flaws of ObamaCare, such as employer and individual mandates, letting individuals choose what coverage is best for them. Under this bill, health savings accounts will be expanded and will give tax credits for those who buy their own insurance to give them parity with those who get employer-provided coverage tax free. These are things that I campaigned on and promised to fight for, and they are in the bill.  The bill also gives States more control over their healthcare policies, allowing for patient-centered health care and getting the Federal bureaucrats out of the discussion. The American Health Care Act, instead, allows for individuals to choose the health insurance plans based on their needs and budget, allowing for Americans to have greater access and to find a health plan that is right for them. The CBO shows that it is going to lower those premiums by 10 percent. Now, Nebraska had a 51 percent increase last year, Mr.This plan is going to lower premiums by 10 percent.  The American Health Care Act will reduce the deficit and cut taxes. According to Monday's CBO score, this bill will reduce the Federal deficit by $337 billion and lower taxes by $883 billion. That is good for  Finally, the American Health Care Act does this and yet preserves affordable insurance for those with preexisting conditions and maintains a safety net for those who cannot pay premiums. These are things that I also promised to fight for, and they are in the bill.  I look forward to working with my fellow House Members on both sides of the aisle to deliver the best law for the American people. We are going to be debating this bill for the next few weeks, and we are going to make it better.  I am proud that this Congress and the Republican leadership have made a commitment to passing this legislation in an open and transparent process. This is a good first step toward fixing the mess of the  Before we vote on this, I encourage my colleagues and the American people to carefully read the bill so they can find out what is in it. Unlike ObamaCare, we don't have to pass this to find out what is in it. We know now.  This is a great step forward, a patient-centered, doctor-supported healthcare system that gives power back to the States and gets the bureaucrat out of our healthcare decisions.

1343,topic-id,396,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Wisconsin for organizing this. He is a wonderful freshman Member of the class.  I rise today in support of congressional term limits.  In 1846, when then-Congressman Abraham Lincoln was elected to the U.House of Representatives, he was part of a freshman class that made up one half of the 35th In other words, half of the Congress were new Members when he got elected. Today, in the 115th Congress, our freshmen class of 55 Members make up less than 20 percent of this body. But here is a more stark number.  In the last election, 97 percent of House incumbents won reelection--97 percent. Only 3 percent of the challengers defeated an incumbent.

As a person who is new to Congress and is new to politics, I can tell you the reason why congressional favorability ratings are now at 8 percent. Our constituents feel that we have lost touch. The longer we stay here in Congress and don't cycle back to our home districts, the more out of touch we are perceived.  To restore America's trust in Congress, we must institute term limits. Our Forefathers intended the House of Representatives to be an arm of government closest to the people, and to be the purest embodiment of a representative democracy. Members of the people's House were to come from different walks of life and careers to better shape the direction of our great country.

182,topic-id,334,"Mr.President, joining my colleague here on the floor, I agree with all of the comments the Senator from Arizona has made. They are interesting because as to the history of the State of the Senator from Arizona and his family history, Judge Gorsuch has a similar history, to the point that his great-grandfather built a hotel in Wyoming called the Wolf Hotel, in Saratoga, I found a picture of that hotel from 1878, which was 12 years before Wyoming became a I got that picture from the American history museum at the University of Wyoming and got a copy of the picture and gave it to Judge  In front of the hotel in 1878, there was a stagecoach with six horses lined up ahead of it. The Wolf Hotel was a halfway stop on the stagecoach line between a couple of communities in They were about 40 miles apart. So that is the heritage from which Judge Gorsuch comes.  I think that western heritage is important. But I think that additionally important is what the Senator referred to--his judicial temperament, being such a mainstream member of the judiciary, and this general belief inherent within him that the role of a judge is to apply the law, not to legislate from the bench.

1047,topic-id,1286,"Mr.President, it was 7 years ago that Democrats in Congress passed They promised lower healthcare costs. What they delivered was a Washington mandate[[Page S1862]]for expensive insurance that many people found actually wasn't insurance they could use, even though they were forced to buy it. For 7 years, Americans have suffered under the consequences of that decision by this body and by the former  Less than 7 weeks into the Trump administration, Republicans introduced a plan to give Americans real healthcare reform. The American people know that ObamaCare has been a disaster, one broken promise after another. I hear about this every weekend when I am home in I heard about it this past weekend. There is now only one insurance company that is willing to offer ObamaCare coverage in my entire There are 1,000 counties all across the country in the same situation--only one option. This is not a marketplace; it is a monopoly.  As a doctor who has practiced medicine for 25 years, I can tell you that when it comes to healthcare, the last thing patients want to hear is that they don't have a choice: It is this or nothing. That is why Republicans promised we were going to repeal the restrictions in ObamaCare that limit people's choices. We promised to give people options, not mandates. The healthcare bill we are debating now is the first step to keeping that promise.  The bill starts to give people more choices so they can pick what is right for them and for their families. I want to talk about three ways that it does this.  First, the bill removes the mandates. It ends both the individual and the employer mandates. It eliminates the penalties that hard-working families have to pay if they decide that overpriced ObamaCare insurance isn't right for them. This was one of the most outrageous and unfair parts of the healthcare law. These mandates will be gone.  Second, the bill that the House is considering cuts taxes. It gets rid of the ObamaCare tax on prescription drugs. It gets rid of the ObamaCare tax on health insurance. It gets rid of the taxes on artificial appliances, such as pacemakers and artificial joints. Overall, the bill eliminates 15 different taxes. These taxes are obviously passed on to consumers; repealing them helps to bring down the cost of care.  Third, the repeal bill creates options for people and for It encourages people to find creative ways to help make healthcare costs more affordable for them. It expands how people can use health savings accounts, which is a great option for many people. It helps States do innovative things, such as create high risk pools to bring down costs for everybody. It gives States more flexibility when it comes to Medicaid  Let's face it: Medicaid is broken, and ObamaCare just threw more people onto this second-class health insurance. Just last week, we got evidence of how badly Medicaid is harming patients. The chief executive at the Mayo Clinic said in his speech that his hospital is going to give precedence to people with private insurance over people on The supporters of ObamaCare said that their biggest success is the number of people who got coverage by being put into Well, it is clear that many of these people are being harmed by being in Medicaid, a system that has been broken for decades. It is alarming and it is also appalling.  We have to fundamentally reform the Medicaid To do that, we have to give States more options for coming up with the reforms that work for them and for the people who live in those Every State is different, and a one-size-fits-all mandate from Washington will never work for all of the States all across the country. Democrats tried it, and it failed dramatically.  ObamaCare is collapsing all around us. We have to do something, and we have to start now. In the next couple of months, insurance companies are going to start making decisions about what they are going to do for next year, 2018. They will be figuring out how much they want to charge and whether they want to be involved in the ObamaCare exchanges at all. People have been losing their coverage and losing choices ever since the Democrats wrote the healthcare law and the President signed it 7 years ago. I believe it is going to get worse every day that we delay.  There are Democrats who don't really seem to care much about any of that. They would rather set the whole healthcare system on a path to fall apart completely before they will ever admit that they were wrong. Hard-working Americans and families across the country don't have that luxury. There are still 25 million Americans without insurance even 7 years after ObamaCare has been in place. Every year, people have gotten letters in the mail telling them that their plans have been canceled. That is the reality of Democrats want to pretend that everything is fine, but that is absolutely not true.  That is why it is so important that President Trump jumped in right away to take important steps to help stabilize the marketplace. He recognized what Democrats won't admit--that these ObamaCare markets are falling apart. So the President has already started doing what he can to stabilize the markets, to make sure people keep their options for health coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services has taken steps to preserve programs that ObamaCare tried to eliminate. These are plans that people already had and they liked and the law tried to say they could no longer exist. The Trump administration has said people can continue on those plans. The administration also tightened up some of the rules to make sure people actually pay the premiums for this year's insurance before they are allowed to sign up for next year. The administration is taking commonsense steps that will make it harder for people to game the system and that will lower the cost for everyone else. These are important steps. The administration is going to be doing a lot more to protect families and to create more options.  This repeal bill isn't perfect; nobody says it is. Still, it is a monumental shift away from The American people will be better off with this repeal plan. They will be better off with the additional reforms that we will continue to push after this bill.  I hope that Democrats will join us and offer their own ideas about what these additional reforms will look like. I hope they realize that families are better off when they have more choices, not fewer. We are better off when people can decide what is better for them and their families, not when government tells them what to do. We are better off when healthcare decisions are left to patients and doctors, not to Washington bureaucrats and insurance companies. We are better off when people have freedom and options, not mandates and penalties.  America needs healthcare reform. What we had before ObamaCare wasn't working; I saw that as a doctor. What we have now isn't working, either. It is time for everyone to admit that and to take this opportunity to start repairing the damage, start creating real reform. As Ronald Reagan said: It is better to get 80 percent of what you want rather than go over the cliff with a flag flying. The American people are asking for our help, and we cannot turn our backs on them now.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We may have disagreements as to how we are going to get to where we need to go, but we all agree that we need to go there. The question is: How do we do it?  One of the ways you create an environment where you have fresh ideas and fresh ways of looking at it is to change the people who are presenting and acting those ideas.  I find myself asking many times as we stand on the floor here: What would the Founders say if they were here today with us? How would they look at how we are enacting their vision of what it means to be a constitutionally-based Republic that is ``We the People''? How would they react?  I think there are probably a few things that they could not have imagined. Twitter or Snapchat might be one of them--pick your way of communicating across the spectrum that we now have today as our reality. I am not saying those things are bad.

284,topic-id,540,"Mr.Speaker, in the aftermath of the November election, it has been exciting to watch the unprecedented outpouring of citizen concern, activism, and, in some cases, outrage. America is finding its voice so Congress can find its spine.  Most recently, the people are demanding Congress be held accountable for the outrageous efforts on behalf of Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, forcing more expensive coverage for insurance plans that will not be as good and breaking the Trump promise of better, more affordable health care.  It has become clear that the Republican plan would force older Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 to pay 60 percent more for their health insurance coverage.  The Republican plan also seeks to unwind the life-changing expansion under Medicaid that has provided care for the poor, disabled, and lower income and helps people with mental illness and opioid addiction.  Wildly increasing the ranks of the uninsured and lowering the quality of care and affordability is so unacceptable to the American public that it is exposing deep divisions within the Republican ranks.  The wrecking crew is being slowed as public awareness and citizen action spread across the country. This morning, the American public has drawn a new assignment: to resist the Trump budget. It is shocking in its reckless cuts to programs that Americans hold dear.                              {time}  1015  What does it say that the cuts proposed to the Environmental Protection Agency are so extreme that even the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has made a career out of attacking the EPA, found it too brutal even for him?

Trump would not just impose shocking reductions on peacekeeping and humanitarian action, but he would deny the State Department the ability to exercise soft power. This compromises our national security interests and leaves us less safe.  Critical and widely supported lifesaving medical research efforts will be slashed, reversing years of bipartisan effort to enhance medical research to fight disease, illness, and disability.  At a time of housing crisis across the country, some of the few Federal tools to increase affordability and combat homelessness are being cut away.  This budget disaster would even zero out Federal support for public broadcasting, even though it represents just a tiny sliver of Federal budget and supports a vital public service.

468,topic-id,3441,"Mr.Speaker, this has been a fascinating 2 weeks here on Capitol We have had, last week, all night sessions in our Ways and Means Committee and on the Energy and Commerce Committee dealing with the Republican plan to dismantle the Affordable Care At times, Mr.Speaker, it is really hard to process all of the claims and counterclaims that are going on. I feel occasionally like I am in an alternative universe, and it is not just because we were up until 4:30 in the morning debating this.  People have lost track of how we got to this point--what was happening earlier, what has been the benefit and accomplishment of the Affordable Care Act, and what is going to happen moving forward were we to adopt a really disastrous proposal advanced by my Republican friends.  Twenty-five years ago, I was in a different role as Portland's commissioner of public works. And one of the elements in my portfolio for several years was to deal with personnel and benefits and health care. I am fully aware of trying to deal with our 6,000 employees to provide them with affordable health care that the city, as the employer, could afford, and that wasn't too burdensome on our employees. We were caught in a situation with rapidly escalating costs, inflation for medical care twice the rate of the ordinary inflation; we were having problems with employers maintaining coverage in an affordable fashion; and the individual market was, frankly, very chaotic and troublesome.  I have with me here a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation from March of 2009. They talked about these challenges--how the United States healthcare spending had risen from 1970 from 7.2 percent of the gross domestic product to where they projected that it was going to cost us by 2018, next year.[[Page H2144]]It would be $4.3 trillion, $13,100 per resident, and account for over 20 percent of the gross domestic product.  Mr.Speaker, I am pleased to say that, as a result of the unprecedented reforms that were incorporated in the Affordable Care Act, we were able to deal with this problem. We began 10 years ago, when Democrats gained control of Congress, working on expansion of the CHIP program, children's health, and it was one of the first actions signed into law by President Obama when he assumed office and we weren't facing a veto from the Bush administration.  We have been working for over 3 years trying to lay the foundation for moving forward with a comprehensive approach for healthcare reform. And it should be noted, for all of the hyperbole about socialized medicine and government dictating outcomes and taking control away from the American people, that is the furthest thing from the truth.  In fact, the program that was developed by President Obama and the Democrats, with no help from Republicans, was actually a middle ground. It relied upon the private insurance that most Americans had through work, and be able to expand that coverage, to be able to improve the quality of care, to be able to rein in medical inflation, to be able to deal with some of the most needy of us, and to be able to have a healthcare system that performed better.  The simple fact is we spend about twice as much as any other developed country in the world. And our outcomes, on average, are worse than what happens in those countries that my friends on the other side of the aisle derided--Canada, Great Britain, France, As a practical matter, those people get sick less often, they get well faster, they live longer, and they do so for a fraction of what we pay.  So what we did, through a very extensive process--multiple public hearings, meetings, seminars, position papers that were generated from a wide variety of areas--was to assemble a program to deal with that. One of the elements that drew the scorn of my Republican friends, and, in fact, is part of their repeal that is one of the centerpieces, is to repeal the mandate that people have health care.  It is ironic that that has become a target from Republicans because the mandate came from Republican alternatives to HillaryCare in the Clinton administration. In fact, 19 Republican Senators, including Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, supported a healthcare mandate to be able to expand and stabilize the health insurance market.  Well, what we have done through those 2 years that it was enacted, March 23, 2010--we are approaching the seventh anniversary--it went live in the fall and was fully in effect in 2014. So in the 3 years that the Affordable Care Act has been in place, it has had remarkable achievements.  You recall I mentioned what the studies showed that we were facing with rapidly escalating healthcare costs, where it was estimated that we would be having over 20 percent of the gross domestic product, we would be approaching over $13,100 per resident. Well, that didn't happen. Despite the dire predictions of the Republican opposition, healthcare costs did not skyrocket.  In fact, we anticipate now that instead of being over $13,000 per resident, it is under $10,000 after a couple years of operation of the Affordable Care Not over 20 percent of the gross domestic product, but 18 percent. We have found that these are the lowest rates of medical inflation since we have been keeping track.  The Affordable Care Act, by any stretch of the imagination, has been a success. We have seen coverage expand dramatically to the lowest rate of uninsured in the United States in our history while we have contained costs. That success is all the more remarkable because there has been a concerted effort on the part of the Republicans, from the moment they seized control of the House in 2011, to make it worse.  Bear in mind, the Republicans attacked the Affordable Care Act in court, on the floor of the House, and in terms of trying to muddy the waters on the State level. The Supreme Court challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act failed. The Supreme Court decided that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional and would remain.  But the Supreme Court made a devastating decision that allowed individual States to opt out of Medicaid expansion. That was part of the program that was so important to be able to extend care on a cost-effective basis to some of the lowest income people in the country. Thirty-one States did. Nineteen States refused to do so. That undercut the coverage, made huge problems, created situations where there were people in the Republican-controlled States that refused to extend Medicaid, despite the fact that the Federal Government was paying for it, that we had people who were too poor to qualify for assistance. Shocking, embarrassing, and to the detriment of those States, they had much worse outcomes.  But it is ironic that some of the people who started attacking the Congressional Budget Office projections about the impact of the Republican plan pointed to the calculation on the part of the CBO that they underestimated the number of people who would be uninsured.                              {time}  1930  Well, that was precisely because there was no expectation that States would not expand Medicare, and if that unfortunate decision hadn't been made, we would, in fact, have seen them hit their target numbers.  Despite the claims of outrage on the Republican side that there would be employers dropping coverage for their employees en masse, we found that, in the main, employers retained coverage. Now, this is not the case going forward with the Republican proposal.  I think there was a reason why my Republican friends insisted on jamming this through the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee before we had a chance for the scorekeeper, the CBO, to give the results of their analysis: because they knew how bad it would look.  The CBO anticipates that there will be 14 million more uninsured Americans, including 2 million who will lose coverage provided by their employer because of the way their alternative tax credit for health insurance would be structured. In my State, it is estimated that as many as 465,000 Oregonians could lose coverage. The uninsured rate will triple in our  One of the areas that has been most successful with the Affordable Care Act has been for older They benefit from the protections against discrimination, and they are going to see a return to much higher premiums and higher costs.  The Republican plan would take the requirement that seniors pay no more than three times the rate of insurance for premiums for younger people, that will be five times greater. And instead of the subsidy that is based on income, there will just be a flat subsidy across the board. This means, in practice, that older Americans are going to face steeply higher premiums, and they are going to pay far more out-of-pocket because of the less generous subsidy.  One example that ought to get, I think, everybody's attention: In 2026, a 64-year-old with an income of about $26,500 would pay $14,600 for their health insurance as opposed to $1,700 today, an increase of almost $13,000.  Now, there are winners and losers under the Republican approach. The healthy, young people will catch a break, but older Americans will pay a lot more at precisely the time when they need health insurance.  Now, our Speaker appeared to be confused when he was describing the difference between the Republican approach and the Affordable Care Act, when he talked about how all of these people are being subsidized by the majority, who aren't sick. As many commentators rushed to point out to the Speaker, that is what insurance is about. Many people pay some to subsidize those who suffer loss. You pay a couple of hundred dollars a year for auto insurance so that, when you have a $10,000 loss, that is picked up by the people who don't suffer a loss but paid the premiums nonetheless.  Think about what the Republicans have put in place. They are doubling down on what the Trump administration has done trying to discredit the efficacy of the program, casting it in[[Page H2145]]doubt. The administration has already stopped enforcing the mandate.  The IRS is supposed to check and enforce to make sure that people sign up for the ACA and everybody is part of the insurance pool, just like States have mandatory auto insurance. You are not allowed to run the risk of harming your fellow motorists by not having insurance. That is widely accepted and understood that it is necessary to have the system work right.  Now the Republicans are increasing the damage that Trump has imposed, unilaterally, by not enforcing the mandate. They are going to repeal the mandate. In place of the mandate, they are going to have a 30 percent surcharge in case people drop coverage and decide to reenter the insurance pool.  Well, think about that for a moment. The people who are young, healthy, who feel invincible and don't have healthcare problems now are very likely not to get insurance at all. They figure that when they get sick, they can go ahead, pay the 30 percent premium. If they find out they have got cancer, some serious disease, then they can sign up later. It is designed to destabilize the insurance system that we have.  By the same token, we are looking at the other end of the spectrum where the people who are lower income, older, and sick are going to pay a disproportionate burden. That is why the CBO determined, in their analysis, that in 2026, actually, there will be a drop in terms of insurance premiums, in terms of the cost. They will start to go down. They will go down because older Americans will be unable to afford the premium. They will drop the coverage.  It is not that they don't need health care. It is not that they are going to somehow avoid becoming sick or having accidents, but they are not going to have insurance coverage. That means the care that many of them are going to experience will be what we were fighting against before the Affordable Care It will be in the emergency room. It will be when it is too late. It is not in a clinic before things get worse. It is after the fact, and it is in a setting that is not nearly as effective.  Mr.Speaker, it is really disappointing that part of the assault is on the Medicaid program itself. Medicaid is this program that provides care to the elderly, disabled, pregnant women, children, poor people. It is part of the bedrock safety net of this country. Republicans were against the expansion of Medicaid and making the qualifications to have Medicaid be more generous.  Under the Affordable Care Act, it is 138 percent of poverty, so lower and middle-income families are able to access this care. Prior to that, there were widely varying requirements across the country, and many of the States, particularly in the South, the States that declined to expand Medicaid, were facing really onerous restrictions--$10,000, $12,000, $7,000 family income--making it very, very hard and for only the most desperately poor to qualify for it.  Now, the Republican plan will eliminate the Medicaid expansion in its current form. It would cap Medicaid funding, and, ultimately, we are going to watch, reverting to what we had before--in effect, de facto rationing.  In Oregon, the Republican plan would shift $2.5 billion back to the States over the next 6 years. States are going to be left with impossible decisions: reducing benefits, cutting people off of  This is what has happened historically when people ran into difficult financial times in the They didn't raise taxes to make sure that the poor were provided coverage; they cut back coverage even more.  Sadly, under the Republican plan, 14 million Americans would lose Medicaid coverage by 2026, and it would start having its impact in less than 3 years.  The policy would also severely set back efforts to combat opioid addiction and improve mental health treatment.  In my community, as I visit health centers, find out what is going on in clinics, in local government, officials that deal with the homeless, the drug addicted, the mentally ill, we found that they are using the opportunity to enroll people in Medicaid to give them proper care and not put that burden on local governments that they simply can't cope with.  The Republican plan would prevent that. We won't be able to have people most in need provided with the mental health, the addiction services, the health care that they need.  The Republican plan would put 2.8 million people with substance disorders, including over 200,000--about 220,000 is the estimate that I have seen--with opioid disorders, at risk of losing their coverage, including the coverage of addiction treatment, continuing the tragic cycle that we see played out in our streets across the country, but particularly in Some of the areas that actually were most opposed to the Affordable Care Act have received the greatest benefit.  In a time of concern about budget deficits, repealing the Affordable Care taxes--which we approved in the Ways and Means Committee in the middle of the night last week--would create an immediate windfall tax cut for the highest American taxpayers. The Affordable Care Act was a balanced plan that actually reduced the deficit while it improved healthcare outcomes across the country.  This approach is going to provide--for example, the top 400 earners would see an average tax break of about $7 million a year, and people who are millionaires will be receiving tax cuts averaging $57,000 apiece; but, as it plays out, we will find taxes would raise significantly on about 7 million low- and moderate-income families.  Mr.Speaker, it also puts in jeopardy Medicare coverage for 57 million Americans by cutting the Medicare trust fund resources. Because of the total impact of what we have done with the Affordable Care Act, we have watched the Medicare trust fund have its life extended 2 years. The Republican tax proposal will cut $170 billion from the Medicare trust fund, moving it closer to being insolvent.  It is fascinating. Donald Trump promised not to touch Medicare or This plan violates both those promises. And as I had mentioned, the Trump promise that everybody would be covered under the Republican plan rings false. That is simply not the case.  Mr.Speaker, it was interesting, in the course of our deliberations, we received correspondence from the American Association of Retired They represent 38 million members in all 50 States, in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin It has a proven track record of being nonpartisan, a nationwide organization that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities for older They have a wide range of issues for which they have championed and gained notoriety; but, most significantly, we have watched them be involved with healthcare decisions, and they have been proven nonpartisan. In fact, I took issue with them when we were dealing with the Medicare part D prescription drug program in 2004.                              {time}  1945  It was unfortunate, I thought, that they kind of threw their weight to an inadequate program that was not paid for, that added to the deficit, and didn't do anything to fight to reduce prescription drug costs. But they made the judgment that this was the best they could do for the people they represented, and they didn't hesitate for a moment to work with Republicans to be able to enact that.  They wrote on March 7 to the chairs of our Energy and Commerce Committee and our Ways and Means Committee to express their opposition to the American Health Care They did so because it would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability. They said it would dramatically increase the healthcare cost for Americans age 50 to 64 and put at risk the health care of millions of children and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on Medicaid programs for long-term services, supports, and other benefits.  They have long fought to protect Medicare, and they pointed out in their correspondence that the 2016 Medicare trustee report said that the Medicare part A trust fund is solvent until 2028. This is 11 years longer than the projection immediately before the Affordable Care Because of the changes in the Affordable Care Act, we gained solvency, 11 years longer.  Now, they have serious concerns about the Health Care Act that repealed provisions that strengthen the[[Page H2146]]fiscal outlook, specifically the repeal of the .9 percent payroll tax on higher income workers. According to their analysis, this provision would hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the future.  Think about it, Mr.Speaker, we are dramatically increasing the number of uninsured We are going to give them more expensive insurance of a lower quality. They will have higher deductibles and copays. At the same time, we are jeopardizing the future of Medicare, which so many American seniors rely upon.  They pointed out that about 6.1 million Americans age 50 to 64 purchase their insurance in the nongroup market, and that over half of them were eligible to receive subsidies for health insurance coverage. They note the significant reduction in the number of uninsured since passage of the ACA, with the number of people in that age bracket dropping by half.  Yet, according to CBO, what is going to happen if the Republican plan is enacted, that that number is going to go back up again, it is going to be unaffordable for a number of seniors, and they are going to be paying a much higher cost.  Mr.Speaker, it is troubling that we are having a debate where we really have tried to discredit independent sources, where we have had no hearing dealing with the legislation that is rushing toward the House floor.  It is ironic that there was debate and discussion criticizing Democrats for the 3 years we spent developing the framework for moving the legislation forward. And after 6 years of my Republican friends being in power in the House, chipping away, undermining the Affordable Care Act, trying to make it worse, discrediting it, and voting over 60 times to repeal it, they do not have a plan in place to replace it.  Now, this is the best we can come up with. It is a program that is widely discredited.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2143-2.txt,99,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,16.0,March

845,topic-id,646,"Mr.Speaker, one of the most disturbing aspects of the Republican attack on the Affordable Care Act and the success we have had in extending care to Americans has been the specific attack on Fourteen million of the 24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican bill are under the Medicaid program. Medicaid is critical to the provision of health care in the United Medicaid covers more people than  Medicaid expansion has been transformational in the 31 States that took advantage of the provision in the Affordable Care Act to provide coverage to people who make up to 138 percent of poverty--roughly $16,600 for a single individual and almost $34,000 for a family of four.  Until then, Medicaid has provided extension of care to the elderly, to the poor, and to the disabled. It was helpful, but very restrictive. In some cases, people who earned a modest sum--$7,000, $10,000, $12,000--were ineligible, especially in those 19 States that refused to take advantage of the opportunity to expand the Medicaid coverage at Federal expense.  Mr.Speaker, this is So even though these poor, disabled people did not have access to Medicaid, many of them did ultimately secure health care. But they got it too late. They got it in the emergency room. They didn't get it in a clinic in a timely fashion. And, of course, the cost for that charity care in emergency rooms or in clinics was borne by the rest of us in increased costs for our insurance.  The Republican draconian provisions, even before they put into effect an absolutely unnecessary and unenforceable work requirement, will be devastating to millions. Bear in mind, these people now are receiving care in an appropriate clinic session. They will be getting it now when it is too late, and that burden shifted on to the rest of us.  There will be a tax credit that doesn't help people who don't have enough money to buy meaningful coverage in the private market. Under the Republican plan, coverage will become worse, deductibles and copays will become higher, and we risk destabilizing the insurance market for the rest of us.  Now, we have heard on the floor, in committee, and on the news shows our Republican friends and the President talking about the Affordable Care Act is in a death spiral and that the insurance industry is collapsing.  There was a fascinating article in the weekend New York Times that looked at the insurance industry. Since March of 2010, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the overall stock market has more than doubled. It has increased 136 percent. But the managed care health organizations have increased their stock value almost 300 percent. The largest, UnitedHealth, 480 percent.  A signal of an industry in a death spiral?  Absolutely not. The companies are healthy and investors are bidding up their stock. The CBO report that our Republican friends did not want us to have before we voted on the bill in committee in the middle of the night testifies to this underlying stability of the insurance market and the Affordable Care  Medicaid under the Republican plan will be shifted back increasingly to the States, which have repeatedly proven that they are incapable of maintaining high eligibility funding to help the poor and the near poor. And when budget crunches hit, it is the poor who suffer most with restrictions in their coverage.  We have also heard that the Republican plan will provide much-needed flexibility. That is nonsense. There is already ample flexibility under the Affordable Care I represent We were able to negotiate an agreement with the Federal Government under the 1115 waiver program that other States have that represented a unique partnership with the Federal Government to achieve better care, better results, and restrain Medicare costs. We have got the flexibility. There is no need to destroy the program.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2245.txt,99,VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT OF 2017,2017.0,21.0,March

1080,topic-id,827,"Mr.President, later today the Senate will vote on H.69, and I am here to state as strongly and emphatically as possible my opposition to this misguided and unwise measure.  As a Senator who fights to preserve and protect the vast diversity of American wildlife and honor the natural beauty of our Nation's great refuges, I urge my colleagues to reject the effort to revoke a commonsense rule of the U.Fish and Wildlife This rule of the FWS is designed to prevent the use of cruel, unsporting, and inhumane killing methods on Federal land. It is really that simple, and repeal of it is an outrage.  Proponents of H.69 have attempted to frame this debate as an effort by the Federal Government to usurp State power, but that argument is simply absurd. The rule at issue is about Federal management of Federal land, Federal control over land owned by the Federal Government, pure and simple. The rule, which took effect in September, does not restrict subsistence hunting or normal hunting practices. It does not imperil public safety or impede on defense of property. It simply prevents brutal, cruel, barbaric hunting methods that target vulnerable bears, wolves, and coyote from occurring on lands that were intended to provide refuge for these animals. ``Refuge'' is the key word.  This resolution subverts the judgment of professional wildlife managers to adopt sensible wildlife management actions that are based on the best available science. If the U.Fish and Wildlife Service rule is undermined, any State would be permitted to allow egregious killing methods on these wildlife refuges, which is the one category of Federal lands specifically set aside to benefit wildlife. That is its singular purpose.  I will oppose this legislation because I believe in preserving our Nation's natural ecosystem and the constitutional responsibility of the Federal Government to manage Federal lands for all citizens and prevent the inhumane treatment of our Nation's most iconic wildlife.  This rule bans the killing of wolves and their pups at their den sites in springtime when they are most vulnerable. It bans the killing of sleeping black bear mothers and their cubs while they are hibernating in winter--not exactly fair sport and certainly damaging to our environment. The rule also bans the baiting of grizzly bears, which involves the use of toxic, rotting food or grease to lure and acclimate bears to a certain area so that trophy hunters can get a point-blank shot. It prohibits the use of traps such as steel-jawed traps or snares, which cause animals to suffer injury as they fight the trap or even slow and painful death from starvation or exposure. It prohibits using airplanes and helicopters to scout, land, and shoot brown or black bears. These practices are not only cruel and inhumane, they are really unsporting and have no place in a civilized society.  This resolution would foreclose our wildlife managers from making Federal wildlife management decisions. It will undoubtedly affect the future of all American wildlife, including regulating[[Page S1877]]inhumane practices on Alaska national wildlife refuges even though those practices may be recognized as cruel and unsustainable.  All in all, voiding the U.Fish and Wildlife rule would set a dangerous precedent for the management of public lands across the country. Time and time again, our Federal courts have held that the Federal Government has the authority to regulate wildlife on Federal lands and cannot be superseded by initiatives at the State level. This Federal rule explicitly prohibits only these particularly gruesome and egregious methods of hunting or other kinds of practices on national wildlife refuges. It does not apply to hunting in State-owned wilderness or to rural Alaskan practices for residents who hunt for subsistence.  Regardless of my colleagues' claims, there is not a Tenth Amendment issue here, and the case law clearly demonstrates it, from the Supreme Court decision in 1976 that held that ``the Property Clause also gives Congress the power to protect wildlife on public lands, state law notwithstanding''; the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which followed it; and just last year, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, which repeated the Supreme Court's well-established jurisprudence on the supremacy clause and the property clause.  Neither the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act nor the Alaska Statehood Act grants any State official the power to overrule these Federal land managers' decisions.  Putting aside the legal issues--and there are none that really argue in favor of sabotaging this Fish and Wildlife Service rule--it is the right thing to do for us and for our future. This legislation would essentially reject our authority and our responsibility and our obligation to future generations to promote humane wildlife management practices. It is not only a matter of our law but who we are and what kind of society we believe we should have.  I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing this abhorrent and appalling legislation.

1431,topic-id,1076,"Mr.President, I am here in the midst of a Judiciary Committee hearing on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, showing, and in a way showcasing, the wonder of American justice. This hearing will proceed through the balance of the day with him as our witness, and then into tomorrow with others who will comment on his qualifications.  The showcasing of American justice really demonstrates how the rule of law serves our democracy and how we strive to appoint the best possible people--men and women, dedicated public servants--to the courts of our land to assure that the rule of law and American justice are second to none and as infallible in protecting individual rights as they can possibly be.  In a sense, I am here to talk about a rule that also serves American justice. It is a rule put forward by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under the last administration. I am here to oppose H.83, which would repeal that rule. The rule is known as the OSHA injury recordkeeping rule. It sounds very technical, obscure, and for most people it is, but there are nearly 3 million serious injuries reported every year at American workplaces.  For over 40 years; that is, four decades, Federal law has required employers with 11 or more employees in dangerous professions--poultry slaughtering, meat packing, steel mills, construction--which see the bulk of these injuries to keep active records of injury suffered in those workplaces and others like them that are considered dangerous.  Having accurate records is common sense for employers who want to know what is going right in their places of work and what is going wrong and how they can prevent workers from being hurt on the job because they don't want anybody hurt. Responsible employers want safe workplaces. It is really that simple. We all know injuries are bad for business and they cost time and money.  With those records, OSHA can also investigate companies and work to make them safer and ensure they comply with the law. In essence, they can look at the outliers--who are lawbreakers, who cares less about safety than profits--but also maybe employers who don't do as much as they could or would if they were better informed.  A misguided court ruling in 2012, after 40 years of the law prevailing, curtailed OSHA's ability to sanction employers concerning those records. The ruling limited OSHA's ability to sanction employers to just 6 months of the start of the investigation based on the records. Soon after that ruling, OSHA and the Obama administration discovered it could not adequately investigate employers who provided an unsafe workplace, making them effectively immune from some safety laws.  After going through all the proper rulemaking, all of the steps that are necessary to make an administrative rule, all the channels and procedures, the last administration put forward a rule that responds to the court decision and allows OSHA to review those records for 5 years. That is essentially how things worked for 40 years. It worked well for 40 years, and it was simply reinstituted because the court decision was so crippling to the rule of law and American justice. That is the rule we are discussing today--a return to longstanding policy that existed for decades under Republican and Democratic administrations, dating back to the Presidency of Richard  Putting aside the 40 years' worth of this rule working well, it does some very important things. It requires these large employers in dangerous industries to keep accurate records of serious work-related injuries and illnesses. It has no impact on a huge swath of the economy that is not considered dangerous. It doesn't apply to restaurants, offices, and many other workplaces, regardless of the number of employees they have; the rule impacts just the most dangerous industries in our economy and companies in that industry with more than 10 employees. It essentially prevents them from covering up injuries, maintaining fraudulent records concerning injuries, and willfully violating the law.  There are things the rule does not do. It imposes no new costs on employers. It imposes no new obligations. It simply returns to a policy that worked well for decades--I repeat, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, accepted by both--and it gives certainty to businesses. That is one of the great advantages in an economy and society where certainty for our job creators is very valuable.  Repealing this rule would lead to more dangerous workplaces and give unsafe companies an upper hand in competition. It would unlevel the playing field between the good guys and the bad guys in those industries. This rule would essentially eliminate requirements that employers keep proper records, as they know OSHA can do nothing to investigate. Repeal of the rule amounts to the Federal Government siding with the companies that see injuries on the job but in effect sweep them under the rug. Repeal promotes companies to keep false records--if they keep records at all--limiting enforcement and punishment of anyone who keeps two sets of books, which few would do. Repeal of this rule undermines companies that keep safe[[Page S1913]]workplace records and are in competition with companies that are cutting corners. This has implications for taxpayers. Many procurement processes seek information about companies' safety records, giving a leg up to the safer company, as should be the case. That is in taxpayers' interests. Repeal of the rule would take away this incentive to protect employees.  Repealing this rule is bad for taxpayers, is bad for Federal policy, particularly in those areas where the Federal Government is a purchaser and a consumer, because it deserves to know--and so do we all--which ones are the safe employers.  Former Obama and Bush administration officials oppose repeal of this rule. Dozens of health and safety groups warn against the spike in injuries that repeal may encourage in work-related injuries and illnesses. Labor organizations representing millions of workers nationwide and many Fortune 500 companies oppose this resolution and support the rule. Health and safety groups, labor organizations, Fortune 500 companies, and officials from the past two administrations all support the rule and oppose this resolution. It is truly bipartisan.  I urge my colleagues to unite across the aisle and resist the false and unfortunate arguments that are made in favor of this resolution. I urge colleagues to join me in opposing it because it will endanger workers in the most hazardous places in the workplace and the country.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1624,topic-id,870,"Mr.President, the rules that the Federal Communications Commission recently promulgated--and when I say ``recently,'' it was October, only months ago--expanded the concept of privacy and consumer protection as applied to broadband. Now we are on the verge of rescinding those rules through S.34.  This resolution is a direct attack on consumer rights, on privacy, on rules that afford basic protection against intrusive and illegal interference with consumers' use of social media sites, websites, that often they take for granted. Many Americans simply don't stop to think about how broadband providers, as the carriers of all internet traffic, are also able to collect and use consumer data, to put together a detailed picture of who they are, what they do, where and when they buy things, where they go, what they like to do--all of it an array of data that people assume is private, all of it freely available to those internet providers.  Even when data is encrypted, our broadband providers can piece together significant amounts of information about us--including private information, medical conditions, financial problems--based on online activity. It is a mine that can be used--more valuable than a gold mine--because that information can be sold and bought and used again so that privacy becomes a completely evanescent and illusory feature of our lives.  Consumers wanting to switch broadband providers are often hit with hefty termination fees, and they have to experience a lapse in Internet service at home--something that most simply don't have the luxury to do or endure in today's connected society where internet is accessible. They have no meaningful choice about how to safeguard broadband privacy. They have one choice if they want speeds above 25 megabits per second. That is why I applauded those rules when they were promulgated by the FCC back in October, finalizing broadband privacy protections. I applauded them because signing up for the internet should not mean you sign away your rights to privacy.  Just as telephone networks must obtain consumer approval before selling customer information, broadband providers ought to be required to obtain consumers' affirmative consent before selling their sensitive browsing or app usage data to advertisers. The FCC rules that this resolution would decimate, utterly destroy, essentially seek to protect that privacy interest. The only way the FCC's broadband privacy rules protect consumers is through an affirmative opt-in consent. That is the only real protection that works.  These rules also prohibit pay-for-privacy schemes that would require consumers to waive their privacy protections as a precondition to receiving service. They establish data security and breach notification standards for broadband providers.  They also have important national security implications. Just last week, the Department of Justice indicted four individuals, including Russian spies, for hacking into Yahoo! systems in 2014 and obtaining access to at least 500 million Yahoo! accounts. According to the indictment, these Russian intelligence officers spied on U.Government officials and private sector employees of financial companies. One defendant also exploited the data for financial gain.  Without clear rules of the road, broadband subscribers will have no certainty or choice about how their private information can be used, no protection against abuse, and no assurance that security standards will be bolstered against that kind of attack that the Russians and their spies launched.  The FTC doesn't have jurisdiction over the security and privacy practices of broadband, cable, and wireless carriers. If the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in FTC v. AT&T is upheld, adopting a ``status-based'' instead of ``activity-based'' interpretation of the FTC's common carrier exemption, the FTC's jurisdiction and ability to impose privacy and security obligations would be even further curtailed.  Critics also say that the FCC's broadband privacy rules would unfairly create a separate regulatory regime for ``edge providers,'' websites such as Google or If that is their real concern, why haven't they focused their efforts on ensuring that the FTC has meaningful rulemaking authority so that it can implement privacy and data security rules over such websites?  In closing, I have long supported giving the FTC authority to adopt its own rules governing the privacy and security of websites. Giving the FTC authority to adopt new rules would help ensure our privacy, keep our privacy safe no matter where we go on the internet or how we connect. However, I don't see any of our colleagues, in supporting this resolution, rushing to accomplish these goals.  We should all remember that consumers need control over their own information and how it is used. This resolution would subvert and sabotage that control.  All too often, Americans take for granted privacy until it is lost. Once it is lost, rarely can it be recovered. Once that information becomes public, privacy is irreparably damaged.  Today's vote, if it succeeds, will deprive Americans of important baseline privacy standards that they expect and demand the government to provide. Few Americans are aware of this vote today. Many will be aware of its consequences. It will do extraordinary damage to privacy, if it is approved.  I urge my colleagues to reject it and to help preserve American privacy.

We heard that every single nominee was being handled too quickly, even though every previous President since the first President has managed to have a Cabinet confirmed by the Senate quicker than this one.  Clearly the process going on right now--hours of questioning beginning today for Judge Gorsuch, who has a 10-year record as an appeals judge on the Tenth Circuit, where all of the other judges in the district courts under the Tenth Circuit's jurisdiction see their cases go to be appealed.  The Supreme Court is ``distinctly American in concept and function,'' according to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, and there is, frankly, nothing quite like it in any other constitutional government. It is a Court that was supposed to be part of this very unique at the time idea of a government that was so finely balanced that it would run itself, a machine that was so finely balanced that it didn't take a King, it didn't take the intervention of somebody to decide who would be the one person who would run the country.

In the history of the country, only 112 people have had the honor to serve on the Supreme On the last day of January, President Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to be one of those unique individuals who get to serve on this Court, to be an Associate Justice on the U.Supreme  Since his nomination, he has visited individually with a significant majority of Members of the I think he has had 70 visits with Members of the Senate in their offices. Many of my colleagues on the other side--several of whom I will mention in a minute--voted for Judge Gorsuch to have the job he currently has. Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle left their meetings with Judge Gorsuch impressed by his character, by his intellect. Here is what just a couple of our colleagues on the other side said:  ``He did a very good job in the meeting with me. He presents himself very well.''  Another one of our colleagues said: ``He's a very caring person, and he's obviously legally very smart. . . . I think we are dealing with someone who is impressive.''  Another one of our colleagues said they ``had a thorough conversation about the importance of the rule of law and of a judiciary that is independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.''  As more Senators had a chance to meet Judge Gorsuch, they came to see him as an independent-minded judge who has a deep appreciation for the law and a real understanding of what a judge should do.  It was mentioned earlier that the judge should be required to talk about how he would rule on individual cases. Of course not. In fact, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is on the Court now, was very strident before the committee in pointing out that it would be wrong for a judge to explain how they would judge an individual case. She said that if a judge did that, a judge would actually have to recuse themselves, in her opinion, from the case, and others on the Court today have all said similar things when asked the kinds of questions that the minority leader just said that Judge Gorsuch would have to answer if he was going to be confirmed to the If that was the test, there would be nobody on the Court today, and if that was the test, none of the 112 people who have served on the Court[[Page S1861]]would have, in all likelihood, passed that test.  When I had a chance to visit with Judge Gorsuch, it was clear that he understood the proper role of a judge. The role of a judge--the job is to adhere to the Constitution, to apply the rule of law, and not to legislate from the bench.  When he was nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch said:       It is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It      is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the      people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he      reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he      prefers, rather than those the law demands.  What does that mean? How would a person reach a conclusion they didn't like and that is what makes them a good judge? Well, a good judge reads the law, reads the Constitution, and applies the law. A good judge doesn't try to determine what the Constitution and the law should say but only has the job of determining what the Constitution and the law do say.  Justice Scalia--the vacancy Judge Gorsuch will fill--according to Justice Scalia, setting aside personal views is ``one of the primary qualifications for a judge''--not determining what you would like to happen but determining what the law and the Constitution say has to happen. I think Judge Gorsuch understands that.  He comes to the Court very well prepared. He is a graduate of Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford His academic credentials are unrivalled in preparation for this job. He served his country admirably as a Supreme Court Justice clerk for Justice Byron White, who was appointed to the Court by President Kennedy and confirmed by the Senate, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was appointed to the Court by President Judge Gorsuch served as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, and then in 2006, President George Bush nominated him to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of The Senate confirmed his nomination unanimously by a voice vote. There are 12 Democrats currently serving in the Senate who were then in office and supported Judge Gorsuch's nomination 10 years ago to the job he has today.  In the decade Judge Gorsuch has served as a circuit court judge, reviewing the work of other Federal judges on appeal, he has demonstrated the integrity, professional qualifications, and judicial temperament to serve on the Nation's highest  Judge Gorsuch said recently that judges are not politicians in robes. It is not the job of a judge to determine what the law is or should be; it is the job of a judge to determine what the law is. The job of a judge is to determine what the Framers intended the Constitution to say.  Judge Gorsuch received high praise from legal experts across party lines. He has gotten the highest level of recommendation from the American Bar Association, unanimously rating him as ``well qualified,'' its highest rating. He is respected by people who know him in his community. He has really dedicated himself to a lifetime of service that prepares him for this job.  The Supreme Court is one of the foundational institutions of our country. It is designed to protect our democracy and is designed to really understand and apply the Constitution and the law so that the rule of law is uniquely dependable in the United States of  If you are a citizen and you read the law and you understand what the law says, that should get you a long way toward success before the courts and ensures that in this country, the rule of law matters.

1082,topic-id,2179,"Mr.President, I rise to join my voice with a growing chorus of citizens, as well as members of the scientific community and colleagues, who are deeply disturbed by this CRA to repeal vital wildlife protections from Federal land in  Before I speak on this CRA, I would like to be clear that I am not someone who believes all regulations are good. In fact, I don't believe we should be trying to regulate our way out of all of our problems. I am proud of the work I have done, with people on both sides of the aisle, in an effort to make our government work smarter and more efficiently for the benefit of my constituents in New Jersey, as well as all Americans, but today I am profoundly disappointed.  Instead of working to create bipartisan policies that will serve all Americans, we are now considering a CRA resolution--unfortunately, one of many ones of this type--that prioritizes special interests above the good of the public, and it is deeply unpopular, in fact, with the public at large.  I oppose this CRA that would repeal the U.Fish and Wildlife's rule called the non-subsistence take of wildlife on national wildlife refuges in Alaska rule. The rule was finalized by the Fish and Wildlife Service in August of 2016, with the clear goal to forever ban unnecessary and extremely cruel methods of killing bears and wolves and other animals on more than 70 million acres of public land managed under our Federal National Wildlife Refuge System in  Let's be clear. When it says the word ``take''--that it prevents the ``take'' of wildlife--that means the killing of wildlife. Specifically, the rule prevents inhumane killing of animals on our wildlife refuges.  Examples of the rule are: prohibits the killing of mother bears and their cubs. It prevents the killing of wolves and pups in their dens. It prohibits using planes to track and kill bears. It prohibits using snares to strangle and kill bears, steel traps to kill bears, and it prohibits baiting and killing of grizzly bears.  Why was this rule issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the first place? Our national wildlife refuges are public lands that exist for the benefit of all Refuge lands are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service for the express purpose of conserving natural diversity in wildlife populations. This means that any management activity that favors certain species over others is inconsistent with the goals of the National Wildlife  It doesn't mean that hunting is not allowed on Federal land. Hunting is one of many permitted practices on wildlife refuges, and this rule does not prevent hunting on any wildlife refuge. What is permitted on refuges under this law is the indiscriminate killing of bears and wolves in an attempt to boost populations of moose and caribou.  Unfortunately, this is exactly how Alaska has been managing its wildlife since 1994 on State and private lands, when it adopted an intensive management strategy for its wildlife that is specifically designed to artificially reduce populations of predators so hunters might have more prey, more animals to kill.  In Alaska, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the State work together to manage wildlife within the National Wildlife Refuge However, when any State's wildlife management approach is in direct conflict with the goals of the refuge system, the Federal Government has the authority--indeed the obligation--to step in and ban certain practices. This is exactly what the Fish and Wildlife did last year when they issued their rule prohibiting this inhumane killing method on 16 Federal national wildlife refuges in  It is important to note that the predator control practices I have described, some of which are currently allowed on certain State and private lands in Alaska, have never been allowed on national wildlife refuges in This rule simply clarifies that these practices--even those explicitly authorized under State regulations in Alaska--are never to be used on Federal wildlife lands in Alaska, regardless of what is decided to be allowed under this State law.  I have heard concerns from my colleagues in Alaska that they believe the Fish and Wildlife Service rule triggers a State sovereignty issue by dictating which practices can and cannot be used on Federal refuge lands in However, I don't believe this rule conflicts with any of Alaska's State sovereignty. The Fish and Wildlife Service has clear statutory and constitutional authority to prohibit wildlife management practices that are incompatible with the objectives of national wildlife refuges in Alaska, as well as other States, including New  I have also heard the concerns of my Alaska colleagues that this rule threatens the many Alaskans who rely on subsistence, hunting of deer, moose, and caribou, to feed themselves and their families. I have sympathy for that concern and believe again that this subsistence hunting is not affected.  We know these predator control practices have never been done on Alaskan refuges before. This argument makes no sense. It is not affecting the subsistence hunting of deer and moose and caribou for them to feed their families. It has never been allowed to go on in the first place. How can these practices be necessary to preserve subsistence hunting when they have never been done before on Federal wildlife refuges? I want to be clear about something. Alaska is free to manage its wildlife on State lands and private lands however Alaska chooses. This point is not up for debate, not up for discussion. It is not the subject of the Fish and Wildlife Services rule in question. The rule only applies to federally owned and federally managed wildlife refuge land, which must be managed for the benefit of the American public, including the requirement to manage for national diversity of wildlife.  As former Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe announced in a press release in August, ``Whenever possible, we prefer to defer to the State of Alaska on regulation of general hunting and trapping of wildlife on national wildlife refuges unless by doing so we are out of compliance with Federal law and policy. This regulation ensures that we comply with our mandates and obligations.''  Let's move beyond talk of mandates and obligations. The hunting practices banned by this rule are flatout inhumane. They are an anathema to the type of thoughtful, humane wildlife management that should be taking place on national wildlife refuges.  In a committee hearing, I asked management experts about this rule last[[Page S1879]]week, and they agree that these practices were not necessary on wildlife refuges. In fact, the U.Fish and Wildlife Service Acting Director Jim Kurth--who was the former manager for many years of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge in Northern Alaska--testified that the service did not find that the practice prohibited by this rule was in any way necessary.  Another witness, Brian Nesvik, Chief Game Warden with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department--again, a Republican-invited witness--testified that Wyoming has a different perspective on utilizing national wildlife refuges in their The practices discussed in this rule, he said, are not used in Wyoming's wildlife refuges, nor did he make an appeal to use these inhumane practices because they are not necessary. Killing a mother bear or mother wolf when she has young cubs virtually guarantees that those cubs will not survive, creating the potential for much broader negative impacts on the overall population.  The baiting of grizzly bears, which involves putting piles of food out to attract bears in unusually high numbers at the start of hunting season, is literally akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Bear baiting often occurs when bears are desperately searching for those extra calories to store energy for hibernation. It is an inhumane practice and is recognized so by many experts.  The use of aircraft hunting--using a plane to track wild animals and then landing to kill them--violates the principle of fair chase in every sense of the word. In fact, killing wolves from aircraft or on the same day that air travel occurred was already prohibited on refuge lands prior to this new rule being issued. The new rule merely extends that same protection to bears.  Finally, the use of snares--these are these choking traps--and steel traps to kill the bear is a practice that is particularly troubling, and I am not alone. A statewide poll of Alaskans themselves shows that nearly 60 percent of Alaskans oppose trapping and snaring bears in their  Charles Darwin called the leghold trap one of the cruelest devices ever invented by man, stating:       Few men could endure to watch for five minutes an animal      struggling in a trap with a torn limb.       Some who reflect upon this subject for the first time will      wonder how such cruelty can have been permitted to continue      in these days of civilisation.  That was Charles Darwin decades and decades ago in 1863. I echo that again today, more than 150 years later. Such cruelty should not be permitted on Federal wildlife refuges of all places, and the Fish and Wildlife Service was absolutely right to permanently protect bears from such cruelty on Alaska's wildlife refuges.  I would like to take a few more moments to talk about the animals that are subject to this rule. Grizzly bears and wolves are the top predators in North Predators in any ecosystem play a critical role in maintaining populations and in preventing problems like we have actually seen in New Jersey by the overgrazing and disease that can occur when deer, moose, and caribou grow in high numbers.  These charismatic animals also attract huge numbers of tourists to national parks, refuges, and other wild lands in the United All across the country, nearly 72 million Americans spend over $50 billion on wildlife watching.  In Alaska, wildlife watchers outnumber hunters by nearly five to one, and they also contribute more than four times as much money to the State's economy as hunting does. Put another way, even considering the issue from an economic perspective, these animals are worth far more alive than they are dead, killed by these savage inhumane practices.  There are few values as deeply entrenched in the American culture as conservation. This legacy is our American heritage, and the coexistence of people, wildlife, and wild lands remains a key objective for our public lands today.  Americans interact with nature in many different ways on public lands, some through consumption uses, like hunting and fishing, and others through more hands-off activities, like camping and wildlife watching. No single use is more important and more valuable than another. So public lands should be managed in a way that minimizes conflict across those different uses while allowing for natural diversity.  The Fish and Wildlife Service rule does just that. Our wildlife refuges are not game parks, and they should not be managed as though they are.  The cruel practices this rule prohibits--killing mother animals and their babies and the trapping, snaring, baiting, and aerial hunting of bears--are practices that I believe do not align with who we are as a country. They are practices that have no place on our national wildlife refuges in Alaska or any other  I want to close with something that my friend Senator Heinrich already mentioned. Many people know that Teddy Roosevelt was an avid hunter, a naturalist, a wildlife enthusiast. When he was President, Roosevelt went on a bear hunting trip in Roosevelt's hunting party cornered a Louisiana black bear. They tied it to a willow tree and suggested the President shoot it.  Viewing this as an extremely unsportsmanlike way to kill a bear, Roosevelt refused to do it. A political cartoonist heard the story and drew a cartoon that celebrated President Roosevelt's decision. A Brooklyn candy shop owner saw the cartoon and decided to create a stuffed toy bear and dedicated it to the President, who refused to engage in this kind of inhumane hunting of a bear. He called it a ``Teddy bear'' or ``Teddy's bear,'' and little children for generations have been loving them ever since.  Teddy Roosevelt knew that using certain methods to kill animals was immoral and wrong. We know this too.  With all of the issues going on right now--from healthcare to tax and all of the issues and urgencies, such as infrastructure--why are we about to consider a CRA that would literally, on our Federal lands, allow the cruelest types of killing to go on of bears and wolves and their pups in dens.  Why, with all that is going on, would we, as Americans, violate our culture and history by allowing the most inhumane, cruel killing practices to go on? Why, with all that we have to do, are we going to allow this to happen?  Well, I will not support it, and I stand against it. Our national wildlife refuges--our refuges for wildlife--have never allowed these cruel practices, and we should not start now.  We should not CRA this rule. I stand strong and firm in honor of our traditions and stand against this  I yield the floor.

After returning home from the war, he attended the University of Arkansas and earned a bachelor's degree in business. In his professional life, he was vice president and general manager of the Derrel Thomas Company in Van Buren, Still, Warren found time to participate in numerous civic organizations within the community. He was an active member of the Alma United Methodist Church for decades and served on the Methodist Health and Rehabilitation Board for 41 years. Additionally, Warren served on various other boards and organizations and was a pillar in the community. Perhaps most notably, he was a member of the Rotary Club--first in Van Buren and then in Fort Smith--for 54 years and maintained perfect attendance. This is just one example of Warren's dedication to serving and giving back to  While Warren never sought recognition for the work he did on behalf of his community, his contributions were noticed and recognized by the city of Alma, as well as on the regional and State levels. He was inducted into the Arkansas Senior Hall of Fame in 2013.

This was yet another reminder of how loved and valued Warren was by so many people whose lives he touched.

In Ohio, families and businesses rely on Lake Its waters are critical to farming and to clean energy development and industry and regional economic competitiveness, to fishing and recreation and so much that people do every day in my  From tourism in Catawba and Put-in-Bay, to fishing at Marblehead, to vacations and family reunions at Maumee Bay State Park, Lake Erie benefits our communities and creates jobs in our State, but for more than a half century, keeping our lake healthy has been a constant struggle. Lake Erie is the shallowest of the Great In the Western Basin off the shore of Toledo, it is only 30 feet deep--much shallower in contrast with Lake Superior, which is 600 feet deep on average.  I remember how polluted Lake Erie was when I was growing up. As a child, it was obvious the water shouldn't look quite the way it looked. While improvements have been made, today's problems are different and in many ways more urgent.  Harmful algal blooms are a constant threat. Because the Western Lake Erie Basin near Toledo is the shallowest part of the lake, it is uniquely vulnerable to these blooms, the same way that much of Lake Erie, 60 or 70 or 80 feet deep, is more vulnerable to pollution.  In August 2014, a bloom left 500,000 Ohioans in Lucas County in Northwest Ohio, in the Toledo area, without safe drinking water for nearly 3 days. We know these blooms are caused by excess nutrients in our water. This comes from untreated sewage, it comes from urban runoff, and it comes from farm field runoff. Heavy rains lead to more combined sewage overflows, more nutrient runoff from our fields, and to larger and more harmful algal blooms.  Algal blooms leave our lake looking like this. This may be a beautiful painting in your living room or a striking photograph of something, but this color here is more the regular, natural color of Lake Erie, the dark here in the wake of this boat. This green is the algal blooms, and you can see what this has done to pollute one of the greatest bodies of freshwater in the world. Would you want to fish there? Likely not. Would you take your children out on water that looks like this? Of course not. Does this water look like what you want coming out of your faucet when you turn on the faucet in Toledo or in Lorain, where I lived for 10 years, or in Sandusky or Cleveland or Ashtabula or any city along the Great Lakes?  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, we[[Page S1883]]know that one effect of climate change in the Great Lakes region has been a 37-percent increase in gully washers, or heavy rain events that contribute to blooms. Hotter summers will only make these blooms worse. The effects of algal blooms like that have profound effects on the entire ecosystem.  Protecting our lake is one of the biggest environmental challenges our country faces. We have made progress over the last 8 years, thanks in large part to the Great Lakes Restoration We have continued to clean up Lake Erie and its tributaries, we have increased access to the lake, and we have improved habitats for fish and wildlife in the region.  Because it is shallow, this Great Lake, Lake Erie, only one of five Great Lakes and the Great Lake with actually the least water--almost 50 percent of all the fish in the Great Lakes live in this Great So you can see what these algal blooms do to aquatic life, to our way of life when you have these kinds of algal blooms.  We know that the bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is working. As we celebrate Water Week this week, we should recommit ourselves to strengthening this program and building on our success. But in President Trump's budget proposal this week, the administration proposed entirely eliminating this important program that has been so successful--entirely eliminating this program that has been so successful. It is basically a surrender to the algal blooms. It is the administration--our country, if he speaks for our country--surrendering and just saying: Give up; we are not going to make the fight.  We have cleaned up Lake Erie because of the Federal EPA, because of the State EPA, because of the cities and the counties along the lake, places like Toledo, Lorain, Sandusky, Cleveland, and my wife's hometown of We have cleaned it up, but it is a constant struggle because so many people live along this very shallow, very vulnerable to pollution Great That is why we don't give up.  We are not just talking about cutting funding for a program; the administration budget completely cuts this program, completely ends it. Taking an axe to the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will cost Ohio jobs, jeopardize public health, and will put our drinking water at risk and reverse the progress we have made. It is simply something you don't do in a country like ours. It is unacceptable. I will fight like hell to protect the Great Lakes, I will fight like hell to protect Lake Erie, and I will fight like hell to protect the entire lake ecosystem.  The fact is, these five Great Lakes are a natural resource like none other in the world. Here is what is at risk if the administration's budget plan becomes a reality: Forty percent of the funds used to protect the lake from Asian carp would just disappear like that; 1.8 million more pounds of phosphorus would enter the Lake, making algal blooms like this more likely, just like that; and the cleanup of toxic sediment in habitat restorations in some of our most polluted rivers would grind to a halt. Why would they do this? Why would they eliminate this program? Neither party here wants them to do this. Senator Portman stands with me on this. Most of the Republican House Members stand with Democrats like Congresswoman Fudge and Congresswoman Kaptur, who represent much of the area along the Great  There are projects across Ohio that simply couldn't take place without this program. In Ashtabula, a cleanup project has removed sediment containing 25,000 pounds of toxic material, transforming the lower two-thirds of the Ashtabula A $61 million project never would have gotten off the ground without the Great Lakes Restoration Look at the new Lake Erie Bluffs Park in Perry Township--they used $1.6 million from the initiative to leverage other sources of funding to restore and protect this shoreline.  My Ohio colleagues of both parties have made it clear that zeroing out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is not an option and that they will not stand for it.  It isn't just this initiative on the chopping block; the budget makes deep cuts in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which monitors these algal blooms. Scientists at Ohio State's Stone Lab play a key role in protecting our lake, and the reported NOAA cuts would nearly eliminate the grant funding that supports Stone Lab's mission. I have been at Stone I see the work they do. I see the dedicated dozen or so naturalists, not well-paid--Federal employees or State employees not particularly well paid. They love nature, they love Lake Erie, they love our State, they love its natural beauty, and they love all that it does for us.  When I was young, people wrote off Lake Erie as a dying lake. It was polluted, it smelled bad, and it looked bad. It was a dying lake. Over the past century, people have had a habit of trying to write off my We have proved them wrong time and again. The lake is improving. It is supporting entire industries. It supports jobs. It provides drinking water. It provides recreation. It is beautiful to look at from my home in Lorain when I lived there.

1427,topic-id,965,"Madam President, one thing has become clear in this country: Hard work just doesn't pay off like it used to. Over the last 40 years, GDP has gone up, corporate profits have gone up, and executive salaries have gone up all because of the productivity of American workers, but companies are not investing in their workers the way they did. Workers don't feel like institutions--whether it is government or big companies--work for them.  Again, GDP goes up, corporate profits go up, executive salaries go up, worker productivity goes up, but workers' wages do not. Actions like this today are the reason. Congress is voting to allow employers in our most dangerous industries to hide injuries to workers and to skirt worker protection laws.  This Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, rule simply makes clear that it is the employer's responsibility to maintain accurate records of serious injuries that happen on the job. The rule simply makes clear that it is the employer's responsibility to maintain accurate records of serious injuries that happen on the job.  It doesn't impose new costs. It doesn't affect small business. What it does is it holds companies accountable for maintaining their own records, as they have done for 40 years. These records are the most important tool we have to identify and root out the most dangerous workplace hazards. They are the basis for national statistics on workplace health and safety.  Two former Commissioners from the Bureau of Labor Statistics--one from the George Bush administration and one from the Barack Obama administration--have written to this body, warning us that killing this rule could undermine nearly a half century of worker safety information.  So a leading Republican and a leading Democrat have both written to this body saying: Don't do this; it will mean more workplace injuries.  I know people around here who have these kinds of jobs--where workplace injuries rarely are even a fact of life--may not think about this enough. Pope Francis exhorted his parish priests to go out and smell like the flock. People in this body need to go out and talk to workers more. Go to union halls, go to workplaces, listen to what workers are saying, listen to what union members are saying, and listen to what nonunion members are saying about what these workplace safety rules mean.  Worse yet, this vote today will allow employers to falsify their safety records with impunity. Companies can avoid OSHA rules and inspections by underreporting--underreporting--harm to their workers, and they can avoid making a real investment to make their workplaces safer.  Over the past three decades, some of the worst offenders with dangerous workplaces hid injuries and kept fraudulent records. They hid injuries, and they kept fraudulent records. They claimed they were safe, while workers were being hurt on the job.  These requirements only apply to the most dangerous industries--industries where proper safety precautions could mean the difference between life and death or a permanent disability for these workers. We are talking about fall hazards, dangerous machines without proper guarding, workers handling dangerous chemicals without adequate washing stations.  Look at the poultry processing industry. These workers face serious health and safety problems. In many plants, workers process 140 chickens a minute, and they are at risk for disabling injuries.  Maybe people around here don't think much about people processing chickens. It is not a job that pays well. It is a job that is difficult. Frankly, people in this body don't know people who do those jobs, by and large. They are handling 140 chickens a minute. They are at risk for disabling injuries.  We eat the chickens, but we don't see what happens when they are processed, and we are not paying attention to that. That is why it is so important we not vote for this rule change.  Too many employers fail to report these injuries. If OSHA isn't empowered to enforce recordkeeping, processing plants will be able to hide their safety violations and expose their workers to crippling injuries.  This CRA vote today is about workers' safety, period. Workers' safety is something so fundamental that it is hard to believe we are arguing about it.  In the United States of America in 2017, companies shouldn't be able to put workers' lives and safety at risk just so they can make more money. They shouldn't be able to put their workers' lives and safety at risk just to make more money, and we shouldn't be part of that effort to help those companies do that.  To my colleagues who are prepared to gut this rule, I ask: Would you be willing to work these jobs? Would my fellow Senators be willing to send their children to work in these dangerous industries while turning a blind eye to safety rules?  I think we know what the answers to those questions are. This is why Americans are losing their faith in our institutions.[[Page S1909]]  Earlier this month, at the Glenn School in Columbus--which is named after my good friend, the late Senator John Glenn--I rolled out a plan to reinvest in the American worker, but instead of coming together to work on solutions, the Senate today is going in the wrong direction.

338,topic-id,479,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.  Our veterans have paid a high price. Dispatched to foreign lands to fight for our freedom, many returned injured, grief-stricken over lost friends, and torn apart by the violence of war.  We owe them our time, our energy, our gratitude, and our protection. That is why we are here on the floor today: to protect the constitutional rights of our heroes and to make sure we are taking care of them like we promised we would.  H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, ensures that government cannot strip our heroes of their constitutional rights without due process. Under current law, if the VA determines that a veteran needs a guardian or fiduciary to help manage their benefits, then that veteran's name must be sent to the NICS database, prohibiting them from purchasing a firearm.  The decision to strip any constitutional right from anyone, most importantly our veterans who have put their lives on the line to defend our Constitution, needs to be made with due process. The VA was never designed to adjudicate the removal of constitutional rights. This decision should be made by a judge or judicial authority.  Instead of stripping veterans of constitutional rights, our VA should be focused on protecting veterans. That is exactly what the other two bills under consideration do.  H.1259 gives the Department of Veterans Affairs greater ability to discipline employees for misconduct or poor performance.  We entrust our VA employees with the health and well-being of our veterans. Most of these employees do a great job, working hard to make sure our heroes are cared for; but, occasionally, a VA employee engages in misconduct, behavior that can endanger the very lives of our veterans.  These men and women sacrificed to serve our The least we can do is enable them to receive the best care possible at the That is why we need H.1259, to allow the VA, under an expedited process, to fire or suspend or demote employees who are putting our veterans at risk.  The legislation also allows the VA to recoup the money paid in bonuses or relocation grants to employees convicted of a felony.  Mr.Speaker, our veterans deserve the best. They deserve the best employees. They deserve the best medical staff. That is what the third bill under consideration, H.1367, will achieve. This legislation improves the VA's ability to recruit the best medical staff, offering the agency direct hiring authority to fill key positions with critical staffing needs.  It also creates a fellowship program to train up VA management for the best performance. It is time to improve the personnel practices at the Veterans  Mr.Speaker, the resolution on the floor today is vital for our Nation's veterans.

My friend from Florida and I were in committee yesterday and heard testimony from one of our colleagues that this bill, as it pertains to veterans' gun rights, is not reactive. It does not go back to those individuals who have been denied their due process rights, who have been denied their Second Amendment rights.  This bill is prospective only. It will only affect those who in the future have been denied those rights. And I think it is absolutely important that we understand the Republican Party in the House of Representatives is committed to make sure that those individuals who have been denied their due process rights, their Second Amendment rights in the past, we will find a solution. We will help those individuals.  Right now, we are focused on making sure that others have the ability to a fair, open hearing where they can present their side of the story before they are denied their constitutional rights.  My friend and colleague from Florida (Mr.Hastings) also talks about the fact that H.1259 will do more harm than good; that somehow disciplining those who are delivering poor services to our veterans is unfair to unions.

In 2014, a VA employee at the Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System took a veteran who was a recovering drug addict to a crack house where he purchased illegal drugs for the veteran, as well as purchased a prostitute for him, though the employee was still employed at the VA well over a year later after the incident until they were finally able to remove him.  Mr.Speaker, I ask my colleagues to stand up now for our veterans. They have performed their duty, and it is time for us to perform for them.  Our duty is to take care of them. A ``yes'' vote restores their Constitutional rights and improves their quality of care.  I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution, vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill. I thank Chairman Roe and Representative Wenstrup for bringing these bills before us.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Hastings is as follows:          An Amendment to 198 Offered by Mr.Hastings       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     696) to prohibit any hiring freeze from affecting the      Department of Veterans All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived.[[Page H2100]]     General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not      exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair      and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and      Government After general debate the bill shall be      considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At      the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the      Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with      such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous      question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and      amendments thereto to final passage without intervening      motion except one motion to recommit with or without      instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports      that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the      next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the      third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,      resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.696.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

First, I thank Chairman Roe and Representative Wenstrup for bringing this bill before us today and for consideration of my amendment.  As Americans, as Members of Congress, our job is to serve and care for our veterans once they return home. That is what H.1367 does.  My amendment strengthens this important bill, guaranteeing that the Department of Veterans Affairs can employ the best people to care for our veterans.  My amendment makes clear that former political appointees at the VA are not eligible for direct hire authority for competitively selected positions without first going through the proper civil service hiring process.  America's veterans deserve the top care from people who are devoted to serving them. The VA is run by hardworking civil servants, men and women hired in a competitive, merit-based process that assessed their skill and their passion for serving our Nation's veterans.  Political appointees, on the other hand, are meant to serve their appointing President's agenda for a temporary period of time. Part of their duty to the Nation is to know when it is time to step down from their position of power.  My amendment prevents former VA political appointees from using their political connections to jump ahead of other qualified individuals, burrowing into a high-paying career position at the  Along with my friend and colleague Representative Lieu, I have already introduced a bill to address the problem of political burrowing.  H.1132 would prevent political appointees from burrowing into the civil service across the government for 2 years after leaving their political position. Until that bill is enacted, this amendment will ensure that the most qualified workers are filling the crucial jobs at the VA, providing our veterans the treatment they deserve.  We must protect the independence of our merit-based civil service, we must employ the best people in the VA, and we must guard our veterans from the failed policies and practices of administrations past.

797,topic-id,1956,"I thank the Speaker for the recognition.  Mr.Speaker, October of last year, October of 2016, Bill Clinton, speaking in front of a group of people in Michigan, said:       So you have got this crazy system. There are all these      people out there who are busting it sometimes 60 hours a      week, and they wind up with their premiums doubled and their      coverage cut in half. It is the craziest thing in the world.  Mr.Speaker, I don't often agree with former President Bill Clinton, but that quote pretty much sums up why we are here doing what we are doing this week with trying to fix the problems inherent in the Affordable Care  Now, sometimes people turning in and watching these hours must wonder how can it be we are talking about the same thing where one side says it is good and one side says it is not. Mr.Speaker, it may help to set some of the historical context. I would like to do that tonight. I would like to talk about the beginnings of what we now know as the Affordable Care Some people refer to it as  This is a bill that was signed into law 7 years ago this month, but it didn't just spring forth. There was a lot of work involved in bringing it forward and getting it heard and getting it voted on on the floor of this I was part of the Energy and Commerce Committee that summer, as I still am today. The Energy and Commerce Committee did hear what was then H.3100, several hours of markup in the committee, several days of markup. Other committees marked it up, and H.3100 was a 1,000-page bill that left our committee. I didn't vote for the bill. I didn't think it was a good idea, but it did have Republican amendments at the end of that process.  That bill then went to the Speaker's Office--not to the Budget Committee, but to the Speaker's Speaker Pelosi put it together, and when it emerged, it was a 2,000-page bill that really didn't have much to do with the bill that was marked up in the committee. But, nevertheless, the bill came to the floor of this House; and in November of 2009, after a significant amount of debate, a significant amount of anxiety expressed on the Republican side and even some on the Democratic side, the bill was passed by a very slim majority. The bill went over to the Senate, and that was the end of that bill.  What happened next was there were--it was not exactly a bill--several drafts of several ideas that people had over on the Senate side; and the Senate took up a bill that the House had previously passed, H.3590 was the number of that bill, and the Senate debated and passed that bill on Christmas Eve of 2009. You may remember there was a snowstorm that was descending upon Washington, kind of a familiar story, a snowstorm that was coming to town. The Senators wanted to get home before the snowstorm hit, and they passed H.3590.  Remember, back in those days, the Democrats had a 60-vote majority in the They were able to cut off debate and pass the bill on a party-line vote with 60 Democratic Senators voting in favor of that bill.  Then something strange happened. The Democrats actually lost a Senate seat in a special election in the State of Massachusetts that they weren't expecting to lose. As a consequence of losing that Senate seat, now, instead of a 60-vote majority, they had a 59-vote majority, so they actually could not cut off debate. It was not a filibuster-proof majority.  Harry Reid told Nancy Pelosi, who was then the Speaker of the House: Well, I have done everything I can do. You are just going to have to pass our bill as it is. I can't make any changes to it.  Speaker Pelosi wisely said--I am paraphrasing here because I don't remember the exact quote--but I think she said: I haven't got 100 votes for that thing over here in the  I think she was right. But they worked on it, and President Obama worked on it, and 3 months later, in March of 2010, indeed, they did bring that vote up in the House, passed exactly what had passed in the As a consequence, since the Senate bill was actually an amendment to a House bill that didn't have anything to do with health care in the first place, but since it was only an amendment to a House bill that had passed the House, so many as are in favor agree with the amendment to the Senate bill, the number being 218, that bill went down to the President for a signing ceremony that very same week. Thus was born the Affordable Care  Now, what has led us to the point where former President Bill Clinton would say that it is a crazy system? Well, there is a lot of discussion back and forth.  Certainly, Republicans took the majority shortly after that bill was signed into law. I would submit that because that bill was signed into law, Republicans regained the majority in the House of Representatives in 2011 and since that time have had a number of votes either trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act or improve the Affordable Care A number of those votes have, indeed, been bipartisan votes, that is, Democrats have voted with                              {time}  2030  I think the total count is there have been 47 Democratic votes to either repeal, replace, reform, or repair the Affordable Care It really has been a bipartisan effort these past 7 years.  We are where we are today because of the problems that exist in the bill. Despite the talk that we heard in the last hour, people are suffering under this.  There is a gentleman back home in my district. I think he is a plumber by profession. He has previously been diagnosed with bladder cancer. He says, under his Affordable Care Act policy, he gets to go see his primary care doctor once a year. His primary care doctor says, Well, you need to go to a urologist to have your cystoscopy, but his deductible is so high, he doesn't do it. He has got access to insurance, but he doesn't really have access to the kind of care that he needs that could be lifesaving and could prevent him from having a much greater problem down the road.  We can all bring our individual stories out, but the fact of the matter is, access to coverage is not the same thing as access to care.  During the course of the campaign this last fall--and I remember this very specifically because November 1 was the day that the new rates came out--the open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act opened up on November 1, and people got a glimpse of what their marketplace rates were.  As a consequence of those marketplace rates, people started to pay attention. There was still another week to go before election day, and people started to pay a significant amount of attention to what the rates were.  It isn't just the rates. It is the access. One-third of U.counties have only one insurer willing to sell in marketplace in those counties. I think the number is either five or seven States that have entire States with only one insurance company. That is not really choice. That is not really access. That, in fact, is a monopoly.  2017 was a year marked by a sharp rise in premium increases across the country. Seven States saw premium increases of more than 50 percent. Texas was about 25 percent. Some States went up over 100 percent.  The individual mandate, which was part and parcel of the Affordable Care Act, the most coercive Federal legislation passed since the income tax passed 100 years ago--the individual mandate is the reason that the Affordable Care Act has never achieved widespread popularity. But even with the individual mandate--that is, we are going to send the Internal Revenue Service out and make them make you buy health insurance--over 19 million taxpayers elected to pay the mandate penalty or claim a hardship exemption.  There were 6.5 million individuals who paid the penalty and over 12.5 million people claimed a hardship exemption, according to the Internal Revenue Service's own files.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 10.5 million individuals enrolled in an exchange plan through the first half of 2016. More than twice that number chose to either exempt themselves through a hardship waiver or just simply pay the fine and walk away from the obligation to purchase insurance.  I am firmly of the belief that the individual mandate has no place in a free society. The one central thesis of the[[Page H2234]]Affordable Care Act that I long to see repealed is the repeal of the individual mandate. While we are at it, we might as well take care of the employer mandate.  By the way, President Obama delayed the employer mandate for 2 full years, not by a House passed bill, but by administrative fiat. He simply decided, prior to the Fourth of July in 2013: You know what? The employer mandate is going to cause trouble in the next congressional election, so I will just suspend it.  In a blog post put up by Valerie Jarrett on the evening of July 2, 2013, the employer mandate was simply suspended for a couple of years because it was felt to be too onerous and because of the effect that they feared it would have on the midterm elections in 2014.  Time after time, the Obama administration took it upon themselves to delay or turn back a portion of their own law, and there were multiple times where there were votes taken on this floor.  I think of the 1099, the paperwork that was going to be required in the business-to-business transactions; the 1099 forms that were required under ObamaCare that were repealed by this House in a bipartisan fashion because it did pass in the Senate, and the Senate was controlled by Democrats at the time.  Also, the CLASS Act, a particularly onerous part of the community living access ostensibly to provide some help with long-term care, except it really didn't. It was in an actuarial death spiral even before it was enacted. It was one of those things in the Affordable Care Act where you paid for 10 years of taxes and got 6 years of benefits. When they got finished collecting the taxes, it was decided they better do away with the benefit because, in fact, there was no benefit there at all.  Time after time, in a bipartisan fashion, this House has taken action to restrict or remodel or repair or repeal portions of the Affordable Care We are now coming up on a time where significant change is going to occur in the issuance of health care in this country. The change is going to be tough. We always knew it would be, but it is the right change.  The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Budget Committee have put together legislation that we will be hearing up in the Rules Committee later this week; the American Health Care Act, which will come to the floor before the end of this week. Let me just make a prediction: it will pass the floor of this  I see that I am joined by a colleague this evening.

801,topic-id,793,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating this evening. It means a lot to me individually that he was willing to come up and stay up late with us tonight yet one more night dealing with the Affordable Care  But the gentleman is quite direct. The journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step. It is a three-part program. This was the first part, the first phase that will happen on Thursday night. This deals with some of the more egregious aspects of the Affordable Care Act, those things that can be tackled through Senate rules of reconciliation that only require 51 Senators to get passed. So that is one part of this.  Another part is the administrative part. And our former colleague from Georgia, Tom Price, a physician, who is now Secretary Tom Price for the Department of Health and Human Services, he has an administrative part that is actually already underway. We don't have to wait for that to happen. It is already occurring.  Then there is the third part, the so-called regular order part, the part that will require 60 votes on the Senate side, the part that is, by its very nature, going to be bipartisan. We have reported two rules out of the Committee on Rules tonight, one on the McCarran-Ferguson changes that I think the gentleman is well aware of. There are already additional bills that will be coming to the floor of the House that are separate and apart from this reconciliation bill, which is just the first step in repealing the Affordable Care  I do want to point out that Secretary Price sent a letter to the Governors last week or a week and a half ago now talking about some of the waivers that he is bringing forward right now, the 1332 waivers, which are waivers for parts of the Affordable Care  Quoting from his letter here: ``Under Section 1332 of the ACA, states can apply for State Innovation Waivers and pursue innovative strategies to adapt many of the law's requirements to suit the state's specific needs.''  So many details to receive approval, what a State has to do, but he really stresses in this letter and in one of the last paragraphs: ``We encourage states interested in applying for Section 1332 waivers to reach out to the Departments promptly for assistance in formulating an approach that meets the requirements of Section 1332.''  I know the gentleman hasn't served here that long, but I will just tell you, that is a sea change of difference from the Federal agency which time after time told our Governors: Go back to go. Do not collect $200. You can't do that.  Now we have a Secretary at the agency who is reaching out to the Governors: Governor, we want to help you make this work for you. We are going to provide the flexibility that you need.  One of the things that I think is perhaps most promising is the hybrid, high-risk pool, State-operated reinsurance programs that have been proven in several States already. States that were in a so-called death spiral because of guaranteed issue community rating, the premiums were going up, people were dropping their coverage. And now these States have expanding coverage even without the things that we are providing in the American Health Care Act that we are going to be doing later this week. But already by providing that flexibility at the agency level, States are able to provide some relief for their citizens.  Then, finally, the part three of this. There are going to be some must-pass healthcare bills that will be coming up through our committee. We will have an opportunity to work on those things. We are going to work on the Food and Drug Administration user fee agreement reauthorization. So we will have that, which can happen as a bipartisan exercise in our committee.  I will just stress, the Committee on Energy and Commerce has a history of doing things in a bipartisan fashion. One of the reasons why I enjoy serving on that committee is it is a thoughtful committee and it does do things in a bipartisan fashion. Generally, that is one of the strengths of the committee as it brings legislation to the floor.  This is an important first step. It is a necessary first step. This is the key that gets us through the door of actually making a meaningful impact on cost and coverage in these United It has been 7 long years, but I am anxious and eager to get started on the next part of the process.

910,topic-id,775,"Mr.Speaker, House Resolution 210 provides for consideration of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  President Trump promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is negatively affecting our economy and causing great hardship on the American people. Congress is responding this week with multiple bills to do just that.  After years of endless premium increases, we must take steps to make health insurance more accessible and affordable, including for small businesses that employ the majority of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, will do just[[Page H2261]]that by helping to level inequalities between large and small employers, ultimately making health insurance more affordable for millions of  Simply put, the Small Business Health Fairness Act will empower small businesses to band together through association health plans to purchase health insurance. This will allow them to increase their bargaining power, negotiating for lower health insurance rates on behalf of their employees, just like their large competitors do.  Additionally, the bill will allow their plans to fall under the Employee Retiree Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the Department of Labor, just like the large self-funded employer plans, preempting a myriad of State regulations that often make insurance unaffordable for small businesses.  The usefulness of this legislation is easy to imagine. For example, a small accounting firm might employ just three or four people while the largest firms employ tens of thousands. If that small firm could join together with others just like it to provide health insurance through their national association, it could have the same bargaining power and be subject to the same regulation as the firm with thousands of employees. This parity means more options and lower costs for employers and employees.  Mr.Speaker, our Nation's small businesses were hit especially hard by the passage of In fact, a 2016 survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that small businesses identified the cost of health care as their number one challenge.  An estimated 300,000 small-business jobs were destroyed, and an estimated 10,000 small businesses closed altogether due to the failed ObamaCare policies.  Since 2008, 36 percent of all small businesses with fewer than 10 employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage. This has resulted in less overall healthcare options for working families.  ObamaCare's compliance costs and mandates have resulted in $19 billion in lost wages for small-business employees.  The bottom line is that small businesses--the backbone of our Nation's economy--and their employees are feeling the pain of ObamaCare's failures and broken promises.  I meet with these small-business owners from south Alabama every day. They want to take care of their employees and provide them with high-quality health insurance. Through enacting the Small Business Health Fairness Act, we can help thousands of small businesses achieve that goal.  Mr.Speaker, I also want to point out that this legislation includes strong protections to ensure association health plans are solvent and that the families covered by them are indeed protected. A sponsor of a plan must be a bona fide trade, industry, or professional organization and can't be established for the purpose of providing medical care.  The sponsor must have existed for a period of at least 3 consecutive years before providing group health insurance coverage. The association health plan must be operated by a board of trustees and will be supervised by the Department of This will include minimum capital requirements and a requirement that plans have a stop-loss and solvency insurance.  Finally and most importantly, the bill prohibits association health plans from discriminating based upon health status and preexisting conditions.  Mr.Speaker, the Small Business Health Fairness Act is about ensuring our Nation's small businesses are afforded the same opportunities given to large corporations and labor unions. When similar legislation has been brought to the floor in the past, it has received strong bipartisan support, as I hope this bill will today.  Ultimately, this bill is just one part of our larger plan to rescue the American people from the failures of This week, the House intends to vote to repeal ObamaCare, along with its mandates and its taxes.  But we do also understand that the pre-ObamaCare status quo is not acceptable. That is why the House is already moving to consider bills to give Americans the freedom, choices, and control they deserve.  Our solutions are built on free market and patient-centered principles. By getting the government out of the way and increasing competition, we can draw down costs and help Americans obtain health care that actually works for them.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 210 and the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1400  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2260-2.txt,2197,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,March
913,topic-id,884,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My colleague from Colorado raised an important question: What are the Republicans trying to accomplish here? It is pretty simple. We are trying to give freedom and choice back to the American people who lost their freedom and choice and control over their healthcare plans, who lost freedom and control over their health care because of an ill-considered law passed by this Congress several years ago.  He talked about the cost to American consumers. If you want to pass something that is going to increase cost to American consumers, this Congress did that several years ago. Look at the dramatic increase in healthcare insurance premiums, the dramatic increase in people's deductibles that have occurred since the Affordable Care Act--the so-called Affordable Care Act--was passed here in Congress several years ago.  We are trying to reverse that. We are trying to get control back. And, in fact, we know from the Congressional Budget Office score that it will lower premiums by 10 percent. We haven't seen premiums go lower in years. So if they want to know what we are trying to accomplish, it is plain on its face.  The gentleman referred to some amendments that he offered in committee. Every one of those amendments was ruled nongermane.  And for those of us that maybe don't understand a lot about what ``germane'' means, it is pretty simple. You can't offer amendments to a bill that aren't related to the subject matter of the bill.  The chairwoman of the committee ruled that he offered amendments that weren't germane to the bill that we have today. So the gentleman didn't lose because people were trying to lock him out of the process. He just offered amendments that had nothing to do with the underlying bill.  He talked about the fact that this underlying bill for the rule we have today will lure away young and healthy workers.                                  1415  Let me say it again. I said this in my principal remarks. Under this bill, none of these association health plans can discriminate against anybody. They can't do that. They can't say we are only going to let young or healthy people in the plan. They have to admit everyone. So there is no discrimination here. Everyone will be covered.  And remember how many people in America work for small businesses. All types of Americans work for small businesses. We are not trying to hurt them. We are trying to give them more opportunities to get better health insurance that will cost less money.  And if there was anything in here that would cause discrimination, we would have heard long and hard about that before this point. I would suggest to you, Mr.Speaker, that that is not a relevant argument to this particular bill. Every plan that is going to be[[Page H2264]]under this bill must comply with the regulations of the Department of Labor, just like big corporation plans have to comply with the regulations of the Department of  We are simply treating small businesses through these associations the same way we treat big corporations. We have essentially denied to the employees of small businesses the same opportunities to get good health insurance at a lower cost that their colleagues that work for bigger corporations get.  The reason the bigger corporations have this is because the Department of Labor comes up with a nationwide rule so you don't have all these different variations from State to State and allows for those big companies to do the things that they can do so very well because of their size to get better health care for an affordable cost for their employees. We are giving the same thing to these small businesses through their associations.  And remember, this is not just one bill. We actually just passed a rule. We will be considering another bill that will exempt, from the provisions of McCarran-Ferguson, health insurance so we get more competition into the health insurance market.  This bill is on top of that. It is on top of the AHCA that we will be considering later this week and other bills that will be coming, because there are a host of things that we are doing on this side of the aisle to make sure we restore freedom and choice and affordable care to the people of our country.  We are not removing people from health insurance in any of the bills that we are doing. We are giving them the freedom to choose. And that is what America is really all about: the freedom to choose.  Right now we are coercing, by law, people to go out and buy health insurance that they don't want. That shouldn't be done in We are going to give them their freedom back. And if they chose not to buy health insurance, that is their right as That is not taking something away from somebody. That is giving them their freedom back.  So I would suggest to the gentleman that, if he wants to look for something that is going to help the workers of America, this bill and the other bills that our side of the aisle are proposing will do just that.

A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to[[Page H2267]]     offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House      should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.

Subsection (h) states that ``carbon monoxide cartridges may be used to humanely euthanize wolf young in the den in areas under a predation control implementation plan.''  The next subsection, subsection (i) states that ``the killing of wolf young in the den, commonly known as `denning,' is prohibited unless the commission authorizes the killing of wolf young in the den in areas under a predation control implementation plan.''  That is in the Alaska Administrative Code today, and it is something that the U.Fish and Wildlife Service does not want to see happen in national wildlife refuges. The killing methods authorized by the State of Alaska include killing bear cubs or mothers with cubs, killing brown bears, including grizzly bears, using bait, killing brown bears using traps or snares, killing wolves or coyotes and their pups during the denning season, and shooting bears or wolves from aircraft or helicopters, using the aircraft to track down the bears or wolves, then landing and shooting them.  When you see the list of prohibited actions, you have to wonder why anybody would oppose this rule. Who is advocating for the slaughtering of wolf pups or bear cubs in their dens, shooting them from aircraft or using snares to catch them by their necks and kill them? I think my colleague from New Mexico had a picture of such an event. Who is advocating for this kind of method?  This is why the U.Fish and Wildlife Service policy makes sure that if predator controls used, that they are based on science and not these inhumane actions. The wildlife rule is not a case of regulating sportsmen for traditional hunting practices, but it is making sure that they are doing so in a humane way.  The law requires that the Alaska wildlife refuges be managed to conserve fish and wildlife populations in their natural diversity, but Alaska's predator control practices are not consistent with that management requirement. They are directly opposite to conserving the natural diversity and are instead promoting the wholesale killing of predator species. So that is why we oppose this override of the regulation. I hope my colleagues will turn it down.  If we want to make improvements to the U.Fish and Wildlife Service rule, we can do so by legislation, or by working to change the rule. But by overturning this rule, you are also prohibiting the agency from fulfilling their job of protecting the wildlife refuge.  I want to make sure that all our colleagues understand that this is about protecting wildlife refuges in a humane way, allowing hunting practices, but doing so in a way that preserves the species.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1864-5.txt,172,0915,2017.0,21.0,March

172,topic-id,429,"Mr.President, I have a tremendous amount of respect for Lieutenant General McMaster and a great deal of admiration for his willingness to answer the call of service for his Nation as National Security  So I want to be clear that none of my comments are intended as a reflection on General McMaster himself.  But I am greatly concerned about the current state of the organization that General McMaster is being asked to run and that the way in which the President and his senior advisers appear to be running it is creating great risk for our  The President's first National Security Advisor, who lasted less than a month in office, had failed to register as a foreign agent, a job that he held throughout the Presidential campaign and into the transition--so much for America first.  The initial Executive order structuring the National Security Council system for the new administration deliberately omitted the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence from the Principals Committee--in other words, a National Security Council without the insight and guidance of our intelligence community or military.  Every administration can structure the White House as it sees fit, but national security without intelligence or military advice is, frankly, mind-boggling.  At the same time, the NSC was to include Steve Bannon, the President's political adviser. Although previous White Houses have had staff from outside the NSC sit in on NSC meetings on occasion and as appropriate, never before has an administration suggested that the NSC's work of safeguarding our Nation be subordinate to the political goals of safeguarding a President's political position and public opinion ratings.  Alongside the NSC, this White House has established a so-called Strategic Initiatives Group under Mr.Bannon, which is reportedly undertaking strategic reviews of U.policy on sensitive issues--including U.S.-Russia relations. Running a shadow NSC with crossing lines of jurisdiction and authority seems like a recipe for disaster.  So all of this has created an environment of dysfunction and an organization in severe distress. It is one thing to run a family real estate company this way, but this is our national security that is at stake.  If there is a crisis tonight--on the Korean Peninsula, with Russia, in the Middle East or Persian Gulf--it is far from clear that the NSC is in a position to provide our senior policymakers with the options they need and the decision-space necessary to safeguard America in a dangerous and unpredictable world.

197,topic-id,2343,"Mr.President, I take this time to talk about the Republican American Health Care Act that was released, I guess, about a week or two ago, affectionately known as I start by saying, what is this legislation trying to achieve? When I listen to the Republicans talk about why they have introduced this bill, what their concern is with the Affordable Care Act, they usually mention their 1 concern is to deal with the increased premium costs that Americans have had under the Affordable Care They normally will point to the individual marketplace, where we have seen increases in premium costs as the market has adjusted to the ratings of those who entered the individual marketplace.  So it was very interesting, as I took a look at the Congressional Budget Office analysis of what the Republican TrumpCare bill would do. The Congressional Budget Office, let me remind my colleagues, is the objective scorekeeper. The leader of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed by the Republican leadership. It is the professional career people who make their best judgment of the impact of legislation that we are considering.  Remember, the Republicans have said their principal objective is to bring down the cost, particularly for those entering the individual marketplace, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2018-19, the average rate in the individual marketplace will increase by 15 to 20 percent. Let me say that again. The Congressional Budget Office tells us the premium increases under TrumpCare will increase for the individual 15 to 20 percent.  Now, that could be a lot higher. That is the average. So let me give you the number. If you happen to be 64 years of age, with an income of $26,500, under the Affordable Care Act, you would pay $1,700 in premiums. Under TrumpCare, you would pay $14,600, or a 750-percent increase. That would equal to about 55 percent of your income in the health insurance premiums. Obviously, that is not affordable. A person of that age and income would have no ability to purchase insurance at an affordable rate under the American Health Care Act or  Let me take a look at some other reasons why we may be looking at this repeal-and-replacement bill. I listened to the I listened to my colleagues, and they say, first, they want to make sure they do no harm, that everyone will be at least as well off as they are today, and that there would be more choice to the consumers in buying health insurance.  Once again, I point to the Congressional Budget Office, the objective scorekeepers. What would happen if TrumpCare were enacted? What would happen as far as individuals who currently have health insurance today? According to the Congressional Budget Office, next year, 2018, there would be 14 million less people insured than there are under the Affordable Care If you project that out to 2026, they indicate there would be 24 million more people who would lose their insurance.  Let me quote from The Baltimore Sun in this morning's editorial, where they pointed out that number: Twenty-four million would equal all the residents of Utah, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, Kansas, Nebraska, West Virginia, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming combined would have no insurance coverage. That is what 24 million represent in Clearly, this bill is not carrying out the commitment to do no harm because 24 million more Americans will certainly be in worse shape.  Then I heard the President talk about the fact that he wants to do no harm to the Medicare Program or the Medicaid I took a look again at what this bill does in regard to Medicare because the bill repeals the tax on high income; that is, there is currently in law a tax for unearned income above $250,000, a tax that goes into the Medicare trust fund, Part The TrumpCare repeals that tax. Therefore, the Medicare trust fund doesn't get the income. That would reduce the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, jeopardizing the Medicare system. Clearly, if this bill was aimed at not hurting Medicare, it hasn't achieved that purpose.  Let's talk a little about What does this bill do to Medicaid? According to the Congressional Budget Office, it shifts hundreds of billions of dollars from the Federal Government to our Our States clearly cannot handle that. I have heard from my I am sure my colleagues heard from our other There is no possibility that they could pick up that. The Medicaid Program will be in very serious jeopardy of being able to continue anything like it is today. For Maryland--the State I have the honor of representing--the passage of TrumpCare would jeopardize the over 289,000 Marylanders who have received insurance coverage as a result of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care They very well would lose their coverage.  What does that mean? Well, they better stay well because they are not going to get preventive healthcare covered by insurance. They are less likely to get their preventive healthcare services and the screenings, and, yes, they will return once again to use the emergency room of hospitals as their last resort in order to get their family's healthcare needs met--the most expensive way to get healthcare in our  With the elimination of essential health benefits for Medicaid expansion enrollees, what does that mean? That means the Medicaid population--which in Maryland is hundreds of thousands of people--would lose their essential health benefits, which includes mental health and addiction services.  We are in the midst of an opioid drug addiction epidemic in I have traveled my entire State and have had roundtables with law enforcement and health officials, and they tell me about the growing number of addictions in their community. One of the things they need to do is to be able to get people care and treatment, and we are saying we are going to cut off treatment for millions of That is what TrumpCare would do, cutting off those benefits.  This bill would shift costs. What do I mean by that? Well, it adds costs to the healthcare system. If an individual stays healthy and uses our healthcare system the way they should, it is a lot less costly than entering our healthcare system in a more acute fashion or using our emergency rooms rather than using healthcare providers who are a lot less expensive and more efficient.  So we are going to add to the cost of our healthcare system because of inefficiencies. Many times that extra cost is not paid for by those who have no health insurance; the fact is, it becomes part of what we call uncompensated care. We had that before the Affordable Care With the increase in uncompensated care, all of us who have insurance will pay more because we are going to pay for the people who don't have health insurance, who use the healthcare system and don't pay for the healthcare system. That is a formula for extra costs for all of us.  This legislation would be an attack on women's healthcare. It would attack and eliminate not only the funding for Planned Parenthood, which is critically important in many parts of our country where they are the only healthcare provider for women's healthcare needs, but also eliminate essential health benefits for Medicaid expansion enrollees, which include maternal health. Those guarantees that exist today would no longer be there. With the pressure on the States, it is unlikely that they would be able to maintain the same degree of coverage for our women. Women are more likely to be vulnerable and on  It is an attack on our elderly. I have already talked about Medicare solvency, reducing Medicare solvency by 3 years, but there are more attacks than that. Over half--I think it is 60 to 65 percent of the cost of Medicaid goes to senior care, long-term care or to care[[Page S1827]]for individuals with disabilities. Most families in America get their costs covered for long-term care through The States are not going to be able to maintain the same level of coverage with the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal funds. Our seniors and individuals with disabilities will be in jeopardy of losing a lot of their long-term care coverage.  The legislation, TrumpCare, increases the loss ratios for older people from 3 to 1 to 5 to 1. That increases the cost dramatically for older That is one of the reasons the AARP opposes the legislation. Let me quote them:       This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal sustainability,      dramatically increase healthcare costs for Americans age 50      to 64, and put at risk the healthcare of millions of children      and adults with disabilities and poor seniors who depend on      the Medicaid program for long-term care services and support      and other benefits.  That is I already talked about the Congressional Budget Office being a neutral observer. The AARP, of course, is interested in what impact it has on our elderly population. They very clearly say that they are being put at risk.  Let me also talk about affordability. When you have a person who can no longer afford coverage--I already mentioned that person 64 years of age who would have to pay 55 percent of their income in order to get health coverage. That person can't afford coverage. Let's say that person is relatively healthy, so they go without insurance. Well, they need insurance. Maybe someone is young and decides not to get health coverage; they will get it when they need it. There is a 30-percent surtax if you don't keep insurance. That is going to keep people out of the health insurance marketplace who desperately need healthcare.  Once again I am going to quote from the Sun paper. The Baltimore Sun really summed it up fairly well, particularly with their attack on the Congressional Budget I think that is a very unfair attack. We all obviously take issue at times with the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, but it is the objective scorekeeper. It has the most accurate assessments we get on legislation we consider here. That is why we created the Congressional Budget Office--to give us that advice.  The Sun paper, in their editorial this morning, said:       Small wonder that President Donald Trump and certain      Republican leaders were busy bad-mouthing the CBO even before      its report came out. The last thing they needed is the      nonpartisan number crunchers to offer an informed view      instead of the usual political caterwauling about the      ``failings'' of the Affordable Care And this is      particularly rich: Republicans say the CBO blew ObamaCare      estimates years ago when it was circumstances well beyond the      CBO's control that caused analysts to incorrectly predict      ObamaCare enrollment. Should analysts have expected the      Supreme Court to deem the Medicaid expansion optional and      GOP-controlled States to refuse to accept it? Were they      mistaken to assume Congress could actually follow the law and      fund programs to stabilize state insurance exchanges?       Might the CBO be off-target again? But it's at      least as likely that the office is low-balling the most      damaging effects of TrumpCare as it is potentially over-     stating the harm. The Congressional Budget Office is as close      to an umpire as exists in It has certainly been a      lot more on target than the Trump administration, which has      consistently misled Americans on almost everything from the      definition of ``wiretapping'' to the claims of ``millions of      illegal voters'' casting ballots in the last election. Even      those overstated ObamaCare enrollment estimates were closer      to being on the nose than those produced by the CBO's fellow      forecasters at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services      and RAND       Once again, Mr.Trump and his minions have been caught      making up facts. The President promised the ObamaCare      replacement would provide insurance for everyone and it would      be less expensive. Nobody can make that claim about      As the CBO points out, premiums will rise 15-20      percent overall for the first two years, and more for older       The American public expects us to work together to improve our healthcare system. Instead of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with this legislation that will put us in much worse shape, we should be looking at how we can build on the progress we have made under the Affordable Care  Yes, we can bring down costs. Let's bring down costs by taking on the cost of prescription drugs. We know that Americans overpay on prescription drugs. There is bipartisan support in the Senate to pass legislation using America's buying power to help our consumers pay less for prescription costs.  Yes, we should have more competition with insurance carriers. Why not have a public option and see how well the private companies can compete with a public option?  Yes, we can improve the way we deliver care and make it more cost-effective. We, in a bipartisan manner, went down that path in the last Congress under the Comprehensive Recovery and Addiction Act and the 21st Century Cures Act, where we looked at ways that we can collaborate on care for addiction services and mental health so people can get the care they need in the setting they need, whether it is an emergency room or a primary care physician's office.  We have made progress making our healthcare system more cost-effective and efficient. That is what we should be doing--building on the Affordable Care Act rather than taking away critically important benefits. The Republican plan moves us in the wrong direction, and it should be rejected.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Flake). The clerk will call the roll.

I am proud to have many of my colleagues as cosponsors of this legislation, including Senators Baldwin, Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cantwell, Coons, Duckworth, Durbin, Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, Harris, Heinrich, Hirono, Kaine, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Murphy, Murray, Sanders, Stabenow, Udall, Van Hollen, Wyden, and  In the House of Representatives, the bill's principal sponsor is Congressman It is needed now more than ever before. I say that for many reasons, one of which is that we have seen a large increase in hate crimes in our community. Yesterday I was on the phone with a father from Harford County, MD, whose son was the victim of a hate episode related to that person's religion and ethnic background.  We have seen in our community a large increase in hate crimes against the Jewish community. There have been a lot of bomb threats that have been called into Jewish schools and to the Jewish Community We have seen physical attacks and the desecration of cemeteries. So the minority community feels threatened.  That has been escalating as a result of the actions of our President and his Executive orders. The Executive orders--he has issued two now that are dealing with the immigrant community--do raise the temperature in our community and the concern in our community that people are being threatened because of their religion, threatened because of their ethnic background, threatened because of their status as part of an immigrant community.  All of that has added to the concerns in America today. The legislation that I have introduced would make it illegal for discriminatory policing--for police to use as an indicator for their actions a person's race, religion, or ethnic background.  Discriminatory policing is against our values. Quite frankly, it is not what we stand for as a nation. We don't target people because of their religion. I will always remember that shortly after the Trayvon episode, I met with community activists in Many told me examples of how they were with their parents when the police stopped them randomly, for no reason at all, but solely because of the person's race and how communities felt threatened as a result of it.  It is not what we stand for as a nation. It turns communities against police, rather than working with the police. It is a waste of resources. It does not work. It can be deadly as we have seen in too many communities in our In my own city of Baltimore, we had the episode concerning Freddie Gray, who died in police custody.  I went to Sandtown, where Freddie Gray came from, shortly after that episode and met with the community, and I heard comparable stories about how good community activists felt like they were betraying their community if they worked with the local police, because they said the system was just stacked against their community and their race.  So let me, if I might, quote from the Department of Justice report on the Freddie Gray case. Our congressional delegation asked for a pattern or practice investigation. In part of that investigation, they came out with this finding:       There is overwhelming statistical evidence of racial      disparities in Baltimore Police Department's (BPD's) stops,      searches, and arrests. . . . BPD officers subject African-     Americans to a disproportionate number of pedestrian and      vehicles stops on Baltimore streets and search African-     Americans disproportionately during these stops. . . . The      policing practices that cause the racial disparities in BPD's      stops, searches, and arrests, along with evidence suggesting      intentional discrimination against African-Americans,      undermine the community trust that is central to effective      policing. . . . Indeed, we heard from many community members      who were reluctant to engage with the officers because of      their belief that the Department treats African-Americans      unfairly. . . . These concerns were acknowledged by BPD      leadership and officers, who explained that lack of trust--     particularly in many of Baltimore's African-American      communities--inhibit officers' efforts to build relationships      that are a key component of effective policing. . . .  I say that because racial profiling--discriminatory profiling--is ineffective and is counterproductive. It actually makes communities less safe. I have the honor of being the Special Representative for Anti-Semitism, Racism and Intolerance in the OSCE, or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary  In that capacity, I have identified four major areas of concern within the 57 countries that represent the OSCE, including the United Those priorities are discriminatory actions against the Muslim community, the rise of anti-Semitism, the concerns of discrimination against the immigrant community, and also the concerns on discriminatory policing.  Discriminatory policing is very much engaged in our concerns about the rise of anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. Now, I want to make it clear: The overwhelming majority of people in law enforcement are good people. They are professionals. They are trying to do their job. They are against racial profiling. But we need to protect the professionalism within the police departments and establish a national policy against racial profiling.  My legislation is supported by over 1,150 organizations. Let me just, if I might, mention a couple of those, by quoting their leaders. Wade Henderson, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, who supports this legislation said:       Discriminatory profiling is wrong, fosters distrust between      law enforcement and the communities they serve and puts      public safety at risk. Racial profiling infringes on civil      liberties and squanders resources that should be used instead      to catch criminal perpetrators. We urge his colleagues to      join Senator Cardin and stand for effective law enforcement      by supporting [this legislation].  Jennifer Bellamy, the ACLU legislative counsel, who also supports this legislation, said:       For centuries, discriminatory profiling practices have      harmed communities of color. It is not enough to be `against'      racism and racial profiling, we need national leaders to end      discriminatory practices. We know that profiling of any kind      is ineffective and diverts law enforcement's time, money, and      energy away from actual threats. The time is now to end      racial profiling once and for all.  Then, lastly, Hilary Shelton, the director of the NAACP Washington Bureau and the senior vice president for policy and advocacy said:       This important legislation takes concrete steps to put an      end to the insidious practice of profiling individuals by      federal, state and local levels based on physical attributes      or an individual's religion. It is difficult for our faith in      the American criminal justice system not to be challenged      when we cannot walk down the street, drive down an      interstate, go through an airport, or even enter into our own      homes without being stopped merely because of the color of      our skin, who we are perceived to be, or what we choose to      wear.  I could mention many of the other groups and many other quotes. This legislation is pretty straightforward. It establishes a national uniform standard against discriminatory profiling at all levels of law enforcement--State, local  For example, it tells us that we can't use as descriptors a person's race. We can do so when we are using it to describe a particular crime, but not as a predictor of future crimes. Let me close by quoting from Ron Davis, the former police chief of East Palo Alto, CA, where he said:       [T]here exists no national, standardized definition for      racial profiling that prohibits all uses of race, national      origin, and religion, except when describing a person.      Consequently, many state and local policies define racial      profiling as using race as the ``sole'' basis for a stop or      any police action. This definition is misleading in that it      suggests using race as a factor for anything other than a      description is justified, which it is not. Simply put,      race is a descriptor not a predictor. To use race along      with other salient descriptors when describing someone who      just committed a crime is appropriate.  That is what this legislation does. It establishes a national definition. It prohibits it in any form of policing in our country. It provides for training. It provides Federal grants for best practices. It requires the Attorney General[[Page S1944]]to issue reports. It is legislation that is needed in our country.  Former Attorney General Eric Holder adopted it at the national level, and he said:       In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--     partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for      all. . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the      supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to      empower, not exclude. . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can      leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it      is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever      state.  The 14th Amendment to the U.Constitution guarantees ``equal protection of the laws'' to all Racial and discriminatory profiling is abhorrent to those principles, and it should be ended once and for all.

I consider the U.S.-Israel relationship to be a strategic anchor for the United States in the Middle East and one of our most important relationships with any country. Since the creation of the State of Israel, support for this relationship has been bipartisan, bicameral, and supported by successive U.administrations. This bilateral relationship is also sustained by the deep bonds of friendship between the people of our two countries. This relationship has benefited Israel and has benefited the United  Given the range of strategic challenges across the globe that our country faces and the unprecedented instability and violence embroiled in the Middle East today, it is critical that we take steps to unify support for the U.S.-Israel relationship across the political spectrum. Thus, I believe it is vital that the U.Ambassador to Israel be seen as a unifying figure in this enduring relationship.  I really do believe that there is broad understanding and support in the Senate and the House for the special relationship between the United States and Israel--Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, a country that we can rely on for important intelligence information and that has an economy which is similar to ours. It is a country that has enjoyed a special relationship with the United States since 1948, when Harry Truman recognized Israel after the historic vote at the United  Following extensive consideration of Mr.Friedman's record and taking into account his statements during his nomination hearing, I have concluded that his past record would make it very difficult for him to serve as that unifying force. For that reason, I am unable to support his nomination as America's top diplomat in  I appreciate Mr.Friedman's efforts before the committee to express regret for his substantial record of divisive, inflammatory, and offensive statements. Unfortunately, I believe the body of Mr.Friedman's published works, not to mention his public statements, will compromise his effectiveness in representing the United States and all Americans, as well as the Government of Israel and all  Taken together, Mr.Friedman's statements and affiliations make it clear that he does not believe a two-state solution is necessary for a just and lasting peace. I am concerned that Mr.Friedman's history on this issue, in which he calls the two-state solution a scam, will undermine his ability to represent the United States as a credible facilitator of the peace process. There is simply no realistic, sustainable prospect for lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians other than as two states, living side by side, with security.

1661,topic-id,785,"Mr.President, today I wish to recognize the productive partnership between the United States and Costa I recently had the chance to meet with President Guillermo Solis, and I can attest that this is a bilateral relationship strengthened by Costa Rica's unwavering support for democracy and human rights, comprehensive economic relations, and a deep-rooted commitment to security and the environment. Since 1851, the United States has enjoyed formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica, one of Latin America's most enduring democracies, and the close cooperation between our two countries is an example of how international engagement consistently advances U.national interests and national security.  In recent years, Costa Rica has become one of the United States' most strategic security partners in Central In 2016, in response to the challenges of increasing cocaine trafficking in the region, President Solis's administration developed a security strategy that sets aggressive goals to expand its capacity to control Costa Rica's sovereign airspace and maritime territory. Last year, Costa Rica seized more than 24,000 kilos of cocaine that were ultimately bound to the United[[Page S1968]]Despite a difficult fiscal situation, Costa Rica is projected to increase its investment in security by 20 percent in 2017. I commend the Obama administration's decision to donate two Island-class cutters to the Costa Rican Coast Guard, which will greatly boost Costa Rica's capacity to combat the narcotics trade. This also serves as a reminder of the strategic value of the State Department's security cooperation at a time when the Trump administration is proposing shortsighted cuts to our foreign assistance budget.  Additionally, I want to call attention to Costa Rica's collaboration with the United States in addressing the humanitarian challenges related to individuals fleeing violence in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Between 2013 and 2016, the number of migrants from these three countries who have requested asylum in Costa Rica more than quadrupled, a dramatic increase that reflects the urgency of the situation in Central In a clear demonstration of President Solis's leadership on these issues, Costa Rica and the United States signed an agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, to establish a relocation and processing facility in Costa Rica for up to 200 at-risk migrants at a time from Guatemala, El Salvador, and This critical screening provides immediate protection for those most vulnerable and opens opportunities for these individuals to be relocated to third countries.  Our joint agreement with UNHCR is but one example of U.and Costa Rican collaboration at multilateral fora. Costa Rica has consistently voted with the United States at the United Nations on critical issues related to Syria, North Korea, and In the past year, Costa Rica has also used its voice and vote at the Organization of American States to express concern about the growing challenges to democracy and human rights in  Furthermore, in August 2016, Costa Rica's commitment to human rights was on display when it became the first country to ratify the Inter-American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of Intolerance--an important step toward a more just and egalitarian society within the The convention reinforces international standards on all forms of discrimination, reaffirms the commitment of member states of the OAS to the complete and unconditional eradication of racism, and takes a step forward in the legal definition of contemporary forms of racism.  As a champion of environmental stewardship, Costa Rica has made great strides to develop renewable energy. Costa Rica recently set an ambitious carbon neutrality goal for 2021 and is well positioned to achieve this important objective. The country recently ran 75 days straight on renewable power, and, with continued foreign investment and U.diplomatic assistance, Costa Rica is on its way to becoming a carbon-neutral nation. I am hopeful that our diplomatic mission to Costa Rica will continue to support the country's interest in being a leader in the fight against climate change. Helping Costa Rica realize innovations in its power sector helps foster a broader strategic partnership with an important neighbor in our hemisphere.  At a moment characterized by the Trump administration's isolationist rhetoric, it is critically important to recognize that the United States is safer when we cooperate with other countries in the region to fight the battle against organized crime and illegal drug-trafficking. At the same time, Costa Rica's cooperation with the United Nations to support orderly and lawful migration, its collaboration with its neighbors in the region, and its efforts to promote human rights regionally are worthy of our commendation. Costa Rica is a true partner of the United States, and it is imperative that we continue to strengthen and expand the cooperation between our two countries to promote more security, prosperity, and stability in Central America and across the hemisphere.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1967-2.txt,,THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT AND OPIOID ADDICTION,2017.0,23.0,March

Barb's service to the Senate began in 2001, when her friend Trecia called and offered her a temporary position in Senator Jim Jeffords' office. In New Hampshire at the time, Barb decided she would take a chance and try out life in Washington, Barb thought she was coming down to Washington for a 2-month assignment, answering phones and staffing the front office until the office could hire someone right out of college, but Barb quickly became an invaluable member of Senator Jeffords' team. Eventually, she became the Senator's executive assistant, working alongside him every day until his retirement from the Senate in 2007.  Barb's first year in the Senate included Senator Jeffords switching parties, 9/11, and the anthrax and ricin scares. Any one of these events might have given a different person a reason to leave the Senate, but Barb stayed and worked as hard as ever. When Senator Jeffords retired in 2007, Barb helped Senator Bernie Sanders' office learn the ways of the Senate for 2 months, after which she joined my office.  From day 1, Barb was always the person who made the trains run on time in my office. Barb had the challenging and sometimes impossible task of keeping my day on schedule, while at the same time juggling phone calls, personal notes, briefing memos, and any number of inquiries that came across her desk. There were even a few times where she managed to track down particularly old and rare library books at my request. No matter the task at hand, Barb approached her work with good humor and a can-do attitude that impressed everyone.  Barb's contributions in my Senate office are immeasurable, but I thought it was worth trying to quantify some of the ways in which she has served the people of Pennsylvania and our During her decade of service to Pennsylvania, Barb welcomed more than 200 ambassadors, dignitaries, and administration officials to my office, drafted more than 500 letters, and greeted over 1,000 Pennsylvanians at my ``Keystone Coffees.'' She acted as a mentor and support system for all my staff members, and befriended everyone she worked with in the Everyone, from the Capitol Police officers she passed on her 3-block commute, to the photographers in the Senate Photo Studio who patiently waited while Barb shepherded our constituents for photos, knows how valued Barb was to our team and to me personally.  Having been in the Senate long before I was, Barb understood how to balance the everyday needs in the office with the overall goals we set for ourselves when we first began our service here. Barb provided everyone in my office, myself included, with the important perspective that is often lost here in the Senate: it is easy to get bogged down in details or small problems, but the work we do here is important, lasting, and honorable. Barb never lost sight of how fortunate we are to work in this institution, and I know our team is grateful to have always had that reminder.  It is hard to imagine my office without Barb, but I know she will enjoy her retirement, whether she is home in New Hampshire or traveling the world.

1412,topic-id,1481,"Mr.President, I rise with my colleagues to support H.83 and companion S.27, a resolution I introduced with 25 of my colleagues, under the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to stop the Obama administration Department of Labor's regulation, known as the Volks rule, from expanding the statute of limitations for record-keeping violations. This regulatory scheme represents a backwards approach to workplace safety, and it is a blatant overreach by the Federal  Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers are required to record injuries and illnesses that occur in the work place and maintain those records for 5 years. The law provides for a 6-month period for which OSHA can issue citations to employers who fail to maintain the records properly. However, it was the practice of OSHA, based on their interpretation of the law, that they were able to issue citations regarding keeping those records properly for the entire 5-year period employers must keep those records.  Under this practice, OSHA took action against Volks Constructors, a firm in Prairieville, LA, in 2006 for recordkeeping violations that occurred nearly 5 years earlier--again, recordkeeping violations. This was well beyond the 6-month statute of limitations. Volks Constructors, located in Prairieville, is a heavy industrial contractor that provides manufacturing[[Page S1901]]services and industrial specialties to the petrochemical and related industries. It has been in business for more than 40 years. Volks challenged OSHA in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals for those citations and won. The Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous, three-judge opinion rebuking OSHA's attempt to file citations past the statute of limitations. One of the three judges was President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick  The Volks ruling has since been upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Let me read a few of the comments from the court's opinion: ``We do not believe Congress expressly established a statute of limitations only to implicitly encourage the Secretary to ignore it.''  Another comment: ``The Act clearly renders the citations untimely, and the Secretary's argument to the contrary relies on an interpretation that is neither natural nor consistent with our precedents.''  From Judge Garland's concurring opinion: ``[B]ecause none of the challenged citations were issued within 6 months, `flowing the occurrence of any violation,' I agree with my colleagues that the petition for review should be granted and the citation vacated.''  After the court was clear in its ruling, OSHA, in order to negate such ruling and continue issuing citations beyond the 6-month statute of limitations, promulgated this regulation, the Volks rule.  This joint resolution must invalidate the Volks rule. The Volks rule is a clear violation of the court's ruling and is in direct contradiction of the 6-month statute of limitations. Only Congress can amend a Federal statute. Article I of the U.Constitution is clear. Members of the legislative branch write the law, not the Federal departments and agencies.  Overturning the Volks rule will not--will not--decrease workplace safety. The rule only changes the window during which OSHA can issue citations for recordkeeping violations. This rule is about paperwork violations and not workers' health or safety.  The Volks rule also creates regulatory confusion for small businesses. By finalizing this unlawful regulation, the Obama administration created uncertainty for employers facing a confusing maze of recordkeeping standards and unwarranted litigation.  The U.Chamber of Commerce, the Association of General Contractors, the National Home Builders Association, the National Restaurant Association, the National Retail Association, along with more than 70 State and national organizations, all support this joint resolution.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Coalition for Workplace Safety's letter.

At its core, the Volks Rule is an extreme abuse of      authority by a federal agency that will subject millions of      American businesses to citations for paperwork violations,      while doing nothing to improve worker health and safety.      Finalized on December 19, 2016, the rule attempts to extend      to five years the explicit six month statute of limitations      on recordkeeping violations in the Occupational Safety and      Health (OSH) Act of 1970. This regulation simultaneously      represents one of the most egregious end runs around      Congress' power to write the laws and a clear challenge to      the judicial branch's authority to prevent an agency from      exceeding its authority to interpret the law.       In 2012, citing the unambiguous language in the OSH Act,      the U.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held      that OSHA could not sustain citations against an employer for      alleged recordkeeping violations that occurred more than six      months before the issuance of the citation because, as the      employer asserted, they were outside the six month statute of      limitations set forth in the OSH The court was      unequivocal in its rebuke of Judge Janice Rogers Brown      expressed particular concern on the issue of the agency's      overstepping its authority: ``we were rightly troubled by the      notion of being asked by an agency to expand that agency's      enforcement authority when Congress had evidently not seen      fit to do so.'' Judge Merrick Garland, in his concurrence,      plainly rejected OSHA's rationale for issuing the fines,      ``the Secretary's contention--that the regulations that Volks      was cited for violating support a 'continuing violation'      theory--is not reasonable.'' The Volks decision has since      been endorsed by the Fifth Circuit in the Delek decision,      issued in December 2016, where the court found ``its      reasoning persuasive.''       In response to the Court of Appeals ruling, OSHA      promulgated this regulation specifically to negate the Volks      case ruling and extend liability for paperwork violations      beyond the six month window permitted under the OSHA      issued the final rule in the waning days of President Obama's      Administration with an effective date of January 19, 2017.      The Senate has until April 7 to pass H.83/S.     27.       We urge you to help put a stop to OSHA's abuse of its      authority and support swift passage of a joint resolution of      disapproval for this burdensome, unlawful rule. Because the      final rule directly contradicts both clear statutory language      and two U.Courts of Appeals rulings, it must not be      allowed to stand.

Mr.Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness I thank my colleagues from Ways and Means and from the Education and the Workforce Committee for getting this great idea onto paper and moving this bill forward today.  As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I am always very appreciative to see Members from across this body find solutions for small businesses. That is exactly what this bill is.  For virtually any one of us in this Chamber, it can be said that hundreds of thousands of our constituents depend on small businesses for their livelihoods. They have been looking to those same small businesses for options, as ObamaCare has done the opposite of what it was supposed to do and it has diminished choices for workers.  By allowing small businesses to join together through association health plans, the Small Business Health Fairness Act would give small business employees at least as many choices as those who happen to work for larger companies.  Association health plans have long been a solution suggested by small businesses that share their views with me and other members of the Small Business This bill puts that idea finally into action.  Mr.Speaker, in our current state of affairs, there are fewer and fewer healthcare options available for hardworking This bill addresses that problem for our hardest hit small businesses and communities.  While we begin the hard work of making health care not only affordable but worth buying at all, this bill is an important step in giving Americans the certainty and choices that they want.

408,topic-id,554,"Mr.Chair, I really appreciate what Chairman Roe of Tennessee is doing. He pours his heart and soul into one of the most important issues and things we can deal with here in Congress and, that is, helping our veterans.  Veterans step up and serve in our military. I stand in awe. They do the heavy lifting. They run through the fire. They engage. Then they come home, and we have got to do a better job of taking care of those people who take care of us.  The Veterans Administration, just like the rest of Federal Government, has a lot of good people who actually work there, do care, and have big hearts. With a government of more than 2 million people, every once in a while you come across some bad apples. They may be a poor performer, or they may just have their heart in a different place, and we have got to deal with these bad apples.  While you have a whole set of people who are actually trying to do the right thing, you are going to run into some people every once in a while who aren't doing the right thing, and you have to be able to dismiss them.  Now, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has jurisdiction on the Federal civilian workforce, and we have worked closely with Chairman Roe of Tennessee to help make this possible.  Through the last couple of years that I have been chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, we have heard a number of accounts where Federal employees couldn't be disciplined fast enough. It was obvious what they had done, but they had run into roadblocks in being able to dismiss people.  We heard horror stories from the Environmental Protection Agency where there was a sexually harassed intern that lasted for 3 years. It took 5 weeks to process the harasser's removal proceedings.  We heard the Government Accountability Office come and testify before our committee that it can take 6 months to a year to remove a Federal employee for poor performance. You know what? That isn't good enough. When you have a bad apple and somebody is misusing the system and they are not performing, they are hurting our veterans. And when they are hurting our veterans, I take that personally. Everybody should take that personally. Nobody wants to see that happen.  So this bill, H.1259, is a very important bill to accelerate that process. Again, let's remember that most of the people who work there are good, hardworking, patriotic people who care. But when you do have a bad apple and you do need to get rid of that person, we have to have an expedited removal proceeding.  I know this bill does a number of things, but I can tell you, having heard testimony time and time and time again in a variety of Federal agencies, especially the VA, this is a much-needed bill.  We are going to work as a committee to implement reforms like this governmentwide. To put the Veterans Administration first and deal with this first, I think, is the right priority of this  Again, hats off to Chairman Roe of Tennessee and the committee as a whole for addressing this so aggressively and so early in the 115th  I urge passage of H.1259.

The bill also allows for a fast-tracked reemployment of former VA employees who have a proven record of success at the agency. We get some people trained up, maybe they go and do something else, we ought to give the people priorities in coming back as well, to make sure that we have the most qualified Federal workers who are taking care of the people who have taken care of us.

Mr.Speaker, I introduced H.648 so that we could begin the work necessary to increase the active storage capacity of the Fontenelle As a headwater State, Wyoming takes care of its water, and we know that water is our most important natural resource. Water uses currently at this dam span the gamut from irrigation, domestic, industrial, municipal, fish and wildlife, and recreation. Power generation is a secondary purpose at the dam, and current uses also include industrial capacity for our trona miners, fertilizer producers, and fulfillment of a range of energy needs.  Mr.Speaker, this bill would simply authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to enter into a cooperative agreement with the State of Wyoming so that we could begin the process to study, design, and construct increased capacity for the reservoir. This is a process, Mr.Speaker, that has been held up previously by onerous NEPA requirements, and we need to move quickly so that we can begin to increase this capacity.  Currently the reservoir has 265,000 acre-feet to accommodate water as active capacity. This legislation would potentially add an additional 80,000 acre-feet of existing reservoir space. This bill would provide an affordable and efficient way to add more usable storage in the Colorado River Basin[[Page H2065]]and would accomplish these goals without contemplating the construction of a new dam. The bill has the support of the Wyoming Water Development Office and the Wyoming Water Development Commission, which develops our State's water resources for conservation, storage, distribution, recreation, and other public interests.

939,topic-id,868,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his extraordinary leadership on this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, would partially repeal a longstanding antitrust exemption established by the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to the business of health and dental insurance.  To qualify for this limited antitrust exemption, an insurer must be engaged in the business of insurance regulated by a State that is not designed to boycott, coerce, or intimidate.  While these requirements somewhat constrain anticompetitive conduct, it is clear that they do not preclude the most egregious antitrust violations, such as price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation, by health insurance providers.                              {time}  1500  Health insurers should not be immune from antitrust scrutiny, particularly when they collude to increase prices, reduce availability, or otherwise engage in anticompetitive behavior.  That is why House Democrats passed a measure that is substantively similar to H.372, in 2010, by a vote of 406-19, and in 2009, as well. In 1988, 1992, and 1994, Judiciary Democrats likewise favorably reported legislation to completely repeal the McCarran-Ferguson  While H.372 is only a partial repeal of this exemption, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. But let me be perfectly clear about three things:  First, promoting competition in health insurance markets cannot occur at the expense of the strong protections established by the Affordable Care Act to make health markets more efficient and prohibiting discriminatory insurance policies. These protections are ``textbook measures that help promote competition in the insurance marketplace,'' as Professor Tim Greaney, a leading antitrust expert, testified in 2015.  Second, contrary to President Trump's suggestions on Twitter, repealing McCarran-Ferguson's antitrust exemption for health insurance will not remove State barriers or create new pathways for insurance companies to compete and offer products across State lines.  This simplistic approach to healthcare policy overlooks the fact that the Affordable Care Act already allows States to establish healthcare choice compacts to provide for cross-State insurance sales, while five States have already enacted out-of-State purchasing laws. But these laws have done little to encourage cross-State insurance sales because health insurers are simply not interested in selling these products across State lines.  The barriers to entry into health insurance markets ``are not truly regulatory, they are financial and they are network,'' as Professor Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute has observed.  Notwithstanding President Trump's exaggerated claims to the contrary, it is also clear that enacting this legislation is not a precondition for Congress[[Page H2270]]authorizing cross-State insurance sales.  My Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agree, noting in their report on the bill that ``the general consensus, including among witnesses at the most recent Judiciary hearing on the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, is that if Congress decides to allow insurers to sell across State lines, such action does not necessarily require a repeal of McCarran-Ferguson.''  And third, there is no evidence that enacting this bill alone will improve the affordability or availability of health insurance.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the effect of H.372 on health insurance premiums ``would probably be quite small,'' and enacting the bill will have ``no significant net effect on the premiums that private insurers would charge for health or dental insurance.''  Additionally, because the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to mergers, H.372 will not prevent further concentration in health insurance markets.  The truth is, Mr.Speaker, if Republicans were serious about actually enforcing the antitrust laws, they would fully fund the antitrust agencies. But as we know from the Trump administration's budget blueprint, Republicans plan to make deep cuts to the funding of enforcement agencies like the Justice Department, likely to the detriment of economic opportunity and fair competition.  In addition, President Trump has not even nominated heads to the antitrust agencies. According to the Partnership for Public Service, even though he has been in office for 60 days, President Trump has not picked a nominee for 497 of the 553 positions requiring Senate confirmation.  Worse still, President Trump is reportedly considering appointing a former lobbyist for a health insurance giant to run the Justice Department's antitrust division, which is tasked by Congress ``to protect economic freedom and opportunity by promoting free and fair competition in the marketplace.''  Citing lobbying reports, the International Business Times notes that this particular lobbyist participated in the ``antitrust issues associated with Anthem's proposed acquisition of Cigna,'' and his firm received $375,000 in lobbying fees.  Just last month, the Justice Department won an important lawsuit initiated under the Obama administration to block this merger, which, according to the Department of Justice, would have harmed consumers through increased health insurance prices, while stifling the exact innovation that is necessary to lower healthcare costs.  It is unsurprising that President Trump's corporate cabinet will probably include yet another lobbyist that will pursue an extreme agenda on behalf of special interests. But the significance of this potential appointment cannot be overstated and absolutely will not result in lower prices or more choices for the American people.  In closing, Mr.Speaker, while I support H.372 as a complement to the Affordable Care Act, I agree with the ranking member that this bill is not a solution to improving the availability or affordability of health insurance.

986,topic-id,1345,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) for leading this Special Order hour where we can really talk about the impact of what is about to happen if the Republicans get their way and pass  I think it is important to recognize that this proposal that is currently before the House will substantially hurt the American people, beginning with, as your chart demonstrates, the loss of coverage, when fully implemented, for 24 million Americans who will no longer have access to affordable health care and will be uninsured by 2026. Those are our friends, our neighbors, our family members who no longer will have health coverage.  In addition, it provides an enormous tax break for the wealthiest people in this country. In fact, the total value of these tax breaks over the decade is $600 billion to the richest individuals and the biggest corporations. It is the largest transfer of wealth for working families to the very rich in our Nation's history.  To accommodate this tax break, to give this huge tax benefit to the richest Americans and the largest corporations, they achieve this by stealing health care from millions of families all across this country and by cutting billions of dollars from Medicaid and As the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) said, the 400 richest families will each enjoy a $7 million tax cut; and the way they paid for that is they take away health care from millions of  There is also the impact on our economy. There is a new analysis from the Center for American Progress, and they conclude that TrumpCare will destroy 1.8 million jobs.  We are all focused on: How do we get people back to work? How do we create good-paying jobs?  This is a job killer. TrumpCare will cost 1.8 million jobs, a loss of an ability to provide for yourself, for your family, and for your future.  As you said, people will be paying more money for less quality care. Deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses will skyrocket, leaving sick people unable to afford the care they need.  Particularly, as you mentioned, there will be an age tax because older Americans will pay more. Their premiums will go up at an even faster pace because they are allowed to charge even more based on their age.  Young people are also hurt. Young people are hit with a millennial tax. They put a 30 percent premium surcharge on those reenrolling after a lapse in coverage, which is often the case, particularly with young people where people may have lost a job and be out of work. So they are going to be penalized with a 30 percent premium.  The impact of the Republican proposal, this TrumpCare proposal, on women is devastating. In addition to new restrictions on comprehensive health care for women, this Republican bill, TrumpCare, defunds Planned Parenthood and will make it much more difficult for women to access essential preventative care and affordable contraception.  As I mentioned, the middle-aged American--the age tax--will pay more. For example, a 64-year-old individual with an income of $26,000 in the individual market will pay $12,900 more in their premiums each year. That is almost half their income under the Republican plan. So it is going to really get those who are above 55 but haven't yet hit the age to receive Medicare especially hard.  Also, TrumpCare hurts our seniors by weakening Medicaid and It shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. It steals $880 billion from Medicaid, which, as you mentioned, is the principal source of long-term care for seniors.  Also, it does damage to the protection for people who have preexisting conditions, because someone who has a lapse in coverage will be subjected to a 30 percent premium on top of their base premium. So there is another penalty for people who have preexisting conditions.  If you take all of this together, it is worse coverage, worse care, higher costs, huge tax cut for the richest people in this country--for drug companies, for insurance companies, To pay for their tax cut, we take away insurance from the most vulnerable and working people in this country.  We have all received both emails and phone calls and had conversations with those whom we have the privilege of representing, and they have shared with us these heart-wrenching stories of what it would mean to lose their health care.  In my State, I am proud to say that, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, we have the highest rate of coverage that we have ever had in our State's history. Ninety-seven percent of Rhode Islanders have access to quality, affordable health care. It is great. It makes a difference in the lives and quality of the lives of everyone.  I want to share with the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) an email that I got from a constituent, just recently, from Lincoln, Rhode Brenda said:       If all goes well, I am literally going into surgery for hip      replacement on March 16 of this year. Though hip replacement      is seen as elective, the pain I deal with now interferes with      my quality of life. Without it, I will end up in a wheelchair      in a few years once I can't handle the persistent pain.       Without the ACA, I would not be able to have this      operation. I do not own a home for collateral and have a 19-     year-old car. I work full-time in a hotel for $12 an hour. I      have not had a raise in 4 years. We have no benefits at all,      including health care. We have no paid time off at all for      sick days, personal days, or vacation.       I am not confident enough to move to another job with my      current physical limitations, which have reached a point      where it interferes with every activity, including sleeping.       My doctors, who are aware that I get my medical through the      ACA, have been helpful and diligent about getting me in soon,      knowing there is a major threat for those whose only way for      medical coverage is through the My condition may not be      life-threatening, but left untreated, it would limit where I      can live, if and where I can work, and, most likely, leave me      on permanent disability or Social Security, which most people      can't live on.       I am only 52. I still have several functional, productive      years ahead of me, and I receive a subsidy to help make my      coverage affordable.  Brenda is just one example of someone whose life is literally being preserved. Her quality of life is being protected because she has access to health care. She can have the surgery she needs. She can eliminate the pain she is suffering and lead a productive life.  There are millions and millions of Americans who have the same kinds of stories, who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, who will be deeply harmed when that insurance is ripped away if Republicans get their way and pass  I want to end by just saying thank you again to the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) and to also mention that he referenced, in his remarks, the process that has produced this very, very troubling piece of legislation, unlike the process that produced the Affordable Care Act that occurred over many, many months and many hearings, where 121 Republican amendments were accepted into the bill and it still didn't earn a single Republican vote. Yet, through TrumpCare, over 100 Democratic amendments were offered in three committees of jurisdiction and not a single Democratic amendment was accepted.[[Page H2283]]  So even efforts to try to improve a terrible bill were rejected in the committee process, and that is because they are intent on making sure they deliver this big tax cut to the special interests who sent them here to Washington, and they are going to try to do it on the backs of the hardworking people of this country. We have to continue to stand up and fight and do everything we can to prevent it from happening.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2280.txt,2055,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,March

After returning home from a sober house, he, unfortunately, relapsed and took some designer drugs that he had ordered online, causing him to overdoes.  She called me just this week. Anthony's sister Cara also suffers from anxiety and depression, in part because of the post-traumatic stress disorder that she suffered after discovering her brother who had died. Thanks to the ACA, she is able to receive coverage for critical mental health services since her mother doesn't have coverage through her employer.  Like many of my constituents, Cara relies on the coverage she has gained, and she writes:       I am worried for my future without my support system. The      discontinuation of coverage would be detrimental to our      efforts to combat mental health disorders and the opioid      epidemic which continues to plague families and has been such      a support to my family.

There is a shadow hanging over the United States of America, over our government, and over this House; and only we can lift it.

Well, there is a Federal investigation of the present President of the United States--something that has never happened before--and that has put a dark cloud that can only be lifted by showing in the light of day what the President's involvements were with his income taxes, whom he owes money to.

935,topic-id,546,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in qualified support of H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, but I do not endorse the majority's exaggerated claims regarding the bill's impact on the affordability and availability of health insurance.  H.372 would partially repeal the limited Federal antitrust exemption for the business of insurance established by the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. Specifically, the bill only permits Federal antitrust enforcement with regard to the business of health insurance.  Now, House Democrats have long supported a full repeal of McCarran-Ferguson's antitrust exemption for all insurers, not just for health insurers. In 2010, under a Democratic House majority, we passed legislation to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson exemption for health insurers by a vote of 406-19, even though House Republicans had not previously supported moving any version of a McCarran-Ferguson repeal bill.  But let me be clear. Enacting H.372 would in no way be a substitute for the many health insurance guarantees of the Affordable Care The two things are completely separate. To begin with, enacting H.372 would not significantly improve healthcare affordability or coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.372's effect on health insurance premiums would probably be quite small, and enacting the bill would have no significant net effect on the premiums the private insurers would charge for health or dental insurance. That is according to the Congressional Budget  The Consumers Union observes that the application of the antitrust laws to some health insurance activity, by itself, is simply not enough to create a vibrant insurance market because our long experience shows you can't expect a healthcare system to run effectively on competition alone. That is the Consumers  Likewise, the majority's claim that enacting H.372 would create major new competition by allowing cross-State insurance sales is unavailing. Current law, including the Affordable Care Act, already allows States to agree with each other to allow cross-State insurance sales.  Enabling Federal antitrust agencies to police certain forms of anticompetitive conduct will not, in and of itself, incentivize health insurers to offer products across State lines beyond the incentives that already exist for offering such products. It just won't happen by itself. Whatever the incentives for health insurers to offer such products, they have little to do with Federal antitrust law or enforcement.  Finally, enacting H.372 would not ensure that the Affordable Care Act's prohibitions against discrimination and limits on premium growth would remain in place. H.372 only applies to certain anticompetitive conduct and does not preserve or enhance existing protections for consumers of health insurance. For instance, it does not prohibit discrimination by health insurers on the basis of preexisting conditions, nor does it reduce premium growth or require health insurers to be accountable for price increases.  Repeal of the antitrust exemption for health insurance is a complement to and not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act's many consumer protections. This is not an either-or situation. We need H.372 and the Affordable Care Act to be in place to maximize benefits, improve quality, and lower costs for consumers.  So while I support the bill with some reluctance, I take issue with the majority's rhetoric. It is very important that we set the record straight here.

I, too, support the nomination of Dan Coats to serve as the next Director of National Intelligence and succeed James Clapper, who has been in the intelligence business for 50-plus years. He has big shoes to fill, but I have every confidence Dan Coats can do that.  One of the things I hope he looks at is that post-9/11, when the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created, we basically created another layer in the intelligence community. As the Presiding Officer and other Members know, the DNI--the Office of the Director of National Intelligence--has grown by leaps and bounds. I just hope he takes a good, hard look at the layers we have created, perhaps at the duplicative functions that do not necessarily make our intelligence any better but that do create more problems in managing what is a very important office to our national security and certainly to the intelligence community.                             Sunshine Week  Mr.President, on another matter, in spite of the snow yesterday, I recognize the fact that this is Sunshine Sunshine Week is a movement that was created to highlight the need for more transparent and open government. Justice Brandeis is also often quoted when one talks about transparency in government and its importance to a functioning democracy when he said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.  As a conservative, I would much rather have people change their behavior in their knowing that their actions are going to be public rather than to pass new laws and new regulations. To me, knowing that the public is going to be aware of what one is doing causes people, typically, to be on their best behavior. I think that is the reason I support Justice Brandeis' comment that sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe that is true.  I have done my best to keep that sentiment in mind to create legislation that presses our democracy toward more openness in the Federal Government, not less. That is because I believe our country grows stronger when operating under the principle that an open government is the basic requirement for a healthy democracy. Of course, when voters know and understand what their government is doing, they are in the best position to change its direction if they disagree with it or to reaffirm that direction by casting their votes as informed members of the electorate.  Democracy can only work when the public knows what government is doing and can hold it accountable, so I am glad that at this time of year, we can look back at the successful efforts we have made to promote transparency while looking ahead to do more.  Last Congress, I introduced the Freedom of Information Act Improvement It is a law that strengthens the existing Freedom of Information Act, which is the country's chief open government law, by requiring Federal agencies to operate under a presumption of openness when considering whether to release government information in their custody.  We passed it last summer, and President Obama signed it into law. This important new law accomplishes some of the most sweeping and meaningful reforms in its history to the Freedom of Information Act, and it is already making a direct impact by helping the public access more information.  Because of the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act, last October, the CIA released a portion of its official history of the Bay of Pigs invasion, which has been kept classified for decades. This is a critical part of our Nation's history that is worth knowing, and I believe it is no longer necessary to keep it under wraps in order to protect America's national security.  This serves as an example of what we are trying to accomplish with this law and others like it so as to build upon the idea the Founding Fathers recognized hundreds of years ago; that a truly democratic system depends on an informed citizenry to hold its leaders accountable. That is an idea everyone in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, can agree upon.  I am thankful to the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr.Leahy, for working with me on the Freedom of Information Act Improvement Act and making it a priority. As a matter of fact, Senator Leahy has been my partner on a number of our efforts in this important area over the years that we have both been in the  I also appreciate Chairman Grassley's leadership, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for stewarding this bill through the committee, and I appreciate Leader McConnell for making sure this was a priority for this  In looking ahead, I will continue working with Chairman Grassley to make sure the Federal agencies are implementing this law in a timely manner, and I look forward to doing more to strengthen greater government transparency measures in the future.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Finally, Mr.President, next week, the Judiciary Committee will take up the nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the U.Supreme Court so he may fill the seat that was vacated by the death of Justice That process, of course, begins with hearings to consider his qualifications and his credentials, but heading into next week, we already know a lot about his record.  He has been praised by people across the political spectrum--from liberals to conservatives--as a highly qualified and exceptional judge with impeccable integrity. He served with great distinction on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, based out of Denver, for the last 10 years, after having been confirmed by this Chamber unanimously. His hometown newspaper, the Denver Post, encouraged the President to nominate Judge Gorsuch before his nomination was even announced. This, of course, was the same newspaper that endorsed Hillary Clinton for Clearly, Judge Gorsuch has won the respect of those across the political spectrum and on both sides of the aisle. Last week, the American Bar Association announced its unanimous decision to grant Judge Gorsuch the highest rating available; that of ``well qualified'' as a nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United  I should point out that both the minority leader and former chairman of the Judiciary Committee--the senior Senator from Vermont--have called the American Bar Association's rating system the ``gold standard'' when it comes to assessing the qualifications of judicial nominees.  Judge Gorsuch will also bring decades of experience on the bench, as I mentioned a moment ago. He has also served in private practice, as an attorney with the Justice Department, and, of course, as a Federal judge.  It is time to move forward with the President's nominee to fill the seat that was left open by the death of the late Justice Scalia, and I believe Judge Gorsuch is just the man to fill it. I look forward to hearing from him next week as we consider his nomination to this important position.  I express my gratitude to Chairman Grassley and the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, for their efforts thus far in putting these hearings together, and I look forward to working with the rest of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to consider the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, starting next Monday, March 20.

ObamaCare was sold under false pretenses. The President himself said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.

1077,topic-id,446,"Mr.President, I say to my friend from Florida that I think there has been a lot of false advertising and scaremongering taking place around the country in trying to convince people that, somehow, they are going to lose their coverage, which is not the case.  We believe we can do better than ObamaCare, which has created a one-size-fits-all healthcare package and has basically denied people the right to choose the kind of coverage that suits them best at a price they can afford.  In Texas alone, a person making about $25,000 a year could spend up to 30 percent of his gross income under That is a young person, and it is no surprise that many of them have opted out of ObamaCare and simply decided either to pay the penalty or to just become noncompliant because it is unaffordable.  I am sympathetic, certainly, to the genuine concerns of anybody in one's getting appropriate healthcare coverage, but I sure hope people do not succumb to the scaremongering taking place in parts of the country that tells people they are going to be left high and dry.  For example, my friend and colleague said that Medicare was going to be gutted under the House bill. That is not true. Right now, Medicaid is an uncapped entitlement. It is one of the fastest growing sources of Federal Government spending. The bill in the House proposes not to cut it but to restrain its rate of growth. Right now, it is the third largest budget item in the Texas budget. My friends in the Texas Legislature tell me that it crowds out all other spending, including education, law enforcement, and other things--that it just eats up so much money because it is uncapped. What we would propose to do is to leave Medicaid at the current levels but then make sure that it grows according to the Consumer Price Index--and a rather generous one--in medical inflation.  I will say what I said earlier, which is that I do not recognize the bill that my friend from Florida has described. If the House did not pass a bill and if the Senate did not pass a bill, we would still be here, talking about the meltdown of the Affordable Care Act because many insurance companies have simply pulled out of the marketplace. Many people do not have choices. They are forced to deal with, perhaps, the one remaining health insurance company, and in some places they are going to have all insurance companies pull out of the individual market.

But so far, I have seen zero indication from our friends across the aisle that they are interested in working with us. I hope that is a misunderstanding on my part, and I hope going forward we will be able to come up with some bipartisan bills.[[Page S1875]]  The truth is that, given the constraints of the budget process, we are not going to be able to do everything we want to do in this bill that is going to pass the House on Thursday and which we will take up here in the Senate next week. So there is going to be a necessity to do some more, and I hope we can do that on a bipartisan basis.  We also know that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, is working from a regulatory standpoint to try to do everything he can to stabilize the insurance market and to make sure that people continue to have some choices.  I think this is fundamentally a test of our principles regarding whether we actually believe in more choices and competition, and my firm conviction is choices and competition improve the quality of a service and the quality of a product. That is really one of the foundational principles upon which our economy is based. I think it also works in healthcare, but we haven't had that since ObamaCare passed.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I want to speak a little bit about the important hearing on the judicial nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court that is taking place in the Senate Judiciary Committee even as we speak.  We know that President Trump nominated Judge Gorsuch at the end of January to a seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Justice Scalia was a lion of American law. He was bigger than life. His intellect, his writing, and his wit inspired a lot of young lawyers and not-so-young lawyers and judges and law students over the past decades, and reminded us that judges have a distinct and special and important role in our system of government, but it is decidedly not to be a legislator or a policymaker because they are ill-suited for doing that.  First of all, Federal judges are appointed for life. Judges are not supposed to take public opinion polls to figure out how to rule in a case.  I asked Judge Gorsuch today: Is it proper for a judge to decide in a case in front of him or her who he or she thinks should win and then try to work backward to justify it in a judge's decision?  He said: Well, it is actually just the opposite. What you try to do is to take the facts and the law and you apply them and you respect the outcome, even if sometimes it is not an outcome you would prefer if it were a matter of your personal preference.  What he described, really, is called the rule of law, which has distinguished the United States of America from most of the rest of the world and which has given us our competitive advantage. When people know that we are going to have a legal system that doesn't depend on personalities, doesn't depend on politics, but rather on a written law or Constitution, then people can take confidence in their investments, in their plans, and our economy has been the winner.  There is a Peruvian economist who wrote a book called ``The Mystery of Capital.'' I will just summarize, briefly. I was intrigued by the book and by his thesis. Basically, his argument is the United States is no more entrepreneurial than other parts of the world, but what distinguishes us from much of the rest of the world is what I just said a moment ago: It is the rule of law. For example, if you buy a house and get a title to that house, then you have a legal right to it, and you can defend it against all other claimants or people who might try to say: No, that is really my house. I know that sounds so basic, and we take it for granted, but it really does distinguish our country from others, where the law is really not about law, but it is about politics. It is about who is in power. Well, our laws are designed to protect people who are not in power, including people in political minorities.  I think the greatest legacy of Justice Scalia was a strong belief that the words in the Constitution and laws passed by the Congress matter. He believed judges should apply those texts and not just pronounce their policy preferences in deciding cases. He understood, as I do, that a careful adherence to text ultimately protects our democracy, which is the intention of our Founding  I have spent time, like many of my colleagues, talking about the type of judge we need to fill this vacancy--someone who understands the lessons that Justice Scalia taught us--and will apply them faithfully, without regard to persons or personalities or politics. I believe there is no question that Judge Gorsuch is the man for the task. I am confident that the hearings this week will make that clear to the rest of  It is interesting to listen to some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who want to talk about everything other than Judge Gorsuch and his qualifications. They want to talk about President They want to talk about abortion. They want to talk about same-sex marriage. They want to try to get Judge Gorsuch to prejudge some future case that may come before the U.Supreme Well, no judge worthy of that title will tell anybody: Well, if you confirm me as a judge, I promise you this outcome. That is a violation of the most fundamental ethics of a judge, because a judge is not, again, a policymaker, a judge is not a politician; judges aren't about outcomes, but rather a commitment to the rule of law and due process of law in reaching their decisions.  So far, in almost two days in the Judiciary Committee, I think Judge Gorsuch has performed admirably and demonstrated no reason why our colleagues across the aisle can't support him. As a matter of fact, my view is that if you can't vote for somebody like Judge Gorsuch, there is probably nobody that would be nominated by this President that you would vote to confirm. It is hard for me to imagine the nomination getting much better.  We have already learned a lot about the judge. We know of his intellect. We know of his sterling qualifications and his extensive experience. I particularly appreciated his testimony today about access to justice and his concern that people of modest means--low income, the so-called little guy that our friends across the aisle keep talking about. The little guy in America is essentially denied access to our courts because it costs so much and it takes too long, and there have to be mechanisms in place for us to resolve our differences that everybody has access to or else the statement carved in the marble over the U.Supreme Court that says ``equal justice under law'' is just a pathetic joke.  So we have a lot to do in terms of providing access to justice. I think somebody with Judge Gorsuch's background--someone who actually has practiced the law and who has represented clients in court and who has been thoughtful about this and so many other topics--is just the type of person that can help us get our legal system back on track, so that saying, that model, ``equal justice under law,'' is a reality.  We know that Judge Gorsuch has spent a decade on the bench and about 10 years in private practice, and he has also worked at the Department of Like Justice Scalia, he is a steadfast believer in the Constitution laws and that they should be interpreted based on their text; that is, what they actually say.  I asked Judge Gorsuch today: If you don't believe that you ought to interpret the law based on what the law actually says, what would you use as your guide? If you are not going to interpret the Constitution based on what the Constitution says, what are you going to use as your guide?  Well, some of our friends would talk about a living Constitution or judges knowing better than perhaps the elected representatives of the people. To me, that is just misguided. Judges are not philosopher kings or queens. Judges, as I said at the outset, hold a very important but finite role in our system of government. It is our job as the legislature to make the policy. It is the executive--the President's job--to execute the policy. And if we don't like the law, then it is our job to change it, not to look to the Court to say: I am going to let the Congress off the hook, and we are just going to write an opinion and render a judgment that changes the law under the guise of actually judging, actually engaging in more policymaking.  Well, the great thing about somebody like Judge Gorsuch is that the people who admire him also include people who differ from him politically but have seen him in action--people like the former Solicitor General under[[Page S1876]]President Obama, who said he is ``one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century,'' and someone who ``has always put aside his personal views to serve the rule of law.''  In other words, Judge Gorsuch is the type of judge that we should all be able to get behind, and he is exactly the kind of nominee we would hope to see from any administration. That is why he was previously confirmed by the U.Senate 10 years ago when he was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in He was confirmed by voice vote. For people who may not be familiar with the practices of the Senate, that essentially is by unanimous consent, by unanimous agreement, including the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York, Mr.He thought Judge Gorsuch was good enough for the Tenth Circuit Court of I would challenge him to identify a reason why he is not well suited for the United States Supreme Court, unless it is based on some political calculation.  As the Judiciary Committee this week considers his nomination, I want to make crystal clear the purpose of the hearing. It is not about pinning the nominee down or asking trick questions or asking the judge to prejudge cases that might come before the We know there have been outside special interest groups who have criticized Judge Gorsuch for failing to rule in favor of one sympathetic constituency or another, but, again, that is not what judges do--or what they are supposed to do. Are they really supposed to find the most sympathetic party to a lawsuit and say: I am going to decide that case for them, and I will figure out the justification for it later. That is not what judges are supposed to do. Judges are supposed to apply the law impartially and fairly and decide the facts and apply the law and render judgments on cases or controversies that become before the court, not write policy at large.  So I think some of these attacks are pretty silly, but they also are a reminder of the importance of these hearings because I really believe this is one of those opportunities to help acquaint millions more Americans with our unique founding story and the unique nature of our Constitution and our Nation of laws.  I see my friend from Tennessee here. I remember something he told me once about telling his constituents that one of the important functions of the Senate was to remind people what it means to be an Well, being an American means believing in the rule of law and equal justice for all.  I will close on this because I see my friend from Tennessee here waiting to speak. This is another kind of an interesting statistic I found pretty amazing, and the Presiding Officer, a distinguished lawyer in his own right, can marvel at this as I do.  Judge Gorsuch is no radical. He follows the law wherever it leads: sometimes for the police, sometimes for a criminal defendant; sometimes for the government, sometimes against the government. That is the way the rule of law works. He noted that about 97 percent of the thousands of cases he has decided have been unanimously. As the Presiding Officer knows, the circuit court sits in three-judge panels. The idea that 97 percent of the cases he decided were decided unanimously is pretty remarkable, and he sided with the majority 99 percent of the time. This is nobody out of the mainstream. This is a mainstream judge. So let's be honest and open about it.  I hope our colleagues across the aisle, after this nominee is voted out of the Judiciary Committee, will allow us to have an up-or-down vote on this nomination. It wasn't until the Presidency of George Bush in 2000 that somehow the tradition of allowing an up-or-down vote for nominees went out the window and instead some people got together and decided, well, we are going to come up with a rationale to raise the threshold to 60. In other words, a President won't be able to see his nominee confirmed unless not just a majority votes for it but 60 people vote for it in the Senate because of the Senate's rules on cloture closing off debate. That period of our history during the George Bush administration was an aberration, and I would hope no one would want to repeat that--again, politicizing the judicial nomination process.  People can vote any way they want, but denying the opportunity for the Senate to vote up or down on a nominee, particularly to the U.Supreme Court, is certainly not a road I would hope our colleagues would go down. As they presumably learned this year, after Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, led his conference into the nuclear option, which basically changed the Senate rules by breaking the Senate rules--that is what allowed us to confirm the President's Cabinet with 51 votes, and that is what will allow us to confirm all lower court judicial nominees with 51 votes. So we would think they might have learned the lesson that what goes around comes around and that while you are in the minority one day, you might be in the majority in the not too distant future. What you force the Senate to do in order to do its job may end up biting you in the future. So I hope they seriously consider allowing Judge Gorsuch an up-or-down vote when his nomination comes to the floor sometime around or after April 3.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1437,topic-id,2459,"Mr.President, this week the Judiciary Committee has been considering the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the death of the late Justice Antonin  I think it has been a remarkable opportunity for the country--indeed, the world--to see not only somebody who is obviously very intelligent but very articulate and very committed to the basic principles that created this country, which were shaped in the framework of the  Sometimes people forget that judges aren't legislators and legislators aren't judges and that we do have separate responsibilities. Indeed, the separation of powers between the President and the legislature and the judiciary is very important and for a good reason.  Judge Gorsuch has done a tremendous job for the last 2 days handling questions from both sides of the aisle with humility and with clarity.  I told him that I had hoped he would consider Chairman Grassley's proposal that we have a camera in the Supreme Court courtroom.  Years ago, when I was on the Texas Supreme Court, we decided to have a single camera--which nobody, really, frankly noticed--in order to document and record the proceedings in the Supreme Court of It didn't turn into a sideshow. It wasn't the O.Simpson trial. People didn't misbehave because they were on camera. But it was a great opportunity for people to see their government and their elected officials in action.  Given the performance of Judge Gorsuch over the last couple of days and the benefits that accrue to the country as a result of learning more about his qualifications, his temperament, and his principles when it comes to judging, I hope more people will want to see that. We could all learn from it.  That would be good for our country, it would be good for the judiciary, and I think it would be good for America's standing in the world. We are in a vast minority of countries in the world when it comes to having an independent judiciary, and that is essential to our form of government and to who we are as  The country has learned a lot about Judge Gorsuch in the last few days. His career has been marked by a dedication to the law. In his decade on the bench interpreting the law, he has developed quite a record. As a matter of fact, he said that he had decided to participate in the decision of about 2,700 cases, and he has been reversed once. I find that remarkable. It is really almost hard to believe. He is clearly no extremist.  Some of our Democratic colleagues try to argue that he is not for the little guy but, as he so ably points out, he is for whoever the facts and the law say should win in a case. He doesn't view it as his role to put his thumb on the scales of justice and to predetermine a case or the outcome before the facts and the law have been applied. In short, he is not a politician. It would be totally inappropriate for a judge, given the fact that they are given lifetime tenure and they don't have to stand for election in front of the people--it would be entirely inappropriate for the judge to say: If I am confirmed, I will rule on this contentious issue this way or that way. That is not what judges do. That is what politicians do. That is why, when we stand for election, we go out and campaign and we tell people: This is what I believe in, and if you elect me, this is what I am going to do when I am elected into office. That is entirely appropriate for members of the legislative and executive branch because if the American people don't like what we are doing, they can fire us in the next election or, conversely and hopefully, if they like what we are doing, they will return us to office.  So as the judge pointed out, he said that judges actually would make ``rotten legislators,'' those are his words, not mine, because their job isn't to write the laws, it is to interpret them. They don't stand for election. They are not in intimate contact with the constituencies we all represent. Importantly, as I said at the outset, he did affirm his strong support of the separation of powers. Again, I think it is really important for everyone to acknowledge the different roles performed by different actors in our form of government. Legislators play one role, executive officers, the Presidents, and Governors in our State system play another role, and then the judiciary plays an entirely different, important but limited, role in our government.  One of our colleagues was complaining about the judge's decision in a case and that the so-called little guy lost in the case. Well, the judge said,[[Page S1916]]while he didn't necessarily like the outcome, he felt bound by the facts and the law that Congress had actually passed to render a judgment as he did in that case. I pointed out, were it otherwise--were the judge untethered to any sort of deference to precedent, that he would basically be a loose cannon and making political decisions or deciding what the outcome would be before he worked through the facts and laws to determine what the appropriate outcomes should be. I pointed out, and the judge confirmed, that if in interpreting a statute, which the court did in that case, if Congress doesn't like the outcome, then it is within Congress's power to change the law, to change the statute which would mandate a different outcome in a future case.  He pointed out, appropriately, that the role of the judiciary is for neutral and independent judges to apply the law in the people's disputes. So he is aware of the limits and the important role of the judiciary in our form of government. He also made clear his judicial philosophy is based on nothing more and nothing less than a faithful interpretation of the text of our Constitution and laws. Now, sometimes you hear people talking about, well, we have a living To me, that suggests there is something wrong with applying the text of our existing Constitution, which was passed through constitutional amendment or originally when the Constitution was ratified by the  It kind of raises an interesting question. If a judge isn't bound by the text of the Constitution or of a statute, what can he use? Does he use his own value judgments? Does he use his own policy preferences? Does he use his political agenda in order to do his or her job? Obviously, I hope we would all agree that would be inappropriate.  Judge Gorsuch has also talked about the role of judicial courage, meaning following the law and the facts wherever they may lead, even though the judge, as a personal matter, may not agree with that or that may not be his personal preference. I know it sounds hard for those of us living in a political world, but actually judges do every day put their personal policy preferences aside and decide cases on the facts and the law. I believe it would be wrong of them and I believe a violation of their oath of office for them to do otherwise. What happens when there is a nominee like this who is so outstanding, so articulate, and so principled? Some of our colleagues across the aisle said: We are going to ask him some hypothetical questions. We are going to smoke him out and see if he will take the bait and prejudge some of these cases on controversial areas that will come before his Court or some other court. The judge--and I would expect nothing less--said it would compromise the independence of the judiciary and would be unethical for him to prejudge the outcome of some future case that might come before the Supreme If you can imagine this, how would you feel if in a case before a court, the judge had already made a commitment to the outcome and you ended up on the short end of the stick? You wouldn't feel that was justice at all. You wouldn't feel that was fair at all. That is what the judge was doing in declining to head down that path to prejudge cases. In doing so, he followed the example of a number of previous nominees, people such as Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, both nominated by Democratic Knowing he can't answer, our colleagues have claimed they have no clue how Judge Gorsuch would perform his job and have used that as a pretext to oppose someone who is eminently qualified, but Judge Gorsuch has given them all they need. They have all the information they need in order to make an informed decision. He pledged to hear all sides of the case, to look at the merits, based on the law in question, and then and only then to come up with an unbiased and fair, impartial decision.  Can he do it? Well, the best evidence of ``can he do it'' is ``has he done it'' and the answer to that is yes. He has a decade of time on the bench, with hundreds of decisions, filled with millions of words, done in exactly the way he said he would do, to decide cases, based on the merits, in an unbiased and independent fashion.  So we have his record to judge him by, and his record is impeccable, which is the reason some of the critics have to go down this path of asking him hypothetical questions he can't ethically answer or otherwise claiming to be in the dark about his qualifications, temperament, and philosophy of judging.  It should come as no surprise that lawyers and academics and judges all across the political spectrum have spoken out in favor of the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch, agreeing that he is an independent jurist, with integrity and the right temperament, intellect, and experience to serve on the Supreme  He was introduced to the committee by both of his home State Senators, the junior Senator, a Republican, and the senior Senator, a Democrat, who called Judge Gorsuch a man with ``a distinguished record of public service'' and ``outstanding integrity and intellect.'' I couldn't agree more.  Neal Katyal, a Solicitor General under President Obama, also spoke glowingly of Judge Gorsuch and provided a strong endorsement of his qualifications to serve on the bench. He was one of the first on the other side of the aisle to urge the Senate confirmation of Judge Gorsuch, citing his independence, his integrity, and his superb qualifications. The bipartisan recognition of Judge Gorsuch's fitness for this high office is nothing new because a decade ago, 10 years ago, he was confirmed by the U.Senate by voice vote, essentially unanimously. Not one Member of the Senate opposed his confirmation, and the truth is, nothing has really changed since then. So you would think that if some of our colleagues across the aisle thought he was good enough to be confirmed as a circuit judge to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, that they could have something they could point to if they were inclined to vote no, something that happened within the intervening 10 years, but I have to tell you, there is not much there for them, if anything. In fact, his opinions have rarely elicited dissent, and he has a rare record of reversal which I think is remarkable.  In truth, he is a great jurist, and that is clear by the evolving reasons coming from our friends on the other side of the aisle as to why they had some concern. First, we heard some Senate Democrats would fight a nominee who isn't in the mainstream. Well, Judge Gorsuch passed that test with flying colors so they moved on. Next, they said they would oppose him because of his refusal to answer questions about issues that would come before the As I said, not only do the ethics rules prohibit him from doing that, but the tradition set by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan rightfully dictated that he refuse to do so during the hearing. Now we hear from our Democratic colleagues that his vote must be delayed because of an ongoing FBI investigation that is completely unrelated to him. I think that is just an indication of how desperate they are to come up with a reason, any reason, to oppose this judge's confirmation.  Watching Judge Gorsuch this week, it is clear our Democratic friends are finding it hard to come up with a reason to oppose his nomination. Indeed, they are struggling to do so, and they are desperate for an excuse to oppose him, but they are not going to find a good excuse or a good reason.  I hope our colleagues will help us confirm this good man, this good judge for this office. I know our politics, when it comes to judicial confirmation, have become very contentious, but it wasn't always that way. Back when President Clinton was in office, before President Bush 43, judges were confirmed routinely by an up-or-down vote of the majority of the U.Indeed, Justice Scalia, whose seat will be filled by Judge Gorsuch, was confirmed overwhelmingly. I think it was by 97 votes, if I am not mistaken. Justice Ginsberg, somebody from the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, was confirmed with 96 votes or thereabouts. So I hope it is a time we can get back to the traditions of the past, which means not filibustering mainstream nominees, as some of our colleagues across the aisle have threatened to do even before the hearing began.  I would ask them this. If you can't vote for somebody like Judge Gorsuch, you are not going to be able to vote for any nominee from a Republican President because there simply isn't anybody better qualified by virtue of his[[Page S1917]]experience, his education, his training, and his temperament for this job. I hope they will reconsider.  I am happy to support his confirmation and urge all my colleagues to do so as well. If they can't vote for his confirmation, at least allow us to have an up-or-down vote, without setting the bar at 60 votes, but making it a majority vote in the U.Senate, which has been the tradition in this body for many, many, many years, excepting the last 8 years during the George Bush administration.

I rise in support of H.1365, the Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation  When the Department of Homeland Security was established in 2002, it was understood that the mission of safeguarding the American people would be[[Page H2308]]a complex one. Today, 15 years later, the ever-changing nature of the terrorist threat and its landscape has demanded that DHS be more innovative. In the past 3 years, the Department has actively worked to carry out its procurement process in new and innovative ways.  The Acquisition Innovations in Motion program, launched in 2015, is a framework for coordinated industry engagement in which opportunities, challenges, and strategies are discussed to identify acquisition solutions and foster greater efficiency and effectiveness.  A key component of this program is a Procurement Innovation Lab called PIL is a virtual testing environment that experiments with innovative techniques to assess whether they can be effectively integrated into DHS' procurement process. To date, PIL is credited with reducing award times, the integration of existing flexibilities that are in use in other portions of the Federal Government, and improved acquisition training.  Results, case studies, and lessons learned from the PIL process are regularly shared throughout DHS through webinars and the internal web portal. These activities facilitate a continuous learning culture that enhances the DHS mission of support.  I introduced this bill, H.1365, to institutionalize DHS' acquisition innovation efforts by authorizing such activity by the Under Secretary of Specifically, my legislation authorizes robust testing, development, and distribution of best practices and acquisitions throughout the Department, as well as performance metrics to measure the effectiveness of such efforts.  Enactment of this bill will help ensure that this successful acquisition management technique continues. This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month.  Mr.Speaker, DHS' approach to acquisitions not only accommodates the Department's unique mission, but it supports our responsibility to the management of taxpayer dollars.  This bill codifies a pathway to developing and implementing innovative approaches that serve the Department's acquisition challenges through collaboration and efficiency. To that end, it is vital that DHS continue to drive towards a more effective procurement process in support of its vital mission.

291,topic-id,771,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today to speak about the need for bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform. I am disappointed by President Trump's actions on immigration during his first 2 months in office. I do not say that lightly, because I want this President to succeed, as I want every President to succeed, because if they succeed, so does our country.  But the President's comments and actions to implement policies that don't hold up American values has me feeling very uneasy. To say the least, his erratic statements made on domestic and foreign policy, that he has either taken back or corrected, demonstrates a lack of diplomatic experience. For example, issuing an executive order to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border is not a real solution to fixing our broken immigration system. It does little, if anything, to improve our national security, and it would only hurt trade relations with Mexico, which would have a very serious economic impact not only on American exporters, but especially California's agriculture industry.  Additionally, the Trump administration's directives to deport undocumented immigrants, regardless of how long they have lived here and the contributions they have made to our society, is a strong example of the President's implementing policy that not only is flawed from a human rights perspective, but it is going to have a negative impact on our economy as well.  President Trump is forcing over 11 million individuals who have lived in the United States for decades deeper into the shadows of our communities. They are scared to go to work, scared to go to school, and scared to live their lives. California's agriculture industry relies heavily on a workforce of individuals who are undocumented and work every single day to accomplish the American Dream for themselves and their families. These individuals are not only contributing to the agriculture industry, but they are also students, entrepreneurs, and businessowners.  Furthermore, implementing an executive order to ban travel to the United States is not the American way. As many people in my district are aware, President Trump's first travel ban prohibited a 12-year-old girl, Eman, and her U.citizen father from coming home to the United States, and his order put them in harm's way while they waited in                              {time}  1030  Last month, a Federal appeals court ruled to block that executive order travel ban. Four weeks ago, father and daughter finally came back to Los Banos to rejoin their family.  Our President and his team had to go back to the drawing board, as we know, to issue a new executive order. And just last night, his second executive order to ban travel was blocked.  The Trump administration claims that the flawed executive orders are:  One, a vital measure for protecting national security;  Two, work to improve the vetting process; and  Three, that the United States has a right to vet people who are entering the country and keep people out who are doing us harm.  I agree that we need to work together to protect national security. The Federal Government is obligated to keep our country safe and vet people who enter this country. And guess what? Thorough and rigorous vetting policies are already in place, and they have been going back to the Bush administration ever since 9/11. That is nothing new. My office receives casework on a weekly basis regarding visas that are being extremely vetted and individuals who are waiting for years to get the proper visa to come to this country. That is extreme vetting.  I strongly encourage the President to work with us in Congress and implement a policy that actually strengthens our national security, upholds our national security, and upholds our American values that we all cherish. Working together on a bipartisan basis, we can fix our Nation's broken immigration system. Working together, we can make important investments in our infrastructure, and we should. Working together, we can reform our tax system so it is simple and fair. Working together, we can negotiate a farm bill that provides benefits for all Working together, we can fix the Affordable Care  Clearly, in regards to the ACA, my Republican friends have decided to go at it alone. That is too bad.  I stand ready to work with the President on a bipartisan basis on all of the above, but the President must reach out. I sincerely want our President to do well because that is what is in the best interest of our country, as I want every American President to do well. But it will not happen. It will not happen, my colleagues, my friends, unless we work together.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2088.txt,1774,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,16.0,March
995,topic-id,1293,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.Garamendi) very much not only for the focus and the passion that he shows for this very important issue of trying to ensure that we have health care for all Americans, but also for the leadership he has demonstrated over the years. He and I have worked together in California on so many different issues.  The Affordable Care Act, as we know, has provided health care for over 20 million Since its implementation over 6 years ago, the ACA in my district, which is Fresno, Madera, and Merced Counties, located in the San Joaquin Valley, has decreased the uninsured rate from 22 percent to 11 percent. It is cut in half.  I have a marvelous, wonderful district that I take great pride in representing. It is one of the largest agricultural areas in the country. It has significant wealth, but, sadly, it has significant poverty. It is the combination of those two that make it a place where immigrants have come for decades--immigrants past and immigrants present--to make a better life for themselves.  Mr.Speaker, 19,000 individuals in my district have received financial assistance and have been able to purchase coverage through the Covered California marketplace, and 121,000 individuals in my district are now covered by the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion.  The cuts that are proposed in this Republican proposal would devastate those individuals not only in my district, but in Congressman Garamendi's district and throughout the valley. My Republican colleagues, the five of us from Modesto down to Bakersfield, almost 500,000 people today have insurance coverage that did not have it 6 years ago.  Let me give you some real examples. Tom lives in Fresno, He is 57 years old. In 2015, due to a major heart attack, he had to leave his job of 29 years. Tom's health insurance, though, did not lapse because, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, he gained affordable health coverage insurance through the Covered California marketplace. In addition, his family wrote to my office saying that they cannot envision his recovery being a success had it not been for the  Another one of my constituents, John, who lives in Fresno, told my office that without the ACA, he and his wife would not have been able to afford cancer surgery for his wife. She is now cancer-free. And we know how expensive that can be.  Austin, one of those Americans who volunteered to serve his Nation, a Vietnam veteran who lives in my district, told my office that his wife was paying $830 a month before the Affordable Care Now she can afford health care at $400 a month--cut in half.  Not every story with the ACA is a success story. It is not perfect. There are problems with the act. We should be working on it.  I remember, Congressman Garamendi, when you were the insurance commissioner of California, and one of the areas that you developed a lot of expertise and experience on was how to deal with the insurance industry. Certainly there are improvements that can be made. There are small-business owners in my district who say that the ACA raises costs and does not provide enough insurance options for themselves or their employees. So we need to work together to fix the provisions in the law that drive up the costs and weaken the insurance marketplace.  This month, the American Health Care Act was introduced to repeal and replace the ACA by our Republican colleagues. I do not believe the American Health Care Act is a serious solution to fixing the problems we have in the The legislation we know would provide less financial help to low-income families and seniors whom we both represent. The American Health Care Act would dramatically change the way we finance Medicaid by shifting from an open-ended reimbursement system to a person allotment or block grant which will cap the amount of money in California that receive Medicaid, and that is dramatic and devastating.  This would force California to choose how to allocate increasingly a smaller number of Medicaid dollars and would decrease the care available to Medicaid beneficiaries which Congressman Garamendi and I care deeply about. Thousands of individuals in the San Joaquin Valley would be impacted.  Additionally, the legislation will not mandate individuals to purchase health insurance. Instead, insurers would be able to attach a 30 percent surcharge--think about that--on individuals who have a lapse in coverage. I don't think that is going to play well in Peoria or in So this will provide a disincentive for young and healthy people to buy insurance. It is important to note that in order for the insurance marketplace to work, there needs to be healthy people in the system to help pay for sick people. When the Speaker said that healthy people are subsidizing sick people, well, I am not an insurance expert, but isn't that the way insurance works? Good drivers pay for poor drivers, right? If you don't have a pool, a balanced pool, it doesn't work.  One last point I want to make: passing the Affordable Care Act, I was here in 2010, and it wasn't pretty. It took 1 year, dozens of committee hearings in several committees, multiple versions of the bill in the House and the Senate, and various revisions of it. We tried to get the Republicans involved. We tried to get them to participate, and we took amendments that they gave. But at some point, they decided that, no, they were going to go it alone or force us to go it alone. I think they are making the same mistake that possibly we made 6 years ago. I think that is sad because I think the American public wants us to work together.  Less than 1 month after introducing their repeal-and-replace bill, which will be before us this week--and, clearly, the replace is still a work in progress--the House is going to pass a bill on a party line vote on Thursday maybe without an updated CBO score. I thought we were going to have transparency, the light of day, know what taxpayers are paying, what they are getting, and what they are not getting. I guess not on The CBO scores are how Congress and the public analyzes how legislation would impact States and citizens. But we are not working to get that vital information.  This last week I hosted a healthcare workshop to hear from all of my hospitals, healthcare providers, clinics, doctors, and nurses to ask what they thought of the Affordable Care Act and what we can do to fix the law. What they told me is there are a lot of things we can do to fix the current law to make it better. But they said the healthcare act that is being offered as a repeal and replace is not a solution to providing the much-needed health care we need in the San Joaquin Valley, that we need in California, and that we need in our country.  At the end of the day, Mr.Speaker, we know that working together is how you get things done. On a bipartisan basis, we can make a difference, but not the way we are going. So I think that the gentleman from California's efforts and my efforts as we continue to try to urge common sense to prevail is what we need to do. I will, unfortunately, not be able to vote for this measure on Thursday because it really[[Page H2286]]is going to negatively impact hundreds and thousands of people in the San Joaquin Valley that will lose their coverage as a result of this repeal and replace.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his passion and his efforts.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2280.txt,1774,PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR,2017.0,21.0,March
701,topic-id,874,"Mr.Speaker, after 7 years of railing against the Affordable Care Act, a little less than 2 weeks ago we finally got an opportunity to see what the Republican repeal-and-replace plan actually looks like.  President Trump described it on March 7, again, a little less than 2 weeks ago, as our wonderful new healthcare bill.  The new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price, solemnly promised that no one will be worse off financially as part of this bill known as the American Health Care  Well, Mr.Speaker, as President John Adams once said a long time ago, facts are stubborn things; and over the last 2 weeks, we have had an opportunity to see what the Congressional Budget Office says about the American Health Care Again, this is the neutral body that advises the Congress and the Nation with budgetary analysis both in terms of taxes and spending and also in terms of healthcare coverage.  What it has told us is that 24 million Americans will lose their health coverage between now and 2024. In fact, it will go up by 14 million just in the first couple of years under this bill, which, again, after 7 years, we never got a chance to see it, but now we are finally getting that opportunity.  Mr.Speaker, sometimes it is a little sort of too much to talk about these large numbers and top-line numbers. What I want to share with you and my colleagues and also anyone watching this speech is that the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is, again, one of the most respected healthcare, nonprofit, educational institutions in our country, has produced an interactive website which basically gives any American the opportunity to scroll across a map of America, find the county where you live, punch in what their income level and age is, and then compare the existing law with the American Health Care Again, that website is kff.org/interactive/tax-credits. Again, kff.org.  I had an opportunity to use that website for my district in eastern Connecticut, a district I proudly represent, the home of the UConn Women Huskies and the home of the Groton submarine base, the oldest submarine base in What it showed is that, for people living in New London County, in Windham County, in Tolland County, in Middlesex County, if you are 60 years old and you are making $50,000 a year, you lose $3,230--in terms of premium tax credits compared to existing law--in the proposal which, again, was finally unveiled 2 weeks ago.  If you make only $30,000 a year and you are 60 years old, you lose $5,850, a 59 percent reduction in terms of your income assistance to buy health coverage. Again, the prior number was 45 percent.  Unlike what Mr.Price said, this, in fact, is much worse off financially for people in those age groups and where they live. It is far worse off financially in terms of where they stand. In fact, it makes it impossible for people to afford health insurance.  That is why the Congressional Budget Office, looking at that kind of data, has made the conclusion that, if we pass this bill--and the vote is scheduled on Thursday--we will see, again, millions of Americans who will basically be priced out of the opportunity to buy health insurance.  And when you are 60 years old--as someone who is 63, I can tell you--that is not a good place to be in terms of your health status and the risk that you carry when you get older in life in terms of the need to be able to access healthcare coverage.  Mr.Speaker, it is that reason why, when you look at what the stakeholders that deliver health care in America--the American Nurses Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, and, finally, the American Medical Association--who have looked at this bill over the last 2 weeks, they have universally pleaded with Congress to block this measure, to slow down the rush to judgment which is going to deprive people of one of the most elemental, basic needs that all of us share.  We are not immortal. We are not immune to getting illness and disease. It[[Page H2188]]is something that affects every single  To pass a bill which will wreak that kind of havoc, again, is irresponsible and takes this country in the absolute wrong direction.  So, again, I would plead with Members and I would ask anybody watching this speech, go to the Kaiser Foundation website, find where you live, think about your uncle or your children or people that you know in your neighborhood, and really plug in that data and information and think about what, in fact, we are being told is, in fact, a wonderful healthcare bill and something that won't hurt people and won't make them worse off financially. Again, the opposite is true. CBO is telling us this, the doctors are telling us this, the nurses are telling us this, the hospitals are telling us this, those who advocate for older Americans are telling us this.  Again, it is not too late. This vote is coming up on It is time to listen to the people who are closest to the system and stop this rush to harming millions of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2187-4.txt,1836,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,20.0,March
1280,topic-id,706,"Mr.Speaker, again, as someone who was a small-business employer for 27 years and provided health benefits for my staff, I am acutely aware of the challenges in the small-business market which long predate passage of the Affordable Care Act and which is still something that we can do better in terms of helping folks deal with this issue, which, again, is so important because small businesses are the job creators in the American economy.  What I want to sort of point out is that this legislation, in my opinion, is just a complete misfire. Let's, first of all, remind everyone that there are over 670 association health plans existing in America today.  The notion that the Affordable Care Act somehow is smothering or stifling association health plans is, in fact, just factually false. There are many that are in business, providing coverage, as has been said by some of the prior speakers, for people in industries like restaurants, et cetera. Again, we are not talking about some existential threat that is out there in terms of association health plans today.  The guts of this bill--and it is quite extraordinary coming from, again, the Republican Party--is to preempt State Governments from having any say over the solvency and the benefit design of plans that operate under association health plans.  Back in the 1990s, there was a spate of problems with association health plans going belly up because, again, there was no State insurance solvency standards to make sure that there were funds set aside to pay the bills of people who were employed in the businesses that these plans were set up to serve.  As a result, Congress acted. We basically said that the Federal Government was doing a lousy job in terms of protecting patients. And we gave States the ability, through their State insurance departments, to make sure that certain solvency standards were met and, as was stated earlier, that they weren't able to cherry-pick just the healthiest and leave the rest for the other segments of the health insurance industry.  As a result of the fact that we made this change, again, the State insurance commissioners all across America, Republican States and Democratic States, have weighed in. They sent a letter on February 28 pleading with Congress not to do this, not to pass this bill which eliminates their ability to protect the citizens of their  So this bill is actually an anti-states' rights bill because it is basically saying the Federal Government is just going to step in and wipe out the way in which these plans operate and just lead, again, a race to the bottom, the lowest threshold of protections for patients; and that is considered healthcare reform or somehow advancing the ball in terms of helping small businesses.  There are many other ways to deal with this issue, and this is not the right one. Again, this is not some new idea that we are debating. This has been back and forth over the years, in the 1990s and the early 2000s. It predates the Affordable Care Act by decades, and it is just an old chestnut that is being thrown out in the floor in the name of some idea to sound like we are doing something for small businesses.  Again, under the Affordable Care Act, we set up a 50 percent tax credit for businesses that qualify for it to make health insurance affordable.  I did two townhalls back in my district. I had a plumber from the next town over who, again, took advantage of that 50 percent tax credit. He saved thousands of dollars in terms of providing health benefits for his small business.  We can expand that tax credit to get a wider universe of small businesses, and that is what we should be doing. We should be building on what is successful, again, not watering down existing patient protection and consumer protection laws that ensure that plans are actually going to have enough funds to pay the bills when people get sick or go to the hospital and certainly not be able to cherry-pick what benefits are considered essential or not.

1281,topic-id,174,"Mr.Speaker, we should not be allowing health plans to decide we are not going to cover maternity or that they can pick and choose what essential benefits that, again, the rest of the universe of businesses have to provide now under the Affordable Care Act, which are, again, based on sound medical research, not political decisions or not just the whims of people who are running health plans, like association health plans.  Again, this is the wrong approach. This is, again, turning the clock backwards. It is not going to provide any protections, and it certainly is not responding to some existential threat of association health plans. There are 672 in operation today. Let's help them with programs like tax credits. Let's not just sort of turn that whole sector of the health insurance marketplace into the Wild West because it is patients who are going to lose. Our citizens are going to lose.

1123,topic-id,498,"Mr.President, today I wish to honor the life of John Bruce Fery, a friend and mentor.  John's obituary beautifully conveyed a sense of who he was: ``John's journey took him from challenging early years as a latchkey kid with a working mom to remarkable lifetime accomplishments. He loved God, his family, his community, and his country. He loved the outdoors, sunshine, and John He had a zest for life and a work ethic that was incomparable, while his commanding presence, charming smile, and quick-witted humor made him adored by family and friends. He was captivated by the joys of family life, the challenges of business, the warmth of friendships, the satisfaction of philanthropic work, and the stories each brought to his life.''  On February 16, 1930, John was born in Bellingham, WA, to Margaret and Carl John lost his father at a young age, and he and his mother moved to Seattle, where he graduated from Roosevelt High School and attended the University of Washington before serving in the U.Navy during the Korean war. He married his wife, Dee, in 1953, and obtained his masters of business administration from Stanford University before his extensive, much respected career in the pulp and paper industry. He led the Boise Cascade Company for more than two decades, taking on the position of president and chief executive officer in 1972 and chairman of the board in 1978. Throughout his 37-year career with the company, he built a legacy of sound judgement and expertise that led to his many honors, awards, and service on multiple boards.  In addition to his esteemed business career, John and Dee have given generously to many philanthropic efforts. His obituary aptly highlights some of their significant contributions to the community: ``Whether attending the new Horsethief Reservoir Y Camp in Cascade, Idaho, learning about Birds of Prey at the World Center, enjoying the Idaho Shakespeare Festival and the park that he and Dee donated, attending Medical School through the WWAMI program which John helped found as a means of training physicians for Idaho, staying at Alphonsus Regional Medical Center where John chaired the board and established its Foundation, receiving a grant from the Idaho Community Foundation, which exists today due to John's leadership in its formation and growth, or receiving a scholarship to Boise's Bishop Kelly High School, the University of Idaho, or Stanford, people will have experiences made possible by John and Dee's vison and generosity.''  John was also a dear friend to me. He encouraged me and was instrumental in inspiring my public service. His guidance, advice, and insight are forever etched in my life's path, and I am deeply grateful for the time he took to help shape my service. I extend my deepest sympathies to Dee; their sons, Brent, Bruce, and Michael and their families; and their many other family members, loved ones, and friends. We are bettered for having had John in our lives. He leaves behind an enduring, loving, and joyful legacy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1888.txt,250,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,21.0,March

Immediately request the tax return information of Donald      Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed      executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as      provided under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and      vote to report the information therein to the full House of      Representatives       2. Support transparency in government and the longstanding      tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates      disclosing their tax returns.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

56,topic-id,481,"Mr.Speaker, under rule IX, clause 1, questions of the privileges of the House are ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''  I would argue there is nothing more of a threat to the integrity of the House of Representatives than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance, as our Founders expected of us, of the executive branch.  To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to request President Trump's tax returns and give the American people the transparency that they deserve.  The American people know full well the scope of the President's financial background, as related by television and the media; but they don't know the details.  Article I, section 9 of the Constitution includes a clause prohibiting foreign emoluments to the The Office of Government Ethics has warned us about the President's decision not to divest or set up a blind trust, and there is a need to fully understand the President's ties to  Mr.Speaker, we are seeing the President saying one thing, such as mandating the use of American-made steel on American pipelines, then quietly reversing himself to allow the use of foreign-made steel on the Keystone Pipeline, which is being built by a Canadian company.  The resolution I am offering can provide the transparency to help ease the concerns of Americans in every corner of our country. The Internal Revenue Code includes language laying out a path for the Ways and Means Committee to obtain the tax returns and review them in a respectful way. There is the precedent that I have stated earlier that provides for this to be used.  A growing number of Members and Senators from both parties have been saying we should have the President's tax returns. One of those is Congressman Steve Knight of California who announced to his constituents that the President's tax returns should be made public, so I look forward to his support of this resolution.  The House must demonstrate that its Members are listening to our constituents' concerns. The House must demonstrate that it cares about protecting the integrity of the House, of our government, of our Constitution, of our system of checks and balances. Let's shine a bright light on the President's conflicts together.  We, as the elected Representatives of our constituents and the broader American public, can judge whether his decisions are being made for himself,[[Page H2070]]his business, or for the greater good of the American people.  At the end of the day, if President Trump has nothing to hide, then he should be willing to do what every President since Richard Nixon has done, and that is, release his tax returns.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would remind the gentleman from New York that the question is on, and his remarks must be confined to, the question of privilege.

185,topic-id,1971,"Mr.President, I want to thank my esteemed colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, for his comments. He shared many of the same views I have.  As I think about the job I do as a Senator--perhaps one of the most important jobs we have as Senators is approving a Supreme Court An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court can serve an average of 27 years. We think about Justice Scalia; he served 30 years. Neil Gorsuch is 49 years old. God willing, he probably will serve 30 years or more, perhaps. Think about that. My wife and I have four children. They are going through the college years and so forth. They are in their early and midtwenties. They will likely be grandparents when Judge Gorsuch wraps up his career on the Supreme Court, assuming he is approved. That is why a decision like this about whom to vote for, whom to stand behind, whom to stand with is so important. It is not just for today, it is for our children and our grandchildren.  The people want a Supreme Court Justice who does not legislate from the bench. The people want a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rule of law and follows the The people want a Supreme Court Justice with a record of constitutional jurisprudence and legal restraint to match what we saw from Justice Antonin The people want a Supreme Court Justice with the academic credentials, who is well prepared to serve the American people on our highest Court, to wrestle with some of the most complicated issues that the High Court wrestles with.  When President Trump announced that he was appointing Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.Supreme Court, the American people knew he was truly a supreme pick. He has a brilliant legal mind. He understands the role a judge plays in our judicial system--to interpret the law and not to legislate from the bench. In fact, on the night he was announced, when President Trump revealed his pick, I was at the White House, and I heard Judge Gorsuch say: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.'' That is the humility of a great judge.  Judge Gorsuch has impeccable legal qualifications that demonstrate he will be the type of Justice every American deserves to have on the highest He graduated from Harvard Law He was a Harry Truman Scholar, graduated with honors in 1991. He earned his law degree and then attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar and received his doctorate degree in 2004 from  As we say out West, and as a Montanan, I have to say I am thrilled to see somebody from Colorado be nominated for the Supreme We say out West: Go get a good education and then get over it. And he brings that kind of humility to the bench. He understands that he is beneath the law, he is subject to the law. He is there to interpret the law, not to make the law.  He clerked for Justice Byron He clerked for Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United In fact, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch was nominated by then-President Bush to the Tenth Circuit in Denver, He was confirmed without any opposition, including the support of 11 current Democratic In fact, some of those Democrats included Harvard Law classmate Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and the current minority leader, Chuck During his time as a judge on the Tenth Circuit, he has built a solid reputation as a respected jurist with a very distinguished record.  One thing about serving on the Tenth Circuit Court for 10 years: You can run, but you can't hide. He has left a track record. It is an impressive track record. It is a consistent record of defending the Constitution, including respecting the separation of powers and respecting federalism and the Bill of Rights to protect every American from government overreach and government abuse.  When I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Gorsuch, it was back in early We spoke about the role of government and federalism. We spoke about the Second We spoke about protecting life and upholding our civil liberties. We spoke about our shared western values, mine as a native Montanan, his as a native Coloradan, both of us westerners. I know he understands our way of life. He understands Montana values. In fact, his face lit up as we talked about the love of the outdoors and his passion for hiking and fishing.  As chairman of the Western Caucus, it is important to me to have someone who understands western values, someone who understands the impact the law and his decisions will have on the  As westerners, we fight to protect our Fourth Amendment rights. We champion federalism so that power not expressly given to the Federal Government in the Constitution is returned back to the States and to the people. We will tirelessly fight to protect the Second These are western values.  By the way, the Second Amendment is not primarily about hunting. Our Founding Fathers were not thinking about deer hunting or elk hunting when they were discussing the Second It was about liberty. It was about freedom. These are western values. Judge Gorsuch's background and record strongly suggest that he recognizes and adheres to these values. He will uphold the law. He will rightfully check the administration and Congress when their actions are not done under the law, like President Obama's EPA power plan or the WOTUS rule. These are actions that cripple western economies, and they are politically charged.  I would also like to mention that Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and I were just at the White House meeting, just an hour ago. We were at the White House meeting with over a dozen Tribes who represent hundreds of other We were there to discuss our support for Neil Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court I can tell you, it was great to be there with one of my hometown Tribes from Montana, the They have endorsed Neil They understand that we need a mainstream, commonsense westerner on the Supreme  By the way, when you look at Neil Gorsuch's record on Indian Country issues, as a member of the Tenth Circuit Court for 10 years, he has a track record of ruling on some very complicated issues that face Indian He understands sovereignty. That is very important. That is why you are seeing Tribes endorsing Judge  More importantly, the American people deserve nine members on the Supreme Neil Gorsuch is the mainstream judge the American people want and deserve to fill out the  I am looking forward to what will happen next week in those hearings. You are going to see a very, very bright, a very, very thoughtful, a very, very kind, and a very, very humble jurist who understands and upholds the rule of law. I am excited for our country that we have such a phenomenal nominee. I look forward to casting my vote to confirm him to the highest Court in our great country.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr.Mr.President, what is the parliamentary situation right now?  The PRESIDING The Senate is considering the Coats nomination.  Mr.Mr.President, I understand that we will be voting in about 10 minutes; is that correct?  The PRESIDING That is correct, sir.  Mr.Mr.President, I have had the great honor and privilege of knowing the nominee to be our Director of National Intelligence for many years. In fact, I came to the House of Representatives in the election of 1984, and I had the honor of knowing Dan Coats beginning at that time.  As is well known, Dan Coats left the Senate and became our Ambassador to Germany, where he did an outstanding job. He came back to the U.Senate and served in this body with distinction and honor. Now he goes on to serve as the Director of National  I could argue that a dedicated, experienced, knowledgeable, and courageous Director of National Intelligence[[Page S1824]]is now needed more than at any time that I can remember in the last many years.  With divisions within the intelligence community, there are challenges to the credibility of the intelligence community along the lines that I have never seen. There are questions about the activities of the intelligence community. For example, the President of the United States alleges that Trump Tower was ``wiretapped,'' in his words, by the previous administration, and we see the former Director of National Intelligence both before the Congress and on national television stating that those allegations are not true.  There are probably more questions and more controversy surrounding our intelligence services than at any time since anyone can remember, since So this is a perfect time, in my view, for Dan Coats to assume the highest responsibilities of our Director of National He has the respect and indeed affection of Members on both sides of the aisle because of his successful efforts at working in a bipartisan fashion. He served on the Intelligence He served on that committee in a very dedicated and knowledgeable fashion.  I hope my colleagues will unanimously vote in favor of our former colleague. Both sides of the aisle know him, and we know him well. I wish I had some of his qualities of congeniality and pleasantry. He has always been respectful of other views. Even in the fiercest debates that we might have, he has always been respectful of those who disagree. So he comes to the job with the much needed credibility that will make him immediately effective.  Let's be frank. The intelligence communities are probably under greater attack in a whole variety of ways, both on whether the American people trust them to do the job that they are doing or whether they have become a partisan organization. I think that with the respect and appreciation and affection that those of us who had the privilege of knowing him--on both sides of the aisle--and knowing what an honorable and decent person he is, he will not only serve as an effective Director of National Intelligence, but he will serve to restore credibility.  God knows we need credibility at this time, as we see the Russians trying to affect the outcome of our election, as we see today the Russians trying to affect the French election and possibly the German election, as we see unprecedented cyber attacks--more than at any time in the past. With the challenge of cyber alone, where our adversaries or our potential adversaries are equal to or even, in some cases, more capable of exercising their abilities and capabilities in the cyber realm, then we are in a very difficult and challenging struggle.  That is why I think that many times in history, not only does the man make the job but the job makes the man. I am confident, in the case of Senator Dan Coats, that will be the case.  I thank the Democratic leader for allowing this vote to take place so Dan Coats can get to work immediately.  I urge my colleagues to offer their support with their vote for this nomination of a great and good and gentle man who has again volunteered to serve his Nation, for which all of us should be appreciative, and I am sure we are.  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Rocky grew up on his family's wheat farm in the small McCone County community of After high school, he studied telecommunications at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Shortly after completing his degree, Rocky returned to eastern Montana and began to provide Montana sports fans with high quality commentary. Rocky's distinguished broadcasting career began in the early 1980s and continues today. This past weekend, he was calling the play by play for the Montana High School State Basketball Championship tournament games. Rocky's Montana sports program is broadcast daily on 40 stations, and he has been recognized by his peers as the ``Montana Sportscaster of the Year'' on nine separate occasions.

Mr.Speaker, I call attention to the 92 programs that, over time, since the Great Society, our country has launched. I call attention to Ronald Reagan's prescient quote about the near eternity of government programs. It is very hard to take a program away once it is launched, and this plan acts on The Brookings Institution's data, which has rarely been accused of being on the right side of the political ideology.  It says that if we do three things, we will eliminate 80 percent of poverty: graduate high school, work full-time at any wage, and have no kids outside of marriage.

This jeopardizes our ability to fight back against invasive species that threaten the region's biodiversity, including the Asian carp. It also impacts vital cleanup projects that ensure our water is safe to drink. And there are those who want to store nuclear waste in the Great Lakes as well. It is not a partisan issue; it is an American issue.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2092-2.txt,2251,MICHIGANDERS WILL LOSE COVERAGE,2017.0,16.0,March

President Lincoln reminds us of our duty ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle,'' and, frankly, our government has done a miserable job of it.  While a large number of VA employees honorably serve our veterans, that is not always the case. In the real world, if you don't do your job, you get fired. Yet we have employees at the VA who are guilty of gross misconduct, even major felonies, and they are still on the job.  ``Why is this?'' you ask. Because the process to fire them is too arduous. The VA system that lives up to our veterans' sacrifices starts with personnel. The VA Accountability First Act is a great first step in addressing poor performance and misconduct at the It will allow Secretary Shulkin to make substantive changes as he works to improve veterans' care.

914,topic-id,252,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, for yielding me time.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness  As a surgeon in north Florida, I witnessed, firsthand, the disaster that is After ObamaCare was passed and implemented, small medical practices across the country were faced with new, crippling regulations that threatened their very existence.  I ran a small urology practice in Panama City and faced the very devastation that these new regulations on small business imposed. Thankfully, I was able to work with several other small practices to create the Advanced Urology Institute, a 45-physician practice with over 400 employees and offices throughout north Cooperation and pooling of our resources allowed our practice to reduce costs and to better serve our patients.  My experience underscores why the Small Business Health Fairness Act is so crucial. The Small Business Health Fairness Act allows small businesses to operate under the same principle when purchasing health insurance for their employees.  By joining together across State lines through associations, small businesses can achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by big businesses and unions when purchasing health care. It will empower small businesses to purchase better plans at a lower cost, which means working families can get the care they need at a price they can afford.  It is time to put small business employees on a level playing field with those of large businesses and those in unions. The health insurance market and this bill does just that.

1441,topic-id,3917,"Mr.President, last Thursday was a sunny, cold day in Chicago, but I looked forward to it because there was an event that I wouldn't miss. We have a hospital there known as the Rehab Institute of It is one of my favorites, and we have some great hospitals. The Rehab Institute of Chicago literally focuses on people who have had serious accidents, strokes, injuries and who are trying to get rehabilitated so they can function and walk.  I really got to know this hospital years ago when I had a town meeting in Chicago and talked about our returning veterans from Iraq and Many of them were coming home with serious injuries from roadside bombs and the types of injuries that can change your life.  A man came up to me, and his name was Ed He was from North I was kind of surprised that he was at a Chicago town meeting. He explained to me that he heard about the town meeting because he had a son named Eric who was a disabled veteran and was at the Rehab Institute of It turns out that Eric was seriously wounded by a roadside bomb in Iraq, and during the course of the surgery afterward, there was an accident. The net result of it was that he had very limited mobility and he could no longer speak.  Eric, if I remember, was about 23 years old. He was married and the father of a little girl. Well, the VA did the best for him, and they finally came to his mom and dad and said: We can't do anything more. We need you to pick out a motorized wheelchair for Eric because he needs to be in a nursing home. His father said: He is 23 years old. He is not going to a nursing home. We are not quitting. His dad then set out to find the best hospital in the United States and came to the conclusion that the Rehab Institute of Chicago was the place.  So he came to invite me to come up and meet Eric at the hospital, which I did a couple of days later. Eric was there with his mom and dad, and he started the rehab. I went back to see him a week or so later to see how he was doing. His mom said, as I came into the room: Eric has a gift for you. I thought: A gift for me? The gift was that Eric, with a little help, was able to stand on his own feet. It was a breakthrough. Some people had said it would never happen again.  His dad said to me that Eric planned on Memorial Day to put on his full dress uniform from the Army and walk out of the front door of that hospital with a little help and show folks that they shouldn't have given up on him. They asked me if I could be there. I said: I will move Heaven and Earth; I will be there. I wasn't the only one. There were a lot of people there--the mayor, elected officials, and every TV camera in Chicago--as Eric Edmundson walked out of the front door of the Rehab Institute in  You never forget those moments, do you? Here is a young man who risked his life for America, came back gravely injured, and through his father and mother's determination--and his own strength--he found the best place for treatment. This rehab institute does research to find ways that give people who have spinal injuries and other injuries another chance.  Well, last Thursday they opened up the new Rehab Institute of Chicago, and it is renamed. It is the Shirley Ryan It is not a hospital. They call it an AbilityLab, and the reason is that they try to integrate research with actual doctors, clinicians, and patients all in the same place--not separate universities and hospitals and so forth. It is a bold idea. It is a new concept, but if anybody can pull it off, it is Joanne Smith, who heads up now the Shirley Ryan  Do you know what I learned as I got out of the car to give the speech and to cut the ribbon at this new research facility? I learned that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, had just announced his new budget. Do you know what was included in his new budget? A new spending line for the National Institutes of That agency is the premier medical research agency in the world, and we are lucky to have it right here in the United We are lucky that Congress has given more money to NIH for biomedical research last year. Senator Blunt, a Republican of Missouri, who heads up the subcommittee with Senator Murray of Washington, planned on giving more this year, and we are still trying.  Do you know what President Trump suggested for next year's budget for the National Institutes of Health? He suggested cutting their appropriation by $5.8 billion. It is a $32 billion appropriation. Cutting it by $5.8 billion will bring the level of biomedical research in the United States of America down to the lowest point it has been in 16 years. That is President Trump's idea of a priority--the most dramatic cut in biomedical research in the last 16 years.  I announced it when I did the ribbon-cutting speech. First, I thanked all the folks at the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Smith, and Shirley and Pat I told them if there is ever a time both political parties ought to come together and tell this President that you are just flat-out wrong, this is it. This is it because the medical research that is taking place in the National Institutes of Health is not just for those who are sick today but for those who may be diagnosed later today or tomorrow.  You know what the most frequently asked questions will be when you get that heartbreaking diagnosis? Doctor, is there anything you can do for me? Is there a medicine? Is there a procedure? Basically, is there any hope? If the NIH, or the National Institutes of Health, isn't properly funded and isn't doing its job, that answer is not always going to be a good one.  Young medical researchers don't get rich, but they love what they do. To keep them on the job doing what they should do with all of their talent and[[Page S1920]]all of their skill and all of their education, we have to promise them that we are going to continue to fund medical research in a serious way, without the peaks and valleys.  President Donald Trump does not understand that. Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, who came up with this terrible budget, doesn't understand that. To them, they are just numbers on a page. We will just cut biomedical research to the lowest level in 16 years.  A few minutes ago I had a visit from some folks from Chicago, They were with the National Multiple Sclerosis They come to see me each year. You will see them around the halls wearing their orange ties and orange scarves. They came to talk about multiple sclerosis, which for many of my close friends is a disabling disease they fight every day. It is a disease of the central nervous system. It interrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and the body. Symptoms range from numbness to tingling, to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS of any one person can't be predicted.  The good news is that we are engaged in research that can make a difference, research that gives us hope. They talked to me about Donald Trump's cuts to the National Institutes of I told them I was going to do everything in my power to restore that money so that the research continues.  Incidentally, there is another issue. It isn't just fighting the disease and doing the research. It is what is happening to the cost of the drugs that these people need to maintain their lives and that give them hope. In 2004 the average wholesale price of available MS disease-modifying therapies was $16,000. By 2013, the average price had gone up to $61,000. In 2017, the average price is up to $83,600. All of the top 10 specialty medication classes, which include MS, increased in spending, and all had increases in the price of medication. Some of these drugs have been on the market for years, and now the pharmaceutical industry is driving the costs up across the board.  When we talk about healthcare in America, it is interesting how little time we spend talking about the cost of pharmaceuticals. But how wrong we are. When the head of Blue Cross in Chicago came to see me, she said: Senator, I will bet you didn't know last year Blue Cross Blue Shield spent more money in their hospitalization plans for pharmaceuticals and medications than they spent for inpatient hospital care for those who were covered--more money on drugs than inpatient hospital care.  So what did the Affordable Care Act, which is being debated, do about the price of pharmaceuticals? Almost nothing. What does the new Republican replacement plan do about the cost of pharmaceuticals? Almost nothing. Why? Why is there this hands-off attitude when it comes to an integral part of the cost of healthcare and an integral factor in the dramatic increases in the cost of healthcare? Because pharma has friends in high places.  Watch your television sets. There are two things to watch for, if you still watch television. The first thing is to watch for all the drugs that are advertised on television. Do you know how many countries in the world allow drugs to be advertised on television? And one of them is the United  You see all these drugs being advertised that are going to allow you to be liberated, freed, and cured, and this and that and the other thing. Then, they run through all the disclaimers. This is the one I like the best: Be sure and tell your doctor if you have had a liver transplant: Oh, Doc, did I fail to mention I had a liver transplant?  That is the kind of thing they put on television. Why does a pharmaceutical company spend all that money advertising on television? They make money off of it.  Here is how. Americans walk into their doctor's office and say: I just saw this ad for this drug, and I think it is exactly what I need. Too many doctors, instead of taking 10 minutes to explain why it isn't the drug you need, take 1 minute to write out the script. So expensive drugs make it on the market and justify the advertising on television. That is one of the grim realities of what we are facing.  When it comes to the drugs and their pricing, we know what is happening. They are running up the costs of drugs on individuals, and they can't afford it any more. I just met with some of these MS patients, and one of them told me she had gone now for weeks without medication because, she said: Senator, it is $6,000 I just don't have.  Well, we can do better than that. We should do better than that as a nation. We ought to make certain that we don't get swept away with the pharmaceutical companies and their advertising. Those are the other things you are going to see on television now. They are really beautifully done ads. They are talking about all of us wanting to survive and how the pharmaceutical industries are finding, through their research, good drugs to help us survive. I don't quarrel with that premise. That is right, but it turns out many of them are spending more money on advertising than they are on research. So this is big business. It is big profits. They are trying to protect them. It is driving up the cost of healthcare. People like my friends with multiple sclerosis are wondering how this will end and whether they will be able to pay for the treatment they desperately need.  If this means anything to those who are listening to this debate, if it means something to you or your family, you need to speak up--Democrat, Republican, Independent, Trump voter or not--you need to let this administration and this Congress know that medical research is a priority to you. If it is not, hold on tight because Donald Trump's budget is about to rip the heart out of the National Institutes of  Whatever his ambition, whatever his goals, whatever his tweets, I could care less. When it comes to medical research, he is in for a fight.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, the Republicans promised, if they took a majority, the first thing they would do is get rid of He is gone. It has to be gone too. Fifty-seven times--maybe more--in the House of Representatives, they voted to abolish It didn't mean anything. He was still President then. He was going to veto whatever they passed, but they did it over and over and over. It was an article of faith, and they beat their chests and went across America saying: Get rid of  Then the dog caught the bus. They got the majority in the House and the Senate, and all of those threats and promises about ObamaCare became reality. Then something else happened. People started saying to the Republican majority: And then what? What are you going to replace it with?  Well, it turns out for 6 years they have been writing speeches about abolishing ObamaCare instead of for 6 years writing plans and bills to replace it. So they slapped together a replacement plan, sent it over--I say that because it only took them a couple of weeks. They sent it over to the Congressional Budget Office, which is kind of like the umpire here, the referee, to take a look at it.  The Congressional Budget Office gave a report on the Republican replacement plan for the Affordable Care This is what it said: Under TrumpCare--ObamaCare to TrumpCare--under TrumpCare, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance; 14 million in the first year--24 million Americans out of a nation of what, 350 million, 360 million. That is a pretty large group.  We know what happens when people lose their health insurance. They still get sick. When they get sick, they go to the emergency room when it is too bad, and the emergency room takes care of them. Then the hospital, because the person does not have health insurance, chalks up the cost of that health to charity care and passes it along to everyone else with health insurance.  Under TrumpCare, seniors, rural communities, and lower and middle-income families will see their premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar, according to the Congressional Budget Under TrumpCare, Medicare's solvency will shrink by 4 years. Medicare, you remember, is the program primarily for seniors started back in the 1960s to make sure that when you got to a point in life, age 65, you may not be working, no longer have insurance through your[[Page S1921]]employer, the government Medicare plan would cover you.  Has it worked? Ask 60 million Americans who count on it. What about the results? Since the 1960s, people are living longer. We know Medicare works, but the cost of healthcare has been going up, and we worried about its long-term solvency. It turns out the Affordable Care Act, which we passed, brought some savings to healthcare and added 10 years of solvency to  Now, the Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and it will reduce the solvency of Medicare by 4 years--4 years sooner Medicare will go insolvent. The fiscally conservative Republican Party has come up with an answer, which leads to sooner insolvency for Under TrumpCare, $880 billion in Federal Medicaid funding to States will be eliminated. What does it mean? Well, let me tell you the story of  Judy works at a motel in Southern She is in her sixties. She is a hard-working lady. There is not a lazy bone in her body. She works in the hospitality room where you get the free breakfast at the motel. She is the one who smiles and cleans off the table and makes sure you are happy. I got to know her. Judy asked me about all of this stuff going on with affordable care. I asked her: Would you mind working with my office? Let's see what we can do for you.  It turns out that Judy, as hard as she works, makes a very low income. She qualified for Medicaid, which meant health insurance that did not cost her anything because her income was so low. She couldn't believe it. For the first time in her life--for the first time in her life she had health insurance--Medicaid--providing her health insurance. It was a good thing too because just shortly afterward she was diagnosed with diabetes. Now comes the proposal from the Republicans to remove so many people across America from Where does that leave Judy? Back where she started, working hard, with diabetes, a low income, and no health insurance. Terrible things can happen to you if you have diabetes and don't have some medical home or a doctor you can count on.  That is the reality of what TrumpCare will mean to Judy in Southern One trillion dollars will be cut from programs that serve low- and middle-class families so the Republican approach can cut taxes for the wealthiest people in I am not making that up.  They are raising the premiums for working families to pay. They are cutting off seniors and others from Medicaid coverage so they can give tax breaks to the wealthiest superrich in It is going to cost us healthcare jobs across Downstate Illinois, those are good-paying jobs. The Illinois Hospital Association says we are going to lose them.  This Republican bill, TrumpCare, is bad for seniors, bad for middle-class families, bad for people with disabilities. It is not very good for kids. Half of the kids in America are born under and taken care of by It is bad for the States, bad for just about everyone who is not healthy or wealthy. Yet the House Republican leadership is intent on moving forward with TrumpCare this week.  The President came to the House Republicans yesterday and said: If you don't support me on this vote, I am coming after your districts to defeat you.  This approach is going to increase premiums for seniors in one of the most fundamental ways. We said in our bill that we voted for that you could not have a disparity in premiums more than 3 to 1. So the premiums charged to a 20-year-old and the premiums charged to a 60-year-old could be no different than a 3-to-1 margin. The Republicans changed that and made it 5 to 1.  That is why the American Association of Retired Persons opposes TrumpCare and why seniors across the country are waking up to the reality that they are in for a jolt when it comes to the premiums they have to pay.  Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, has said: ``This is not a bill I could support in its current form . . . it really misses the mark.'' As Senator Collins noted, this bill does not come close to achieving the goal of allowing low-income seniors to purchase health insurance.  Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, said:       The CBO score was, shall we say, an eye-popper. . . . Can't      sugarcoat it. . . . Doesn't look good.  Senator and Cassidy, Republican from Louisiana, said that. He went on to say:       That's not what President Trump promised. . . . That's not      what the Republicans ran on.  Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said:       I'm afraid that if [House Republicans] vote for this bill,      they're going to put the House majority at risk next year. .      . . Just from a practical standpoint, I don't think this bill      is going to reduce premiums for working . . . I      think it's going to cost coverage for many  Why do we want to rush this process? It took us more than 2 years to write a bill, and it is still a bill that needs more work. I voted for it. To think that they can replace it in a matter of weeks, with this slap-dash approach, is not fair to It is not fair to people who count on health insurance for peace of mind and coverage when they desperately need it.  I see my friend on the floor. I am going to close. I released a report today, and it is one I am going to share across the board in Illinois before our delegation votes this week. This bill in Illinois means that 311,000 people I represent would lose their private health insurance. By 2020, the average enrollee in Illinois would see their health insurance costs increase by over $3,000--by 2026, almost $5,000.  The impact is particularly severe for Illinoisans ages 55 to 64. They would see their costs of premiums increase by over 50 percent. Illinois hospitals, they are against it too. They know that a lot of downstate hospitals and inner-city hospitals can't survive this Republican replacement plan.  I will close with a letter from Christine McTaggart of Watseka, Here is what she said to me: ``I wake up every day since the election fearing that a complete repeal will happen and for me that translates into a death sentence.''  Christine was originally diagnosed with stage IIIb inflammatory breast cancer in September of 2012. Given this type of aggressive cancer, her prognosis was poor. She went through 16 cycles--16--of chemotherapy, a bilateral mastectomy, 33 radiation treatments, failed reconstruction and chronic tissue issues, and thyroid cancer as well.  After all of that, in 2014, she learned her breast cancer was back. This time in her bones, stage In her letter to me, Christine McTaggart of Watseka wrote:       When the Affordable Care Act became law, I had no idea my      life would come to depend on policies such as pre-existing      conditions not excluding you from coverage . . . and lifetime      maximums being eliminated. If ACA were repealed, I would no      longer have coverage as my chronic ongoing treatment has far      exceeded the old lifetime maximums. . . . I would have to      choose between bankruptcy for treatments I cannot afford and      rolling the dice, waiting for death.  She ends with this:       I thank you for your tireless advocacy on this issue. . . .      My life literally depends on it.

I have often said that, as an American, I can go all around the world, but I will never get greeted with more love and friendship than I will in People there truly love Americans and all things  The best way to help Kosovo is through continued, strong support, as the United States has done for many years. But too many impediments stand in the way, many of them coming from outside of Kosovo's borders.  For example, Kosovo wants what most countries across the region want, to become part of a secure and integrated Europe, membership in the European Union and in Yet, just five European holdouts stand in the way of this progress for  When it comes to United Nations membership, Kosovo's way forward is blocked by Serbia and its ally, In fact, Serbia seeks to block Kosovo at almost every turn, and lately has been escalating tensions.  Both Serbia and Kosovo want to go to the European Union, and I support both of them getting into the European But one of those countries shouldn't try to block another one, and Serbia has repeatedly tried to make it difficult for Kosovo to get into the EU and to get other things as well.  Serbia recently sent into Kosovo's north a propaganda train emblazoned with the words, Serbia is Kosovo, written in 21 languages to foment discord among Kosovo's small Serbian population. It pushed the building of a wall in Metrovica, a tiny city straddling the cleavages of Kosovo's interethnic divide. While that wall has now come down, the scars remain.  Serbia has continued to deny justice to the loved ones of hundreds of victims of its campaign of ethnic cleansing, including three American citizens, the Bytyqi brothers. And there are all kinds of insults, from a train and other things, giving propaganda against Kosovo by Serbia pushed to the Serbian-Kosovo border that helps to escalate tensions rather than bring them down.  As a result of a Serbian INTERPOL arrest warrant, French authorities recently detained former Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who has already been acquitted twice by an international tribunal.  We in the United States have this wonderful thing of no double jeopardy. If you go to trial and you are acquitted, you cannot be tried on the same thing again. That isn't true of many countries.  So Ramush Haradinaj was accused of war crimes, went to The Hague, spent many weeks and months there, was acquitted, and then was recharged again, and had to go back to The Hague to have another trial on which he was again acquitted. Now, Serbia has manipulated INTERPOL to try to get a third trial on essentially the same matter for Ramush Haradinaj again. This, to me, is unconscionable and shows tremendous bad faith on the part of the Serbian  Serbia also fought Kosovo's membership in UNESCO, ultimately a self-defeating act, because among Kosovo's most cherished historical cultural institutions are its 13th century Serbian Orthodox churches. Kosovo did not get into It failed by three votes, and again the Serbian interruption played a major role in preventing them from getting into The United States fought to have Kosovo into UNESCO, but ultimately lost by three votes.  Kosovo and Serbia have sat down across the negotiating table in talks facilitated by the European Those talks showed some progress that resulted in an agreement calling for normalization. I even nominated, at that time, the Prime Ministers of Kosovo and Serbia, along with the EU's former policy head, Baroness Catherine Ashton, for the Nobel Peace  Unfortunately, today, I question these successes. What kind of normalization involves stoking tensions among a neighbor's minority population and standing in the way of international integration? That is what Serbia is doing to Kosovo, and it should be stopped.  In terms of Ramush Haradinaj, trying to try him again, I don't know why the Government of Serbia seems intent on rekindling 20- and 30-year-old Balkan wars. They were terrible things that happened in war and terrible things that happened on both sides, but the man was found innocent twice. This is nothing more than bad faith on the part of the Serbian Government and harassment.  It might come as a surprise to you, Mr.Speaker, but 9 years on, as a free and independent country, Kosovo still has no army. That is right. A sovereign nation-state without an army. It has a small, lightly armed security force, but nothing resembling the large Russian-equipped Serbian military just next door.  Earlier this month, Kosovo took a small step toward establishing its army. Legislation was submitted to parliament. Like the legislative process here in the United States, the introduction of a bill is only the opening note on a much larger and longer sheet of music, a score which involves consultation with regional partners, the international community, domestic minorities, and  We all know how this process works. There is back and forth, there is give and take. Supporters and opponents alike are welcome into the arena and all positions are heard. The process accounts for everybody's concerns in some way or another.  So what is in this proposal? What would Kosovo's army look like? It would be multiethnic, just as the Kosovo security force and the Kosovo police are now. It would partner with Western countries and hopefully NATO in pursuit of greater regional and international stability. It would be defensive and nonthreatening to Kosovo's neighbors. Mr.Speaker, it would be exactly what the United States wants to see in a partner.  Yet, while Kosovo slowly moves to set up its small defensive force, Serbia is beefing up its military with full Russian backing. It is taking deliveries of T-72 tanks, MiG-29 fighters, and S-300 antiaircraft missile systems, courtesy of Moscow and Vladimir  So I am a little confused, Mr.Kosovo, a country we support and which supports us, wants what every other country in the world has: a basic army in which its citizens can serve their nation, and probably serve alongside our own military if given the chance.  What do we do? We offer rebukes and diplomatic threats, and we make it clear that we don't support Kosovo having an army at this time. That is absolutely absurd and is a position that we ought to change, and change quickly. Yet Russian weapons and materiel are pouring into Serbia, courtesy of Vladimir Putin; and as far as I can tell, the United States has stood in silence.  Regardless, Mr.Speaker, America's relation with Kosovo is strong and the future is bright. We need to stay on that course. Kosovo is a young country. I have been there many, many times. It is not even 10 years old.  We know better than anyone that building a democracy is hard work. Sometimes you will face setbacks. Sometimes you need a helping hand. That is why American support is more important than ever. That is why the United States should work to deepen our ties, enrich our mutual understanding, and continue to bring stability to the entire Balkan region. That is the way to a more prosperous, democratic, and multiethnic Kosovo; and that is the way for the United States to see a Balkan region free, at peace, and part of the whole of  Meanwhile, France should send Ramush Haradinaj home. Enough is enough already. We cannot stand for any more of this nonsense.  The United States should stand by Kosovo is a free and independent country. For many years, they were fed all kinds of lies about the United States during the old Communist regime in the fifties, sixties, and seventies. You know what? The people of Kosovo didn't believe a word of it.  So I would say to my colleagues and to my friends and to all of our American citizens: When you visit Kosovo, you will know and you will be proud to be an American because people come up to you in the street and want to touch you, want to talk to you, want to do everything and be everything Those are the kinds of friends that we need.  America does much for many, many people around the world, many, many[[Page H2345]]nations, and sometimes we feel it is not appreciated--but not in Everything the United States has helped that country with is appreciated from everyone, from the Prime Minister to the President, to people in government, to the average people in the street.  I very often have people coming up to me in the street wanting to talk to me. They recognize me. They say: Thank you. Thank you to America for standing by us in our independence. Thank you to America for being strong and keeping us strong.  So those are the kinds of friends I want to have. Those are the kind of people I want to have.  So I would say to the people of Kosovo and the Government of Kosovo: The United States stands by you and always will stand by you.  I would say to the Government of Serbia: We support the aspirations of the Serbian people to enter the European Union, but Serbia ought to stop doing what it is doing to block Serbia ought to stop its belligerent moves against  Both countries should go into the European Union--and eventually, NATO--and each one should not stop each other. They should help each other.                              Health Care  ",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2343.txt,344,THE IMPACT OF TRUMPCARE,2017.0,22.0,March
1355,topic-id,1715,"Mr.Speaker, I want to spend the next couple of moments talking about a subject that is very near and dear to everyone's heart, and that is health care. I want to do it because tomorrow we have a big healthcare vote here in the Congress, and I think it is very important that we all very clearly lay out what we really feel should happen.  Last week, as part of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was up for about 28 hours in a row marking up a bill that was done all night long. At the time when we marked it up, we thought it was a bit silly because the bill hadn't been scored by the Congressional Budget Office, so we had no idea what it cost. It was like buying a pig in a poke. How could you decide whether something is good or not when you don't even know what the cost is? Since we obviously don't have unlimited funds, if something costs more money, we have to pull it out of someplace else.                              {time}  1800  So we voted on a bill. Unfortunately, it was a strict party-line vote, and the bill passed. Shortly thereafter, a few days later, the Congressional Budget Office scored it; and I think it was, frankly, from my vantage point, a disaster for the bill.  Now, what I think that this Congress should be doing is I think that we should make tweaks and fix the Affordable Care Act, or There are many, many good things in ObamaCare, in the healthcare bill, in the healthcare act, that has now been here for many, many years. But there are also some problems with it.  You know, every major bill that has been passed by this Congress and signed into law needed some tweaks, needed some changes, because you pass a law with good intention, but sometimes it doesn't work out exactly as you wanted it to work out. So you need to change things, you need to make improvements. When you see what is working, what is not working, that is what you do.  That is what this Congress should do with We should say where premiums are going up or where certain jurisdictions only have one insurance company and, therefore, there is no competition, we can figure out ways to fix it. We can figure out ways to tweak it. That is what the American people would want us to do. The American people would want us to work together and would want us to work in a bipartisan fashion to try to fix what was wrong with  Now, there are many wonderful things about First of all, everyone knows it eliminated the so-called preexisting condition problem, where before, when you changed jobs and you went to a new insurance company, the insurance company said, ``Sorry, you have had cancer for 3 years and you have been treated; we are not going to treat you for cancer because it is a preexisting condition,'' or a heart attack or whatever it is. That was basically unconscionable.  And millions of people couldn't get help because they changed a job and, therefore, changed a healthcare plan. That was changed in And that was a very, very important thing because an insurance company can now no longer deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition.  Also, as everybody knows, children up to 26 years old can now stay and be insured under their parents' insurance plans. That was a very good plus of ObamaCare, or of the Affordable Care  And there were other very, very important, good things. We had more people being covered than ever before. People who had never had health coverage got it now because of the Affordable Care  So what do we see now? We see, instead of trying to put it together in a bipartisan fashion, trying to fix it, we have this bill which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee and passed the Ways and Means Committee and supposedly is going to be on the floor tomorrow if they can round up the votes. They are having difficulty rounding up the votes.  And what do we see when we look at this new bill that they are asking us to vote for? Let me tell you what we see.  If this bill would ever come into law, we would have much less coverage than ever before. Many people would lose their healthcare coverage, and we would have a smaller population actually being covered for health care.  We call it TrumpCare, and TrumpCare will take away health care from 24 million hardworking That is not acceptable.  Why shouldn't we be working together to improve ObamaCare? Why do we need a new plan that will insure 24 million less people than we insure now? It is bizarre. It makes no sense whatsoever.  We also feel, when we analyze it--and this is, again, what the Congressional Budget Office tells us--there are higher costs. TrumpCare forces families to pay increased out-of-pocket costs and higher deductibles.  So what does that all mean?  It means you pay more and you get less. That is a pretty bad deal. I don't think anybody wants that deal. I think Democrats and Republicans, alike, don't want that deal. I think Americans don't want that deal. We want it the opposite way. We would like to pay less and get coverage. But what TrumpCare does to the Affordable Care Act, you pay more and you get less.  If that weren't bad enough, an analysis of it finds that there is a crushing age tax. TrumpCare forces Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 to pay premiums which are five times higher than what others pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Talk about discrimination.  If you are a 50-year-old that is in good health, why should you have to pay five times more premium than what others pay for health coverage? Doesn't sound like a very good idea to me.  And then you say: How do they get the money to pay for whatever? Well, it steals from Medicaid and TrumpCare ransacks the Medicaid funds that allow seniors to get the long-term care they need and shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. Again, pretty bad deal for me.  And you say: Well, who benefits from this? If this is something that people are going to have to pay more and get less coverage, it is discriminatory for people ages 50 to 64. It hurts middle class people making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year, hurts them and hurts seniors, knocks seniors out. Well, who does it help?  Well, guess what? TrumpCare ransacks the Medicaid funds that allow seniors to get the long-term care they need. I said that before. But what does it do? It lowers tax cuts for the rich. So the rich get more tax cuts--I am sorry. It doesn't lower it. It gives the rich more tax cuts.  So it is really kind of nice, I suppose, when you have a billionaire President, it is nice to help the rich--but not at the expense of middle class  So when you look at this plan, it is a pretty bad plan for the middle class, pretty bad. So if you didn't like ObamaCare, you are going to dislike TrumpCare even more.  If it is passed, once it is passed, we are going to see, again, premiums rise, millions of people thrown out of insurance, and less coverage, but the very wealthy will get a nice, juicy tax break.[[Page H2346]]  So, you know who used to steal from the rich and give to the poor? This is stealing from the poor and giving to the rich. It is really disgraceful.  So I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Let's defeat TrumpCare because it doesn't help anybody, and let's put our heads together. We have enough talent in this place on both sides of the aisle, and that is what the American people want us to do. They want us to put our heads together. They want us to work together and come up with a plan that aids the largest amount of people at the lowest possible cost.  It won't be easy. It will be very difficult. But we should do it together, not jam TrumpCare down our throat, not tell people about false promises when you know people are going to be thrown off.  If you say: Well, you know what? It is going to be cheaper. Well, it is cheaper if you throw off all the sick people and you don't give them insurance, and you throw off all the seniors and you don't help them. Well, of course it is cheaper because all the people that are sick and really need the help won't get it. And after all, what is insurance about? Insurance is there just in case you get sick.  So I am very chagrined about this new bill. I hope it gets defeated tomorrow. I hope that we then go back to the drawing board and come up with a program that will help the American people, not a program that helps Democrats or a program that helps Republicans, but a program that helps Americans, because we are all in this together.  The bill proposed by my Republican colleagues called TrumpCare is not a bill for Americans that will aid them with help when they get sick. As Americans, I do believe that health care should be a right, not a luxury. I believe that the richest country that the world has ever known can give its citizens health care. I believe in the single-payer health care.  But even if it is not single-payer, let's take the original Affordable Care Act, keep what is good, enhance what is good and what needs to be corrected and changed. Let's do it. That is what the American people want. That is what the American people demand, and we should do nothing less.  This bill ought to be defeated tomorrow. Let's go back to the drawing board and come up with something we can be proud of.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2343.txt,344,THE IMPACT OF TRUMPCARE,2017.0,22.0,March

Just yesterday, he joined the Republican and Democratic Senators from Colorado in introducing Judge Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Judge Gorsuch graduated with honors from Columbia University and then Harvard Law He later earned a doctorate in legal philosophy from the University of Prior to becoming a judge, Neil Gorsuch was Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, worked as a litigator in private practice, and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Moreover, earlier this month, the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Gorsuch ``well qualified,'' its highest rating.  One of my constituents who went to high school with Judge Gorsuch took the time to send me a note in support of his character, calling him ``the most reasonable, smart, principled, kind, and humble person I know.'' Even at a young age, he made a positive impression on his colleagues--something he has continued to do today.  During the course of Judge Gorsuch's 10-year judicial career, his opinions have reflected not only his outstanding legal acumen but also his respect for the Constitution and his Scalia-like ability to explain his decisions.  Judge Gorsuch was nominated to his current position on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by President George Bush in 2006. As a testament to Judge Gorsuch's exceptional credentials, the Senate confirmed him by unanimous voice vote. Several current Members of the Senate from both parties, including Minority Leader Schumer, supported Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. The people spoke last November, and our new President has put forward a well-respected nominee whom the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. It is time for Washington to work together as our constituents expect us to do, to help protect and defend our coequal branches of government and the rule of law. If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch's dedication to interpreting the text of the Constitution and statutes as they are written rather than attempting to legislate from the bench will help to do just that.  As Judge Gorsuch himself has stated in one of his opinions: ``A judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.''  I have had the great honor of meeting with Judge Gorsuch to learn more about his judicial philosophy, and over the next few days, the American people will also get to learn more about Judge Gorsuch through his confirmation hearing. I am confident they will also determine he is qualified to serve on our Nation's highest I look forward to moving ahead to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with this eminently qualified nominee, and I thank him for his willingness to serve his country in this critically important role.

1275,topic-id,518,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness  Mr.Speaker, the concept of association health plans, AHPs, is nothing new. Versions of this bill have been around for many years. They don't work.  Currently, AHPs are regulated by the States, ensuring the ability to protect consumers. H.1101, however, will yank association health plans from the realm of State oversight by federally certifying them and holding them to few, if any, regulatory requirements. This would strip the States of the ability and fidelity to regulate beneficiary protections that exist to protect their citizens.  Federally certifying AHPs will allow selective choice of which benefits are provided and which persons can enroll. This is a complete and total disservice to all individuals and citizens in a State's health insurance market. Association health plans currently exist and operate in New York State, serving many thousands of beneficiaries and avail New Yorkers' protections, benefits guarantees, and avenues for appeal through the Department of Financial  This bill does nothing to offer guaranteed affirmative coverage. It would permit preexisting conditions as a legitimate reason to exclude individuals. It has no minimum threshold for anything resembling essential health benefits, and it fails to offer a requirement for the actuarial value of the insurance product to cover total health costs.  What then remains is not a health plan. In fact, what remains is strikingly similar to what the American Health Care Act purports to offer millions of Americans: less coverage for those enrolled and more expense for those who are too sick, too old, and too poor to be approached by an  AHPs would lead to higher costs for seniors and individuals who are sicker and will dilute the risk pool of entire States, leading to higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. Where the American Health Care Act will unilaterally hurt all Americans, H.1101 would accomplish the same harm directed at the sickest and most underserved in a more prejudicial manner.  Mr.Speaker, I offered an amendment to this bill, which was germane, yet not made in order. My amendment would have protected the rights of the States to regulate association health plans, to include regulation of benefits, consumer protections, and rating restrictions. The goal of my amendment was to ensure that all States and their constituents have the same security and protections that my constituents have benefited from over the past 7 years: consumer protections against surprise billing and adverse selection, provider protection for prompt claim payment and preauthorization, protection for local and regional insurers so that large national insurance companies cannot cherry-pick the good risk.  I certainly believe and would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support program integrity and protecting our constituents, which is what my amendment would have made clear.  Lastly, I would like to be clear that I am supportive of increasing access to health care that is comprehensive and affordable for all The bill before us does not do that. The American Health Care Act certainly does not do that.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly oppose this rolling back of health care.

372,topic-id,1902,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I recently joined the Committee on Veterans' Affairs because of its bipartisan history of working together to improve care for our veterans. I stand ready to work with the committee--in particular, with Chairman Roe--and with every Member of this House to improve and work on the important issues that affect our veterans every day. However, I cannot support this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose it.  As this House knows all too well, there is a veterans suicide crisis in this country, a crisis that is enabled by the easy access to firearms. Just last week, the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, David Shulkin, told the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs that the issue of veteran suicide is one of his highest priorities, and it needs to be a priority of this House as well.  Today, on this day that we have this debate, 20 brave men and women who have worn the uniform in service of this country will take their lives in suicide, and the vast majority of them will use a gun.  As folks all over the country who have helped veterans know, the means matter. Research has shown that more than 85 percent of suicide attempts with a firearm are ultimately fatal compared with just 5 percent for all other means. That is why addressing the public health crisis in the veteran community demands a thoughtful and comprehensive approach: to ensure that veterans in crisis do not have easy access to guns and that they get the care that they need and deserve.  And yet, today, this House is voting on legislation that completely ignores the crisis that many of our most vulnerable veterans are facing. Unfortunately, this bill was rushed to the floor with no consideration in committee, collaboration, or even time for all of us to understand its full implications. The majority scheduled H.1181 for a vote in committee last week with the bare minimum notice required, even having to move the start time of the markup to comply with the 48-hour notice requirement.  During last week's committee markup, I raised the concern shared by many who work closely on this issue that H.1181 would end up being applied retroactively. The result of this bill being applied retroactively would mean that, if it should pass, more than 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm would be able to[[Page H2104]]pass a background check and buy a gun.  While the chairman expressed his sincere intent and desire that this legislation not be applied retroactively, it is fair to say that reasonable people disagree on how this bill would be implemented. This honest disagreement, alone, illustrates exactly why this House should be taking its time on a bill that could have such a profound impact on our Nation's veterans.  The fact of the matter is that, should H.1181 be signed into law, it would need to be read together with the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which requires--requires--Federal agencies to update the records they have previously shared with NICS, meaning, should this bill pass, the VA would be required to remove the 170,000 records they have previously shared with NICS since none of those were approved by a court, nor did they meet the new standard established by this bill.  Now, with respect to the text of the bill itself, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, contrary to its name, would create an end run around the firearms mental health prohibitor that we have attempted to refine and improve since Congress passed the Brady Act nearly 20 years ago and the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendment Act of 2007.  Put simply, this bill would make it easier, not harder, for those veterans in crisis to get access to a firearm by establishing a new judicial requirement that is far higher than any other agency's or department's implementation of the firearms mental health prohibitor, and, quite frankly, would be impractical, if not impossible, for the VA to actually use. The VA is already strapped for resources, and it is unclear if it has the legal standing to initiate a legal proceeding such as that suggested in the bill.  As Members of this House know very well, there has been a fierce debate in this country over the meaning and extent of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. But the question before this House today is not whether an American has a right to own a firearm. The Supreme Court has been very clear on this issue, and the controlling law has been settled. However, constitutional rights are not absolute. As the late Justice Scalia wrote in the controlling Supreme Court Heller decision on the Second Amendment, ``the Second Amendment is not unlimited.''  The question before this House is whether we are going to summarily overturn the VA's efforts over the last 20 years to help prevent veteran suicide and protect veterans' families by reporting the names of veterans with serious mental health issues to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as  Supporters of this legislation argue that the current process used by the VA to share mental health records with NICS is overinclusive and must be thrown out and replaced with a process that ensures veterans' due process rights.  I agree that the current process is overinclusive, and I agree that we must do more to ensure veterans have sufficient notice, an opportunity to be heard, and a meaningful opportunity to appeal any decision that may impact their constitutional rights; and I stand ready to work with my colleagues on the committee and in this House to more specifically tailor the application of the firearms background checks law as it applies to veterans, both prospectively and retroactively.                              {time}  1430  But a wholesale elimination of the VA's long-established practice to help keep firearms out of the hands of veterans who are at serious risk of harming themselves or others is dangerous and misguided.  To be clear, of the 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm, as of 2015, almost 20,000 of them were diagnosed with schizophrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and over 5,000 with Alzheimer's. For a veteran suffering with a significant mental health condition like one of these, access to a firearm is a serious matter.  Moreover, just 3 months ago, this Congress passed bipartisan legislation that codified a process for how the VA can make a determination of the mental capacity of a veteran before that information is sent to The 21st Century Cures Act, which passed this House 3 months ago by a vote of 392-26, required a veteran to be provided notice of a proposed financial competency determination and given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and be represented at a hearing.  H.1181 seeks to undo this carefully crafted compromise before we even have a chance to study the impacts of the 21st Century Cures Act or the VA's existing practices.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 12 veterans, including retired Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, whose leadership and support for our military and veterans community is unquestioned and who believe that this bill could put mentally ill veterans in harm's way by giving them easy access to firearms.

Instead of passing this      irresponsible and dangerous legislation, Congress should      instead do more to guarantee that all veterans have access to      world-class medical and counseling services. We urge you to      oppose this bill.       Our nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran      suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an      average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of      whom do so by using a firearm. We know that non-deployed      veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared      to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans      are at a 41 percent higher risk. Firearms are the most lethal      means when it comes to suicide, resulting in death nine out      of ten times. When vulnerable veterans have access to      firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to      family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies      is felt in communities across our nation.       Last week, we were pleased to hear Secretary of Veterans      Affairs (VA) David Shulkin announce his intent to provide      urgent mental health care services to veterans with other-     than-honorable discharges. This is a step in the right      direction. Over 22,000 soldiers in the Army alone have      received these bad paper discharges since 2009 due to mental      health conditions, and they are among the ones who most need      access to comprehensive mental health services.       But they are not the only ones. In 2008, President Bush      signed a law requiring all federal agencies to submit the      names of individuals who are legally prohibited from      possessing guns to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS). Since then, the VA has submitted over      174,000 names of servicemen and women who require a fiduciary      to manage their benefits and have been determined through      clear and convincing evidence to meet the federal standard      for gun prohibition. Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals      that suffer from schizophrenia and another 15,000 have severe            For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be      fatal. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would put at      risk the safety of these veterans and our communities by      changing the standard for gun prohibition, so the VA's      determinations would no longer stop a veteran from obtaining      a gun. Instead, the names of veterans already in the      background check system would be erased, putting them at much      greater risk of self-harm. This would be irresponsible,      dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to      care, not weapons.       Just last year, Congress worked to ensure that all veterans      have appropriate due process protections in place through the      21st Century Cures This codified existing practice and      guaranteed that individuals who disagree with their final      adjudication have the ability to appeal this determination.       We appreciate your service to your country in the United      States Congress, and look forward to working with you to      support and protect our men and women in uniform and their      communities. In doing so, we urge you to oppose the Veterans      2nd Amendment Protection Thank you for your      consideration.

Everytown for Gun Safety,                                      New York, NY, March 7, 2017.     Re Reject H.1181, which would put U.veterans in danger.

In the midst of a suicide epidemic among our veterans,      this bill would discard hundreds of thousands of mental      health records from the background check system and enable      Veterans Affairs beneficiaries suffering from severe mental      illness to buy firearms.       The stakes could not be higher. Twenty U.veterans take      their lives each day--a suicide rate more than 20 percent      higher than among the civilian population. Two in three of      those suicides are carried out with firearms. While suicide      in the general population has decreased since the turn of the      century, suicide among veterans has not.       H.1181 would repeal the law that blocks VA beneficiaries      from possessing or purchasing firearms if they have been      found mentally incompetent, after receiving due process and      the right to a formal hearing. According to the VA, more than      170,000 prohibiting records for these beneficiaries are      already in the background check system. Under this      legislation, those records would no longer lead to a failed      background check--and would be removed from the system      entirely. H.1181 would roll back the law that prohibits      people with a VA incompetency finding from purchasing      firearms--even though many of these beneficiaries suffer from      schizophrenia or severe long-term post traumatic stress      disorder.       The current process works, and it provides veterans with      due process. To make an incompetency finding, VA officials      must have clear and convincing evidence. The beneficiary has      an opportunity to request a formal hearing and may appeal an      adverse decision to a federal judge. Indeed, the 21st Century      Cures Act, passed in 2016 by the Republican Congress and      signed into law by President Obama, provides new comfort at      the statutory level that beneficiaries can present evidence      from a mental health professional and be represented by      counsel at incompetency hearings.       When it comes to suicide, means matter. When suicide is      attempted with a firearm, the chances that a person will      actually end his or her life are radically increased. Because      firearms are uniquely lethal, up to 90 percent of suicide      attempts with guns result in death. In addition, suicide is      often an impulsive act and 90 percent of people who attempt      and fail to kill themselves do not end up dying from suicide.      Preventing firearm access in these moments of crisis can be      the difference between a long life and a tragedy.       I urge you to protect our service members and veterans by      rejecting H.1181.

These individuals who suffer      from serious mental illnesses like dementia, schizophrenia,      and severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be able      to access firearms more easily. With veteran suicide rate      increasing by 32.2% from 2001 to 2014, Congress should be      closing the background check loopholes rather than weakening      our background check system.

389,topic-id,448,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I note that the chairman noted the support of some of the veteran service organizations, and I think it is noteworthy that the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, has in the past supported this bill. They do not support it this year. They do not because they are so concerned about the crisis we are facing, particularly in their members--those who have come back from the wars in the last 10 or 20 years. They are concerned about that veteran suicide crisis that we are facing and are concerned that this bill might make that worse.  We have heard repeatedly assertions that this would be the only category, that veterans alone would be deprived without adjudication. That is not true. In fact, the law for the firearms prohibitor covers many categories of people who do not have any legal determination:       Anyone who is an unlawful user or addicted to a controlled      substance is prohibited, does not require any adjudication.  The NICS has 23,000 people who are prohibited under the controlled substance addiction and use category. Anyone adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to a mental institution, there are 4.2 million people. There are a wide variety of people who are in that category, again, many without court orders. Those were aliens, those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, that is 10,000 individuals. So it is not unique to veterans. There are other categories as well.  But I really think the bottom line is this: we have heard a great deal of agreement that we care about our veterans, we want to prevent military suicides, and we know that for some of these veterans, it would be dangerous for them to have a firearm. That is precisely why this committee should have had a hearing, so we would have had the opportunity to systematically address these issues and find a better way forward that recognizes that some veterans who need a fiduciary also should not have firearms, and some who need a fiduciary, there is no concern there. But we have been deprived of that opportunity in committee, to do the work we should be doing in committee, to work together in a bipartisan way to fashion a better way forward.  This is way too far. It is an overreaction to a process that should be fixed, and we are committed to do that. But the alternative we are presented with today will wholesale uproot the 20-year process of the Veterans Administration that would be dangerous and wrong, and we remain committed to working together in committee.

Mr.Speaker, I note that 18 of the 26 Members of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee did not serve during a time when there has been a hearing on this bill--18 of us, and that includes me. The evidence that the chairman was referencing from 2015 was from a hearing that never occurred, so there was never an opportunity to discuss that evidence. Again, I think this underscores the extent to which we really do need a hearing.  I have to say, since 2012, when the Newtown shootings occurred in my district, the public feels differently about this now, and our veterans numbers have been going up and up. So I think it is high time for us to have a hearing. It has been 5 years. We should be looking at this process.  The last point I will note: there has been much made of the Constitution today and how outrageous it is. In 20 years since this process has been in place in the VA, I note that no one has ever challenged this successfully in court as a violation of constitutional due process, and I know the love our veterans have for the Constitution, as we do in this That tells me that many families, for example, actually are relying on this.  So, again, I pledge to the chairman we should be working together in committee to get this process right.

This rule fails to identify which beneficiaries have a mental illness that make them a danger, instead instituting a blanket ban on anyone who needs help managing their benefits, and it discourages veterans who need help from seeking help.  The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act will prohibit the VA from considering a beneficiary just because they are assisted by a fiduciary as mentally defective without due process. Just because you have trouble managing your finances doesn't mean you are dangerously mentally ill. This discourages veterans who may need help from seeking help.

In 1997, Judge Breyer was nominated by President Clinton to a seat on the U.District Court for the Northern District of Judge Breyer was confirmed by the U.Senate that same year by voice vote.  On the bench, Judge Breyer has served with distinction. He has done the hard work of sentencing individuals to prison terms. He has also focused on sentencing issues outside the courtroom, testifying before the Sentencing Commission in 2009 and serving as chair of a Ninth Circuit Committee evaluating the impact of the Supreme Court's decisions in Blakely v.

92,topic-id,426,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to start by saying that, for the last 25 years, I practiced dentistry in Georgia's Third District and I experienced a healthcare system that was broken and in desperate need of repair to reduce costs and increase access to care.  After the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, I saw my patients, my friends, my neighbors forced away from doctors who had treated them for their entire lives. Instead of decreasing costs, patients saw their costs skyrocket and their access to care limited.  As a medical practitioner, I want what is best for my patients. Those are the people that I am fighting for: my neighbors and constituents who saw their premiums skyrocket, their quality and access to care limited or determined by a government bureaucrat. I committed to them that I would repeal ObamaCare and undo the damage that it has done to our healthcare system.  The legislation we are currently considering in the House, the American Health Care Act, is just the beginning of keeping that promise.  This is not a choice between a broken healthcare system that existed before It is a new direction that reflects an understanding of what works and what does not work. The legislation will enact many reforms that directly impact Americans by lowering costs and improving access to care.  Tonight, my colleagues and I are going to share with you in great detail what that legislation does. We have all been very open in our opposition to the Affordable Care Act, but it is also important that we share with our constituents what we stand for and what we are working to do to reform this broken system.  We stand for patient-centered health care that meets the needs of our constituents in an affordable way. We stand for market-driven healthcare solutions and an industry that prioritizes personal freedom over government mandates. We stand for the biggest entitlement reform in a generation to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable populations.

One that he talked about was the process here, that this is just the beginning of a long journey that we must take to rebuild our American healthcare system.  This has been an open legislative process. More than 8 months ago, even before I was a Member of this great House, the Republican caucus here released A Better Way agenda, which detailed a consensus vision for patient-centered healthcare reform. Our bill, the American Health Care Act, is built on that framework.  These ideas are not new. They are not unvetted. They are a product of many conversations, debates, and work. Unlike the drafting of ObamaCare, we want our constituents to know what is in this legislation before we pass it. That is why every American can go to readthebill.gop and look at this legislation for themselves. In fact, I encourage anyone who hasn't taken time to look at this legislation yet to go to readthebill.gop and read more about the American Health Care  At no point in this process have I felt closed out of it. As a matter of fact, as a freshman, I can tell you that I have had my voice heard, I have been asked for input, and I have seen many of the ideas that I have spoken about be included in this bill.  This bill has not been crafted behind closed doors. It has not been kept in the shadows. As a matter of fact, it has been just the opposite. As a freshman Member sitting in conference, leadership has been very straightforward about the intentions of the bill, the basic framework of the bill, and I am excited to see that, as this process has gone through regular order, we have seen many amendments added to it, and we are continuing that process.  Regular order means that we have done something very unique here. We haven't just taken a bill and passed it and then get to read what is in it. We have taken a bill, and we have taken it through the committee process. Our colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and Committee on[[Page H2075]]Ways and Means have worked through some many long nights debating amendments in an open process.  Tomorrow the House Committee on the Budget will take up this business. I am a member on that committee, and I am looking forward to the process of going through the debate tomorrow. I am sure that it will be long, and I am sure many amendments will be debated; but I am excited about the opportunity that we have to move a piece of legislation forward, make it better, make it more conservative, but, most importantly, make sure that Americans have great health care, access to that health care at an affordable price.

96,topic-id,314,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.Bacon) for his remarks.  He touched on something that is very important, and that is the driving down of cost and how this is accomplished. Truly, when the patient is in control of their health care, they are also in control of the cost. We are fighting for consumer choice in a patient-driven healthcare system. We understand, and I certainly understand, that patients and doctors need to be at the center of the healthcare conversation, not bureaucrats and not insurance clerks.  Our plan includes provisions to expand choice and give consumers more control over their healthcare dollars. The American Health Care Act significantly increases the amount individuals and families can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year, allowing them to save more to pay for future healthcare expenses and the flexibility to use their healthcare dollars as they choose.  It also allows them to spend those healthcare dollars where they think that it will best benefit their families. It allows them to have the most intimate conversations with their healthcare providers and make sure that they are making the right decisions and using their dollars wisely. If the first question always is ``does my insurance company pay for it?'' you are always going to get the most expensive answer. However, if the patient has contributed to this process, the patient then will be able to make some informed decisions through good conversations with their doctors, and they can better manage their own health care.  We are fighting for a system that puts patients first and allows Georgians in the Third District and all across this Nation to make their own healthcare decisions. That starts with a conversation between the doctor and the patient.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.Rutherford).

98,topic-id,809,"Mr.Speaker, my colleague from Florida touched on something that is very important, and that is fairness in the marketplace. I can tell you, as a small-business owner, I did not receive the same favorable tax treatment as the major corporations did under the Affordable Care Once this bill took effect, I had to move into the individual market. I had to begin buying health insurance with post-tax dollars, and I was unable to afford the coverage not only for my family, but for the people that I had the pleasure of working with every single day in my business.  What Mr.Rutherford talked about is leveling the playing field, and that is something that we need to do. It will increase innovation. It increases jobs. It increases success. It is so frustrating for Americans as they begin to build their small businesses and they begin to grow, and every single time that they take a step forward, the government takes more and more out of their pocket. Now we have a healthcare system that continues to rob them of their success.  Make no mistake; the healthcare system that we had prior to the Affordable Care Act was certainly not successful and not headed in the right way, but we have made it worse with this. What we have done is we have not only disenfranchised many small businesses and people who are growing their businesses and finding success, but we have also, quite candidly, done a poor job of maintaining our safety net. What we are fighting for is to increase affordable health care for all Americans, and this has meant listening to a lot of the feedback from our families and our constituents back home.  What we need to recognize is that, under our plan, dependents can continue to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26 and they are fully on their feet, if that is the right thing for their families to do. Americans told us that they like this flexibility, and we have listened to them.  Our plan will also ensure that those who have preexisting conditions can't be charged more for the health coverage they need. It also includes incentives, not mandates, to encourage Americans to have continuous coverage. This is good for the marketplace, and it will keep costs down for all Our portable tax credits will also increase access to coverage by assisting lower income individuals to purchase the health insurance that they need.  What is more, the American Health Care Act includes a Patient and State Stability Fund to help States expand the number of vulnerable patients who have access to health care. We know that States know how to best meet the unique needs of their citizens, and this is going to give them the flexibility to do that. Therefore, as these funds are flexible, they allow things like cutting out-of-pocket expenses for patients, promoting access to preventive services, or increasing available options in the marketplace--all things that are needed.                              {time}  2030  These reforms will help drive down costs and increase access to care. This is good news for patients who are worried about affordable coverage. Unlike ObamaCare, though, it means that their coverage provides them with meaningful access to care.  It does you no good to have an insurance plan that you cannot afford to use. Time and time again, I have patients, I have small-business owners, I have constituents from all over Georgia's Third District that come to me and say: Just because I have this new insurance plan doesn't mean that my family is getting better care.  One such example was a gentleman that came into my district office just this past week. Three years ago, his health insurance for his family with four children was about $900, and he had a $3,000 family deductible. Last year, his premium had risen to $1,700 a month. And this year, he laid in front of me on my desk in the district office a bill for his health insurance that was $2,400 a month, and a $7,000 deductible. He is a small-business owner with nine employees. It is absolutely crushing his family expenses, and that is not fair.  What we have done is we have created an environment where we have tried unsuccessfully to expand access; and in doing so, we have risen costs on men and women across this Nation that are trying to do their best to move into the middle class. We have seen it destroy family finances. We have seen it create a situation where many families now pay more for their health insurance than they do for their own homes.  Mr.Speaker, in my case, that is the exact same thing. My insurance payment is more than my house payment, and that simply doesn't seem right.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,2324,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,15.0,March
100,topic-id,391,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York for her very candid remarks. As you can see, she touched on many important issues--the unfairness of the system that we have now, but also the importance of protecting our Medicaid safety net.  What we have seen under the Affordable Care Act is that we have seen our safety nets eroded. We are diverting resources away from the people that need them the most--the poor, the elderly, the blind, the disabled, children, and pregnant women--and we are pushing those resources to able-bodied men and women who do have the ability to work.  It is important to recognize that our legislation is probably the largest entitlement reform program in a generation. Our legislation puts Medicaid back on a budget for the first time in history. It provides enhanced flexibility to the States to allow them to design effective and financially sound programs to meet their population's unique needs.  Our plan also ensures that Medicaid prioritizes care for the most vulnerable, who it was originally intended for. We must do this because there are so many Americans, unfortunately, that have to depend on this safety net for their health care.  I understand this. In my hometown, in my dental practice, I treated patients who relied on Medicaid for their healthcare coverage. It was an honor to take care of them and to have very real discussions about their healthcare needs. I understand this vulnerable population because they were a vital part of my practice, and it was truly my pleasure to take care of them. I understand the unique circumstances that cause many of these individuals to be on Medicaid and to need this valuable safety net.  But we have to have an honest conversation about that. We have to be able to provide that safety net. And as we put more and more able-bodied men and women without children on that safety net, it is diverting resources away from those that need it the most. That is not right and that is not the American way. We are fighting to protect and strengthen this Nation's healthcare safety net.  Mr.Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.Marshall). Marshall knows firsthand about health care. He was a practicing OB/GYN, a board chairman of a hospital, and he has served our Nation in the United States  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,2324,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,15.0,March
102,topic-id,714,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank Marshall for his strong remarks and pointing out and highlighting several important things.  You know, one of the biggest things that we are fighting for as part of repealing ObamaCare is that we are fighting for our personal freedom. Right now, Americans have the ``choice'' of purchasing a government-mandated, one-size-fits-all product or paying a government-mandated penalty. In almost a third of all U.counties, and many in my home State of Georgia, consumers don't even have the choice between insurances to purchase. This is not a choice.  With the passage of the American Health Care Act, no longer will the Federal Government mandate that Americans purchase a product that they don't want, because we believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices. We understand the unique dignity of every human being. This dignity calls for self-determination and personal freedom, and we are fighting for that freedom. It is important.  I want to thank all of my colleagues who have joined me tonight to share with our constituents more about what we are fighting for.  First off, our legislation promotes personal freedom by eliminating the individual and employer mandates. Purchasing decisions should be left up to the consumer, not the Federal Under our plan, no American is mandated to purchase a product that he or she does not want and cannot afford.  As I have shared, I have personal experience with how important the conversation between the patient and their doctor is. By almost doubling the cap on how much individuals can contribute to their personal health savings accounts each year and expanding where those dollars can be used, our plan puts patients back at the center of the conversation with their doctor, and they remove all of the government bureaucrats from the middle of that conversation.  Health care is personal. It should belong to the patient and their healthcare provider--and no one else. That is where the most important decisions are made.  We are also working to strengthen our safety net to ensure that our vulnerable populations have continued access to health care. Our plan returns power to the States with the biggest entitlement reform in a generation. Our legislation also protects Americans with preexisting conditions, ensuring that no one is unable to purchase insurance because of an illness.  ObamaCare is a complex tangle of regulations and Federal overreach. With every day that passes, Americans and businesses feel the growing weight of a healthcare system that is failing. But it is also irresponsible to return to a broken healthcare system that brought us  Tomorrow, we will take the next step in the open legislative process as my colleagues and I on the Budget Committee do our part to send the American Health Care Act to the floor of the House for a vote. I am excited to take this step, but I want to be clear that this is only one part of repeal and reform. We are doing all that we can, and we are going to continue to push for conservative solutions with this bill. But it is not the final vote that we will take. There are many steps to go.  While it will take time and patience, I made a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and improve our healthcare system for all I am committed to this difficult road of building this healthcare system that puts patients first. The American people deserve the hard work and political will it will take to do this the right way.  Mr.Speaker, I am honored to have been joined by my colleagues tonight and glad to hear their comments, and I know that you have been as well. I want to point out that my colleagues have done an outstanding job tonight, and I believe that they have made some very, very salient points, and articulated reasons why we must step forward and do all that we can to reform our American healthcare system.  We have to control the cost. We have to do the things necessary to put patients back in control. And, Mr.Speaker, I have confidence that this body, along with our President and our colleagues in the Senate, can do that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,2324,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,15.0,March

The Department of Homeland Security spends billions of taxpayer dollars annually on a variety of systems to secure our borders, protect our aviation system, safeguard our shores, and shield our cyberspace, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, watchdogs at the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector General have found longstanding problems with how DHS has managed these programs. DHS continues to be on GAO's high-risk list for acquisition management, meaning these programs are susceptible to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.  In addition, the Department has failed to have a strategic vision for its major purposes. The result has been wasted effort and taxpayer money gone, with little to show for it. Look at the TSA puffer machines from a few years ago as a past example.  Without a comprehensive strategy, industry also does not have the needed information to best support DHS in making smart investments in executing its mission.

Since being sworn in earlier this year to serve the people of Bucks and Montgomery County, I have made it my mission to advance commonsense bipartisan government reform agenda that includes, perhaps, the single most important thing that I believe we need to do in this Nation, and that is institute term limits.  For 14 years, serving as an FBI agent, most of that time being in the political corruption units throughout the country, there was one commonality that I saw very frequently--there was an unmistakable correlation between the length of time in office and the instances of corruption, and that the lines that were very bright for elected officials coming into the system on day one weren't so bright in year 7, 8, or 9, and certainly not in year 15 or 20.

Next week, my colleagues and I on the Judiciary Committee will hold confirmation hearings on Judge I look forward to hearing his testimony. I am confident that he will impress the country with his knowledge of and respect for the law, just as he has impressed me and my colleagues.  But before the hearings get under way, I thought I would use this opportunity today to highlight an additional aspect of his life and his jurisprudence that make him an ideal nominee to serve on the High So far I have spoken on the floor about his fitness to fill Justice Scalia's seat, as well as his defense of the separation of powers and his support for religious liberty. Today I would like to discuss a more personal aspect of Judge Gorsuch's background--the fact that he is a westerner. As an Arizonan, I cannot overstate how important it will be to have a fellow westerner serving on the Supreme  Where you are from influences your understanding of cultural and regional sensitivities. When you look at the current makeup of the Supreme Court, there is an unmistakable lack of geographic diversity. Of the eight current Justices, five of them were born in New York or New Jersey, and that number was six before Judge Scalia's passing. Granted, Justice Kennedy is from Northern California, but to be frank, much of Northern California is about as culturally western as Justice Breyer's hometown of  The Supreme Court is in desperate need of a western perspective. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill. When I had the opportunity to meet Judge Gorsuch in my office last month, we discussed our respective western backgrounds. I talked to him about my days growing up on a cattle ranch in rural He told me that his heart has always been in the American You can learn a lot about a person by how they spend their time with their friends and their family, and there is no mistaking this aspect with Judge He is a westerner through and through.  He told me about his home outside of Boulder, where his daughters raise and show chickens and goats. I was pleased to learn that each year he takes his law clerks to the National Western Stock Show in Denver, one of the Nation's largest rodeos. By now, I think we have all seen the picture of him fly fishing with Judge While all this demonstrates how much he has embraced the western lifestyle, what makes Judge Gorsuch a true westerner is more than just where he lives or where his personal interests are. Judge Gorsuch's western values are evident in his jurisprudence, which reflects a strong commitment to public service. Arizona has had its share of distinguished public servants. In fact, it was from this very desk that the late Barry Goldwater, one of Arizona's favorite sons, steered the public policy debate[[Page S1822]]for years after he chose to leave a successful career in the private sector. Judge Gorsuch's career reflects the same ethos.  Early on, a young Neil Gorsuch rocketed to the top of the legal profession, becoming a partner in one of Washington's most elite law firms. But instead of enjoying the comforts of a lucrative private sector career, he left it all behind for a high-responsibility, low-profile job at the Department of  After his time at DOJ, Neil Gorsuch could have easily retired or returned to a white-shoe legal practice. Instead, he returned to his home State of Colorado to serve as a judge on the U.Court of Appeals for the Tenth Throughout his tenure on the Federal bench, Judge Gorsuch's western disposition has shone through in his jurisprudence.  I have already spoken of his skepticism toward the administrative state, with its executive bureaucracies, which, he cautions, ``swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate Federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.''  He shares a healthy skepticism over an overly intrusive and heavy-handed bureaucracy with millions of his Federal westerners. Judge Gorsuch recognizes how Federal regulations interfere with the ability of Western States to govern themselves, whether it is a former administration's Clean Power Plan, its ozone rules, or even management of the Mexican gray wolf.  In numerous opinions, Judge Gorsuch has given voice to many of the frustrations experienced by his western neighbors. From his criticism of an overly assertive DC court that often feels compelled to intervene from 2,000 miles away to his recognition of excessive litigation that arises from the complexities of split-estate property rights out West, he speaks our language.  These are perspectives any westerner is familiar with, but they may not be obvious to others, including folks from New York and New If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will already bring generational and religious diversity to the Perhaps more than anything, it will be his western perspective that most enriches the debate in the years to come.  As I have said before, Judge Gorsuch deserves fair consideration by those who serve in this body, and he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. He should be confirmed overwhelmingly, and I am confident that he will be.

1454,topic-id,879,"Mr.President, I rise in support of my resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act of the FCC's broadband privacy restrictions. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Privacy Subcommittee, I have spent more than a year closely examining this issue.  In February of 2015 the FCC, under then-Chairman Tom Wheeler, took the unprecedented step of reclassifying broadband providers as ``common carriers'' under title II of the Communications In other words, on a 3-to-2 party-line vote, the FCC decided that internet service providers should be treated like telephone companies for regulatory purposes. The decision encroached on the Federal Trade Commission's jurisdiction to regulate ISP privacy policies, stripping these companies of their traditional privacy regulator.  Recognizing that his actions to impose net neutrality on ISPs created regulatory uncertainty, last spring Chairman Wheeler began to float the idea of implementing new FCC privacy rules. The FCC decided, again on a 3-to-2 party-line vote, to move forward with the rule change just before election day. The whole process was unsettling, to say the least.  The FCC ultimately decided to commandeer an area of regulatory authority for itself, without any meaningful check on this unilateral action. Once it initiated the bureaucratic power grab, it proceeded to establish new rules restricting the free speech of its regulatory target.  I submitted comments to the agency expressing my constitutional concerns about its proposed rule. I wasn't alone in doing so. Noted Harvard law professor Larry Tribe, hardly one to be confused for a conservative, did the same. But the rules were finalized nonetheless.  While the FCC recently took a step in the right direction by staying the application of the privacy rules, these midnight regulations are still hanging out there. Congress needs to repeal these privacy restrictions in order to restore balance to the internet ecosystem and provide certainty to consumers.  These regulations have altered the basic nature of privacy protection in the United For decades, the FTC policed privacy based on consumer expectations for their data, not bureaucratic preferences. These consumer expectations were just common sense: Sensitive data deserves more protection than nonsensitive data.  Unfortunately, the FCC rules dispensed with this commonsense regulatory approach. Under the new rules, what matters isn't what the data is but, rather, who uses it. This creates a dual-track regulatory environment where some consumer data is regulated one way if a company is using it under the FCC's jurisdiction and an entirely different way if its use falls under the FTC, or the Federal Trade  This is all confusing enough, but it gets worse. In the consumer technology sector, innovation is the name of the game. Companies are constantly rolling out new products and competing to win over consumers. By the same token, consumers are always on the lookout for the newest gadget or app. But the FCC's privacy order makes it increasingly difficult for consumers to learn about the latest product offerings from broadband providers. Instead of being notified about faster and more affordable alternatives for their family's home internet needs, under the FCC's privacy order, Arizonans might get left in the dark.  The FCC's heavyhanded data requirements restrict the ability of broadband providers to offer services tailored to their customers' needs and interests, and they lead to inconsistent treatment of otherwise identical data online. When a regulation diminishes innovation, harms consumer choice, and is just all-around confusing, it is a bad regulation. The FCC's privacy rule for ISPs is a bad regulation.  When it chose to impose needlessly onerous privacy regulations on broadband providers while leaving the rest of the internet under the successful FTC regime, the FCC unfairly picked one politically favored industry--the edge providers--to prevail over a different industry--broadband.  Repealing the FCC's privacy action is a crucial step toward restoring a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet. The FTC's privacy rules are the result of an ongoing, data-driven effort to understand and protect consumer expectations. That is the The FCC's rules, on the other hand, are the hasty byproduct of political interest groups and reflect the narrow preferences of well-connected insiders.  To sum all of this up, the FCC's midnight privacy rules are confusing and counterproductive. This CRA will get rid of it, pure and simple. But let me say what it won't do. Despite claims to the contrary, using this CRA will not leave consumers unprotected. That is because the FCC is already obligated to police the privacy practices of broadband providers under section 222 of the Communications Act, as well as various other Federal and State laws.  Both Chairman Wheeler and Chairman Pai agree on that point. Just last week, Chairman Pai wrote to my friends on the other side of the aisle confirming this legal fact.  This resolution will not disrupt the FCC's power, nor will it infringe on the FTC's jurisdiction elsewhere. Neither will it affect how broadband providers currently handle consumer data. Broadband providers are currently regulated under section 222, and they will continue to be after these midnight regulations are rescinded.  Passing this CRA will send a powerful message that Federal agencies can't unilaterally restrict constitutional rights and expect to get away with it. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.  I yield back the remainder of my time.

1273,topic-id,622,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, this week marks 7 years since ObamaCare was signed into law. We all remember the promises former President Obama and Washington Democrats made at the time.  Families were promised that their healthcare costs would go down. They were promised more choices and more competition. Small businesses and their employees were promised greater access to affordable health care.  But for 7 years, we have watched as all of those promises were broken. For 7 years, we have heard from families and small businesses across the country that have seen their healthcare costs skyrocket and their choices diminish.  Members of the House Education and the Workforce Committee recently heard from Scott Bollenbacher, an Indiana small-business owner with 11 full-time employees. The company has been forced to switch healthcare plans twice now under ObamaCare, and their only viable option this year was a plan with a 78 percent premium increase.  Mr.Bollenbacher is one of countless small-business owners struggling to make ends meet under a failed government takeover of health care. Because of ObamaCare, 300,000 small-business jobs have been destroyed, including nearly 8,000 in my home State of North                              {time}  1400  Additionally, an estimated 10,000 small businesses nationwide have closed their doors, and small business employees have lost $19 billion each year in wages.  It should come as no surprise that, since 2008, the share of small businesses with fewer than 10 employees offering health coverage has dropped 36 percent. It is not that they don't want to; it is that onerous mandates and regulations have made it simply unaffordable to do so.  Fortunately, relief is on the way. This week we are not only moving to repeal ObamaCare, we are also advancing positive reforms that promote affordable coverage for working families, including the Small Business Health Fairness  As its title implies, this important legislation is about fairness for small businesses and their employees. Today, small businesses are on an unfair playing field with larger companies and unions when it comes to health care. Large businesses have the ability to negotiate for more affordable healthcare costs for their employees, but small businesses do not have the same advantage. Because of their size, small businesses have limited bargaining power, which means their employees can end up paying more for health insurance.  With millions of Americans employed by a small business, it is long past time to level the playing field. That is exactly what this commonsense legislation is about. This bill would empower small businesses to band together through association health plans, or AHPs, to purchase high-quality health care at a lower cost for workers.  This bill represents a first step toward a more competitive health insurance market that crosses State lines. Under H.1101, small businesses in different States could join together through a group health plan. These plans would have strong protections and solvency requirements to ensure workers can count on healthcare coverage when they and their families need it.  What does all of this mean: more choices, more freedom, and more affordable health care for working families and small-business owners like Scott This is a better way, one that stands in stark contrast to ObamaCare's failed approach. Instead of more mandates, this bill empowers individuals to access the high-quality, affordable healthcare plan that meets their needs.  I want to thank my colleague Representative Sam Johnson for championing, for years, the positive reforms in this bill.  I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on H.1101 so we can level the playing field for small businesses and expand affordable health coverage for working families.

Mr.Speaker, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent a lot of their time extolling ObamaCare and indicating that we should just stay with what we have, but we all know that ObamaCare is failing.  Republicans are on a rescue mission. We truly do have a better way. As some of my colleagues have stated, we will be passing the American Health Care Act tomorrow. What we are doing here with this bill is something we could not include in that legislation that will round out what it is we want to do with keeping our promise in what we promised last year in our program called A Better  Let me just talk a little bit about the failures of As my colleagues have said, all the promises were broken: if you wanted to keep your doctor, you could keep your doctor; if you wanted to keep your healthcare plan, you could keep your healthcare plan. Those promises were the most obvious ones that went away. The cost of health care would be going down, and none of that happened.  Mr.Speaker, in addition to that, there is a 25 percent average increase in premiums this year for millions of Americans trapped in ObamaCare, healthcare.gov exchanges. Nearly one-third of U.counties have only one insurer offering exchange plans; 4.7 million Americans were kicked off their healthcare plans by There was $1 trillion in new taxes, mostly falling on families and job creators; 18 failed ObamaCare co-ops out of 23, which my colleague from Tennessee so eloquently pointed out.  These were established as an alternative to the public option. Those healthcare co-ops collapsed, costing[[Page H2327]]taxpayers nearly 1.9 billion and forcing patients to find new insurance; $53 billion in new regulations requiring more than 176,800,000 hours of paperwork. ObamaCare regulations are driving up healthcare premiums and costing small-business employees at least $19 billion annually.  As I said in the hearing that we had on this bill, the Democrats want a coercive system. Republicans want a system based on freedom.  Today we have an opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of hardworking men and women who are employed by small business. We have an opportunity to deliver much-needed relief to small-business owners who are trying to do the right thing and provide high-quality healthcare coverage for their employees. This legislation represents a truly positive reform that will help lower healthcare costs for working families and put small businesses on a fair and level playing field.  Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy, and there is no reason why they should be at a disadvantage when it comes to finding an affordable healthcare plan. They should be treated in the same fashion as larger businesses and have the ability to craft healthcare plans that meet the needs of their employees. If we want to encourage small businesses to offer health care at a lower cost to workers, this is one commonsense step we can make.  Again, I thank our colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, a true patriot and servant of this country, for his longtime support of this legislation.

1432,topic-id,1057,"Mr.President, I rise today in opposition to a resolution that will roll back nearly 45 years of OSHA workplace safety enforcement precedents. We would be reversing a precedent that helps ensure every American worker heads homes safely at the end of their shift.  This resolution is an effort by my Republican colleagues to overturn a rule issued by OSHA on December 16, 2016, entitled, ``Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness.'' As the title says, this rule provides employers with clarification on the requirements to timely report and record workplace injury and illnesses. This rule adds no new employer requirements that differ from 45 years of policy. The rule supports a practice that law-abiding businesses comply with and have operated under since passage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Passing this resolution and repealing this rule only creates a safe harbor for businesses that have broken the law in the last 5 years or don't intend to follow longstanding rules created to protect the safety and health of workers.  For nearly the last 45 years, OSHA has required employers, with the exception of small employers, to timely report workplace injury and illnesses to the Department of Labor and maintain a record of such incidents going back at least 5 years. If an employer failed to do either, they could be cited and penalized. OSHA's rule issued last December simply maintains this longstanding practice.  This resolution aims to change that record keeping requirement, or lookback period, from 5 years to 6 months. So if an unscrupulous employer fails to report a worker injury or illness and OSHA doesn't discover the underreporting and cite the employer in the first 6 months after the incident occurred, the employer is able to get away with it and the data used to identify dangerous industries or worksites is lost.  Accurate injury and illness records are critical for the protection of workers and for OSHA to direct the most efficient use of their limited resources, and the more data they have, the better. With their current resources, OSHA is only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. That is clearly not sufficient, especially when over 4,800 workers were killed in 2015 and almost 3 million more suffered a serious workplace injury or illnesses. The OSHA reporting rule is critical for OSHA to conduct a thorough investigation, enforce accurate recordkeeping requirements, and focus limited resources on industries and bad actors that pose the greatest risk to worker safety.  Take, for instance, the Exel Corporation, a Pennsylvania warehouse and trucking company, which hired hundreds of foreign students on temporary visas, and was cited for numerous unrecorded injuries after some students were seriously injured on the job. Only after students fought for fair pay and safer working conditions and OSHA was able to conduct an investigation was it revealed that, for years, the company had withheld wages and willfully failed to record about half the serious injuries to student workers as well as other serious health and safety violations.  By the time DOL had completed their lengthy investigation, the Wage and Hour division recovered over $200,000 in wages withheld from 1,028 foreign student workers. OSHA cited the company for dozens of unrecorded injuries, all of which occurred over the 6-month period before OSHA issued the violations, and a penalty of $283,000. About two-thirds of the $283,000 penalty was for unrecorded violations that occurred outside the 6-month statute of limitations window this CRA is proposing to codify.  In response, the Exel Corporation accepted all the penalties, agreed to pay half the total fine, and instituted a new corporate-wide program to fix their recordkeeping practices which added safety protections for roughly 40,000 workers at over 500 facilities nationwide.  None of those violations and the associated fine would have been allowed if a narrower 6-month statute of limitations was in place as this resolution proposes to do. I think it is safe to say that Exel's new corporate-wide program that added protections for 40,000 workers in 500 facilities nationwide would not have been implemented either.  Efforts to repeal the OSHA reporting rule and 45 years of OSHA enforcement precedent, without even a hearing or vigorous debate, is reckless and runs contrary to any proworker vision. The change in longstanding OSHA precedent was prompted by a DC Circuit Court ruling in the 2012 Volks Constructors v. Secretary of Labor case. After that decision, OSHA revised its recordkeeping regulation to conform with guidance provided in a concurring opinion. If there is a legal disagreement regarding the authority of OSHA to cite employers for continuing violations, we should let the legal process conclude before any congressional or legislative action is taken.  The OSHA reporting rule is a fair occupational safety standard, and that is why every administration in the last 45 years, Democratic and Republican, has enforced the requirement this rule clarifies.  Opponents of the OSHA reporting rule and supporters of this CRA resolution claim that the OSHA rule would extend the statute of limitations on recordkeeping paperwork violations and that this CRA resolution is necessary to protect jobs, eliminate burdensome regulations and protect small business. None of that is accurate.  The OSHA reporting rule does not kill jobs; it creates no new employer obligations that are different from what they were required to uphold for nearly 45 years. And the rule does not cover small businesses.  What the rule does do is save employers from killing and maiming workers. It gives OSHA the tools it needs to identify dangerous industries, reckless employers, as well as punish those who break the law at the expense of worker health and safety and businessowners who obey the law.  No law-abiding business, which values the safety of its workers and the information used to make the workplace even safer, should be at a competitive disadvantage facing a competitor that underreports injuries and cuts corners at the expense of workers' safety.  The safety of the American worker and a level playing field for law abiding employers should not be a partisan issue. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me, working Americans, and the millions of law-abiding businesses that strive to create a safe workplace and oppose this resolution.

We are strong allies, and we have a strong military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural relationship with the State of As a Jew, the importance of that relationship is something that I feel in my bones, and as a Senator, working to[[Page S1957]]make our relationship with Israel stronger is a major priority. I strongly believe that part of strengthening that relationship is doing everything we can to help make progress toward a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Helping to resolve that conflict has consistently been one of the top diplomatic priorities of the United  There are very important implications in this selection for the Israeli people, the Palestinian people, the Middle East region, and even beyond. We need an Ambassador who can rise to the challenge, someone who can bring the parties together for negotiations and be regarded as legitimate in the eyes of all parties. Mr.Friedman is not that man.  Mr.Friedman's past conduct demonstrates that he lacks the tools one needs to be a good diplomat. For starters, diplomacy is about choosing your words carefully. It is about reasoning with those with whom you disagree. Diplomacy means not resorting to insults and to name-calling when you have a disagreement, which is something that Mr.Friedman has done time and time and time again.  In an op-ed he penned for the newspaper Arutz Sheva, Mr.Friedman called supporters of the American Jewish Organization J Street ``far worse than kapos.''  Now, for those who don't share the history, I was born in 1951, and I grew up with the holocaust and the stories of the holocaust pounded into my head, and I know what ``kapos'' are. It is the term that refers to Jews who collaborated with the Nazis--with the Gestapo, the guards at the concentration camps during the holocaust. When asked to repudiate his statement on J Street, Mr.Friedman refused, and in fact doubled down, stating ``They're not Jewish, and they are not pro-Israel.'' For those who don't know, J Street is a pro-Israel organization dedicated to the two-state solution--a goal that is shared by successive U.administrations, both Democratic and The two-state solution is the only way to keep Israel a Jewish State and a democracy.  Mr.Friedman's smearing of our fellow Jews--my fellow Jews, many of whom are members of J Street, this is a calumny. This should be a disqualifier for someone seeking to represent the United States in the State of Mr.Friedman's statement shows that he lacks understanding of history--of our history, the history of the Jewish people--it shows he is intolerant of opposing views, and he is profoundly insensitive. That is probably why so many of my fellow Jews have reached out to me, have urged me to reject his nomination.  Mr.Friedman's offensive remarks don't stop there. He regularly insults those with whom he disagrees. He even called me a clown and a moron after I pointed out the anti-Semitic stereotypes evoked in the Trump campaign's final ad. As I told Mr.Friedman when we met in my office, I have been called a moron before--that kind of thing happens in campaigns all the time--but as I also reminded him, part of being a diplomat is being diplomatic.  Now, while I have serious concerns with Mr.Friedman's temperament, my biggest issue with this nominee is his lack of commitment to the peace process. For example, right after being nominated to serve as Ambassador, Mr.Friedman stated that he ``looked forward to doing this from the U.embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem.''  It has been a longstanding policy of the United States to recognize Tel Aviv as the capital of This policy has been viewed by successive administrations as important for helping maintain regional stability and peace with Israel and its neighbors. An abrupt change in this tradition would make it more difficult for the United States to play the role of arbiter, to achieve peace and security between the Israelis and the At a time when we need to reduce tensions in the region, Mr.Friedman was sending the exact wrong message. What I find even more troubling is Mr.Friedman's support for settlement building. Successive U.administrations have recognized that new settlements are barriers to peace. Mr.Friedman has served as president and has been actively fundraising for the American Friends of Beit El, the nonprofit that supports the expansion of that settlement--expansion which is illegal under international law, an expansion deep inside of Palestinian territory.  How can we possibly help advance peace between the two parties with a man who believes there ought to be more settlements--one of the very things that observers on both sides of this conflict recognize as a significant obstacle to peace. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has remained intractable for far too long, proving a hardship--a tragedy--for Israelis and Palestinians both and impacting regional and even global security. I believe--I am convinced that a just and lasting agreement between the two parties on a two-state solution, though very difficult, can and must be achieved. Confirming David Friedman as Ambassador of the United States to Israel will only serve to make that job more difficult, if not impossible, and in my mind would be a tragedy.

848,topic-id,787,"Mr.Speaker, I am rising today to urge my colleagues to support H.1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, which I have introduced with my Republican colleague, a fellow Army veteran and former prosecutor from the State of Virginia, Congressman Tom Garrett, where we are seeking to address our outdated and widely problematic marijuana laws by federally decriminalizing marijuana.  FBI reports have shown that, in 2011 alone, an individual in the United States was arrested for marijuana use, sale, or possession every 42 seconds--every 42 seconds--mostly in poor and minority communities. Our current laws are turning everyday Americans into criminals, sending them to jail, ruining their lives, tearing apart families, and wasting huge amounts of taxpayer dollars to arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate people for marijuana use, a drug that has been proven time and time again to be far less dangerous than alcohol both for individual consumers as well as for the people around them.  Donald Abrams, who is chief of oncology at San Francisco General Hospital, has talked about how, in the 37 years that he has worked and served as a physician, the number of patients that he has admitted to his hospital with marijuana complications is zero. The number of patients that he has admitted due to alcohol use is ``profound.''  So, rather than actually helping people, our current laws are turning them into criminals, forever impacting their future and the future of their families. Over the years, we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars locking people up for nonviolent marijuana offenses, creating strain within our criminal justice system, and clogging court calendars, resulting in further overcrowding of our prisons.  Now, just a few weeks ago, I had the chance to go and visit a number of our prisons and jails in Hawaii, where I saw firsthand the crumbling infrastructure, the extreme overcrowding and facilities in dire need of upgrades, as well as the shortage of services that are actually needed to help rehabilitate people and reduce our recidivism rates.  So whether you personally think that marijuana use is good or bad, whether you would choose to use marijuana or not, the question is: Should we really be sending people to jail and turning them into criminals for it? The answer is no. The fiscal impacts and the social impacts of our current policy are having devastating ripple effects on individuals and our communities and are only continuing to perpetuate the problem.  For example, the contradiction that we see currently between State and Federal laws on marijuana has created a serious problem for many of our local businesses. I have talked with local bankers in my home State of Hawaii who expressed great frustration, and even confusion, about the contradiction between our laws with the fact that even though our State of Hawaii has legalized and authorized marijuana dispensaries to grow, process, and dispense medical marijuana, Federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from offering any type of financial services to both businesses and individuals whose financial transactions have anything to do with marijuana.  So what this means in practical terms is that our State-recognized and licensed medical marijuana dispensary owners as well as their employees can't open a bank account. They can't get a loan from our local bank. The businesses, literally, have to hold thousands, or even millions, of dollars from their transactions and have to conduct their transactions in cash. Businesses that provide services to these medical marijuana dispensaries are also unable to access financial services due to the gaps between Federal and State law.  So as we look at ways that we need to update our outdated drug policies and the need for us to reform a very broken criminal justice system, we need to take into account the growing body of evidence that suggests the medicinal benefits of marijuana, including, preventing epileptic seizures, reducing anxiety, and even halting the growth of cancer cells.  However, the FDA still currently classifies marijuana as a schedule I drug, basically saying that marijuana is just like heroin, LSD, and MDMA, ignoring the fact that at least 28 States, including my home State of Hawaii, have already accepted the medical use of marijuana under State law.  In addition to passing H.1227, we need to require the FDA to remove marijuana from schedule I based on State-accepted medical use. These reforms that we are calling for in this bipartisan bill are common sense and they are long overdue, long overdue changes that will help to reduce the strain on our criminal justice system, create certainty and reduce contradictions and confusion between State and Federal law, and update those Federal laws to actually meet the needs and progress that States are making across the country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2246.txt,2122,CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS,2017.0,21.0,March

We, for the third time in American history, have unified Republican control of the government: a Republican in the White House and Republican control of the House of Representatives and of the In the last five campaigns, one out of every four ads was about health care, so it is our turn to lead.  Here is what we know: ObamaCare today is failing. It is failing to meet the promises that were made that people could keep their doctor or keep their plan. It is failing to be affordable for those who see rising premiums, rising deductibles, no choices, no health care at all, and limited access.  As Republicans leading in this Chamber, we are on a rescue mission to save the American people from this disaster and to replace this law with something that works and gets us away from government-centered health care and moves us to patient-centered health care, doctor-centered health care.  You know, we believe in ownership societies where you ought to be able to own your own healthcare plan, own your own decisions about education and how you choose to prosper.  Today, the Rules Committee is contemplating amendments that should excite conservatives with generational changes that will unlock the potential of this great country.  State flexibility, for the first time, we really see the option for States like mine in Florida to step up and say we don't want the Federal Government involved in health care anymore. We want to take control over those who are vulnerable in our communities, and we want to innovate and come up with solutions that meet those challenges.  Work requirements, hardworking people in my district don't understand why they go to work every day but too often they are paying for entitlements for people who are able-bodied, childless, can work, and choose not to. That is wrong.  We are going to take up, on this floor, legislation that I suspect will have a work requirement for able-bodied, childless adults for those States who choose to implement this bold conservative reform.  We also expect that there will be an end to the disaster of Medicaid expansion. Today in America, one out of every four people is on That is absolutely unsustainable. It means three of us have got to pay for the cost of our own health care and then a substantial portion of the cost of someone else's.  By ending Medicaid expansion for nonexpansion States, we put the country back on a path to prosperity--not government-centered health care, individual patient-centered health care where people can choose the plans that best meet their needs.  If we do this, if we meet this challenge with our historic opportunity to lead, then the American people will know that we are worthy of their trust.

1342,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I was back in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the past week. Someone asked me: What is the biggest surprise you have encountered since being in Congress?  I said: I will give you a negative surprise and a positive surprise. The negative surprise was how much of our time is spent here in Congress doing things that really, in my opinion, have nothing to do with the hard task of legislating, running around to an endless series of meetings that distract us from the hard work of the floor of coming together and fixing problems.  I said: But on the positive side, I have been blown away by the quality of talent, the commitment to service, and just the incredible collection of experiences we have in the freshman class of the 115th Congress--on both sides of the aisle, by the way.  I think we have a unique opportunity to seize this moment and send a message to our citizens back home that we are ready to change politics as usual and we are ready to work together to get things done. So today we would like to speak about that in general and in particular about term limits, an idea whose time has come.

Our healthcare system in this country has failed the American people, the Federal debt and deficit continue to balloon, taxes are driving out businesses and jobs, and our foreign policy is in shambles right now. These issues aren't new, yet they never seem to get fixed. Why is that? Well, I would argue because Washington isn't working for the American people.

386,topic-id,1596,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1181. As a combat veteran in the Iraq war, the issues we are debating this afternoon are deeply personal to me.  Veteran suicide has reached crisis levels in this country, and our failure to do more to help veterans in desperate need of mental health care is truly shameful. Unfortunately, Republicans have brought forward a bill today that will make this crisis even worse.[[Page H2108]]  Here is the plain truth. If we allow people with serious mental illnesses to purchase dangerous weapons, we are putting their lives and the lives of their loved ones at risk.  Mr.Speaker, at a time when more veterans are taking their own lives, we should be debating how to get them greater resources and support, not easier access to firearms. At least 10--10--esteemed military leaders, including David Petraeus, Michael Hayden, and Stanley McChrystal all agree. Here is what they wrote in a heartfelt letter to Congress:  ``Our Nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of whom do so by buying a firearm.  ``We know that nondeployed veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans are at a 41 percent higher risk'' than the American civilian population.  ``When vulnerable veterans have access to firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to their family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies is felt in communities across our  ``The VA has submitted over 174,000 names of servicemen and -women who require a fiduciary to manage their benefits and have been determined through clear and convincing evidence to meet the Federal standard for gun prohibition.  ``Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals that suffer from schizophrenia, and another 15,000 have severe  ``For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be fatal.''  They conclude by calling the bill before us today ``irresponsible, dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to care, not weapons,'' and I couldn't agree more with that.  The question for my Republican friends is a simple one: Do you know more about what is best for our veterans than General Hayden? Do you have a better understanding of what would improve their welfare than General McChrystal? Do you appreciate their needs more acutely than General Petraeus? If the answer is no, then you should vote ``no'' on this bill later today.  Mr.Speaker, if this legislation is signed into law, more veterans will take their own lives. That is the tragic reality we face. Please side with General Petraeus and General Side with your conscience and your values. Side with our veterans. Please vote ``no.''  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence regarding a summary of the effect of H.1181.                                                     Law Center to                                         Prevent Gun Violence,                                                   March 10, 2017.                               Memorandum     To Interested     From Americans for Responsible     Re Effect of H.1181 (2017): Veterans 2nd Amendment          Protection                                Summary       H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, would      mandate that veterans determined to be mentally incompetent      or incapacitated by the Veterans Administration (VA) shall      not be considered to have been ``adjudicated as a mental      defective'' for the purposes of federal firearms law without      a finding by a judge or judicial authority that the veteran      is a danger to self or others.       The VA has reported records to the FBI's National Instant      Criminal Background Check System (NICS) regarding more than      170,000 beneficiaries who were adjudicated as mentally      incompetent under a very different standard. The vast      majority of those incompetency adjudications have been made      (1) without a finding of dangerousness and (2) without the      involvement of a judge or judicial officer.       In short, this bill would drastically change the standard      under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered      ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and      it provides no express time limitation to ensure that this      new standard would not be applied to VA adjudications that      occurred before enactment of this bill. As a result, there is      significant concern about how this legislation would affect      veterans who have previously been adjudicated as mentally      incompetent by the VA, and who are, as a result, currently      considered subject to federal law's firearm prohibition.       The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) states      that once a federal department or agency is aware that, when      the basis under which a record was made available to NICS      does not apply, or no longer applies, a federal agency must      ``update, correct, modify, or remove the record from any      database that the agency maintains and makes available to the      Attorney General, in accordance with the rules pertaining to      that database; and (ii) notify the Attorney General that such      basis no longer applies so that the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System is kept up to date.'' A strong      argument could be made that, if H.1181 were to become law,      most beneficiaries who have been found to be mentally      incompetent by the VA could no longer be considered subject      to federal law's firearm prohibition.                           Relevant Language       The relevant language of the bill states: ``Notwithstanding      any determination made by the Secretary under section 5501A      of this title, in any case arising out of the administration      by the Secretary of laws and benefits under this title, a      person who is mentally incapacitated, deemed mentally      incompetent, or experiencing an extended loss of      consciousness shall not be considered adjudicated as a mental      defective under subsection (d)(4) or (g)(4) of section 922 of      title 18 without the order or finding of a judge, magistrate,      or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that      such person is a danger to himself or herself or others.''       The key phrase is ``in any case arising out of the      administration by the Secretary of laws and benefits under      this title.'' This phrase determines the scope of the      individuals that would be affected by this bill. It is not      limited to cases that the Secretary administers subsequent to      the enactment of the bill, but rather is unbounded in time.      This language could therefore be interpreted to apply to any      case arising out of the administration of these laws and      benefits by the Secretary, regardless of when the case      occurred. If the NICS Section of the FBI follows this      interpretation, it may remove records of these individuals      from       This would have far-reaching impact. Currently, few if any      mental incompetency determinations by the VA are made by a      judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. These      determinations are made my VA examiners who determine, in the      course of processing veterans' benefits claims, that as a      result of as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or      mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, a      beneficiary ``lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage      his or her own affairs'' and requires a fiduciary to handle      the disbursement of benefits. Because these beneficiaries      require a fiduciary to handle disbursement of their payments      due to mental incompetence, they are considered to ``lack[]      the mental capacity to . . . manage [their] own affairs . . .      as a result of marked subnormal intelligence, or mental      illness, incompetency, condition, or disease,'' and are      therefore prohibited from possessing a firearm under existing      federal law.       These incompetency determinations may be appealed to the      VA's administrative Board of Veterans Appeals, and then      eventually to federal court, but the federal judges reviewing      the case would be reviewing the VA's finding that the veteran      is mentally incompetent, and would have no basis for      determining whether or not the veteran was ``a danger to      himself or herself or others.'' Determining whether a person      is a danger to self or others is generally outside the      purview of the Veterans Benefits Administration or cases      arising out of the administration of laws regarding veterans'      claims for benefits.       If an incompetent beneficiary seeks relief specifically      from the NICS firearm prohibition, the VA must determine      whether the beneficiary has proven by clear and convincing      evidence that ``he or she is not likely to act in a manner      dangerous to self or others, and the granting of relief is      not contrary to public safety and/or the public interest.''      Essentially, the VA is tasked in these cases with assessing      whether the beneficiary met a substantial burden of proving      non-dangerousness. This does not involve a finding by a      judge, magistrate, or judicial authority. Though veterans may      then appeal an action by the VA denying NICS relief to a      federal district court judge, that judge would be tasked with      reviewing whether the evidence reasonably justified the VA's      determination that the veteran failed to provide clear and      convincing evidence that he or she was not dangerous. It is      not clear even in these rare cases that a judge upholding the      VA's determination would have occasion to make an affirmative      finding that the person was a danger to self or others.       In short, this bill would drastically change the standard      under which veteran beneficiaries may be considered      ``adjudicated'' for the purposes of federal firearms law, and      provides no express time limitation to ensure that this new      standard shall not be applied to previous adjudications by      the It could therefore threaten to implicitly require      that NICS lose nearly every prohibiting mental health record      it has ever received from the                           Limiting Amendment       In order to avoid the loss of these records in NICS, we      suggest amending the phrase ``in any case arising out of the      administration . . .'' to refer only to cases arising      subsequent to the enactment of this law.[[Page H2109]]    ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2102-2.txt,2226,SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH FAIRNESS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,March
656,topic-id,1154,"Mr.Speaker, I am going to cut directly to the chase. The Trump-Ryan healthcare bill betrays every single promise Donald Trump made about health care, and does it all for the sake of an enormous tax cut for those who need it least.  The first promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that everyone would have health insurance. Although the ACA expanded health coverage to more than 20 million Americans, Donald Trump said repeatedly that he didn't think the ACA provided enough people with coverage. He said: ``We're going to have insurance for everybody,'' and ``I'm not going to leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford health insurance.''  What does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  According to the Congressional Budget Office, 14 million people would immediately lose coverage next year, and 24 million people would lose coverage by 2027. That is outrageous. But it gets worse.  According to the White House's own estimate, 26 million people, not 24 million people, will lose coverage under the Trump-Ryan bill.  The second promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that their health insurance would be cheaper. Donald Trump said that his plans would have ``much lower deductibles.''  Secretary Tom Price said last week that under the Trump-Ryan proposal ``nobody will be worse off financially.''  What does the Trump-Ryan bill actually do?  In my home State, Arizonans will get hit hard, very hard. In 2020, under the Trump-Ryan plan, Arizonans will receive on average $3,500 less in subsidies than ObamaCare, meaning they are going to be forced to spend more money out of pocket to continue getting care.  The Trump-Ryan bill will stick it to older It peels back an ObamaCare rule that protects older people from higher costs. The Trump-Ryan bill green-lights insurance companies to charge older Americans 66 percent more.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, a typical, low-income, 64-year-old's out-of-pocket costs would increase from less than $2,000 a year to almost $15,000 a year by 2026. So if you are an older American and you don't like ObamaCare, let me tell you this right now: You are going to hate  The third promise that Donald Trump made to the American people was that Americans would enjoy better health care. As a candidate, Donald Trump said that ObamaCare was ``horrible health care.'' He promised that ``everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.''  So what does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  Well, if you are lucky enough to still have health insurance under the Trump-Ryan plan, it will provide you even worse coverage. The bill does nothing to increase the quality of your care. It will cut some of the healthcare services you receive now.  In his speech before Congress less than 3 weeks ago, Donald Trump said that ``we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.''  At a time when opiate overdoses kill more Americans than car accidents, we absolutely should be expanding treatment. But what does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  It does the opposite by cutting addiction services and mental health treatment under  Donald Trump's fourth promise to the American was that he would not cut During the Republican presidential primary, he bragged that he was the first and only potential GOP candidate to state that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and  What does the Trump-Ryan bill do?  It cuts Medicaid more than it has ever been cut before. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it cuts Medicaid funding by $370 billion over 10 years.  The Trump-Ryan bill will permanently and radically weaken this critical safety net for the working poor. It freezes enrollment in Medicaid and unravels the Medicaid expansion. If you are worried about what this means for you, your family, and your friends, you should be.  Donald Trump is breaking his promise on Will he break his promise on Medicare, too? Will he break his promise on Social Security? Why is Donald Trump breaking promise after promise he made on health care?  The Trump-Ryan bill takes healthcare coverage away from millions of people, it raises deductibles and copays, and provides worse coverage for those who are lucky enough to still be able to afford it.  So what are Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans up to? This bill does a lot of things poorly, but there is one thing, and really only one thing, that this bill does incredibly well. It cuts a whole lot of taxes for the rich.  This Trump-Ryan ``healthcare bill'' includes a whopping $600 billion in tax cuts, almost all for the wealthy. The single biggest tax cut in the bill repeals a 3.8 percent tax on investors who make more than $250,000.  This tax cut will not put a single dollar back in the pocket of any family who makes less than $250,000. But if you are the top one-tenth of 1 percent, which means that you make at least $3.75 million per year, then you will get on average a $165,000 tax cut. This is outrageous.  The Trump-Ryan bill also repeals a nearly 1 percent tax on families making over $250,000. Again, if you are in the top one-tenth of 1 percent, you are going to do great under the Trump-Ryan bill. You will get an average tax cut of over $30,000.  But, if you are in the bottom 90 percent, if you are an average, hardworking American, you will get nothing from this tax cut.  Who are Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans looking out for? If you are an out-of-work steelworker in Youngstown, it is not you. If you are a struggling farmer in rural Alabama, it is not you. If you are working at Target, Walmart, or McDonald's, you are out of luck, too. Heck, even if you are making a decent living as an auto worker or a truck driver, it is not you.  Two nights ago, Donald Trump even admitted this. In an interview on FOX News, Tucker Carlson pointed out to Donald Trump that the rich do a lot better under the Trump-Ryan healthcare bill than working and middle class people, many of whom supported him in this election.  What did Donald Trump say in response? ``Oh, I know.''  Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and House Republicans are looking out for the richest of the rich. They are putting the pinch to you, hardworking Americans, to give their rich friends and supporters a giant tax break, and they are willing to wreck our healthcare system and take healthcare insurance away from 24 million Americans to do it.  Two years ago, Marco Rubio called out Donald Trump as a con artist. The Trump-Ryan healthcare bill is one big con on the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

984,topic-id,1187,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the Speaker for this opportunity to continue the discussion. My colleague from Texas really left here a moment ago with a plea about bringing down the cost of health care in Actually, it was the cost of premiums in That is a plea that I think all 435 of us would echo. It would certainly be our goal, as representatives of the American people, to find some way to accomplish that, some way to bring down the cost of premiums.  I would like just to make a point right at the outset. When discussing health care, there are really two connected, but very separate, parts to the healthcare system.  One part is the delivery of medical services. These are the doctors, some of whom are in organizations of doctors of various specialties. Some are in large practices, such as the Kaiser practice. Some are in hospitals disconnected from doctors. But there is just a plethora of different ways in which medical services are delivered. That is the delivery of medical services. That is one part of it.  The other part of the healthcare system in America, and really anywhere in the world, is the collection of money to pay for the services. Now, in the United States, we have many different ways to collect the money. One of them is through taxes. And this is how we pay for Medicare and Medicaid, what we call MediCal in We pay for the veterans' medical services through the collection of taxes, children's health services, and some other programs that are much smaller. So that is one way in which we collect the money to pay for services. You might call those single-payer taxpayer services, taxpayers' money being spent on services delivered by that whole range of providers, some of which happen to be government providers, for example, the Veterans Administration and military medical services.  Now, the other way in which we collect money to pay for services are premiums, health insurance premiums that are charged by health insurance companies. The largest single part of that is from corporations, businesses, that buy health insurance and pay the premiums. And the others are individuals, and this is the individual insurance market. There are some small group markets out there, also. But these two systems, we need to understand that they are different. They are connected, obviously.  Now, if we are going to deal with the cost of premiums, you have to go over and deal with the cost of health care, because the health care drives the premiums and also drives the amount of money that we need to raise to pay for the services that are provided by the various governmental programs.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, which is now some 7 years old Thursday of this week, the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, there are some very powerful mechanisms to reduce the cost of health care--doctors, hospitals, and the rest. Some of these are electronic medical records so that there is a continuity of knowledge as to what happened, what was provided, what services were provided to the individual.                              {time}  1730  Another one happens to be a penalty assessed on hospitals for hospital readmissions on hospital-acquired infections--profound in driving down the cost; also extremely important for individuals because hospital infection rates dramatically dropped.  There are also ways in which we pay for the services. It is very clear that the utilization of fee-for-service drove up the cost.  Anyway, as we go through this discussion today on the Affordable Care Act, and I see I am being joined by my colleagues here, I just want us to keep in mind that in order to deal with the cost of premiums, you have got to deal with the cost of services that are provided.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, we actually saw, over the last 5 years as the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, went into effect, a decrease in the rate of increase. We haven't seen a decrease in the cost of medical services, but what we have seen is that the inflation rate has significantly reduced, so much so that the financial security of the Medicare program, which is the single biggest expenditure, has been extended by some 11 years because the inflation rate has declined--not decreased, but the rate of inflation has declined almost 50 percent from what it was before the Affordable Care  That is a direct result of the many reforms that went into the way in which medical services were delivered. That allowed for a lower inflation rate for premiums and an extension of the financial viability of Medicare and other medical programs.  Now, unfortunately, we are now faced with a repeal or a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and the promise has been made by my Republican colleagues that somehow this will reduce the premiums. Well, that is interesting. Now, exactly how are you going to reduce the premiums unless you are dealing with the cost of medical care?  In their reforms, there is--as best I can determine and everybody else--no effective way to reduce the cost of medical services and, in fact, the high probability that the cost of medical services will increase, specifically, because, in their proposed reform, men and women that are 45, 50 to 65 are going to find it virtually impossible to continue to buy insurance. They will drop their insurance. That is part of those 14 million Americans that will lose their insurance next year and part of the 24 million Americans that will not have insurance 9 years from now.  That population, before they get to Medicare, when they begin to get ill, 40, 50, 60, they will not be able to afford insurance. It is something like a $12,000 increase in cost to them. It is what is known as the senior tax.  Now, that will drive up the cost of medical services. Because they will not be able to have continuity of care, their diabetes, their heart issues, their high blood pressure, and on and on will not be treated.  Similarly, in the proposed reform, there is a significant reduction in the number of men and women across this Nation--and we are talking probably in the range of 4 to 6 million in the next 2 years that will not be covered under the Medicaid program. Those people, not having access to continuous medical services, will not seek treatment for those illnesses that can be treated effectively or held in abeyance, such as diabetes, heart disease, and the like. That means that the cost of medical care for them will rise.  Where will they go to get medical care? Not to worry, say our Republican colleagues. They can go to the emergency room. We have been there. We have seen what that means.  The expansion of the Medicaid program is unraveled by the proposed I am going to come back to this.

You are always there. And here you are once again this evening laying out the problems that we are going to see with  Let me just very quickly run through this, and then I would like to turn back to my colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. The proposal that is on the floor, we could just lay out five very succinct arguments on why it doesn't work.  I was going through a rather complete explanation of how the healthcare system works because it is kind of a basic understanding, but clearly, under the legislation that is going to be taken up this Thursday, Americans are going to pay more for less. And it is not just a few.  The senior citizens in Medicare are going to see a diminution in their benefits. We are looking at the 40-to 50-years-olds, which I have already discussed. We are looking at other individuals.  Pay more for less, we are looking, over the next 9 years, that 24 million Americans will lose their insurance or their opportunity to get insurance. And just this next year, just 18 months from now--excuse me, not 18 months from now. Nine months from now, we are going to see 14 million people begin to lose their insurance.  I talked earlier about this age tax, which speaks to those people that are 50 to 65 years of age. They are, under this legislation, going to pay up to five times more than someone who is between 20 and 30 years of age.                              {time}  1745  Present law says they can be charged no more than three times what a 20- to 30-year-old pays, and so this is what is known as an age tax. It simply shifts the cost to those 40-, 50-, 60-year-old people who happen to be the most expensive. And I talked about the $12,000 that they will have to pay in addition to that.  It guts We call it Medi-Cal in California and Medicaid across the The expansion of Medicaid was an extraordinarily important event that provided insurance not only to men and women who had no income, but to 85 percent of the people on Medicaid across this Nation who are elderly, in nursing homes, or elderly poor, unable to provide sufficient income from just their Social Security--those are called the dual eligible--or children.  Now, in the Affordable Care Act, there was what was known as Medicaid expansion; and those are the working men and women, families, who have less than 138 percent of the poverty rate. So those are the low-income working men and women who are able to get Medicaid, or Medi-Cal insurance in It simply guts it in a variety of ways, which we will come back and discuss a little later.  You can bet and you can count on there being less support for the elderly that are in nursing homes. There will be less support for the young families; the single-mother families who are struggling to get along, probably going to school, trying to learn skills; and for[[Page H2282]]the working families who are at $10 an hour minimum wage.  Finally, this is the one that ought to drive Americans right off the rails. This is a whopping $270 billion tax reduction for the top 1 percent of It is for 400 families in America, the richest 400, four of which are in the current Trump administration, including the President himself.

This is obscene because the way in which this thing works, working men and women and families across America at every income level are going to get less. They are going to pay for more, and yet the superwealthy in America are going to get a whopping tax reduction. This is the income distribution that we should never have, to take from the poor, to take from the middle class, and give to the superwealthy. I will come back and discuss this.

The gentleman couldn't be more accurate about all that he said.  I was listening carefully to the story the gentleman from Rhode Island told of the individual who wrote him an email. I, too, have received many, many emails.  I was thinking, as he was describing the situation, of a woman who runs her own small farm near Marysville, California, in my district. For years, she could not afford insurance. She had a small orchard farm. She couldn't afford insurance. When she got sick, she went to the emergency room. She was able to get along.  But she knew that, as she approached 50 years of age, she would be facing a bad medical situation, and she did. She had cancer. She couldn't get a policy prior to the Affordable Care Act because she had a preexisting condition: she had cancer. Emergency rooms are not treating that. She wasn't able to get on a program, and she was going to die.  About that time, we established, in California, a covered California program that is an exchange based upon the Affordable Care She, because of her income, was able to get a comprehensive insurance policy and a subsidy for her premium. She then had quality insurance, and she was able to get the cancer treatment because her insurance had no preexisting conditions and she was able to afford it. She had to pay a little bit, but she had a subsidy that made up the difference.  She is now looking at a situation, because she is in that age 50 to 65, where she will not be able to afford a $12,000- or $14,000-a-year premium because the subsidies were taken out and because of this age tax, the 1-to-5 ratio rather than the 1-to-3 ratio. It is horrific. She knows what she is facing. She is facing the loss of her insurance and, quite possibly, the loss of her life.  This is wrong. This is wrong.

Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court helps recognize the diversity in geography, the diversity of our country, and it helps to recognize that indeed there are highly qualified jurists who reside west of the Mississippi  Judge Gorsuch is a fourth-generation He is a skier. He is a fly-fisherman. He serves on a court that represents 20 percent of our Nation's landmass.  Once confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will be only the second Coloradan to have ever served on the Nation's highest The first Coloradan to serve on the High Court was Justice Byron Justice Byron White also led the NFL in rushing, which is something Neil Gorsuch won't be able to claim when he is confirmed but is certainly something that makes his confirmation as the second Coloradan unique in our history. Should he be confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will also make history as he represents the first Generation X Justice of the U.Supreme Court, the emerging generation of American leadership.  Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court unanimously by voice vote in this Chamber in 2006. In fact, 12 current Democratic Senators did not oppose his confirmation, including three distinguished members of the Judiciary Ranking Member Feinstein, Senator Leahy, and Senator Durbin are all members of the Judiciary Committee who supported, through voice vote, his nomination. Eleven years ago, Senator Graham presided over an empty committee dais as Neil Gorsuch faced his confirmation in 2006. No one showed up. What a difference a court can make. The level of bipartisan support for his 2006 nomination is almost unheard of in today's political climate, but when you look at his record, his writings, and his statements, it is easy to see why Judge Gorsuch has such overwhelming support.  Judge Gorsuch is not an ideologue. He is a mainstream jurist who follows the law as written and doesn't try to supplant it with his own personal policy preferences. As he said, ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''  Judge Gorsuch is not an activist judge but, rather, a faithful adherent to and ardent defender of our Judge Gorsuch said that judges have a ``foundational duty'' to ``do more than merely consider [the Constitution]. . . . They take an oath to uphold it.''  The judge recognizes that the judiciary is not the place for social or constitutional experimentation and that efforts to engage in such experimentation delegitimize the As he said, ``This overweening addiction to the courtroom as the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the judiciary. . . . As a society, we lose the benefit of the give-and-take of the political process and the flexibility of social experimentation that only the elected branches can provide.''  Judge Gorsuch has a deep appreciation and respect for the constitutional principle of federalism and the separation of powers prescribed by our Founding As he stated, ``A firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-functioning democracy.''  Judge Gorsuch understands the advantage of democratic institutions and the special authority and legitimacy that come from the consent of the governed. As he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''  Judge Gorsuch appreciates the rule of law and respects the considered judgment of those who came before him. As he said, ``A good judge will seek to honor precedent and strive to avoid its disparagement or displacement.''  It is this appropriate temperament, this fidelity to the Constitution, this remarkable humility that has made Judge Gorsuch such a consensus pick among Colorado's diverse legal and legislative communities.  Former Colorado Senator, Democrat Ken Salazar, Secretary of the Interior under Barack Obama, in praising Judge Gorsuch's temperament, said during his circuit court confirmation:       [A] judicial nominee should have a demonstrated dedication      to fairness, impartiality, precedent, and the avoidance of      judicial activism--from both the left and the right. I      believe that Mr.Gorsuch meets this very high test.  A very prominent Colorado lawyer and former adviser to President Bill Clinton said:       Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy, and deep regard for the      Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked      with him and have seen firsthand his commitment to basic      principles. Above all, this independence, fairness, and      impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-     earned reputation.  Hundreds of prominent liberal and conservative Colorado attorneys support Judge Gorsuch, writing this bipartisan letter of support praising the judge:       We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,      Democrats, and Many of us have been critical of      actions taken by President Nonetheless, we all agree      that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join      the Supreme He deserves an up-or-down vote.  The people who know him best in Colorado--they have worked with him[[Page S1872]]in the Tenth Circuit Court, and they have worked with him in private practice--believe that he deserves an up-or-down vote, believe that he is exceptionally well qualified to join the Supreme  One of the individuals, one of the lawyers, one of the Democrats who signed that very letter, who wrote this phrase, was a Democrat who was the cochairman of the host committee for the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 that saw the nomination of then-Senator Barack Obama to be the Democratic candidate for the 2008 ticket.  Colorado's former Democratic Governor Bill Ritter and former Republican Attorney General John Suthers jointly said:       It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and      exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he      or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and      will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical      judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.  Judge Gorsuch has a consistent record of applying the law fairly, and his reputation among his peers and lawmakers is evidence of it.  According to the Denver Post, Marcy Glenn, a Denver attorney and Democrat, recalls two cases before Gorsuch in which she represented underdogs, and she said: ``He issued a decision that most certainly focused on the little guy.''  That same article cited another example. ``Judge Gorsuch can't be pigeonholed as either pro-prosecution or pro-defense,'' said Peter Krumholz, a Denver appellate attorney who reviewed the nominee's criminal law record. ``He is very independent and will not hesitate to rule in favor of a criminal defendant's rights when he thinks it's warranted by the Constitution.''  For all these reasons cited today and the many reasons that have been cited over the past several weeks, I am certain Judge Gorsuch will make Colorado proud and that his opinions will have a positive impact on this country for generations to come.  I look forward to Judge Gorsuch receiving a fair hearing today, tomorrow, and after that, to working with my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expeditiously confirm his nomination.  Thomas Hornsby Ferril, a great poet laureate, wrote another poem. This one is memorialized on a mural painted in the rotunda of the Colorado capitol. It ends with these words: ``Beyond the sundown is tomorrow's wisdom. Today is going to be long, long ago.''  The wisdom of Neil Gorsuch, guardian of the Constitution, will serve our Nation well for generations to come.

1421,topic-id,1807,"Mr.President, over the past several days, the American people have had a chance to participate in the Supreme Court nomination process by watching Judge Neil Gorsuch, judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Denver, take questions from the Judiciary For several days now, there have been hearings, with the Judiciary Committee's meeting 12 hours yesterday or so and, the day before, there being a number of speeches from every member of the Judiciary I and Senator Bennet, my colleague from Colorado, had the great privilege of introducing Judge Gorsuch on Monday to the Senate Judiciary  I think what people across the country are seeing in this confirmation process is a judge who has a keen grasp of the law, a judge who understands the limits of power that are placed on the judicial branch, understands the role of the executive branch, understands the role of the legislative branch, and how he as a judge is supposed to rule when it comes to checking that balance of power.  We also see, of course, after 12 hours of questioning--everything from the kind of temperament he has to the kinds of decisions he would make--that he is an even-tempered individual who would serve this country well. So I come to the floor again to talk about my support for Judge  Eleven years ago, this Chamber unanimously confirmed Judge Gorsuch through a voice vote for his position in 2006 on the Tenth Circuit Judge Gorsuch has been described as a ``brilliant legal mind'' by the Denver Post and both liberal and conservative attorneys in He is a mainstream jurist who has the right temperament and the right view of judging in order to be on the Supreme Court, according to the Denver  Moreover, Judge Gorsuch is a faithful and ardent defender of our Constitution, a judge who has, time and again, shown a fidelity to the separation of powers and the limited role of government that was envisioned and prescribed by our  It is no wonder that Judge Gorsuch has always enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, 12 of our current Senate colleagues, including minority leader Senator Schumer and[[Page S1906]]Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Durbin, all of whom are on the Judiciary Committee, were in office in 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to the Tenth None of them opposed his confirmation--none of them.  Perhaps the best question for them today would be: Do you regret that decision 11 years ago? Did you not do enough work to know the nominee then?  When Senator Graham held his committee hearing 11 years ago--the confirmation process--no one else showed up. It was an empty dais. If you tuned in to watch C-SPAN on Monday or Tuesday, you saw a different level of participation from the Judiciary What a difference a court makes. So I hope this process is one that will be shown to be fair to the American people--this process of getting to know Judge Gorsuch's temperament and his legal philosophy, but not 1 of the 12 Democratic Members who are here today and who were here in 2006 voted against him in 2006.  The approval of Judge Gorsuch was also in addition to a few other colleagues who have since left. We were joined at that time--Judge Gorsuch was supported at that time by then-Senator Barack Obama, by then-Senator Joe Biden, by then-Senator Hillary Clinton, and, at that point, by Senator John Kerry, all of whom participated in the confirmation process of Judge Gorsuch 11 years ago and all of whom did not oppose his nomination on the floor of the U.It shouldn't come as a surprise, if you have been paying attention to the confirmation process, to watch a mainstream consensus pick for the Supreme Court answer questions. From when the hearings began--of course, just a couple days ago--I think, since then, we have seen overwhelming bipartisan support emerge publicly in the Senate, once again, and we will see that emerge over the next several weeks.  Several of our colleagues from across the aisle have already indicated they believe Judge Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote, and I hope that will continue. A fair shake in this process is what we are asking for. I wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues from across the aisle that he deserves a fair shake and an up-or-down vote. Let's give him that fair shake. Let's give him that up-or-down vote. Let's make sure the process remains fair, and let's give it in a timely fashion.  Let's also give the American people a fair shake. Let's not forget that Judge Gorsuch is their choice for the Supreme The American people rejected the previous administration's nominee and instead chose Judge We should respect the will of the American people.  Today, I would also like to speak about Judge Gorsuch's jurisprudence on the separation of powers and the administrative state. Under the previous administration, I, like many Coloradans and many of my distinguished Senate colleagues, grew worried as we watched continued administrative overreach. We watched 8 years of continued administrative overreach, agency overreach, and a judiciary that was ill-suited, or not inclined, to push back on the executive branch's unconstitutional overreach.  As James Madison warned us in Federalist 47, ``The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.''  It is, therefore, James Madison concluded, that the separation of powers must be a ``sacred maxim of free government.''  That is what we are seeing in this debate over the confirmation of Judge Through his writing, Judge Gorsuch undoubtedly recognizes this sacred maxim of free government. The questions he is receiving and the answers he is giving talk about that sacred maxim of free government.  His body of work indicates, one, an understanding that there are clear constitutional limits to administrative agency power; two, it also demonstrates and illustrates a willingness to ensure agencies do not exceed their statutory authority; three, a genuine concern for the due process of regulated parties, which rightly requires these parties to receive clear notice on the scope of the regulations they must follow; and, four, a recognition that there are constitutional limits on the lawmaking responsibilities that Congress can delegate to the executive branch.  Remember, going back to the founding of our country and the arguments that took place over the type of government we should have, this Nation started first with the Articles of Confederation and this loose collection of States--States that were able to print their own money, States that were able to raise their own militia because they feared the power of tyranny; they feared the power of centralized government that the British monarch represented, but that loose Confederation wasn't working so our Founders realized they had to go back to the drawing board to come up with something different.  So in the late 1700s--1787, 1788--we saw this great debate break out published across the pages of papers in New York and throughout the country as the anti-Federalists and the Federalists began debating what kind of a government we should have. We had to recognize that too much government was a bad thing, but we also recognized that when we were too loose with that government, then it wouldn't function either.  So James Madison and others who had gotten together recognized that we should put forward a different type of government, and they did so in the Constitution, but they did it amongst guidance by people like James Madison and Federalist 47. They did so understanding that one branch of our government wouldn't gain an unfair advantage over another branch of the government.  As the years since that debate in 1789 took place, we have seen that there has been a mission creep, so to speak; that there has been a branch overreach, as the executive branch has grown in power at the expense of the legislative branch. I wish I could say that was all the fault of the executive branch, but it certainly hasn't been. At times, the legislative branch has yielded too much power and too much authority. Instead of doing its job, the legislative branch has given that authority to the executive branch. Of course, the executive branch hasn't just pushed it away, saying: No, don't do that. They have taken it. Both Republicans and Democrats, over the past several years, have done exactly that, but it has hurt our balance of powers, and it has hurt that very idea enshrined in Federalist 47; that we have to make sure the same hands don't hold all the power of government, leading to that maxim of free government.  So a judge who understands and who will rule that there are clear constitutional limits to administrative agency power is an important philosophy. It is an important approach that a judge would have. A judge who is showing a willingness to ensure that agencies don't exceed their statutory authority--we need that in our Nation's We need that on our Nation's High Court to restore the balance of power. We need someone with a genuine concern for due process, someone who recognizes that there are constitutional limits on lawmaking responsibilities that Congress can delegate to the executive branch. That is why it is important we talk about the views of Judge Gorsuch and the questions he is being asked because his views are rooted in the Constitution--very mainstream rules that are rooted in the Constitution, mainstream views that should ease any concerns our colleagues on the other side of the aisle may have about Judge  As Judge Gorsuch explained in his famous concurring opinion on the deference given to administrative agencies interpretations, the so-called Chevron doctrine, he said:       We managed to live with the administrative state before      We could do it again. Put simply, it seems to me      that in a world without Chevron very little would change--     except perhaps the most important things.  That maxim of free government, that balance of power, the separation of powers, the limits on the administrative agency powers, it is something that I think we have to focus more time on, to restore the role we are supposed to play. We need to restore the role we are not just supposed to play but the role we are mandated by the Constitution to fulfill.[[Page S1907]]  For these reasons, and many others I have shared on the floor, I look forward to working with my distinguished Democratic colleagues to make sure Judge Gorsuch gets that fair shake and that timely up-or-down vote and I certainly hope the bipartisan support he deserves.

Some think it is a day just for drinking, but Patrick is remembered not because he drank, not because of frivolity, but because he was a dedicated Christian committed to serving the I think it is good on Patrick's Day to remember why he was a saint.                              {time}  1245  Now going 180 degrees from talking about saints, Mr.Speaker, I think it is worth discussing the decision made by a Federal judge in Hawaii, also in We have judges who have become dictators. We have judges who have ceased to abide by the They have widely applied themselves as politicians, though they do not run for office.  A true judge, a conscientious and ethical judge, would review a document such as the President's executive order for what it is, what it says, what it does. Intent is not an issue. What does it do?  The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was seeking and is seeking to protect Americans, but we have judges who are not interested in protecting Americans so much as they are patronizing and sucking up to the liberals in the country: those in the media, those in entertainment, those in their highbrow circles. They are not interested in following the Constitution or the law.  We had a hearing in the Committee on the Judiciary on the Ninth Circuit this week. The Ninth Circuit apparently is the most overturned circuit in the country. It has a massive number more cases filed in their circuit than any other circuit. In fact, I have now filed a bill that would divide the Ninth Circuit so that the Ninth Circuit would be comprised of California only, and then all the other States--Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming I believe is in, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, and territories--I may have missed a State, but all of the other States and territories would be in a new 12th The judges who are currently on the 12th Circuit Court in my bill--who are currently part of the Ninth Circuit would remain with the Ninth We would have a new circuit, and the judges would be appointed by the current  I know there are a lot of people in California who have great sympathy for that, have been begging for years to be carved out of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because their destructive, unconstitutional decisions are doing great harm to those who believe in the Constitution as written, not as some liberal judge thought it might should be as he tries or she tries to play up to friends at their get-togethers. They would be hailed as being so wise, but the truth is, as Scripture talks about, these are people who are wise in their own eyes, but they are doing great harm to the United States of  When anyone in any kind of leadership position loses their common sense, they are educated beyond common sense--they educate common sense completely out of some folks in the United States now--we have problems. And anytime people are educated and taught to believe that what instinctively they knew or were taught was not the right thing to think, and those people become leaders in the country, that country speeds up in its travel down the road to the dustbin of history.  No nation has ever lasted forever. No nation ever will in this world. It is not going to happen. So the question is, from its founding, how long does it go? It depends on how long the leaders of that nation can keep good sense within their consideration in making decisions. That is not happening. Good sense is not being used by judges who have assumed powers they never had, were never given.  Under the Constitution, the powers regarding refugees, immigration, those decisions are left to the Some judge may say, oh, you can't consider religion, but indeed any judge that so says is completely wrong. Thank God religion has been considered many times, as when Jews were being persecuted and killed, it was appropriate to say that we want to welcome Jews out of those horrors as refugees, bring them in. But this Nation is being put at risk by judges who are wise in their own eyes.  Now, there is an article here about the Hawaii judge. It is in The It was written by Les Carpenter, Oliver Laughland, and Liz It was written apparently before the decision was made.  ``U.district judge Derrick Watson is one of several judges hearing arguments over the ban in the final hours before its implementation. He said on Wednesday afternoon after hearing oral arguments that he would issue a written ruling before 6pm Hawaii time. Hawaii was the first state to challenge the second version of Trump's travel ban, after the first was halted by court order.  ``The state has argued that the ban is unconstitutional, and that it will suffer damage to its local economy and to various educational and religious institutions. It also argued that some Hawaiians will be prevented from reuniting with family members swept up in the ban.''  That is heart rending, but the fact is none of those are a basis for reversing a Presidential executive order that Congress and the Constitution together gave the President to issue.  We also find from comments that the courts didn't look to the four corners of the document and look what the document says because many of us know that as long as the Constitution is the foundational bedrock for the[[Page H2176]]country, we have a solid foundation. But when we have judges like this Derrick Watson or the judge from Maryland or James Robart, who issued a ban in the first travel order, when they don't pay attention to the Constitution but pay more attention to what they hear from their liberal friends who are disgusted by the elected President of the United States, and they know they will be heroes, and they long for the accolades of the intelligentsia, which actually isn't the intelligent--educated, yes; intelligent, no.  The Constitution gives certain powers to certain parts of the government. Congress has the power to make decisions on immigration, migration, naturalization, but it has the power to delegate those responsibilities as it sees fit to the President, and it has done so. The President has certain powers of his own office, of his own right to protect the United States of But these judges think that you should not consider the fact that one of the most educated people in the world on what Islam is and what it isn't says the Islamic State is He has a Ph.in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad, as I recall, and he happens to be the head of the Islamic  But the judge would have us disregard the fact that a man who spent his life studying Islam, Koran, the Holy Koran because the Koran that is brought around to some of our offices, they take out verses that have to do with violence against those who are not Muslims, but the Holy Koran he spent his life studying, but these judges would say, oh, no, no, you can't consider the fact that these radical Islamists claim to be Muslim or Islamists, you can't consider that.  One article out this week pointed out that somebody should tell these judges that the terrorists coming in from the nations designated by the President are They are not They are not They are not secularists. They are radical It is ridiculous to have to continually state the obvious that we all know, that all Muslims are not a threat to the United States, but it is absurd not to understand that those who in the name of Allah are killing, beheading, torturing, trying to destroy a free society in the name of Allah, they should not be allowed into the United If they are U.citizens and their goal is to supplant the U.Constitution with sharia law, that is treasonous.  That is why I was so pleased with President Sisi, as a Muslim leader, telling a room full of imams: We have got to stand up to the radicals who have hijacked our religion. President Obama didn't know that. He kept continuing to say that, oh, no, the Islamic State, it is not Islamic, these Islamic terrorists are not Islamic, when actually wise Muslim leaders like President Sisi, they understand, yes, these people are They claim it in the name of They claim it in the name of the Holy Koran, but they have hijacked our religion, and it is time to stand up to them. As long as we have world leaders who are, metaphorically speaking, without clothes, and nobody has the nerve among the world leaders to say: you are naked, put on some clothes. Again, for those who are educated beyond their intellectual level, that means you have got to call it like it is and don't just go along to play to the crowd, the media, the Hollywood types. Stand up and call it like it is. We have a President who is trying to do that.                              {time}  1300  There is no doubt, as Justice Scalia said about one of the ill-advised decisions previously made by the Supreme Court, this will end up costing American lives. These decisions, if they are allowed to stand, by these unconstitutional judges will cost American lives, and the blood will be on the judges' hands in their pursuit of accolades and popularity among the neo-intellectual elite. They left common sense behind and put our Nation at risk. It is tragic.  I have the two decisions from the courts--one from the District of Hawaii and one from the District of But it is interesting. In this article I was reading, Mr.Speaker, it says the judge, within just a matter of brief hours, was going to have this 42- or 43-page decision made. Let's see. This is the Hawaii decision, 43 pages. It seems to me somebody must have been working on that before oral arguments. The decision must have been worked on before that to have a 43-page decision just within a matter of a few hours.  But let's face it, the litigant surely knew before they ever had a hearing what the judge surely knew before the hearing--that he was biased, prejudiced, and was in no way going to have a fair hearing. He was going to end up ridiculing the President of the United States, and unwittingly, witlessly, putting America at risk.  We have testimony here from the FBI Director saying: We will vet these people, but we have nothing against which we can check the information they give us. Yeah, we will vet them, but we got nothing to check their information against.  As Director Comey pointed out: At least in Iraq, we had government records from Iraq, we had the criminal records. But in Syria, since the Obama administration was so diametrically opposed to the Assad administration in Syria, well, the official government certainly wasn't sharing information. And since this administration said we were going to stop the Islamic State--even though we did nothing from the administration decisions, at least, but help the Islamic State grow bigger and strong, and kept sending weapons, material to what the Obama administration thought or said were our friends and allies, but actually ended up repeatedly allowing the weaponry, the heavy artillery tanks, to fall into the hands of the Islamic State--well, the Islamic State was not sharing the information they had about the people of  And, in fact, Mr.Baghdadi made clear that they were going to get some of their best warriors mixed in with refugees, and they surely have. When you have judges who close their eyes, wet their finger, and hold it up for liberal friends to blow on so they know which direction they should move, well, we get bad decisions that put the Nation at risk.  For those of us who spent much of our lives studying history, it is very clear. Since you know no nation lasts forever, then you look at important milestones along the rise and along the demise, and these are the kind of decisions that lead to a country's demise. When you refuse to recognize what your enemies say--that they are your enemies, they are going to destroy your way of life, they are going to get refugees who are terrorists into your country--because you are so stupid you don't know how to defend yourself, you want to pat yourselves on the back for being so open-minded and open-doored that you allow your killer to come in and kill you, just like the proverbial song and tale taking in a snake, warming it, bringing it back to life, and it bites the rescuer; or the tale of the tortoise carrying the scorpion across the water and then getting stung. When people tell you they despise your way of life, they are going to bring your way of life down. When their documents tell you that they believe that you are infidels and need to be destroyed, there has to be somebody at the top of the country's leadership that understands the risk and stands up to protect the country.  And when people like these judges take the Constitution into their own hands, rip it up, and say, ``I don't care what restrictions we have on us, I don't have any restrictions, I am a Federal judge for life,'' well, that is only so long as the judge has good behavior. And these judges have not had good behavior. They have taken powers under themselves--their name might as well be Chavez or Morsi--taking power into their own hands that they were never supposed to have.  But at least in the case of Chavez and, possibly, Morsi, they won elections. There was a great deal of fraud involved in Morsi's election. It was questionable whether he actually won. The threats eliminated any contest to the election results. But the 30 million or so that went to the streets and demanded his ouster in Egypt, the greatest public step in world history, demanded the removal of an unconstitutional leader in world history. There has never been 30 million people go to the streets peaceably. It wasn't all peace. But the part that wasn't peace was caused by the Muslim That is why they have been labeled as a terrorist organization, and that is why the United States should label them as a terrorist organization.  Regardless of what anybody thinks about President Trump, his order was[[Page H2177]]an attempt to protect Americans against judges who think they are unaccountable because we haven't impeached near enough and who become dictators and seize power that was never given to them.  I have got a bill we are preparing that would eliminate any jurisdiction for any Federal court other than the Supreme Court to take up an issue involving immigration of refugees, other than immigration courts, but not on a constitutional level, not to issue an injunction to stop a congressional action or a Presidential action. That would have to come from the Supreme Court, and that is the way it ought to be.  When the Constitution was written, there was only one Federal court provided for. That was the United States Supreme Any other court that is Federal in this country owes its life, its jurisdiction, to the U.As some have said in other applications, ``We brought them into the world and we can take them out,'' as far as their courts are concerned; and we need to do that. We need to take their courts out of the business of making decisions that overrule congressional and Presidential action on refugees and our national security when it is involved with those refugees.  At a hearing that Alid Perez and Steve King, my friend from Iowa, set up and held yesterday, there were very touching stories of Christians, Yazidis, the persecution of Jews in the Middle We heard from people that know what it is to be persecuted by radical They see how stupid the policies have been in this country.  We heard from one of the people in the Homeland Security Department that with the massive millions of dollars that Congress appropriated to be used in countering violent extremism, an inarticulate euphemism, that we have spent millions on things like teaching young school choirs Muslim songs. Now, that is one of the contributing factors to the senseless Orlando killings, the San Bernardino killings, the Boston marathon killings--choirs. A contributing factor is that we have wasted millions of dollars, maybe billions, on outreach programs that should not necessarily be the role of some parts of our law enforcement.  I challenged FBI Director Mueller that they had not even gone to the mosque where Tsarnaev went to find out if his pattern had changed, if his behavior had changed, you know, if he was memorizing more and more scripture than he ever had.  We often hear after these shootings, these killings, or these bombings take place: Well, he was becoming more and more religious.  Well, that can be an indication that somebody has become radicalized. There are a number of factors.  Kim Jensen from the FBI, who prepared 700 pages or so on training people how to spot radical Islamists, well, he had his 700 pages purged from training materials for a long period of time. Finally, they realized somebody really needs to know what radical Islam is. They allowed some of the training materials to be used again--maybe all of them--but only for a limited number of FBI agents, as I understand it. We had material that was removed during the purge of our State Department, Homeland Security Department, intelligence departments, agencies, during the purge of their training materials, removed what our Federal agents need to know in order to be able to spot if somebody is no longer a peace-loving Muslim but now has been radicalized and wants to kill American infidels.  There are things that can be spotted if you know what to look for. We have people that know how to train for those things. Phil Haney with Homeland Security knew. With this scientific methodology of finding the connections between radical Islamists, as we have heard publicly, he had identified 800 who may have terrorist ties--reviewed 400, where nearly every one of them ended up being named on the terrorist watch list, but the other 400 were not ever analyzed.                              {time}  1315  No telling how many of those potential terrorist individuals may actually kill people, kill Americans some day, if they haven't already.  Although Secretary Napolitano said we get pinged and we connect the dots, yet she was Secretary when somebody high--maybe her, but probably someone else--was eliminating the dots, thousands of pages of dots, dots representing terrorist ties. They wiped them out. They erased them.  Phil Haney saw it as it was happening, was able to capture much that was being deleted, that would allow us to know who in the United States has terrorist ties. Under President Obama, our ability to identify our enemy was greatly weakened, and now we have judges that will put us even further at risk.  But you see it repeatedly through history. When a nation's leaders begin to think they are so wise, so above the fray that they refuse to recognize a direct threat to the nation, then the nation is--it speeds up its trip to that dustbin of history. My continued hope and prayer is that this administration will reverse that slide.  I know there are many that say that you have a cycle--whether it was ancient Greece, Rome, other societies--where they pursue freedom, they have some freedom, they begin to lose freedom, they fall under a dictatorship, a totalitarian regime, and then the cycle goes on. But my reading of history leads me to believe perhaps it is more like, can be like, bell-shaped curves where you can go up, create more and more freedoms, have periods where you lose freedoms, but if you have a generation or two that stands up and recaptures those freedoms, you could have another bell-shaped curve. It doesn't have to be a cycle where you completely lose your freedom. But the way we are headed, this will happen.  I was hearing from my friend Secretary Tom Price yesterday that there are 76,000 employees in Health and Human Services, and we are not talking about people that even put Band-Aids on those who need medical care. We are talking mainly about bureaucrats. That is one of the things that contributed so mightily to the increased cost of health care: so many more bureaucrats were being hired, had to be hired, more and more regulations.  You had IRS agents, by the thousands, that had to be hired in order to implement They weren't going to help anybody's health. They might actually cause problems with people's health--ulcers, at least.  But this Nation is at risk. We have gotten a reprieve, a chance to catch our breath, restore freedom.  As I have said before, for those who have read ``Nineteen Eighty-Four'' by George Orwell, the main thing that Orwell got wrong was the date, because we now have eyes in our homes wherever we are that are staring at us, allow the government to stare at us through our own computers, through our own smartphones. When watching the movie of ``1984,'' it actually is an eye like a picture, but what it really is these days, they are computer screens, smartphone screens. The government can watch any time it wants.  We were assured that the government would not be watching like that unless they followed the law or got a FISA court warrant, but Edward Snowden showed that--those of us who heard testimony and heard statements from people in authority about what they would do and not do--has been proven to be false.  That became clear to me when I saw the affidavit seeking a warrant for all of Verizon's data on all of their customers, all of their calls, all of the information, because the Fourth Amendment says it has to be with particularity. You have got to be specific, what it is you are seeking, make sure there is probable cause to believe a crime is being committed and this person committed it, and that there is evidence to show that that is being sought, and then you get the warrant.  That is the way I reviewed applications for warrants repeatedly when I was a judge, but not anymore. No, no. A guy comes in, swears to a FISA court judge that at one time I had great trust in because we were assured, hey, these are appointed--nominated, at least--confirmed Federal judges. They would never violate the Well, we found out that is just not true. They became a rubber stamp.  So the particularity in the affidavit we saw was: We need all the information on all the customers Verizon has. The FISA judge, supposedly out there to protect Americans' private information, said: Oh, well, that is particular enough. You want everything, all of the numbers, all of the information.[[Page H2178]]Okay, here is the order. Here is the warrant. Verizon, turn over everything you have got on all the numbers you have.  Well, so much for protection of our rights by the FISA court. We now know we are not protected by the FISA court. We can't trust the FISA court.  As I said in our hearing last week--well, I have said it publicly--unless our intelligence agencies produce the culprits who violated the law and did not follow the law in masking the name, minimizing the transcripts, unless our intelligence agencies can root out the people that have been violating the law, I will vote against a reauthorization of 702.  I know they say: Well, we need all of this power to keep us safe. But we have competing interests here. On the one hand, we have a government that yearns to be bigger and bigger and know more and more until it knows everything about everybody; and on the other hand, we have got people wanting to be safe and wanting their government to protect them. So there has to be a balance.  But when government officials can get every bit of information about your private life, then why do we even need a Congress? You have got bureaucrats making your decisions, know all about you. Might as well let them make the rest of your personal decisions. They know everything else you know.  So we are living in a dangerous time, but the judges have got to be reined in. I hope that my colleagues will join us in restricting the ability of a district or circuit court, any Federal court other than the Supreme Court, taking up these types of national security issues involving refugees or immigrants, because it looks like that is the best thing we can do at this time.  In the meantime, I do intend to review more information about these two judges from Hawaii and Maryland--any others that may join hands as they jump off the cliff--and see if their conduct seems to be sufficiently bad conduct to require their removal from office.  I know this will be looked at as a political thing, but it is not. We are talking about the freedoms of every Democrat, every Republican, everybody that is not identified with a party--every The judges have overtaken the  In the name of political correctness, we have ended up, apparently, according to the information that is coming out, allowing people who happen to be Muslim to have total access to our congressional computer systems. This article from March 15 in the Conservative Review by Luke Rosiak--and apparently, he has done a great deal of digging on this story. He seems to have more stories about it.  Well, let me touch on the one from March 13:  ``Congressional IT staffers who are the subject of a criminal investigation into misusing their positions had full access to Members' `correspondence, emails, confidential files,' and there was almost no tracking of what they did, a former House technology worker said.  ``Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldn't be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so Members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said.  ``Awan ran technology for multiple House Democrats, and soon four of his relatives--including brothers Abid and Jamal--appeared on the payroll of dozens of other Members''--of Congress--``collecting $4 million in taxpayer funds since 2010.  ``U.Capitol Police named him and his relatives as subjects of a criminal probe on February 2, and banned them from the complex's computer networks. But Members of Congress for whom they worked have downplayed their access or publicly ignored the issue.''  And, of course, the reason is no one wants to be seen as a racist. Islam, being Muslim, is not a race; it is a religion. And for some, it is not only a religion, it is a form of government that some--fortunately, a minority--think should replace our own  Anyway, the article goes on: `` `They had access to everything. Correspondence, emails, confidential files--if it was stored on the Member's system, they had access to it,' the former House Information Resources technology worker with first-hand knowledge of Imran's privileges told The Daily Caller News  ``Technology employees who work for Members must initially get authority from HIR, a component of the House's chief administrative officer, which maintains campus-wide technology systems.  ``There were some things--like access to the House email system that were totally controlled by the technicians at In order for certain permissions to be granted, a form was required to ensure that there was a paper trail for the requested changes. Imran was constantly complaining that he had to go through this process and trying to get people to process his access requests without the proper forms. Some of the permissions he wanted would give him total access to the Members' stuff.''  And again, he used the threat of calling someone bigoted because he was Muslim if he was not given the total access that this person now being investigated as a criminal said he needed.  And it is amazing how many people gave him the full access he wanted without the proper credentials, without the proper background investigation, because no one wanted to be called bigoted since he was                              {time}  1330  `` `IT staff at HIR can be tracked for every keystroke they make,' the worker said. But by comparison, `when these guys were granted access to the Member's computer systems there is no oversight or tracking of what they may be doing on the Member's system. For example they could make a copy of anything on the Member's computer system to a thumb drive or have it sent to a private server that they had set up and no one would know.'  ``That raises questions about why Members are so quick to brush off the seriousness of the investigation.''  Mr.Speaker, as you know, we are not hearing a lot of people talk about it. We are not seeing a bunch of stories about it. But this is critical to the ongoing of Congress' actions. You can't have privileged communications that allow us to know what is going on in the departments, agencies, over which we have oversight--you can't have access to that kind of information.  The wrong people know everybody we talk to, everything that is said. They know how to fend off and best come after They know how to manipulate us and do so so much easier and better. You don't have to be Russian, apparently, to get access to the Democratic National Committee's emails.  I am still really interested to know if any of these five who didn't have proper background investigations, that worked on so many of our Democratic friends' computer systems, if they possibly helped set up the Democratic National Committee's computer system.  `` `After being notified by the House Administration Committee, Abid was removed from our payroll.' '' This is a quote. `` `We are confident that everything in our office is secure,' Hilarie Chambers, chief of staff for Democratic Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, told  ``Multiple House IT workers said it is impossible for Members' offices to make that judgment, and that Capitol Police--who are running an investigation that involves cybercrimes and current and potential international fugitives, despite their primary duties being providing physical security--aren't capable of determining what actually occurred either.  ``The Capitol Police web page listing their authority, scope of work, and expertise does not mention the word `computers.'  ``A Fairfax County, Virginia, police report shows that the brothers' stepmother called the police on them in January, and a relative said Imran has been out of the country attempting to access assets stored in Pakistan in his deceased father's name. The relative said they forced her to sign power of attorney documents against her will.  ``After naming them as suspects in a criminal investigation, the Capitol Police have not taken their passports or arrested them. The brothers previously took a $100,000 loan from a fugitive wanted by U.authorities, Ali Al-Attar, who has fled to Iraq and been linked to Hezbollah.''[[Page H2179]]  Just gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, Mr.Speaker, that we have got people with ties owing money to known associates of the Hezbollah terrorist organization and their having full access to Members' computers.  This says: ``Imran ran technology for Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz--who resigned as head of the Democratic National Committee after a disastrous email hack that was blamed on Russians--and had the password to an iPad used for DNC business.  ``Politico described the investigation this way: `Five House staffers are accused of stealing equipment from Members' offices without their knowledge and committing serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network.'  ``But it later said Hill staffers were downplaying the information security component, writing, `Sources close to the House investigation said the former staffers, while able to view some Member data, did not have access to any classified information.'  ``That description rankled multiple House IT workers, who told TheDCNF those semantics misleadingly made it seem like they didn't have access to extremely sensitive information.  `` `Classified' is a terminology used by spy agencies and other executive branch agencies, not generally Congress, with the exception of the Intelligence The full email correspondence and hard drives of Members of Congress are nonetheless sensitive, extremely private, and likely to contain privileged information of the utmost import.  ``And an email need not deal with national security to open that Member to blackmail or extortion. All a rogue IT staffer would need to do was threaten to release emails that were politically embarrassing.  ``The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers' access didn't span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions.  `` `When a new Member begins, they guide them on everything from which computer system to purchase to which constituent management system to go with and all other related hardware purchases. Then they install everything and set up all the accounts and grant all the required permissions and restrictions,' the staffer said.  `` `In effect, they are given administrative control of the Members' computer operations. They then set up a remote access so they can connect from wherever they are and have full access to everything on the Member's system.'  ``Numerous Members of Congress who employed the suspects wouldn't say whether they've been fired or what steps they've taken to examine whether their information is safe.''  Spokesmen for a number of Members of Congress ``all ignored requests or refused to say.  ``The central IT worker said they were ignoring the problem in the hopes that it will go away, but that their apathy speaks to the problem.  `` `Unfortunately, as the recent election has shown, security of computer systems on the Hill is not really taken seriously.' ''  So we are told now, this article from March 15, says that the Capitol Police are getting outside help. We will see.  Might I inquire how much time I have?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes remaining.  ",CREC-2017-03-17-pt1-PgH2175-3.txt,1801,VETERANS 2ND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,17.0,March
650,topic-id,919,"Mr.Speaker, in my remaining time, I want to address the question of  Two years ago when Joe Biden was Vice President, making him President of the Senate, there was a compromise. Instead of doing complete and full repeal of ObamaCare as Republicans have been promising for years, there was a compromise: All right. We will take out all but the regulatory authority, those things that actually caused the greatest increase and expense.  But it didn't change the fact, Mr.Speaker, that we had made a pledge to America that I didn't help write but our leaders of the Republican Party in the House did, and it said: Because the new healthcare law kills jobs, raises taxes, increases the cost of health care, we will immediately take action to repeal this law. Then it goes into some detail about that.  Then we know we had A Better Way, Speaker Ryan, our leadership, current leadership's Better And this was from June 22 of 2016.  The plan begins by laying out five principles. It begins by repealing That is all of it as its first principle. And the last sentence of the paragraph says: ``We need a clean start in order to pursue the patient-centered reforms the American people deserve.''  That is exactly right, and I was glad that our leadership of our party put that in there because we needed a full repeal.  But 2 years ago, it wasn't a complete repeal. More so than what is being done now, in what we are being told is the new bill. It was more repeal then. But even then we wanted to do a full repeal, but we were told because Joe Biden could come over from the White House, come down Pennsylvania Avenue and take the presiding officer's seat straight down the hall, that he would likely rule that other part was not in compliance with the Byrd rule.  In essence, the Byrd rule basically means, if something is merely incidental in its effect on the budget instead of a direct effect on the budget, then it may not be considered under the procedure that was being used, and that procedure only requires 51 votes.  So the thing that everybody knew back then is, if it were a Republican in the presiding officer's seat, of course, would say all of this, especially the part that was taken out, would survive the Byrd rule because it is not just an incidental effect on the budget. It is the most dramatic effect on the budget of most any bill that Congress has ever taken up--dramatic and not incidental, dramatic.  And so now we are told: Look, everybody needs to get on board with this new bill that doesn't go as far as the one 2 years ago, and it leaves all these regulations and things, all that power. 1,400 times it says the Secretary will make the rules, regulations to implement the bill. But we are being told it is okay; you don't have to knock those out because now we have Secretary Price that can do that.  Well, for one thing, if he could, then that would mean when the next Secretary of Health and Human Services comes along and it is a Democrat, you can put them all back. We hadn't done anything. We didn't accomplish anything. We just had a little breather.  But we are also told the prices will likely continue up. There may be a 10 percent drop of the two to four times the healthcare costs, health insurance costs, at least, are increasing.  But since we know it will be a Republican in the chair, then the Republican in the chair in the Senate will be free to do the right thing and say, honestly, truthfully, absolutely, the repeal of all this regulatory massive mess is dramatically going to affect the budget, not incidentally. So it survives the Byrd rule. It stays in.  There are things that are in the new bill that probably won't survive that analysis that have been added.  Why don't we do what we promised for 7 long years, repeal all of ObamaCare? But we are told there is a second bucket, a second stage, where Secretary Tom Price--in whom I have got great faith because he knows health care, he knows healthcare law--can change those regulations.  Well, we also know that this is going to be taken to court very quickly. And even I, as the conservative appellate chief justice that I was at one time, would probably look at that and say wait a minute.  The law gives you the power to create regulations to implement the bill; it doesn't give you the power to make regulations that will destroy the bill. So it won't have to be a liberal judge that can knock down regulations.  I remember my late friend Justice Scalia not talking about a particular case, but talking about the issue of when Congress doesn't do something and has a lawsuit to do it instead, Justice Scalia said: If you guys in Congress don't have the guts to stop something you have the power to stop, don't come running over to the Supreme Court to demand we do it. You do your job. That is not our job.                              {time}  1345  And this is the case with It needs to be repealed--as Mitch McConnell said, root and branch. And it survives the Byrd Rule, and then we really help  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.[[Page H2180]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-03-17-pt1-PgH2175-3.txt,1801,VETERANS 2ND AMENDMENT PROTECTION ACT,2017.0,17.0,March
803,topic-id,2181,"Mr.Speaker, yes, this is an important week. There are a lot of things we are bringing up, but nothing is more important than the bill that is supposed to address the Affordable Care Act, as it was called. But it is kind of tough to call it that since it has been completely unaffordable for so many. So many lost their health insurance and lost their doctor. Some lost medication that they were taking before. It is now no longer approved under their new policy. So it has been a very difficult period of time as ObamaCare has been foisted on the country. It came so close to not passing.                              {time}  2100  And every Republican that I am aware of has promised: You give us the majority in both Houses and the President and we will repeal it. I believe Majority Leader McConnell said we will repeal it and rip it out root and branch. Republican leaders, I believe, mentioned lock, stock, and barrel. And I have great respect for my friends who were just speaking here, but I have got a real problem with the bill.  We are told there will be three phases, three buckets, three stages, whatever you want to call it. The first will be to pass this bill. It leaves in place the parts of ObamaCare that caused insurance to skyrocket. It is leaving in place the part of ObamaCare that caused deductibles to rise from very little to thousands and thousands of dollars, beyond so many Americans' ability to ever reach. So the insurance, they are paying them money every month, but they realize: I don't have $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 to pay the deductible; therefore, I am really paying for nothing. Especially young people have found this.  We are told that it is because the Senate has what they refer to as the Byrd rule that would not allow us to take the part that is not currently in the bill regarding all of the regulations. We are told that the Byrd rule--and we have looked into it, apparently--if a bill is moving under reconciliation, as this is, then in the Senate, in essence, it must do more than affect the budget incidentally; it must materially affect the budget. And yet we know that if we repeal all of the part that is being put off for stage 2 or 3, but particularly stage 2, the regulations that were put in place by the Obama administration, the regulatory authority that was given to them, by putting that off, it means the prices that dramatically skyrocketed, they are not going to skyrocket down.  We are told, well, they may go up some, but we think there is a good chance they will come down 10 percent. But for my constituents, so many of whom either lost their insurance or are now paying for skyrocketing prices two, three, four times or more than what they used to pay, a 10 percent drop will not be a help at all. Their deductibles will not be coming down anytime soon.  We are told, though, with the regulatory reform that my good friend Secretary Tom Price will do, that will be the phase, the stage, the bucket, that will drop the prices. But when I read through--and I know some people said 2,700 pages, my two part. And I have[[Page H2237]]gotten two copies, and they are both around 2,500 pages. So unless there are 200 pages I never found, I did read the bill more than once. And someone said 1,400 times. I don't know. I know it is a lot. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is given wide discretion in putting in place rules and regulations to implement the act.  We have heard that there will, no doubt, be, immediately, litigation filed, lawsuits filed, to try to overturn the regulations that are put in place by Secretary Well, since I have had experience in litigation, including Federal litigation, Federal appeals, what would be the issue?  Well, the issue would be whether or not the Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority to create regulations that will, in effect, completely destroy the bill so that eventually the prices will come back down, the deductibles eventually will come back down. That is what we are told. And I trust Secretary Price will do everything within his power to make this happen.  So Secretary Price will come forward with regulations that will emasculate the bill, emasculate Litigation is filed. Ultimately, at some point, it will come back to a judge, an appellate judge.  As a State district judge, I handled cases and matters that I knew were going to be appealed. As a chief justice of an appellate court, I made those decisions and sat in on discussions with other justices, and so it seems I am in a good position to potentially analyze what would happen on appeal.  We know the Secretary has wide discretion promulgating the regulations, the rules, to bring about the implementation and the intent of the ACA, But the question will be, on appeal: Does the Secretary of Health and Human Services have the authority, under the bill, to render it meaningless?  Now, I am not aware of justices at the appellate level who are a great deal more conservative than I was, but I believed in following the law even though I, at times, didn't like the law. I would not legislate from the bench. And in a case such as this, you would look, well, yes, the Secretary should have wide discretion to implement the intention of the bill and see that it is carried out.  But it would certainly seem the more powerful argument--perhaps, most likely, the winning argument--will be, yes, but he doesn't have discretion to kill the bill. He has discretion, wide discretion, to implement the bill and carry out the intent of the bill.  I just can't help but think, again, back to words from my late friend, Justice We weren't talking about a specific case, because he never betrayed the trust that he had as Associate Justice of the U.Supreme We were talking about things in general. He said at times it bothered him that Congress had the power to end some bill, to change some law, and yet we seem to put a rubber stamp and encourage people to go file a lawsuit to get the law struck down instead of just winning the vote in the House and Senate and repealing the law.  The words that really come back are: If you guys in Congress don't have the guts to do what needs to be done, that you have the power to do and you are supposed to do, don't come running to us over at the Supreme Court expecting us to do your job for you.  He was right. This body, along with the Senate, has the power to do exactly what we have promised for 7 years we would do if we got the House, the Senate, and the We would repeal  Now, I don't know how many there are of us that cannot vote for a bill that will leave in place the regulations and the parts that made our insurance skyrocket, that caused me to lose my insurance. And I wouldn't take the subsidy for 3 years until we got insurance through other means. The law is very clear that, as Members of Congress, we weren't supposed to get that, so I went without insurance for a few years. But we promised our constituents we would repeal  So what about, we are told, this part that can't make it through the Byrd rule in the Senate? Well, for one thing, 51 votes could change the Byrd rule. For another, there is nothing that is going to more materially affect the budget, in this reconciliation or any other, than bringing the price of health insurance and health care down dramatically. That is more appropriate under the Byrd rule than the whole other part that we are told will make it through the Byrd rule in the  The most important part is the part being left out. That will bring the prices down. That will give control back to the patients and the doctors. That will allow the States to come up with new ideas and new ways to provide health care and to get it to those who need it. But more important than anything, it restores freedom in America that has been lacking since that bill passed.  When the government is in charge of every Americans' health care, the government has every right to tell people how to live. Those claims from years past--we don't want the government in our bedroom--became rather hollow when ObamaCare passed and the government came into your bedroom, your dining room, everywhere in the house. It has got to be repealed. As Mitch McConnell has said previously, rip it out root and branch.  Who is going to make the decision on what seems so clear should allow all of ObamaCare to be repealed? Who is going to make that decision in the Senate?  Well, we know the Vice President can come right on down to the Capitol, come down Pennsylvania Avenue and come into the Senate He is the President of the Senate, and I couldn't be more thrilled that he is.  If he is unable to come, then the majority leader could sit in the chair, or he could appoint someone to sit in the chair pro tem. But it will be a Republican who decides whether or not all of ObamaCare can be repealed, but especially the part that is left out right now.  Mr.Speaker, I know the President is coming, and I am so glad that we have this chance because he is But I believe that the President of the United States who has been sold this bill that won't bring down prices--maybe 10 percent, we are told, some day--he deserves better. He does not deserve to be slapped in the face with a midterm election when prices have not come down, as people pushing this bill know they won't--maybe 10 percent. That is not going to change votes of those who know we promised a full repeal. We have the power to do a full repeal, and we should do a full repeal.                              {time}  2115  Let's get freedom back to a doctor-patient relationship. And from what I am told--they certainly haven't called me--I am told that the health insurance lobbyists have been very active, and people in our leadership are listening. But if that is true, these are the same people with Big Pharma that signed off on It meant they would make billions more than they ever had in the short term, but in the long term, they signed their own death warrant.  We owe it to the American people to make sure that insurance is viable for the future, and the only way to do that is to repeal ObamaCare, rip it out, root and branch. I like Mitch McConnell's expression. That is what needs to happen. And for those of my colleagues who are getting nervous about having pressure from the White House, pressure from the House leaders, pressure from the Senate leaders, it is nothing like the pressure you will get from your constituents when they find out you didn't really do anything to make their lives better because the prices are not coming down; the regulations that require all of those parts and policies that people don't want that they should have the freedom to choose, they are still there; and in the meantime, the new regulations by the great Secretary of Health and Human Services, in whom I have great faith, they will be tied up in litigation. Maybe they get to the Supreme Court in 2 years. Maybe they don't. Maybe it is longer.  And the American people continue to suffer because we didn't have the guts to do what we should do, what we promised we would do, and that is: Repeal  I would like to keep the Senate majority in 2018, and I am convinced that the only way we do that is if enough of us endure the name calling in the short term, and stand up and say no on this bill that doesn't keep our promises. It has got some good stuff in it, no question, but it doesn't keep our promises.[[Page H2238]]And if enough of us will do that, then maybe we can get the Senate and the House leadership to agree to do what we promised.

981,topic-id,1665,"Mr.Speaker, it has been an interesting couple of days. We heard from our President, and that was a great privilege this morning to hear from him at our We were reminded what an amazing victory President Trump had last Some said it was so very historic, maybe as historic going back clear to Andrew Jackson's victory in 1828.  That took me back, being a lover of history, being convinced over the years, as I majored in history in college because I knew out of the Army 4 years, when I finished that, I figured I would major in what I loved, and that was history. Although my mother thought I should have majored in math or either been a doctor or a college math professor.  But history I loved, and I continue to learn from history. The old adage is those who refuse to learn from history are destined to repeat it. The corollary that is not as well known is those who[[Page H2279]]do learn from history will find new ways to screw up.  But the 1828 election that saw Andrew Jackson become our President actually happened after four abysmal years, some would say the least productive 4 years any President has ever had, and it was actually a President who was a hero of mine, John Quincy He was the first son of a former President to be Some have said he was probably the best educated President we have ever had, having been educated at the best Massachusetts had, England had, and France had. He wrote books in German, fluently spoke  Of course, if he had had his way, he would have been married to an American, but when his mother, Abigail, was not too pleased with the girl he thought was the love of his life, he ended up being directed to England where he ended up falling in love with Louisa, and she ultimately became his wife; but apparently his mother didn't think she was quite fit. Louisa became the first--used to be able to say the only--First Lady the country has ever had who was not born in the United Like I say, if he had had his choice--first choice--then his wife would have been born in the United But that is the way things fall. He loved his wife dearly.  He was quite accomplished. He kept the most complete journal of anybody we have ever had who was He knew slavery was wrong. He knew slavery was destroying our country, that we could never reach the potential that God had for this country unless we eliminated slavery. He had corresponded to England with a guy by the name of William Wilberforce, who had dedicated his adult life since his twenties to eliminating slavery in the British Isles and British territories.                              {time}  1715  He ran for President in 1824. No one won with the electoral votes. It was thrown to the House of John Quincy Adams garnered the favor of Henry Clay in the And when Clay threw his support behind John Quincy Adams, Adams then won the  Adams had some friends who were very close to him. They knew his heart, they knew his heart was pure, and his intentions were clearly nothing but the very best for the United They knew him to be a man of honor, a man of integrity, a man of his word. He had not made any kind of deal with Henry Clay to make him Secretary of But as a man of honor, a man of integrity, he could not understand why he couldn't go ahead, and why he shouldn't go ahead, and appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of  His closest friend said: John, if you appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of State, you will never, ever be able to convince anybody in Congress--the House or Senate--you will never convince anybody in Washington but your closest friends, those of us that really love you, you will never convince the rest of the world or posterity that you had not cut a deal with Henry Clay that in return for his support for you being President, you would make him Secretary of Please, appoint him to anything, but not Secretary of It is going to look like you made a deal and bought the Presidency with the appointment.  But there were those who did not love John Quincy Adams, didn't have that much respect for him, and would have been fine if he had not won the election, but he had won the election. And those who didn't care about John Quincy Adams encouraged him: Sure, appoint Henry Clay, it is your choice. You appoint whoever you want.  Those who loved John said: John, it is not a good idea. People are going to brand you improperly. We know you are honest. Those are not really your friends that are telling you to just appoint Henry Clay to be Secretary of Go ahead.  He didn't listen to the closest friends who loved him and cared about him. He listened to those who didn't care if he succeeded or failed. So he appointed Henry Clay to be Secretary of  Some historians would say he had the least productive 4 years of any President in history. It is always arguable. But there were clearly times throughout his 4 years as President when he backed bills and pushed bills that would have been good for the United States and that should have had the support of both the House and Senate when they couldn't get passed simply because people thought he had bought the office with the appointment of Henry Clay to Secretary of And so they went against anything and everything that John Quincy Adams tried to support thereafter.  That may seem kind of a strange story to pull out from history, except I was reminded of it as I thought about today, and I thought about some folks who even in October, they didn't care about Donald Trump getting elected President, they didn't really support him at that point, so they encouraged him: You go ahead and let's do this bill that we are bringing to the floor and just never mind the fact that prices will not come down, unless you want to say 10 percent over 3 years, maybe 10 percent.  After the prices will probably continue to go up after those same 3 years, we may be able to cut 10 percent off at some point. Why? Because we are not stripping the regulation, the regulatory authority, out of We are only repealing part of it. And we are leaving almost all of the part that has driven costs through the roof. It has driven the price of health insurance through the roof. It has blown the deductibles so high that so many of my constituents and friends know they will never have enough cash to pay for the deductible to even get to a claim that the insurance company would pay.  And I just know that when the prices of health insurance don't come down over the next few years, people are going to say President Trump broke his promise to repeal He only got part of it, but the monopolies that had begun to grow in the health insurance market grew bigger and fatter. And a man who wanted to do an honorable thing for America and get rid of ObamaCare--that it cost people their insurance, their doctor, their medicine, that it caused so much suffering and heartache as people struggle with their healthcare bills--he promised he would get rid of it, he wanted to deliver on his promise, and he has been told by people who weren't really sure if they cared if he won or lost that: Gee, just pass this, this will be great. Just pass anything. Pass something. We will call it a victory and move on.  But these are the times when it is very important to take an assessment of those who want to see you succeed and those who really don't care. There are those who have felt on the Republican side that if Donald Trump was defeated, that would be the end of the Tea Party movement, that would be the end of any type of populism rising up against the runaway socialism, the runaway assault on religious freedom, the Second  The American public rose up, and this is our first chance to really deliver on our promises. I hope that the votes are not all there yet so that we can reach an agreement so that we can include in the bill that comes to the floor, not an amendment we vote on so that it can be voted down, but actually included in the bill so that we take out at least the big hunk of what has caused health insurance prices to skyrocket.  And if we can do that, we can have a win this week, one that we can all feel good about on our side of the aisle, and even my friends on the other side of the aisle. If we do the right thing and make sure that we take action that actually legitimately brings down health insurance costs, then my friends on the other side of the aisle will hear good reports of joyful remarks with gratitude that insurance prices have come down, we can now afford it, our deductible is lower, we are building a health savings account, it is great.  There are some good things that can come out of the votes this week. But if people take advice from those who are not as concerned with their total success, then this could be the start of a Presidency that was as unpleasant as John Quincy Adams' Presidency, which ended up leading to the inevitable result of his defeat in 1828 to Andrew  I hope we keep our promise.

934,topic-id,626,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill that will move us a step closer towards restoring healthy competition in the health insurance industry. Today, the health insurance industry is besieged by dwindling competition and skyrocketing premiums. Insurance providers, States, and the public have been dealing with the disastrous repercussions of ObamaCare for the past 6 years and overregulation by States for much longer.  Congress finally has the opportunity to pass legislation to reverse the downward spiral of our health insurance industry. Any such legislation must encourage a robust and competitive health insurance market in which insurance providers actively compete for customers. Healthy competition ensures premiums are accurately priced and that customers are able to find a variety of policies to meet their specific needs and demands.  H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, represents a step on that journey, repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act as it applies to the business of health insurance. There is wide support for this bill, and the Judiciary Committee has favorably reported similar legislation in the past, including legislation that was passed by the House, 406-19 during the 111th  The stated goal of the bill is to help restore competition in the healthcare market. I support this goal and firmly believe this bill must be coupled with larger changes to the existing Federal and State healthcare regulatory schemes.  As Speaker Ryan has noted, States ``should be empowered to make the right tradeoffs between consumer protections and individual choice, not regulators in Washington.''  This bill does not impact the State's ability to regulate the insurance market. Rather, this legislation levels the playing field for all healthcare industry participants. While insurers have been exempt from Federal antitrust laws for the past 70 years, healthcare providers and other participants have not.                              {time}  1445  This bill removes this exemption, ensuring that health insurers are better able to compete to provide quality coverage, thereby benefiting hospitals, doctors, and, most importantly, patients.  In addition, if separate legislation is passed to allow for the more open sale of health insurance across State lines, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act will allow uniform Federal antitrust laws to be applied across the marketplace while allowing States to maintain authority as the primary regulators of the health insurance market outside of the antitrust sphere.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act was originally passed to leave the regulation of the business of insurance with the States and to allow insurers to engage in certain procompetitive collaborative activities.  This legislation limits significant uncertainty and unnecessary litigation that would likely result from a broader McCarran-Ferguson repeal, through the use of safe harbors for such historically procompetitive collaborative activities, specifically the collection and distribution of historical loss data, the determination of loss development factors, the performance of actuarial services that do not involve restraints of trade, and the use of common forms that are not coercive.  Absent these safeguards, insurers will likely disengage from certain proconsumer collaborative activities, eliminating or impeding smaller insurers from competing and disincentivizing larger insurers from exploring new products and markets. This will lead to further market consolidation and fewer product choices, the impact of which will eventually be borne by the consumer.  These narrow safe harbors create a presumption that certain procompetitive activities can continue while maintaining regulation and oversight to the extent any activity crosses over into a restraint of trade. As a result, insurers can continue to engage in proconsumer business practices and will be encouraged to provide a diverse range of offerings at fair and reasonable prices.  I thank Mr.Gosar for introducing this legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the Competitive Health Insurance Reform  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

945,topic-id,982,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Our health insurance industry is in a dire situation. Premiums and deductibles are skyrocketing, hundreds of percent in some cases. In the State of the gentleman who is the chief sponsor of this bill, the State of Arizona, there has been a more than 100 percent increase in just the last year.  In 2017, the national State average of insurers participating in Federal exchanges dropped to four, down from six the previous year. Five States will only have one insurer providing plans on their Federal exchanges this year. It is time to reverse this trend. The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act is an important step in restoring competition to the health insurance industry and will help to set the foundation for additional essential reforms that must follow.  I say to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.Conyers), the ranking member of the committee and my friend, I appreciate very much working with him on this legislation, but I would also say to him that this legislation, as bipartisan as it is, cannot save the Affordable Care It is drowning. It is denying people coverage. Its costs are going up so much that somebody who likes it this year will not be able to afford it next year.  The promise that if you like your health insurance you will be able to keep it was never true, and it is still not true with The promise that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor was never true. The promise that health insurance premiums would go down under ObamaCare has been proven to be totally false. Instead, what we have done is we have denied the American people the right to choose for themselves what access to health care that they need and can afford.  We have denied the American people the freedom to decide whether or not they want to purchase a product that is mandated upon them by the Federal That is wrong. It has got to change. That is why we are taking action this week--including the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, but certainly not only the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act--to return a patient-centered healthcare system to the American people, one that reconnects them with their healthcare providers, one that will make sure that they have the maximum amount of choice and the maximum amount of access to real, affordable health insurance and quality health care in I support this bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record three letters in support of H.372.

Paul Gosar,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Gosar: The Small Business &      Entrepreneurship Council (SHE Council) and our nationwide      membership of small business owners and entrepreneurs support      the ``Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017'' (H.     372). Perhaps more than any other group, small business      owners understand the need for increased competition in the      health insurance marketplace. Indeed, it is the actions of      entrepreneurs that bring down costs, enhance innovation, and      boost quality in a competitive marketplace. H.372 is a      common sense and long-overdue step to repeal special-interest      exemptions to federal antitrust laws for health insurance      companies.       These exemptions have existed for more than 70 years, and      were initially instituted to help newly formed insurance      companies deal with data sharing. Given the dramatic changes      in the industry over these past many decades, such special-     interest treatment is no longer warranted.[[Page H2273]]       Considering the government-imposed distortions within the      health care industry as a result of the Affordable Care Act      and other regulatory restrictions, full-blown review and      reform of health care policies focused on expanding      competition, and consumer choice are needed. That includes      foundational changes, such as, in the case of H.372,      removing special-interest treatment that could reduce or      retrain competition.       In order to bring down health insurance costs and utilize      the models and technologies of our modern economy to drive      value and innovation within this sector, entrepreneurs need a      system that allows for such freedom and creativity. Your bill      is an important step in bringing down artificial barriers      that are preventing much needed innovation and competition.      Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.

It would not interfere with the states' ability to      maintain and enforce their own insurance regulations,      antitrust statues, and consumer protection laws. Because      states vary in their enforcement efforts, the impact of      repeal on health insurance companies would differ from state      to state. This is no different from the situation faced by      other businesses.       The bill is narrowly drawn to apply only to the business of      health insurance, including dental insurance, and would not      affect the business of life insurance, property or casualty      insurance, and many similar insurance areas.       Passage of H.372 would help interject more competition      into the insurance marketplace by authorizing greater federal      antitrust enforcement in instances where state regulators      fail to act. When competition is not robust, consumers are      more likely to face higher prices and less likely to and less      likely to benefit from innovation and variety in the      marketplace.

937,topic-id,757,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for their thorough work on this bill. I would also like to express my appreciation to the broad group of stakeholders who have helped to shape, improve, and support this commonsense and consumer-centric legislation.  As Congress, once again, faces the preeminent task of repairing our Nation's healthcare system, first and foremost, we must establish the proper foundation for a competitive and consumer-driven health insurance marketplace that empowers patients.  The Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017 will restore the application of Federal antitrust laws to health insurance and infuse much-needed competition and transparency to the industry. Ending the special-interest exemption is the essential first step to broader healthcare reform. Popular cost-reducing reform priorities, such as selling insurance across State lines and developing diverse, consumer-driven plans, are predicated on the robust competitive markets this bill will enable.  As a healthcare provider for more than 25 years, I understand firsthand the importance of a competitive and dynamic health insurance market. Patients, doctors, and hospitals alike benefit when health insurers compete to provide a variety of quality coverage options.  It is apparent that after 70 years, McCarran-Ferguson, the broad-stroked exemption created by Congress in the 1940s, was not wise. Over decades, and expeditiously since the passage of ObamaCare in 2009, the health insurance market has devolved into one of the least transparent and most anticompetitive industries in the United These antiquated exemptions are no longer necessary for health insurance. There is no reason in law, policy, or logic for the industry to have special exemptions that are different from all other businesses in the United  The interpretation of antitrust law has narrowed dramatically over the decades. Many of the practices which insurers say they need this exemption to do, such as analyzing historical loss data, have proven to be permissible by the Federal Trade Commission and the courts over the decades since McCarran-Ferguson was passed.  This narrowing of scope has resulted in a law whose efficacy and usefulness long since expired. Yet, the shell of this zombie law lurks to scare off potential, legitimate legal challenges from States, patients, and providers. These entities do not have the tools, money, or manpower to challenge these monopolies in court or head-on in the current market. Only the Federal Government, with its resources, can enforce the laws which rebalance the playing field of interstate commerce fairly.  I would like to stress the point that this legislation does not affect any other type of insurance other than health insurance. The language of the bill was carefully and deliberately drafted to exclude other areas of insurance, such as life insurance, property and casualty insurance, and excepted benefits like disability income insurance. In short, the legislation before the House today does not repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act for life insurance, annuities, property and casualty insurance, disability income insurance, and long-term care insurance.  The broad stakeholders of healthcare professionals, insurance providers, and consumer protection groups support this narrow and important scope of the language. I am open to efforts to strengthen the narrow and deliberate scope of this legislation going forward should the need and opportunity arise.  Repeal of this specific section of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which applies only to health insurance, has strong bipartisan support. As labeled earlier, in the 111th Congress, it passed by a vote of 406-19 and passed the Republican-led House in the 112th Congress by a voice vote. Similar legislation has been introduced by multiple Democratic Members of the House, and the text of my bill has been included in the Republican Study Committee's healthcare reform bill for the last four Congresses in a row.  The passage of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act into law is an important first step towards increasing competition in health insurance markets and will assist with setting the foundation for real, competitive, and patient-centered healthcare reform.  At the end of the day, you can tell a lot about a bill by who supports it. H.372 has the support of the healthcare professionals that actually provide care to patients, including doctors, dentists, surgeons, pharmacists, chiropractors, optometrists, and others. This key law, by liberating, liberates the insurance industry and doctors and empowers the patients. Doctors will see and insurance will see that the patient is empowered for new opportunities. Things that we can't even imagine today will exist through competition. It is the American way.  Mr.Speaker, I thank the chairman and the members of the committee for their work on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2267-2.txt,1992,HONORING GEORGE COCHRAN,2017.0,21.0,March

580,topic-id,635,"Mr.Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and Representative Wenstrup for their work on this important bill.  This legislation empowers the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with the authority to hire the best and brightest employees.  We can all agree that you can't have a top-notch VA without employing young veterans who want to continue serving their country after they return from the front lines. Each and every day, our brave men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for us, and we owe it to them to ensure that, when they return home, they have the best care at the VA and that they also have the best career opportunities available to them.  This legislation is about veterans serving veterans. Young veterans in the Fifth District of New Jersey, where I live, tell me that they face significant challenges when they return home, even though many of them have a desire to help serve other veterans.  I was lucky enough to hire one such veteran on my team, Mike DeVilliers, who served in the U.Mike is committed to helping other veterans and has, at a local community college, where he ran a program for student veterans. He now serves my constituents, including our veterans and across the four counties in the Fifth  We should be encouraging talented and qualified young veterans like Mike to put their skills to use and give back to their fellow servicemen and -women. The VA is one place those skills are sorely needed to best serve the 473,000 veterans who live in New Jersey and the many other veterans across our country.  Mr.Chairman, approximately 60 percent of VA employees are over the age of 45, and the Department has struggled to develop an adequate pipeline for younger employees and emerging leaders to fill crucial and critical roles. We have seen the negative effects of not having the right team in place to support our veterans. While programs like Pathways at the VA are a step in the right direction, we can do more to improve the process and give a leg up to all veterans who wish to bring their skills to the  More than half of the post-9/11 veterans are 34 years of age or younger, and approximately 30 percent have bachelor's or advanced degrees; yet the Department of Labor reported that post-9/11 vets face a higher unemployment rate than other veterans. That is simply unacceptable.  The VA should draw from their excellent source of talent to strengthen the care all of our veterans receive by considering more young veterans for excepted service appointments. That is why my amendment would make sure that the VA Secretary includes recipients of the post-9/11 GI Bill and younger veterans who have recently graduated from college as a distinct category qualifying for excepted service appointments to the Department of Veterans  Mr.Chairman, the mission statement of the VA is inscribed outside the Department's headquarters. It reads: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.'' This is President Lincoln's promise to serving and honoring the men and women who are America's heroes, and it should and must be our same commitment today. I know of no one who stands more willing and able to serve fellow veterans and their brothers and sisters in arms than the veterans themselves.  There is nothing partisan about serving our veterans. This is a commonsense solution without any new costs, and it is a perfect example of working across party lines to help get the backs of those who have served our country.  I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our veterans by supporting this win-win solution.  Mr.Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.

222,topic-id,889,"Mr.President, this week is Sunshine Week, an annual nationwide celebration of the good that comes from peeling back the curtains on government. Sunshine Week coincides with the National Freedom of Information Day and President James Madison's birthday, both of which occur on March 16.  James Madison understood the value of an informed citizenry as a necessary check against those in power. We shouldn't forget his call for the people to ``arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''  More recently in our Nation's history, Justice Brandeis declared, ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.''  These sentiments hold true to this day. A government that operates in darkness--and a public that's kept in the dark--sows the seeds of waste, fraud, and abuse.  In the face of secrecy and obstruction, the public has a vital weapon: the Freedom of Information Act,  Over 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed FOIA into law, establishing the public's judicially enforceable right to government information.  Before FOIA, the people had to justify their need for information to the government, but after FOIA, the government has to justify its refusal to release information to the public. FOIA's enactment marked a crucial step toward a government more accountable to the people.  No doubt, FOIA manifests Congress's recognition of the need to carefully balance the public's right to know and the government's interest in protecting certain information from disclosure, but practice and history demonstrates this balance has all too often been tilted away from transparency.  Many in government have continued to find ways to undermine citizens' right to know under Transparency should be the norm, not the exception; yet, when it comes to FOIA requests, we have continued to see a government culture of delay, deny, and defend. When this happens, FOIA's effectiveness is undermined and the public becomes even more skeptical of its government.  We have seen this in one way or another under every administration, both Republican and Democratic, since FOIA's enactment, but the trend toward secrecy and obstruction in recent years should alarm all of us.  According to a March 14 Associated Press report, ``The Obama administration in its final year in office spent a record $36.2 million on legal costs defending its refusal to turn over federal records under [FOIA.]''[[Page S1837]]  In 2016, the Obama administration set records for ``outright denial of access to files, refusing to quickly consider requests described as especially newsworthy, and forcing people to pay for records who had asked the government to waive search and copy fees.''  To top it off, ``The government acknowledged when challenged that it had been wrong to initially refuse to turn over all or parts of records in more than one-third of such cases, the highest rate in at least six years.''  We simply cannot continue down this path.  Fortunately, a truly bipartisan and bicameral effort last year resulted in the enactment of the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016. I was proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation and to have worked closely with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, as well as the open government community, in ensuring its passage. It achieves some of the most meaningful and necessary reforms to FOIA in history.  We are already witnessing some of the positive impacts of these reforms.  For example, the National Security Archive, a nonprofit open government advocate, fought for years to achieve the public release of certain historical documents about the Bay of Pigs invasion. But time and again, they were met with legal hurdles put up by the Central Intelligence Agency,  This past October, however, the CIA released these historically significant documents. In doing so, the CIA's Chief Historian stated that the Agency is ``releasing this draft volume today because recent 2016 changes in the [FOIA] requires us to release some drafts that are responsive to FOIA requests if they are more than 25 years old.''  This is excellent news. It is just one example of the good that can result from bipartisan work toward a common goal for the American people. I look forward to hearing many other such stories of important information finally being made publicly available under FOIA, thanks to these recent reforms.  But we can't just rest on our laurels. No matter which party is in control of Congress or the White House, continuing oversight of FOIA--and the faithful implementation of its amendments--is essential to ensure the law's effectiveness as a tool for the public good.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am proud during this Sunshine Week to join Senators Feinstein, Cornyn, and Leahy in sending letters to the Trump administration to learn more about specific steps taken to carry out the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and efforts underway to improve the proactive disclosure of information.  Compliance with both the letter and spirit of FOIA should always be a top priority of any administration, so I look forward to hearing back about progress made.  Before President Trump took office, I stood on this floor and urged him to reverse the secrecy and obstruction that defined the Obama administration's FOIA track record. Today I reiterate that call.  A new administration provides a new opportunity to get it right.  This Sunshine Week, let's recommit to working together toward improving open government, fulfilling FOIA's promise, and ensuring a more informed citizenry.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgS1836-2.txt,457,SECURING OUR AGRICULTURE AND FOOD ACT,2017.0,15.0,March
242,topic-id,1493,"Mr.President, affirming the public's right to know how their government is run, Sunshine Week is an annual reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. In the spirit of government transparency, I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2017. This important piece of legislation furthers the public's access to court proceedings by permitting Federal judges at all Federal court levels to open their courtrooms to television cameras and radio broadcasts.  For decades, and with great results, States such as my home State of Iowa have allowed cameras in their courtrooms. In fact, all 50 States and the District of Columbia now allow some news coverage of proceedings, and it is time we join them. This openness in our courts improves the public's understanding of the legal system and what happens inside our courts.  However, our Federal judicial system unnecessarily remains a mystery to many across the country. The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Klobuchar and a number of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, will greatly improve public access to Federal courts by letting Federal judges open their courtrooms to television cameras and other forms of electronic media. Letting the Sun shine in on our Federal courtrooms will allow Americans to better understand the judicial process.  The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act will ensure that the introduction of cameras and other broadcasting devices into courtrooms goes as smoothly as it has at the State level. This legislation leaves the presence of the cameras in Federal trial and appellate courts to the sole discretion of the judges--it is not mandatory. The bill also provides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this legislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent through a 3-year sunset provision. The bill protects the privacy and safety of nonparty witnesses by giving them the right to have their faces and voices obscured. Additionally, the bill prohibits the televising of jurors and includes a provision to protect the due process rights of each party.  It is time to open the courthouse doors and let the light shine in on the Federal judiciary. Granting the public greater access to an already public proceeding will inspire greater faith in and appreciation for our judges who pledge equal and impartial justice for all.

(B) No media coverage of jurors.--The presiding judge shall      not permit the photographing, electronic recording,      broadcasting, or televising of any juror in a trial      proceeding, or of the jury selection process.       (C) Discretion of the judge.--The presiding judge shall      have the discretion to obscure the face and voice of an      individual, if good cause is shown that the photographing,      electronic recording, broadcasting, or televising of the      individual would threaten--       (i) the safety of the individual;       (ii) the security of the court;       (iii) the integrity of future or ongoing law enforcement      operations; or       (iv) the interest of justice.

1326,topic-id,885,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for not only managing the time, but her leadership and great work in  Mr.Speaker, I rise to speak about the millions of Americans who will suffer under this oxymoron called This bill will result in higher costs and less coverage for hardworking Americans, especially the poor and the elderly. The only winners in this bill are the wealthy who are getting their $600 billion tax cut.  Earlier this week, an official with the American College of Physicians put it best when he said:       In 38 years of advocating for doctors and patients, I have      never seen a bill that will do more harm than the  This is a powerful statement.  You know, Mr.Speaker, what I can't figure out is what problem this bill is trying to solve. If the Republicans were looking to cover fewer people, make insurance more expensive, and give tax cuts to the rich, then I guess this Republican bill is the answer.  Let's take a quick look at what this bill does or, as my Republican colleagues refer to it, promises kept.  First and foremost, 24 million Americans are going to lose coverage. Let me repeat that, 24 million. That is not only unacceptable, it is cruel.  And even for those lucky enough not to lose coverage, things are not going to be very good.  Under the Republican healthcare scheme, older Americans will be paying five times more. In what world does anyone think that it is a good idea to make health care even more expensive for the elderly? This is one of those crazy but true things about this bill. So this is what the GOP calls promises kept.  Well, let's take a moment to remember what promises were actually made. In an interview with ``60 Minutes'' in 2015, President Trump promised:       Everybody is going to be covered. I am going to take care      of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not,      everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they      are being taken care of now.  Then just 2 days before the election, Trump went to Sioux City, Iowa, and said:       I am going to protect and save your Social Security and      your You made a deal a long, long time ago.[[Page H2336]]                                {time}  1630  So how does this repeal bill stack up with those promises? Premiums will spike 750 percent with far fewer tax credits to help shoulder that burden; 30 million Americans with preexisting conditions would lose the certainty of coverage they have enjoyed under ObamaCare; Medicare will be slashed by $170 billion; Medicaid will be cut 25 percent. That is $880 billion being ripped away from the most vulnerable Americans, resulting in 14 million people losing coverage immediately.  So who wins here with TrumpCare? The rich, who will reap $600 billion in tax cuts at the expense of medical treatment for the most vulnerable and working folks in this country; Big Pharma is a winner who can now look forward to more obscene profits and less oversight; and, of course, the private health insurance companies, who, once again, will be in total charge of America's health care.  Who loses? Hardworking, regular folks who simply can't afford to underwrite a tax cut for the rich at the expense of their health.  Take my constituent, Shawn, for example. He wrote me to share his ACA story. In 2006, Shawn was diagnosed with HIV and a rare heart condition, and his premiums skyrocketed from $123 a month in 2005, all the way up to $1,473 a month in 2012. That is an average increase of between 35 and 40 percent per year. At the same time, his deductible climbed to $2,900, meaning his insurance wouldn't offer him a dime until he coughed up nearly $3,000 first.  When ObamaCare kicked in in 2014, Shawn had at least a dozen plans to choose from. He selected a platinum plan which delivered better coverage than he previously had for only half the price that he had previously been paying. Let me repeat: because of ObamaCare, Shawn started paying half the price for a better plan. How was it better? As Shawn put it, he no longer faced lifetime caps; he had free wellness visits included in his coverage; instead of a nearly $3,000 deductible, he now had just a small copay.  If the ACA is repealed, Shawn will be uninsured for the first time in his life. For the first time in 54 years, Shawn will be forced to pay out of his own pocket for lifesaving medications. His HIV medications alone cost nearly $30,000 per year--that is three times as much as he pays right now for all of his medical expenses. If he is hospitalized for his heart condition--which has occurred already twice--he will incur tens of thousands of dollars in additional charges. In short, under the Republican's healthcare scheme, Shawn will be financially ruined.  Mr.Speaker, this is utterly unacceptable. The American people deserve access to affordable, accessible, and high quality health care. TrumpCare achieves the opposite. It is a bad deal and a threat to the well-being of our Nation and our people. Beyond that, it is shameful and inhumane.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose TrumpCare in its entirety and vote it down tomorrow.  ",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2333-6.txt,1708,0915,2017.0,22.0,March
281,topic-id,840,"Mr.Speaker, I use Twitter and have about 65,000 followers, which is pretty modest by Trump standards; but my staff is smart enough to keep the launch code secret from me so that when I say something, we find the right words to express what I want to say, and occasionally, very occasionally, I have a chance to cool down before I fire off a tweet. But this week we learned that one of our colleagues doesn't have a reasonable staff person who helps him think through his tweets.  On Sunday, Steve King of Iowa tweeted out his love and praise for the anti-Muslim nationalist candidate in Holland who is running on an explicitly White supremacist platform; anti-immigration, anti-Islam, anti-refugee, anti-people of color. This candidate is the full White nationalist package. And apparently, King and Geert Wilders are very good friends.  In his tweet, Representative King says: ``Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We cannot restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.''  Let that sink in for a moment.  In context, what it means is: A, Steve King believes Western civilization is under attack by outsiders; and, B, those outsiders can never be assimilated or be considered part of our civilization.  God knows what Representative King would think of my grandson who likes to tell me that in this arm he is Puerto Rican and in this one he is But he says: ``Grandpa, right here, I am 100 percent American.''  You think: My grandson, yeah, he is right, and the Congressman from Iowa is wrong. I think my grandson is every bit as American as Steve King or I am.  I was born during Jim Crow, when separate but equal was the law of the land. But during my lifetime, we fought segregation and racism, and my daughters have been fighting it even more in their generation, so that exclusion, segregation, and racial hatred are no longer the law of the land.  Now, at least as far as I am concerned, my grandson, who was born in America, is an American, whether Steve King likes it or not. Born in Illinois, he is not someone else's baby. He is 100 percent He is part of our civilization, and he is the future of America, along with Steve King's grandchildren.  Just to be clear, Representative King's message was warmly received and retweeted by none other than David Duke, the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, who has been a very proud Republican candidate on numerous occasions.  Duke said: ``Just in case you were thinking of moving, sanity reigns supreme in Iowa's Fourth Congressional District,'' and, ``God bless Steve King.''  Oh, but Representative King was not done. He is never done. He did an interview with an Iowa talk radio show where he discussed ``the plan'' of television anchorman Jorge Ramos to make White people the minority in America, causing King to respond that: ``I will predict that Hispanics and the Blacks will be fighting each other before that happens.''  So what happens when a Member of Congress makes racist remarks? Is he censured? Are his words taken down? Is he rebuked by the leaders of his party?  If he traveled somewhere without getting permission or he accepted a gift without prior approval of Congress, he would be punished. He might even get censured or called out in some way.  But for making racist comments, for supporting a racist candidate in someone else's election, or for saying things that receive high praise from David Duke and the KKK, nothing is going to happen. I have not heard leaders in the Republican Party scrambling to say that Steve King does not represent their views on race, religion, diversity, and the threat that ``somebody else's babies'' pose to American civilization.  A friend of mine in Chicago asked me what I thought was going on when a Member of Congress says such hurtful, xenophobic things, calling, essentially, on Black and Brown people to join in a race war.  The answer is that people like Representative King feel empowered: empowered by the presence of Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Jeff Sessions; empowered by a President who wants us all to fear Muslims, fear Mexicans, and, frankly, fear all Latinos, even my American-born grandson.  This is what happens when American men and women remain silent. When we do not stand up to the bully, the racist, the nationalist, they get more and more empowered. They get more and more empowered, and their actions become more and more normal.  Well, saying that Black and Brown people will be fighting each other and[[Page H2086]]saying that non-White people are somehow somebody else's children and not our children--the children of a nation that believes all men are created equal--well, that is not normal, and the American people will not accept the silence of the majority party when one of their own speaks out in this way.  I am waiting for the censure, the denunciations, and the rebukes. But I suspect I will be waiting a long time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2085-3.txt,478,WAR IS BEING DECLARED ON THE GREAT LAKES,2017.0,16.0,March

1169,topic-id,893,"Mr.Speaker, I have spoken here before about the surge in demand for citizenship we are seeing in the Fourth Congressional District of Thousands who are eligible are taking the step to become citizens because they feel threatened by a President and administration that does not seem to think of immigrants, refugees, Muslims, or Latinos as human beings. So the one way to protect oneself and to protect one's family is to apply for citizenship if you are eligible.  Some days they are lined up out the door of my office. So full are our daily appointments, we had to add a Saturday citizenship workshop to accommodate all of the people who wanted to apply, and we will be adding additional workshops. At one workshop a couple of weeks ago, staff and volunteers worked with families to fill out the paperwork, assemble all of the evidence and fees for the application. In one day we helped 260 people fill out their citizenship applications.  I discovered something very important. People keep coming back to me and asking: What can I do to fight back? What can I do to help immigrant communities who are under siege by President Trump, ``President'' Bannon, and all the rest of the people who want to drive immigrants out of the country?  So I told them they could help others apply for citizenship, and they came in droves--hipsters with funky facial hair, women with pink knit hats they made for the Women's March, environmental and LGBTQ activists, union members, and just plain old folks from my district who are not themselves immigrants but who feel the solidarity with immigrants in their community.  You know what? This new group, after getting a little training, sat for a few hours with immigrant families, going over their histories, their stories, their reasons for being here, and their reasons for applying for U.citizenship. And they were pretty good at filling out government forms. They formed a bond. They got to know each other. They were helping each other accomplish a mutual goal, which is standing up to xenophobia and the Trump-Bannon era.  The citizens and the applicants to become citizens are both worried about Republicans taking away their health care and eliminating the environmental laws that have made the water we drink and the air we breathe so much safer. They worry about where women and girls will get healthcare services in cities like Chicago if Trump and his buddies defund Planned Parenthood, or what happens after the courts are stacked with judges who are so out of step with the modern era on gender and civil rights, consumer protections, women's health, and any of the other issues people care about.  Anyone who walked out of that citizenship workshop where 260 new citizenship applications were completed felt a sense of community and interconnectedness with one another. Now, it is sad to report that thousands of my constituents can't spend a Saturday morning applying for citizenship. Many of them are at legal clinics or law offices filling out papers to address the very fear that they will lose their homes, their savings, and their families if Trump's deportation force knocks on their door.  They are filling out, by the thousands, power of attorney documents and child custody papers in case they are grabbed off the street, in their homes, or, worse yet, in their places of worship. It is heartbreaking. Moms and dads are making decisions about who their kids will go to live with if they get picked up and deported. Which relative, neighbor, or older sibling will be in charge if mom and dad are taken away?  Believe me, these kids know what is going on. The 5 million U.citizens who have parents at risk of deportation know that their government is a threat to their safety and their security. Their own government could come to the door and upend their lives at any moment, and their parents are preparing for the worst.  It is the humanity, the love, their striving for a better life that comes through in these parents who want[[Page H2292]]what is best for their children and what was unavailable to them in some far-off country. These are very real people who have no legal avenues that allow them to live and work here legally, who have no options other than to hide or leave, who have been cut off from fully integrating into our society as citizens because Congress has been fighting over immigration reform. These are the people that Mr.Bannon, Mr.Sessions, and Mr.King have been working together for years to get out of what they call their country so that our erratic new President can point to deportations and say that he is making America great again.  What is clear from the citizenship surge and all those who want to help is that America is not only great, not only kind, not only dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, but there are Americans and those who want to be Americans willing to stand up and resist when leaders take us in the wrong direction.  Mr.Speaker, you will see millions of Americans and aspiring Americans marching together in American cities across our great Nation on May 1, and when you do, you will see this bond and this shared humanity this coming May 1.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2291-4.txt,478,ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS,2017.0,22.0,March

In early 2011, just after I was elected attorney general of California, I went in for a checkup. It had been a while since I had seen her. Chrystal asked me how I had been, and I asked her how she had been, and then she shared with me great news. She was pregnant.  As a dental hygienist, she was working for a few different dentists and wasn't on the payroll of any of them as a full-time employee. This was before the ACA was in place, so Chrystal was on private insurance with only basic coverage, just enough to cover her annual exams.  When Chrystal found out she was pregnant, she went to her insurance company to apply for prenatal coverage. She was denied. When I asked her why, she told me that they said she had a preexisting condition. So you can imagine I asked her: Are you OK? What is wrong? What is the preexisting condition?  She told me she was pregnant.  When she applied to another healthcare company for insurance, again, she was denied. Why? Preexisting condition. What was it? She was pregnant.  So this young woman was forced to go into her sixth month of pregnancy before she received a sonogram. Instead, thankfully, there was a free clinic in San Francisco, so she could get her prenatal care.  Thank God she had a strong and beautiful baby boy. His name is They are both doing well today.  Thank God that situation is no longer the reality for millions of  I share Chrystal's story to remind us what America's healthcare system looked like only a few years ago.  We should not forget that before the ACA, 48 million Americans lacked health insurance. That is more people than the entire country of  Before the ACA, when these people got sick, they had three choices: Go without treatment, go to the emergency room, or go broke.  Before the ACA, 129 million people--almost one out of every two Americans--could be denied insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions. And the minute you got sick, your insurer could dig up some flimsy reason to drop your coverage. You could be denied coverage for chemotherapy or insulin if you had cancer or diabetes. You could be denied prenatal coverage if you were pregnant, like You could even be denied health coverage if you were a victim of domestic violence.  Before the ACA, healthcare costs were crushing low-income and middle-class Premiums--which, of course, are those monthly bills that we all pay for our insurance--were going up and up. Sky-high medical bills were the 1 reason Americans went broke, causing them to sell their homes, their cars, and even pawn their jewelry to pay off their debts.  One of the worst things about facing the healthcare system without coverage before the ACA was that it left you feeling utterly alone. Most Americans know what I am talking about: that knot in your stomach when you know there is something wrong with your health or the health of your child or your parent, but you are not sure what it is, whether it can be fixed or whether your insurance will cover it, and the frustration, the anger as you try to make sense of the fine print and codes on the medical bill that has so many zeros.  How many of us have walked into an emergency room with a loved one and felt time just stop? Maybe it was with your child who was running a fever or having trouble breathing. Maybe your partner is being rushed in with a possible heart attack. All you will know is that something is wrong. All you know is that you are overwhelmed and scared, and you know that you should not also have to fight on the phone with an insurance company or wonder if a doctor will even see you at all. That is how millions and millions of Americans experienced our healthcare system.  It was not right or fair. So the ACA set out to make things better, and 7 years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It finally extended good, affordable health insurance to Americans like Chrystal all across the Vice President Biden was absolutely right when, at the time, he said that it was a ``big''--and then I will not quote the next word; let's call it blanking--``deal.''  It is a shame that people have been playing politics with this law and with America's health. The former Speaker of the House said that the ACA would be ``Armageddon.'' A Republican Presidential candidate who now sits in the Cabinet called the ACA--and these are his actual words--``the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.''  Earlier this month, the President of the United States tweeted that the ACA is ``a complete and total disaster.'' Well, I say: Tell that to the people of California because when a State wants to make the ACA work, it works--whether that is California or Kentucky, and real people living real lives know it.  For example, I recently heard from Myra from Sherman Oaks, CA, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She wrote:       Before ObamaCare, my husband and I lived under constant      stress due to our lack of good health insurance.  But, because of the ACA, Myra told me:       We had a Silver Blue Shield plan that covered . . . well      over a million dollars in bills to date. I am happy to report      I am now well, but without insurance, I was facing a death      sentence. Without the ACA, we would certainly have had to      sell our home to pay my bills and try to figure out how to      make ends meet.  She wrote that it covered well over a million dollars. That is what the ACA does.  Here is how Cindy of from Oakley, CA, has experienced real life. She wrote:       My daughter was diagnosed with an eating disorder at 13      years old and I can directly thank the excellent care      received at Kaiser Northern California for her good health      today at age 17. Without the ACA and the mental health parity      it helps provide . . . I would not have had treatment options      available to me.  Again, coverage for mental health treatment--that is what the ACA does.  Honoree, a single mom from Samoa, CA, living with a spinal cord injury that has kept her from working for 3\1/2\ years, wrote to me and said:       I wanted to let you know that I love ObamaCare! My      healthcare has steadily improved since the ACA was enacted. .      . . I can't tell you how AMAZING it felt to get my teeth      cleaned and cared for after waiting more than a decade.       I walked around for weeks saying, ``thanks, ObamaCare!''      whenever I sensed how good my teeth felt.       I would be saddened to see the ACA get scrapped. It's made      a huge difference in our lives. Actually, I'd be more than      saddened, I'd be very scared.  Again, this is testimony about the ACA, in this case about dental coverage and improved healthcare. That is what the ACA does.  I will state that I believe there is a huge disconnect between the over-the-top criticism of the ACA and the law's actual impact. There is a disconnect between the politics and how people are actually living and thriving under the In fact, in a recent poll, one in three Americans didn't even realize that the ACA and ObamaCare were actually the same thing, and they are. So, everybody, let's be clear about this. The Affordable Care Act is ObamaCare, and ObamaCare is the Affordable Care  We all know, of course, that there are ways to improve the ACA, but ending it is not the answer. The truth is that the ACA has largely done what it was supposed to do--expand, protect, and reduce--expand coverage, protect consumers, and reduce the pace of rising healthcare costs. Thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion, 20 million[[Page S1953]]more Americans have health insurance. That is the population of the entire State of New Thanks to the ACA, premiums are going up at the slowest rate in half a century. Thanks to the ACA, doctors are innovating and providing better preventive care, from keeping people out of the hospital to delivering healthier babies. Thanks to the ACA, insurers cannot set lifetime limits on your care, meaning your insurance company won't tell you in the middle of a cancer treatment that they have paid all they ever will. Thanks to the ACA, millions of underserved Americans in rural towns and in cities and everywhere in between have access to care for the first time. Thanks to the ACA, young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26. Thanks to the ACA, 55 million women have insurance that works--mammograms, checkups, and birth control with no copays. When you pick up your prescription at the pharmacy and see that the bill is zero dollars, well, that is the And thanks to the ACA, you can't be discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition, including that preexisting condition called being a woman.  Of course, navigating the healthcare system is still daunting, but things are better. There are now some rules of the road to keep insurance companies from taking advantage of you during some of life's most vulnerable moments. Because of the ACA, because of ObamaCare, you can sleep a little easier at night and know that your care will be there when you need it.  Let's fast-forward to today. Today, we mark the seventh anniversary of this historic life-changing law. But all that it covers and protects could also be ripped away, and that is because of the American Health Care Act, the Republican healthcare plan on the House side. That is what it will do--rip it all away.  They have done their best to mislead folks about their plan. They have criticized objective news reports, and they even questioned the Congressional Budget Office--which, as we know, is, by the way, a nonpartisan, independent office which crunched the numbers and found that this new plan would cause millions of Americans to lose insurance coverage.  Before we leap on to this new bill, let's all ask some key questions. Let's all take a good look at what this plan really would and would not do.  First, will this bill provide insurance for everybody, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. In fact, the independent Congressional Budget Office says that under the GOP plan, 24 million Americans will lose their health insurance by the end of the decade. That is equal to the population of 15 States combined.  Who are these people? These are middle-class families, our Nation's teachers, veterans, truckdrivers, nurses, and farmers. These families include those who struggle with opioid addiction, have a child that needs support for autism, or have an aging parent who needs a nursing home. This bill threatens them all.  Let's ask: Will the plan help the folks who need care most? The answer is no. The House Republican plan's flat tax credits are based only on age, with no consideration of income level. So what that means is that a 40-year-old cashier making $10,000 gets the exact same amount as the 40-year-old banker making $74,000 a year. It doesn't matter whether you live in downtown Manhattan or the Cleveland suburbs or rural  Let's ask: Will monthly costs go down for low-income and middle-class families who are stretched horribly thin right now? The answer is no. According to that same independent analysis, the Republican plan will immediately increase American families' premiums by 15 to 20 percent, with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs after that. In the next decade, a person in their fifties could see their insurance costs go up 850 percent. Their insurance costs can go up 850 percent.  Let's ask: What about our seniors--will their monthly costs go down? Sadly, the answer is no. The Republican plan lets insurers charge seniors five times as much as other Americans, meaning that high cholesterol your doctor diagnosed could cost you $3,200 more a month.  Let's ask: Will all women still have access to affordable family planning? The answer is no. This new bill will give Americans choice in healthcare, but the women of America will not have choice. The bill denies women tax credits if they get a plan that covers abortions. It prohibits Planned Parenthood from providing care for millions on Some 2.5 million patients choose Planned Parenthood every year, including roughly 1 million in They should be able to see the provider they choose and trust.  Let's ask: Will this new plan protect Medicaid, as President Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. Medicaid covers many people whose jobs don't offer healthcare, and it also pays for half of all the births in this It supports people with disabilities and children with special needs. Most people don't realize that Medicaid is the primary payer for treatment of opioid addiction and substance abuse. But this new plan being offered by House Republicans would roll back Medicaid coverage and cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid benefits over the next decade.  Let's ask: Does the plan put American families ahead of insurance companies? The answer, tragically, is no. Under this plan, if you lose your job and it takes more than 2 months to find another, you will be charged a 30-percent penalty on top of the monthly costs you are already paying. That money goes right into the insurance company's pockets.  So, by now, you are probably wondering: Who exactly does this bill help? Well, here is your answer. It gives millionaires a $50,000 average tax cut every year. It gives the top 0.1 percent in this country a $195,000 tax cut every year. It gives insurance companies a $145 billion tax break over the next decade. The President and the Speaker want you to believe that this plan is good for American families, but under their bill, the only thing that gets healthier are the insurance companies' bottom line.  As far as California is concerned, this bill would devastate our families. Here are the facts, and, frankly, here is the fight. Over 5 million Californians have received insurance through the Affordable Care I say they are worth fighting for.  Since the ACA went into effect, California's uninsured population has been cut almost in half, from 17 percent to about 7 percent. I say they are worth fighting for.  Medi-Cal went from covering 8.5 million Americans to 13.5 million today. One in two children are covered under I say they are worth fighting for.  The community clinics and health centers that so many Californians rely on would be cut back or closed. I say they are worth fighting for.  A UC Berkeley study estimates that repealing the ACA would cost California up to 200,000 jobs, everyone from home healthcare aides and janitors to workers in retail, restaurants, and accounting. I say they are worth fighting for.  I rise today to emphasize that it is really important that we understand the everyday consequences of this bill. We are talking about real people. If you are a farmer in the Central Valley on Medicaid, you can lose that coverage. If you are a Los Angeles senior with diabetes, you may no longer be able to afford coverage on the individual market. If you are a family in Shasta County with a child dealing with a prescription drug addiction, substance abuse treatment likely will not be covered. If you are a couple in Humboldt County with an ailing parent, your request for home health services could be denied. These are the kinds of Californians and the kinds of Americans who this plan would hurt.  When these folks wake up at 3 a.m. worrying about an ache or pain or their next chemo appointment, when they wake up with that concern and that thought at 3 a.m., I promise you, they are not thinking about that through the lens of being a Republican or a They think about themselves as fathers, mothers, parents, daughters and sons, and grandparents. They worry about their health needs and how their health needs will affect not only themselves but their loved ones. These concerns are not about politics. These are universal concerns, and we have all been there.  It is because all of us share these concerns and because all of us would be badly harmed by this new plan that[[Page S1954]]this bill is opposed by the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the They are the most respected medical and patient advocacy groups in this country, and they know what is at stake.  Ultimately, I believe this bill is not just about medicine or math; I believe this is about morals. The plan that the House is voting on today is a values statement, and it is not a good one. As our former President said about the ACA, this is more than just about healthcare; it is about the character of our country, and it is about whether or not we look out for one another.  I think we need to take a good, hard look in the mirror and ask: Who are we as a country? Are we a country that cuts the deficit by cutting care for our most vulnerable?  Let's look in the mirror and ask: Are we a country that gives tax breaks to insurers while giving higher medical bills to patients?  Are we a country that tells seniors and cancer patients and women ``You are on your own''?  Are we a country that sees healthcare as a privilege for a few or a right for all?  I believe that is what we have to decide.  The ACA is not perfect. It can be strengthened, and I am willing to work with anyone who will work in good faith to do that, but it is time to stop playing politics with public health.  Our government has three main functions: public safety, public education, and public health. We shouldn't be turning these responsibilities into partisan issues. Instead, we should be figuring out how to improve the lives of all Americans, whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or  People are counting on us, people like one of my constituents in Kern County--a woman who is suffering from lung disease, who said:       We are not asking for much . . . decent healthcare. . . .      Don't take it away. . . . Make it better.  I say to my colleagues: Do not take away American people's healthcare. Let's make it better.  I yield the floor.

208,topic-id,2141,"Mr.President, I rise to deliver my first official speech on the Senate floor. I begin by saying how deeply grateful I am to the people of New Hampshire for the great trust they have bestowed upon me.  I come from a State that combines rugged individualism with a strong sense of community. It is what I often call our ``all hands on deck'' approach, where we come together, we pitch in, and we help our friends and neighbors when they need it.  Right now, we see this approach each and every day with those on the front lines of our State's devastating substance misuse crisis. Law enforcement officials, medical professionals, and citizens in every corner of our State work together to try to turn the tide of this deadly epidemic. The heroin, opioid, and fentanyl crisis is the most pressing public health and safety challenge facing New This epidemic takes a massive toll on our communities, our workforce, and our economy, and I know it is ravaging other States all across our Nation too.  This crisis does not discriminate. It affects people in every community and from all walks of life. In 2016 alone, roughly 500 people in New Hampshire lost their lives as a result of this epidemic, and the spread of synthetic drugs, like fentanyl, is increasing dramatically the number of lives lost and[[Page S1831]]is killing people faster with smaller amounts of drugs. Last year, more than 70 percent of confirmed New Hampshire drug deaths involved fentanyl. Lives are at stake, so every Member of this body must come together and put partisan politics aside to get results for our people.  The people of my State have a long tradition of sharing their stories and making their priorities known to the elected officials who represent them, and everywhere I go, I hear stories from those who have been affected by this crisis. I hear inspiring stories from those in recovery who are working to put their lives back together, and I hear tragic stories from siblings, parents, and friends who know the pain of having a loved one taken from them far too soon. All of these stories are critical in breaking down the stigma of addiction and pushing for solutions. Instead of simply writing in an obituary that a loved one died suddenly, more and more families, including the families of one of my son's high school classmates, are speaking out and telling the painful stories of addiction and loss.  Last year, at our annual Easter egg hunt that I hosted as Governor, I was approached by a woman on our statehouse lawn who was carrying a baby. After I took a picture and I admired the baby, she pulled me aside and said the little boy she was holding was not her son but her grandson and that his mother had died from an overdose 1 month earlier. She was there on the day before Easter, as we celebrated our spring ritual of renewal and hope, and shared that pain with me so we could move forward to help others in her situation.  Just this week, on Monday, I met with a man named Phil, from Laconia, who is now in recovery. Phil said that over a year and a half ago, he had lost his home and nearly everything because of his substance use disorder. Now, thanks, in part, to the fact that he was able to gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, Phil is substance-free. He has gone on to become a recovery coach, and he helped found a recovery center in Laconia, where he works to help others with the same challenges he had.  We can never thank those in recovery and the families who have lost loved ones enough for speaking out about this issue and for working tirelessly and courageously to try to prevent others from suffering as they have, but while thanking them is appropriate, it is not enough. The bravery of survivors and those in recovery needs to be marked by our constant vigilance and by urgent action.  I am grateful to the Senators who have been true leaders on this issue, especially my fellow Senator from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen, who has fought tirelessly to secure funding to combat this crisis and help the people of our The passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act was an important step, as was the 21st Century Cures Act, which included some funding to fight the opioid epidemic. The Cures Act will not provide enough funding for our State, and I will continue fighting, alongside Senator Shaheen, to ensure that the Federal Government provides New Hampshire with the resources we need.  I am pleased there has been bipartisan support for combating this crisis in the Senate, but we must continue to work together at all levels of government and with those on the front lines to battle this crisis.  During my time as a member of the National Governors Association, I worked with my fellow Governors from both parties to push for steps, including passing emergency Federal funding to support States' efforts to combat this crisis, and at the State level in New Hampshire, we proved that we could come together to implement a comprehensive, ``all hands on deck'' strategy to support those on the front lines and help save lives.  During my time as Governor, we secured $5 million in additional State funding for treatment, prevention, recovery, and housing programs. We worked together to provide law enforcement with additional resources through a program called Operation Granite We expanded drug courts throughout New Hampshire, and we worked to crack down on fentanyl. In order to prevent the overprescribing of opioids, we took steps to improve provider training and update the rules for prescribers.  Critically, Republicans and Democrats put their differences aside and came together to pass and reauthorize the New Hampshire Health Protection Program, also known as Medicaid expansion. Passing and reauthorizing this program included healthy debate and, at times, heated argument. What matters is that after those debates, we were able to take this essential step forward to continue strengthening our families, our businesses, and our economy.  Medicaid expansion is providing quality, affordable health coverage to over 50,000 Granite Staters, including coverage for behavioral, health, and substance use disorder treatment. Thousands of people have received addiction treatment after gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion program in New What is clear and what I hear from people in recovery centers all across my State is that lives are being changed and saved as a result of Medicaid expansion.  Take, for example, Ashley, of Dover, I first met Ashley at the Farnum Center in Manchester, and I have been inspired by her story ever since. Ashley is living proof of the positive impact of Medicaid expansion.  Ashley had struggled for nearly a decade with heroin addiction, during which time she was arrested, her husband died from an overdose, and she lost the custody of her young child. Yet, as a result of her courage, perseverance, and the treatment she received for her substance use disorder under Medicaid expansion, Ashley's story is one of progress. She has been in recovery for over a year. She is employed, is working at Safe Harbor Recovery Center to help others who are struggling with addiction, and has moved to employer-sponsored insurance coverage.  It was an honor to have Ashley attend the President's joint address to Congress as my guest of honor, and I will continue to carry her story with me in these Chambers and beyond.  It is not just in New Republican Governors and some of my Republican colleagues in the Senate have made clear just how critical Medicaid expansion is to their As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found, 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with opioid disorders, have coverage under the Affordable Care That is real and essential progress, but we know we have far more work to do. I am committed to working with Members of both parties in the Senate to continue building on these efforts.  What we cannot afford to do, however, is to allow a partisan agenda to pull us backward. I am extremely concerned about the effect that legislation introduced by House Republicans last week--also known as TrumpCare--would have on our efforts to combat substance misuse. Make no mistake, this legislation would end Medicaid expansion, which experts have said is the most important tool available to fight the substance misuse crisis. This plan also cuts and caps the traditional Medicaid Program, which means States will be forced to either raise taxes or cut eligibility and services.  As a former Governor, I know full well the impact the decisions in Washington can have on our communities. Repealing Medicaid expansion and capping traditional Medicaid would severely hurt the ability of those on the front lines to save lives and combat this deadly epidemic.  Substance use disorder treatment providers have been clear that if Medicaid expansion is repealed, they will have to significantly cut back on the help they can provide to those in need. To pull the rug out from millions of people across the country who are seeking a lifeline from the throes of addiction is unconscionable. We cannot let that happen.  In addition to making the substance misuse crisis worse, TrumpCare would affect countless others across New Hampshire and America, from individuals who buy their own insurance who would see their premiums skyrocket to older Americans who would now be forced to pay an age tax, to women and families who would be hurt by the provision that defunds Planned  We know there is more work to do to improve and build on the Affordable[[Page S1832]]Care Act, but this TrumpCare bill is not the answer, and I am working with my colleagues to fight against this legislation.  Furthermore, I am working on additional legislation that would help combat this substance misuse crisis. I joined Senator Portman in introducing the STOP Act, bipartisan legislation that would help stop dangerous synthetic drugs like fentanyl and carfentanyl from being shipped through our borders to drug traffickers here in the United These synthetic drugs are only making this crisis more dangerous, causing a spike in deaths in New Hampshire and across the We must do everything possible to stop them from entering our country.  I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues, led by Senator Klobuchar, to introduce the SALTS Act, which would empower law enforcement to crack down on synthetic substances and better prosecute drug traffickers.  I also joined Senators Manchin, Shaheen, and several of our colleagues to reintroduce the LifeBOAT Act, which would establish a permanent funding stream to provide and expand access to substance misuse treatment.  These are essential steps we need to take now. I will also continue evaluating additional legislative steps to support treatment, prevention, recovery, and law enforcement efforts. We know the road ahead will not be easy. The scourge of addiction requires us, at times, to change the way we have always done things at a quicker pace than is sometimes comfortable but that can never be an excuse for inaction.  Every day, I am reminded of the stories like those of the grandmother I met at the annual Easter egg hunt, Phil's and Ashley's, and those of the thousands in my State who continue to feel the impacts of a crisis that is taking far too many lives. By making their voices heard, citizens in New Hampshire are breaking through the stigma of addiction and, in turn, are helping others seek the treatment and recovery they need. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that those critical services are there for them.  We must all continue to speak up and fight for those who are voiceless and those who continue to struggle. We must reach out and work toward policies that can truly make a difference because often when we reach out, people reach back, but if we are silent or if we allow the rug to be pulled out from under those seeking help, this epidemic will only get worse. It will devastate even further our families, our communities, and our businesses.  I am going to continue to fight to make progress, and I am willing to work with anyone to help those struggling to get the treatment they need and to support all of the dedicated professionals who are on the frontlines of battling this crisis. We will have to continue to fight together, each and every one of us, every single day, to build on our efforts to combat this epidemic, and by working together, we can and we will stem and turn the tide.

Mr.Griffin has been a leader in calling for easier access to naloxone, Narcan, for families at risk of an overdose, even testifying on the issue before the New Hampshire State My colleagues in the U.Senate remember Mr.Griffin from his testimony on the rise of opioid-related deaths and the importance of passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act last year. In addition to his role as cochair of the Addiction Policy Forum's families committee, Mr.Griffin has spearheaded several local efforts in the Granite State, including hosting a monthly church service for people with substance use disorders and their families, a club for young students to raise awareness of the dangers of opioids, and a project to create a farm-based sober living facility for those in recovery.  New Hampshire has benefited greatly from Mr.Griffin's devotion and leadership. On behalf of my colleagues and the U.Congress, I thank Mr.Griffin for all the advocacy work he has done and continues to do. I congratulate him again on being named one of the Addiction Policy Forum's ``Advocates of the Year''.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgS1969.txt,2302,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,23.0,March
339,topic-id,1854,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman, my friend from Colorado, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate, and I rise to debate the rule providing for consideration of the three bills related to the Department of Veterans Affairs--interestingly, all under one rule. We have been doing two bills under one rule. We are now headed to three. I recommend we just put all of our bills under a rule and save us a lot of time.  The first bill under today's rule, to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the bipartisanship reflected in this bill is certainly a rarity in this body and, frankly, could have easily come before us under the suspension of the rules.  There are nearly 47,000 job vacancies for doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals throughout the Veterans Administration's healthcare system. The VA is consistently rated as one of the worst Federal agencies in terms of pay and leadership, and since 2009, the number of VA employees resigning or retiring has risen every year.                              {time}  1245  As of the new year, 547,000 patients were waiting more than 30 days for care at a VA hospital. It is clear that we must act to improve the VA on a holistic level, and this bill is a good start.  This legislation establishes staffing, recruitment, and retention programs to enable the VA to build a stronger workforce.  However, I am disappointed that the Rules Committee majority did not make in order an amendment that I offered to this measure, which would have allowed the Secretary of the VA to fill any existing vacant positions within the Veterans Administration, regardless of whether the position was vacated before or after the reckless hiring freeze imposed by Donald John  I would also note that Representatives Schrader and Moulton offered an amendment that would fully lift the hiring freeze, but the Rules Committee blocked this amendment as well from receiving a vote on the House floor. I remain disheartened at the way the majority continues to operate the business of the House of  The bipartisanship this bill enjoys dissipates when we move to another bill wrapped in today's three-rule measure, and that is H.1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Before I launch into all of my remarks regarding this, I want to make it very clear that I and most Members of the House of Representatives will do everything we can to protect the Second Amendment rights of U.citizens and veterans especially.  This legislation, however, if enacted, would immediately enable approximately 174,000 veterans currently deemed mentally unfit by the VA to purchase firearms. At its core, this bill assumes that all veterans with mental illness should have unfettered access to guns, regardless of whether they will turn the weapon on themselves or their loved ones, and that any determination otherwise is simply wrong. The broadly reaching bill arbitrarily removes every veteran flagged by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System from its rolls, literally putting tens of thousands of lives at risk.  Let's look at the facts. Under procedures currently in place by the VA and the Department of Justice, an individual who lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs can be prevented from purchasing a gun. This term applies to veterans with severe mental illnesses who require a fiduciary to help manage their VA benefits. If the veteran thinks there was an error or that he or she was unfairly disqualified, the veteran can utilize the same due process and appeals procedures that are available for other VA decisions.  Under the current process, which was codified in the 21st Century Cures Act just a few months ago, the veteran is allowed a hearing before the Board of Veterans Appeals and given several opportunities for judicial review and appeal in Federal court.  Mr.Speaker, this bill turns this sensible and humane approach on its head. It is time that we acknowledge where we are as a country. It is time that we deal with the fact that we are in the midst of a veterans' suicide epidemic. Twenty veterans kill themselves every day. That is 7,300 of our finest and bravest persons in our society. Two-thirds of these suicides are carried out using firearms.  A Department of Veterans Affairs report, provided to Congress in 2015, revealed that nearly 20,000 veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia, 15,000 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and thousands more diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's, and serious depression were on the NICS rolls. Under this bill, these individuals and many more would be given immediate[[Page H2096]]access to guns, putting themselves and others in danger.  Even as our Nation suffers shooting after shooting, Congress has not acted. Democrats held a sit-in in this very room in that well in this last Congress to protest the callousness of the House Republican leadership in preventing us from even considering legislation to protect our citizens with reference to guns. Rather than act to address gun violence, we instead considered legislation like this, which will actually lead to more gun violence, Mr.The logic and lack of compassion in such an approach absolutely escapes me.  Our country has witnessed horrific shootings in the past few years. Dozens of children were murdered at Sandy Nearly 50 people were killed at the Pulse nightclub in One of our very own from this Congress was nearly assassinated while holding a townhall event in 2011. We continue to ignore the ramifications of shootings at Oak Creek, Aurora, Virginia Tech--I could go on and on--The list just continues. 32,000 Americans lose their lives every year from gun violence.  We have grieved together. And I, along with several of my colleagues, have stopped standing down here in the well for a moment of silence and then going back to our regular business after hundreds of our people are killed throughout this society. We have demanded change together, and we have been shocked by the paralysis that has gripped this institution when it comes to taking commonsense steps to end our country's gun violence epidemic.  Today, we see in this bill another measure coming out of Republican leadership that sprints toward the goal set by this country's powerful gun lobby. Listen up, NRA, there are people like me that aspire to have a zero rating by you every year. And it is not just the gun lobbyists, it is gun manufacturers as well. It may be great for the gun manufacturers' bottom line and the NRA's bottom line, but it is terrible for those brave men and women who have served this country so fully, those brave men and women who suffer wounds that may not be visible to the naked eye, but are no less real and worthy of our attention.  With each new tragedy that occurs, whether it be a mass shooting or the 20 servicemembers we lose every day to suicide, those who stand in the way of legislation to address our country's gun violence epidemic are increasingly culpable for its continuation. I am disgusted with this morally bankrupt obfuscation, and I think the American people are, too.  Let me lay down a marker. Of the 435, plus six Members of the House of Representatives and the 100 U.Senators, I want to see the first person when this measure goes into effect, if it does, and 174,000 veterans are taken off of the NICS rolls and can access guns, the first one that dies--and I hope we track it--I want everybody to stand up and remember that we had a chance to stop it here. Don't tell me, if 20 veterans are killing themselves every day and if 7,000-plus of them are killing themselves every year--and we won't even mention domestic violence and the horror that comes from those guns--if we continue this effort, we will allow more deaths along those lines.  Before concluding, Mr.Speaker, I want to say a few words about the final bill encompassed in this rule, H.1259, the VA Accountability First Act of 2017, and the Republicans' continued assault on the working people of this country.  At its core, this bill is an attack on workers' rights, plain and simple, and will do more harm than good in our efforts to improve care at the Veterans This legislation would strip the collective bargaining rights of VA workers. It weakens an employee's right to appeal. It weakens protections for VA workers who speak up against mismanagement and patient harm.  Republicans claim they want to help fix our VA system, yet, with this bill, they do that by insulting, undermining, and attacking the very employees who serve and care for our veterans, including the over 120,000 veterans who work for the Yesterday, one of our colleagues presented at the Rules Committee a statistic that I didn't know. Of the 2 million Federal employees in this great Nation of ours, 640,000 of them are veterans. So when we get ready to pare back this government that somehow or another people have targeted for all sorts of cuts, if you read today's budget proposal by Donald John Trump, you will see that lots of these veterans will be losing their jobs, in addition to all of the things that we have already discussed.  We need to make improvements at the Everybody knows that. That is clear. But singling out VA employees and their protections is counterproductive, to say the least, and only compounds manpower shortages plaguing the agency.  This legislation will exacerbate recruitment problems and impair retention at the agency. It threatens the agency's ability to build a robust clinical workforce by threatening the quality of care that the VA will be able to provide.  I don't know what the pique is by my Republican colleagues with reference to workers in this country. They talk a very good game about protecting workers and we are going to bring back jobs and we are going to do all of these things that are going to protect the middle class.  I will get a chance to talk about this a little bit more, but I am very proud of the unions in this They are the unions that people like my father and countless of us who served in the House of Representatives worked in and helped build this They are the people that our veterans from the Second World War, the Korean conflict, and Vietnam who became union members and went on to do things for collective bargaining that made workers' rights be better for people in And I don't see tearing them down--let alone in the VA administration--is something that we need to do.  Mr.Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle know exactly where their priorities lie with this bill, and it is certainly not with improving the quality of care of our veterans, but rather in exploiting yet another opportunity to attack the rights of working men and women across our country.  I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2094-3.txt,511,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,16.0,March

359,topic-id,467,"Mr.Speaker, at the end of the day, we are gathered here, once again, to debate the same old, tired, irresponsible, and morally bankrupt policies championed by my friends across the aisle, policies that will, while we face a suicide epidemic among those servicemembers who have so bravely served this country, make it easier for them to take their own lives by increasing their access to guns. That may be good policy for the powerful gun lobby and gun manufacturers, but it is horrendous policy for the American people.  We have before us legislation that will gut workers' rights for VA employees while also making it easier to reprimand those who are brave enough to speak out against the ills they see occurring at the VA--ills that have and will continue to undermine the quality of service our veterans are able to receive.  All of this moral ineptitude is set against the backdrop of a healthcare plan recently put forth by Republicans that will raise the number of uninsured in this country to 24 million in under 10 years. This includes 14 million folks being unceremoniously kicked off of Medicaid and 7 million Americans kicked off of the health insurance plans they receive through their employers.  This is a plan that will increase premiums for individual policyholders by up to 29 percent. This is a plan that will increase, particularly for older Americans, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.  Mr.Speaker, in the final analysis, this is no plan at all but rather a shameful and cynical massive giveaway to the ultrawealthy at the expense of the middle class that will result in hardworking Americans paying far more for far, far less.  Mr.Speaker, I have been in this institution 25 years, and I have been on this Earth 80 years. I have seen an awful lot of trauma during that period of time. I served as a State court judge and had the responsibility of Baker Acting--it is called in Florida--people to mental institutions. I have established fiduciaries for people who were unable to take care of themselves. I worked actively when we had mental health hospitals to keep those mental health hospitals open.  I would say to you, Mr.Speaker, so that you can say to the gentleman who asked that I apologize, that I apologize for nothing having to do with any remarks that I made within the confines of what is allowed in this institution. The simple fact of the matter is I used the term ``crazy,'' and I had reference to schizophrenia.

271,topic-id,1943,"Mr.President, I rise today to once again address the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the U.Supreme  I am extraordinarily pleased that the President has nominated such an outstanding individual to fill the seat that was held by my friend, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for nearly three decades.  In the weeks since Judge Gorsuch's nomination, I have done my best to make the case that he is exactly the kind of Justice that we need: one that will--in the timeless words of Marbury v. Madison--say what the law is, not what he wishes the law would be.  In my view, his outstanding credentials and his understanding of the proper role of a judge under our Constitution make him a choice that should command universal support. Unfortunately, this feeling does not appear to be as broadly shared as it should be.  Leftwing activists are demanding a scorched-earth approach to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, and I am afraid that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to have been swept up in this fervor. Their opposition stems from two different[[Page S1850]]sources and has taken two different forms.  The first cause is the visceral reaction among some to our new After last year's bitterly fought election campaign, many on the left simply refuse to accept the legitimacy of the new administration and are dead set on all-out opposition to every initiative, every policy, and every nominee of this As a case in point, we are in mid-March and the President is still waiting for the Senate to confirm his Cabinet nominees. This hasn't happened, to my knowledge, in the 40 years I have been in the  Skeptical of any nominee's willingness to hold the administration that nominated him accountable to the law, they are demanding assurances about how Judge Gorsuch would rule on the administration's most controversial moves.  The Supreme Court confirmation process should not be treated as just another forum to litigate the wisdom and lawfulness of the new administration's policies. Not only does such an approach distract from the proper focus on the nominee's qualifications and judicial philosophy, but it also threatens to undermine the very independence Democrats claim to want in a Supreme Court  As I have explained in detail as recently as last week, nominees of both parties for decades have refused to speculate on cases that may come before them in order to not prejudice their potential future judgments. Moreover, as a sitting Federal judge, Judge Gorsuch is bound by the code of conduct for United States judges, one of the canons of which prohibits a judge from making ``public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court.''  In light of this longstanding, necessary, and, in Judge Gorsuch's case, legally mandated practice, I have found it extraordinarily disappointing to hear some of my colleagues try to turn on its head Judge Gorsuch's admirable efforts to protect his independence. For example, the minority leader has repeatedly castigated Judge Gorsuch for refusing to take a definitive stand on the legality of the new administration's policies, accusing him of ``avoiding answers like the plague.''  For those of us of all political stripes who want a Supreme Court Justice who decides cases on the basis of what the law commands, rather than whether the result serves a particular political or policy agenda--be it Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, pro-Trump or anti-Trump--Judge Gorsuch's refusal to prejudice his approach to future cases should be celebrated, not condemned.  As Justice Sotomayor said recently: ``Any self-respecting judge who comes in with an agenda that would permit that judge to tell you how they will vote is the kind of person you don't want as a judge.''  Put more colorfully, there is a plague threatening judicial independence; here, this plague takes the form of the minority leader's attempt to extract these sorts of inappropriate answers, and Judge Gorsuch is wise to avoid that. The minority leader should know better.  Moreover, we know the minority leader does know better, given his many years of service on the Judiciary Committee and, in particular, how he acquiesced to the same approach when now-Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were presented with similar timely hypotheticals during their confirmation processes.  Sadly, I have little doubt that this line of attack on Judge Gorsuch will continue to infect the confirmation process, but we should be completely clear and unambiguous about what these attempts to get Judge Gorsuch to answer hypothetical questions about the legality of the administration's policies represent. They are illegitimate, partisan attempts to derail his nomination, cleverly shrouded in a cloak of alleged concern about his independence. Americans should not be under any illusions that these proper concerns about independence amount to anything else.  To turn to the second source of opposition to Judge Gorsuch's nomination, one need only examine this week's New York Times heading, which blared: ``Democrats' Line of Attack on Gorsuch: No Friend of the Little Guy.''  This same theme has been repeated by various leftwing interest groups and by some of my colleagues here in the They should be ashamed. As I have explained extensively in the past, the judge's critics view the judiciary as simply an extension of politics, just another forum to relitigate battles that they lost in the policymaking process. In their view, the job of a judge is not to apply the law to the facts dispassionately, but rather to pick winners and losers on the basis of the political popularity of the litigants and the policy consequences of the decision.  While such an approach is antithetical to the role of a judge under the Constitution, it has become an entrenched article of faith for most of those on the left. As such, they have approached Judge Gorsuch's nomination in a predictable manner: cherry-picking and mischaracterizing his opinions as evidence of a political agenda with total disregard of what the law commanded in each of those cases.  Simply put, this line of attack on Judge Gorsuch is ludicrous. Any reasonable analysis of his opinions shows that his decisions apply to laws enacted by the people's elected representatives, without regard to his own personal preferences. His approach manifests the Constitution's vision of the appropriate role of a judge that has been prominently embraced by Justice Scalia: ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you are not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.''  Today, I want to examine just a few of the cases seized on by Judge Gorsuch's liberal critics to demonstrate just how unfounded their attacks are. Compass Environmental v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission involved a Tenth Circuit ruling against a firm for failing to provide adequate training to protect its employees from electric shock hazards. Judge Gorsuch did indeed rule in the firm's favor, but the case did not present the question of whether the company should do more to protect its workers. Rather, the case turned on the question of whether the Secretary of Labor satisfied the standard of showing any evidence to demonstrate that the firm in question was providing less training than what is the norm in the industry.  One need only examine the judge's opinion to understand how that specific legal burden was met, reaching the same conclusion as the administrative law judge below.  Next, Riddle v. Hickenlooper touches on one of the liberals' faith talking points: the supposed need to regulate political speech in order to fight money in politics. While this case has been characterized as some invitation for wealthy and large corporations to exert undue influence in politics, it actually turned on a rather narrow and technical question of whether a $200 disparity in the contribution limits for major party and write-in candidates for Colorado's State House of Representatives amounted to an equal protection violation.  Judge Gorsuch joined the majority opinion of his colleagues--an Obama appointee, by the way--in agreeing that it did constitute such a violation, and then wrote a brief concurrence outlining how unclear Supreme Court precedent was on this particular point.  Moreover, he stated how ``clear'' it was that ``with a little effort, Colorado could have achieved its stated policy objectives . . . without offending'' the  In essence, Judge Gorsuch adopted a particularly narrow position on a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of campaign finance law, meriting none of his opponents' extrapolations about larger issues of political speech.  Finally, several of Judge Gorsuch's writings have called into question the so-called Chevron doctrine, under which Federal courts defer to administrative agencies' interpretations of the law. His opponents have seized on this skepticism to argue that Judge Gorsuch is somehow reflexively opposed to regulation. Nothing could be further from the truth.  These critics of Judge Gorsuch should recall that the Chevron deference first flourished as a reaction against liberal judges overturning the deregulatory actions of the Reagan administration. I myself am a skeptic of[[Page S1851]]Chevron and have led the fight to overturn it with my Separation of Powers Restoration But as the name of my legislation suggests, overturning Chevron is about restoring the constitutional allocation of powers between the three branches, maintaining fidelity to the text of the Administrative Procedure Act, and ensuring that the bureaucracy abides by the law no matter its policy goals.  These are a few of Judge Gorsuch's opinions that have been most prominently mischaracterized as driven by a political agenda, when in reality their results are demanded by the law. Sadly, I expect that these mischaracterizations and inappropriate demands of Judge Gorsuch will continue to appear in this confirmation process. They don't have any better arguments, and those arguments are not only flawed, but they are wrong and inappropriate.  Let me quote from a prominent liberal law professor, Harvard's Noah Feldman, to sum up how I think we all should feel about this strategy:       I'm not sure who decided that the Democratic critique of      U.Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch would be that      he doesn't side with the little guy. It's a truly terrible      idea. . . . [S]iding with workers against employers isn't a      jurisprudential position. It's a political stance. And      justices--including progressive justices--shouldn't decide      cases based on who the parties are. They should decide cases      based on their beliefs about how the law should be      interpreted.  That is a liberal law professor agreeing with me, really, and condemning these types of ad hominem attacks by people who know better or should know better.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to resist the temptation to give in to partisan and ideological pressure to engage in these tactics I described earlier, and I hope people will pay attention to what I have suggested. These are unworthy of the Senate's role, and they are unmerited with respect to such a stellar nominee as Judge Gorsuch, a man who is clearly committed to the proper, independent role of a judge.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in helping to ensure his speedy confirmation. This man is a decent, honorable, intelligent man who deserves the support of this decent, honorable, intelligent body. The arguments of the other side are without merit and, frankly, are really abysmal, and I sure hope they will reconsider and vote for this man who will be an excellent Justice on the U.Supreme  Mr.President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1654,topic-id,2529,"Mr.President, before I begin my remarks on the Supreme Court nomination, I want to just say a word about the terrorist attack in London yesterday.  I was devastated to hear that two Utahans, Kurt and Melissa Cochran, were victims in yesterday's attack.

Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, it is with great disappointment that I rise to address the treatment of Judge Neil Gorsuch by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  Today marks the close of his confirmation hearing, which began on This hearing was extraordinarily thorough, examining just about every facet of his record and his life.  The nominee himself delivered an outstanding performance, enduring more than 20 hours of intense questioning over 2 very long days. He displayed an impressive command of the law and the kind of intelligence one expects of someone with such stellar credentials. He showed the proper understanding of the role of a judge in our constitutional system of self-government: to apply, not make, the law. He demonstrated this crucial quality both in his affirmative answers and in the times he had appropriately refused to prejudge issues that might come before him. Throughout, his demeanor was serious, thoughtful, and humble. These qualities have defined his service as a judge for the last decade and will serve him well on the U.Supreme  As for my fellow Senators, many of them approached this hearing the right way, posing questions that gave us real insight into the nominee's record and judicial philosophy. Thanks to their hard work, Judge Gorsuch has now been vetted as extensively as any nominee to come before the Senate in the whole length of my service here. I thank them for their careful work and good judgment.  In particular, I want to single out my friend and colleague Senator As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he was charged with the monumental task of planning and executing the whole endeavor. He performed admirably, and we all owe him our sincere gratitude. He is one of the best people here, and he is totally honest and decent.  Regretfully, I feel compelled to contrast that responsible approach of many of my colleagues with the actions of a number on the other side of the aisle. Frankly, some of the treatment of Judge Gorsuch has made me ill. In him, we have a man who is superbly qualified and who quite obviously understands how his job is to say what the law is, not what he wishes it might be. In fact, I do not believe any fair examination of the whole of his[[Page S1964]]record on the bench can reasonably yield any meaningful clues as to what his policy views are. He is the kind of nominee whom, in an ideal world, we should be able to confirm by universal acclamation. Yet that is not the sort of treatment we are seeing--far from it.  Instead, we see a desperate campaign being waged against him to derail his nomination at all costs. This is the sort of approach that has long been advocated for by many far-left activists intent on attacking in their belligerent ways and stacking the courts with ideologues committed to imposing liberal policies without respect for what the law and the Constitution actually command.  As someone with great respect for all of my colleagues--even those with whom I often disagree--I had hoped they would resist the siren song of their activist base and give Judge Gorsuch a fair shake. Unfortunately, I see many of them falling prey to the temptations of this scorched-earth approach. Whatever their motivation--be it the outcome of the Garland nomination, the apparent unwillingness to accept the results of the election, or the desire for judges to push their political agenda--many of them appear willing to employ tactics they used to recognize, rightly, as inappropriate and even dangerous. In doing so, they threaten to inflict lasting damage on the judiciary, the Senate, and our politics more broadly.  Consider their demand that Judge Gorsuch answer politically charged hypotheticals about potential future cases. For decades, nominees of both parties have refused to comply, so much so that the practice is then referred to as the ``Ginsburg standard,'' after current Justice Ginsburg, and they had been quite right to do so. To offer an advisory opinion that is inconsistent with the Constitution's allocation of powers--which give judges the authority to decide only actual cases and controversies, not offer broad advisory opinions--is inconsistent with the core characteristic of the judicial process, which considers issues in the particular legal and factual context of an individual case and gives parties the opportunity to make their arguments in full, and it asks judges to prejudice themselves when they should be arbiters, raising serious due process concerns for future litigants who deserve a fair hearing.  Having participated in 14 confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees, I fully understand the temptation to ask these kinds of questions. Indeed, I have seen many Senators of both parties fall prey to the temptation, only to have a nominee politely respond about how it would be inappropriate to answer.  It is one thing to make the occasional mistake of this variety and move on. I have seen it happen countless times, but that is not what happened this week. Instead, I witnessed many of my colleagues devote almost their entire half hour rounds to posing these sorts of inappropriate questions. When Judge Gorsuch responded appropriately and explained his inability to answer--oftentimes with an extensive explanation of the rationale for doing so--he was lambasted by some of my colleagues for his refusal to engage in this dangerous practice.  Worse yet, these harsh attacks came from Senators who I have seen gladly embrace the very same answer from nominees in the past. What they once demanded, they now reject. What they once avoided, they now embrace. Simply put, it is hard not to interpret their attacks as hypocrisy of the highest order.  This is a completely illegitimate line of attack on Judge Gorsuch, and it should be repudiated forcefully.  Consider also the way in which some of my colleagues misrepresented Judge Gorsuch's record. It involved just a few simple steps. First, cherry-pick one of the judge's opinions in which a sympathetic victim lost; next, gloss over the legal issues at hand that mandated the outcome Judge Gorsuch reached; then, fail to mention how he was often joined in these opinions by his colleagues appointed by Presidents Clinton and Obama; after that, fail to mention the many times Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of litigants similar to the one who lost in the case at hand; finally, make a wild assertion and accusation about how that case shows how Judge Gorsuch is biased against ``the little guy.''  We should call these phony attacks for what they are: bogus attempts to mischaracterize his record intentionally.  Any fair analysis of the record Judge Gorsuch has established on the bench can lead to only one conclusion: He is the type of judge who will reach the result commanded by the best reading of the law, free from any political agenda.  He follows his oath to do justice without respect to persons. As Judge Gorsuch himself rightfully put it, quoting Justice Scalia, ``If you're going to be a good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.''  There will always be times when the law produces a result we disagree with. That is a simple fact of life. Sometimes that is our fault for not writing the law better, but the appropriate response is to change the law, not to demand that a judge ignore the law to reach a result we like.  As legislators, it is, by definition, our responsibility to change the law to produce better, more just results. If my colleagues think a law like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is producing bad results, it is their right to try to change it. They can count on me fighting tooth and nail to protect religious liberty, but at least they will be doing their job as lawmakers, not shirking it and demanding that unelected judges do their dirty work, nor impugning the honor of good judges like Judge Gorsuch who refuse to ignore the law on behalf of a political agenda.  In Judge Gorsuch, we have a Supreme Court nominee as fine as I could ever imagine. He is the type of man we all should be clamoring to step into the late Justice Scalia's big shoes. But instead of the best traditions of the advice and consent process that many of us have tried to live up to, what is he treated to? Hypocritical attacks on the very judicial independence that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim to prize above all else, misleading attacks that distort his record, and now a promise to filibuster his nomination by the minority leader. My gosh, what have we come to around here?  I remember when Justice Ginsburg went through with only three votes against her and not much debate, and she refused to answer any of the questions that my friends on the other side were demanding of Judge Gorsuch and of other Republican judges. Frankly, I stuck up for her and felt that was the right thing for her. I have great respect for her because of the way she handled those proceedings and others as well. We didn't do this in earlier years. It has become so radical around here and so political around here that we are besmirching the very people who have become the judges in this land and are doing such a good job.  This is a travesty of the highest order. Judge Gorsuch is a brilliant, decent man who has devoted his life to serving his country. He has done exactly what we want as a careful judge for more than a decade. What does he get when nominated to the highest Court in the land? He gets his name dragged through the mud. He gets baited with questions we all know he cannot answer, that nobody can answer. If they are not trick questions, they are certainly improper, and then he is attacked for not answering. He gets his record mischaracterized and is accused of cruelty and hardness of heart. He gets the kind of treatment that leads him to regret putting his family through what ought to be a dignified process.  It is time to stop this madness, stop the dishonest attacks. Instead, let's have a debate worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body and confirm this absolutely outstanding nominee.  If my friends on the other side would treat somebody as respectable and highly prized and praised as Judge Gorsuch and treat them the way he was treated in some instances in these hearings, may we bar the door on the next nominee of this administration. That will be Armageddon, I guess, and we can't let this body descend into that sort of catastrophe.  I will insist on our nominees being people of the highest order, like Judge Gorsuch, people who will make us all[[Page S1965]]proud, people who will respect both sides but who will enforce the law, and people who, when it becomes time to change the law, can properly make that decision and have the guts to do it. There aren't many cases that have to be changed, however. All I can say is there are some that both sides wish would be changed, and on both sides.  All I can say is this: I hope our colleagues will treat this President's nominees with greater respect. I have always tried to treat their nominees with great respect, and I helped get them through. Justice Ginsburg had only three votes against her, if I recall correctly. It was very few votes. There are judges who are now on the bench who I couldn't support, but I didn't stop them from having a vote up or down. Frankly, there are judges on the Circuit Court of Appeals whom we allowed to come up and whom I personally would not have approved as a President or otherwise but who were picked properly by the Democratic President and who had enough good recommendations on their side to sit on the bench. I think that is what has made this country a great country--that we understand that there are different points of view, not just in politics, but with regard to the law itself. And all of us have to understand that and realize that when somebody's elected President, that person, whether he or she, deserves to have fair consideration of the judicial nominees.  It is no secret that President Obama put almost 50 percent of the Federal bench on the bench, and he had a lot of up-and-down votes on them. Yes, there were some notable differences and notable debates, but by and large, the President got whomever he wanted. And I have to say that in the past, Republican Presidents generally got whomever they wanted. But in the intervening number of years since Roe v. Wade, we have had nothing but big problems that I think have resulted in the denigration of the bench and which should never have occurred.  I hope my colleagues, all of whom I deeply admire and like, will take some of these things into consideration and treat Judge Gorsuch with the true and deliberate respect that he deserves. I hope they can bring themselves to vote for him because he is truly a wonderful man, a great father, a wonderful husband to his wife, a tremendous person from the West, a fly fisherman, a fellow whom every one of his law clerks deeply loves, and a person who, by any measure, is one of the brightest judges in the country today. I can't really think of anybody who would be brighter than he is or any better than he is.  So Donald Trump picked one of the best people, if not the best person in America, for this job, and I hope my colleagues on the other side will recognize that in spite of their dislike, and sometimes even hatred, for Donald Trump, this is important. And it is important that we start handling these matters with greater dignity, greater fairness. When we really do disagree, fine; let's have a debate and battle on it, and let the chips fall where they may. But not all of these deserve to be in that category, and certainly Judge Gorsuch does not deserve to be in that category. He is an absolutely outstanding person.

There's been a focused effort to dramatically reduce      populations of wolves, coyotes, and bears, and the methods      and means they've used are both unscientific and unethical.  That is not my quote, but that of former Governor Tony Knowles of  In addition, in the past decade, the Alaska Board of Game and the department have turned their back, I think, on a long history of not only working together between Federal and State agencies but embracing ethics as central to wildlife management--not just to maintain the viability of that management but to maintain the support of the public for that management.  This relatively new approach that actively seeks to eschew the long history of embracing sporting ethics can best be summed up by a quote from Doug Vincent-Land, the former director of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Wildlife He said: ``The professionals at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game did not feel it was our role to judge the ethics of these practices.''  The result of this ethics-free approach is now glaringly obvious, when considering some of the methods of take that have been approved over time for native predators in Shooting mother grizzlies with cubs, aerial gunning of wolves, killing wolf pups in their dens, using spotlights at bear dens, baiting of bears, and allowing the wanton waste of black bear meat are a few of the practices that Alaska's Board of Game has approved.  Aldo Leopold, the father of modern wildlife conservation, once said: ``Ethical behavior is doing the right thing[[Page S1867]]when no one else is watching--even when doing the wrong thing is legal.''  Now, I know it has become fashionable in some hunting circles recently to ignore the importance of ethics to our way of life. Yet, if our greatest leaders are any indication, that is, at best, a slippery slope to irrelevance.  This cartoon is a good reminder. It is from the early 20th century, at a time when President Teddy Roosevelt was invited down to Mississippi for a black bear hunt. When he wasn't successful, they tied a black bear to a tree. I think that cartoon from that period is a good reminder of how T.viewed the importance of sportsmanship and ethics in hunting as central to what maintains our credibility. Today, politicians jump at the chance to embrace his reputation, but too often they have not followed his example. So while shooting down grizzlies with cubs may be legal, I suspect the public will never view it as ethical. I have to wonder what good old T.would have to say about recent decisions to allow things like unlimited bag limits on black bear cubs or baiting of bears and shooting female grizzlies with cubs.  So why does all of this ethics stuff matter so much to hunters? Why does it matter to me? It matters because hunters like me are a small minority of the population in this country. We are less than 5 percent, by most counts, and we are able to carry on this great tradition because the vast majority--the nonhunting public, which is 95 percent of the population--sees us as effective and ethical stewards of our country's native wildlife. We have embraced the North American model of wildlife conservation that has literally brought elk, deer, wild turkey, and species we think of as common today--Canada geese, for example--back from the brink of extinction, and that public shares in that success when they enjoy wildlife. That is true, even if they never hunt, never pick up a fishing poll. We as hunters also have the trust and the respect of the public because we are willing to literally spend billions of dollars of our own money to protect, conserve, and manage those resources with the best available science.  The Alaska Game Board's decision to ignore the latest science on the importance of predators to healthy prey populations is indicative of a desire to effectively turn caribou and moose populations into livestock and to manage for maximum numbers and maximum tag revenue.  Now, ironically, that approach has certainly been ineffective at boosting and maintaining historically high caribou and moose numbers.  This is an example of a graph of moose population over time. We can see back in 2002, when these sorts of intensive take measures went into place: intensive predator control, preintensive management, and postintensive management. If you can discern a consistent correlation of an outcome of higher moose numbers there, you are doing better than  This would all be fine if this was just happening on State lands in Alaska, perchance. But, unfortunately, the Alaska Game Board now seeks to suppress healthy predator populations on our national wildlife refuges--the very places set aside to protect and preserve our native wildlife--even predators, even black bears and grizzlies and wolves. Let that sink in for a moment.  This is about embracing unscientific wildlife management on the very refuges that belong to each and every American citizen--not Alaska State land but our national wildlife refuges.  People save up for years--sometimes decades--to travel thousands of miles to go to places like the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge so they can see a grizzly bear fish for salmon. Does it make sense to allow these kinds of extreme measures of take to allow for grizzlies with cubs to be killed in those refuges? Will these policies actually benefit the hunting public? I would argue that they do not.  Not one of my colleagues can deny how much I love to hunt and fish. Many of my life's best memories have been forged around the campfire with my friends and family at elk camp. Just this past Christmas break, both of my boys joined me for what would be my son Carter's very first elk hunt. This is the picture of us in the Continental Divide Wilderness Study  After days of hard hunting, hiking miles through the rough and tumble backcountry of the Continental Divide WSA, my son Carter harvested his first elk.  He soon learned that the real work starts after you pull the trigger. He labored long and hard to make sure that every scrap of meat from that animal made its way from the wilderness to our freezer. Anything less would be unethical and disrespectful to that magnificent animal. My son takes great pride in the meals that elk provides for our family and our friends. He also knows that hunting is conservation and that we have a responsibility to hand these wildlife resources off to the next generation unimpaired. I am proud that even at 13 he takes that responsibility very seriously.  Some of my son's classmates in school are vegetarians. Too many of those who do eat meat think that it is created, as my colleague from Alaska said, on a Styrofoam platter wrapped in cellophane. Carter knows better. As someone who hunts and fully embraces the ideas of sustainability and ethics, the next generation of sports men and women couldn't have a better ambassador to this new generation of millennials for why hunting is actually critical to the future of wildlife.  That, my friends, is what this CRA before us, in my view, puts at risk.  When you vote to put the Federal stamp of approval on methods of take that the public views as objectionable--even unethical--when you allow that ideologically driven style of game management to even permeate the sanctity of our national wildlife refuges, I don't think that is standing up for hunters. I fear that it is endangering the future of something that is critical to culture and way of life.  As I said before, the number of active hunters in the United States today sits, I think, at around 5 percent, or maybe a little lower--I hope not. By voting for this CRA, we are risking the confidence of the general public in our ability as hunters to be the best stewards of our wildlife resources. That is a risk that I am not willing to take.  So I would urge all of my colleagues to stand up for our Nation's wildlife, to stand up for our national wildlife refuges, and to vote no on this proposal.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Methods of take, like shooting mother grizzlies with cubs, aerial gunning of wolves, killing wolf pups in their dens--these are not 21st-century tools for wildlife management. They are relics of the 19th century, before we truly understood the importance of predators to healthy ecosystems and populations. These practices have no place on our Nation's Federal wildlife refuges.  This rule, frankly, doesn't stand up for subsistence hunters or hunters at all; it simply reinforces the politically driven and unscientific turn that the Alaska Board of Game has taken under Governors like Sarah This isn't about hunting; it is about dogma and dogma driving policy.

397,topic-id,826,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in opposition to this bill, and I adopt many of the premises that my friend, Mr.Walz, adopted.  I also adopt the premise of Roe, who is a really dear friend of mine, that Tim Walz is the kind of guy you wouldn't mind riding across the country with. That is because he is honest, he is knowledgeable, and he is sincere. Frankly, I attribute all of those same characteristics to  But, Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. Everybody on this floor agrees that our veterans deserve the best care possible. There is no debate about that. All of us in this House are focused on that goal. But this bill does nothing to meet that goal, in my view. This bill is part of--and I do not ascribe it to Roe--a significantly long history of a partisan effort to scapegoat Federal civil servants that has been going on for decades, long before Roe got in it or Mr.Walz got in it.  It is a follow-on to the dangerous hiring freeze the Trump administration imposed in January and the repeated attempts over the last several years to extract more and more cuts from Federal employees' pay and benefits, which contributed over $150 billion in cuts in pay and benefits over the last 6 years. Stripping away the rights of VA employees to work in a nonpartisan, professional environment will not improve the care our veterans and their families deserve and expect from the VA medical system.  This bill, in my view, would undermine the collective bargaining rights--I am a very strong supporter of collective bargaining rights--of VA employees serving as doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and others in critical jobs, and disrupt the collaborative relationship between VA managers and employees that is essential to a successful workplace environment.  Many years ago--almost 100 years ago--we adopted a civil service system. The premise of that system is we ought to have professional employees--not political employees, not political appointees--not subject to change because of the political whims that may be blowing one way or the other. This bill risks demoralizing those who have tirelessly been working to help our veterans reintegrate into civilian life in communities across this country.  Let me make it clear--and I am sure Roe is not surprised when I say this--that I agree with Mr.If there is an employee who is not performing well, that employee ought not to be kept on. But this bill removes the process that was negotiated, or could be negotiated, in a collective bargaining way. And if, by the way, it takes 300-plus days, then perhaps this legislation could deal with that to shorten it. There are ways this could be dealt with that, in my view, will not undermine the civil service protections that are important not only for the employees, but for the system itself.  I have no doubt there are measures that can be adopted to improve VA performance and effectively and fairly discipline employees who engage in misconduct. We ought not to tolerate that. But this bill does not include them. I have not read Senator Isakson's bill, but perhaps that is closer, and I look forward to reviewing it with both the chairman and the ranking member.  This bill goes too far, shreds basic due process rights, in my view, and punishes even model employees. And let me say as an aside, when I say it undermines basic due process rights, part of those rights are to have some time to get representation, to thoughtfully respond, to have some discovery as to what is going on here, what is being alleged, why is it being alleged, and who is alleging it. This bill eviscerates that, in some respects.  I am proud to represent 62,000 Federal employees in Maryland's Fifth District, including many who work at the VA's clinic in Charlotte Hall and in Camp Springs in the neighboring Fourth We ought to remember, Mr.Chairman, that when we undermine our Federal workforce and our ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest, we undermine our government's ability to serve the American people. So this is not just about present employees. It is about those who might consider employment in the future.  Mr.Chairman, I hope we don't make the mistake of, in effect, throwing the baby out with the bath water. Let's not take away the rights and protections of those who serve us so ably.  But, yes, I agree with Roe and with Ranking Member If there are those who are not serving us well, yes, there ought to be a process; it ought to be fair, it ought to provide time in which to respond, not interminable time, so that we can have an agency of which we can be proud and does what we all want--serve our veterans in a way that we would expect,[[Page H2118]]demand, and that we are morally obligated to give.

617,topic-id,1304,"Mr.Speaker, I must hasten to add that the gentleman from California added a little comment that ``it is known.'' I don't share that view, Mr.Speaker, that it is known that the Affordable Care Act is failing.[[Page H2170]]  In fact, we had a hearing yesterday when the former Director of the Congressional Budget Office appointed by Democrats testified on the Affordable Care Act and testified on the American Health Care Lo and behold, Mr.Speaker, Mr.Elmendorf agreed with the present CBO In other words--and everybody in America ought to be pleased on this because they all are asking for bipartisan--the former Director appointed by Democrats of the CBO agrees with the Republican Director of the CBO, who just came down with his advice and counsel to the Congress just a few days ago.  That ought to give pause to those who are pressing to pass a bill, which would result in the loss by 24 million Americans of their insurance and would result in the increased costs to almost every American of their insurance.  Now, yes, there are some Americans who would choose not to have health care. Then they would get sick or they would get in an automobile accident or something else would happen where they would require medical care, and they would not be able to pay for it. Guess what? We would all pay for it.  That is what was happening before the Affordable Care It is still happening with some who choose either to pay their contribution toward health--some people call it a penalty; I call it a contribution--to meet their personal responsibility, as the Heritage Foundation suggested, of having provisions that, if they get sick, they will be able to pay for it.  Now, last week, Mr.Speaker, the majority leader had some quotes from people who did not like the Affordable Care At this hearing that we had, we had a number of people, and I want to quote some of them:       I certainly never imagined I would have a child who would      rely so much on a government program like  This child, Mr.Speaker, suffers from Rett syndrome, which is a neurology disorder that strikes mostly young girls with normal development for the first 18 or 24 months of their life. Then their development is arrested and, in fact, in some respects, there is a retreat in their abilities.  She went on to say:       Medicaid provides skilled nursing care, which allows us to      raise our daughter, Caroline, in our home instead of a      hospital or institution.  Of course, a hospital or institution would be far more expensive, Mr. She went on to say:       This allows my husband and me to hold jobs and take care of      other family needs. The House Republican plan for Medicaid      would put my daughter's life at risk, and my family is      terrified.  That was Marta Conner, mother of a child with Rett syndrome covered under  I titled yesterday's hearing: The hearing that the Republicans refused to have on the American Health Care Act or the Affordable Care Act itself.  This quote is by a doctor:       In public debate in Congress, the actual people can be      obscured by graphs and numbers. But, ladies and gentlemen,      every day in clinic, I am one-on-one with the real people,      real Americans who could take steps closer to health or      suffer more with this Congress' decision. I urge you and your      colleagues to reject the American Health Care Act and,      instead, strengthen the Affordable Care  To that extent, Mr.Speaker, as the majority leader knows, that testimony joined hundreds in the medical field: The American Medical Association, associations of physicians with particular skill sets, of hospitals, of insurance companies, of patients, of providers, of urban hospitals, suburban hospitals, rural hospitals, and literally hundreds of people intimately involved in the healthcare system who are urging us not to pass the American Health Care Act and to leave in place but improve the Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, I have indicated to many on this side of the aisle that we are prepared to work to improve any piece of legislation that has been passed and particularly a piece of legislation which affects so many Unfortunately, we have not had that opportunity since this bill, the Affordable Care Act, was first considered and passed.  This week, the Congressional Budget Office released their estimate and impacts of the House Republicans' bill to repeal the Affordable Care  Mr.Speaker, as the majority leader knows, President Trump, in this body and at that rostrum, promised insurance for everybody that is much less expensive and much better. He has not offered such a bill. The American Health Care Act certainly does not provide that.  In fact, the CBO--both Republican and Democratic directors--opined at least 24 million people will lose their insurance and, by 2026, there will be 58 million people in America without health insurance.  Mr.Speaker, the majority leader has indicated this bill will be on the floor next week. I hope that everybody takes the opportunity to read the CBO report and the testimony given in yesterday's hearing on the bill. It was the first and only hearing that was held on the bill that will be on the floor. Previous hearings on the Affordable Care Act are not good, and previous hearings that there are alternatives out there don't deal with the bill that is going to be on the floor next Wednesday or  Senator Susan Collins has said of the bill that is going to be on the floor:       It should prompt the House to slow down and reconsider      certain provisions of the bill.  She was referring, of course, to the CBO report.  Senator Bill Cassidy from that liberal leftwing bastion of Louisiana said:       Can't sugarcoat it. Doesn't look good. The CBO score was,      shall we say, an eyepopper. I also hope it was a thought      provoker.

It was not brought before us until it came right before the floor.  But let me follow through on all your questions because my response back was, I was actually excited to hear that Democrats wanted to work with us, that their attitude has changed from when we were in committee and they had amendments going forward, that it was no longer going to be hashtag amendments, it was actually going to be productive amendments; and I thank you for having that change of attitude.  Mr.Speaker, I am proud of the transparent process we have taken in the House, and I think this needs to be reminded to all the American public.  As I mentioned last week, our healthcare bill is the result of 113 hearings. I know the gentleman on the other side of the aisle, he is proud of the 72 hearings they had before they did the Affordable Care  We have now marked up this bill in three separate committees, with over 18 hours of debate in Ways and Means, and over 27 hours of debate in Energy and Commerce, and the countless amendments from both Republicans and  By the time we vote on the floor, this bill will have been publicly available online for 3 weeks. Now, it is only 127 pages. That is a far contrast to the 2,700-plus pages, if you want to compare it to  So far, nearly 590,000 people have visited our website, and over 200,000 have downloaded this legislative text.  So, Mr.Speaker, that means more people have read our healthcare bill than went to I call that transparency. Republicans have been committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare for years, and so now I think it is time to act.  The gentleman also commented about the Well, I am actually excited that you had another person who confirmed what the CBO said because what the CBO says about this bill is it will lower the deficit by $337 billion.  It will also reduce premiums by 10 percent by 2026, and it will secure major entitlement reform by capping Medicaid spending, giving States certainty and flexibility, saving taxpayers $880 billion, and making the program solvent for future generations, because that was a concern in one of the letters.  Now, Mr.Speaker, those are the facts. With regard to the coverage numbers, the CBO reports that most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with individual mandates. Let me repeat that. Most of the increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate.  Now, that makes sense to me, because if we no longer force Americans to buy something they do not want, one-size-fits-all health care, they will naturally choose not to buy it.  But, Mr.Speaker, I know the gentleman across the other side of the aisle argues with me about the knowledge that everybody knows ObamaCare is failing. I would ask the gentleman to visit one-third of the counties in this country that only have one option.  Or why don't you go to Tennessee, where the President just was because, you know, 16 counties in Tennessee have no option. But ObamaCare will penalize you for not having health care when you can't even buy it.  But if ObamaCare was working so well, why do more people accept the penalty or the exemption than actually buy ObamaCare? That is a number that is quite interesting. That is why I am encouraged to see our plan will decrease the average premiums that people have been asking for.  Now, our goal is not just to sign up people for insurance. Our goal is to get America better health care.  Now, the gentleman also commented and had letters--and I love to read letters. I love to listen to constituents because that is what our work should be. And you read a letter when it came to And I would not scare people, I would actually talk to that individual.  Medicaid is on an unsustainable path. In one 10-year window, it will cost $1 trillion.  Mr.Speaker, the gentleman on the other side knows what $1 trillion is because that is about the entire amount we spend on discretionary spending. From all of the appropriations that we go through, that would take up everything we have.  Well, we know that is not sustainable, so we should do something about it. That is why we had a meeting with 18 Governors, Republicans and And the number one thing they told us, give us flexibility to be able to manage. That is exactly what this bill does.  But I like to read some letters. Here is one from Colleen from Annapolis:       I just received the notice for my 2017 health insurance      policy. It will skyrocket, not by the advertised Maryland      State average of 20 to 25 percent but, rather, by 60 percent.      In addition, my deductible is going up 45 percent. Since the      inception of ObamaCare, my policy has increased 75 percent.       I am a 63-year-old female in excellent health who takes no      medication. My only benefit from the ACA has been two      mammograms, which I paid $12,600 in premiums to get. What a      disaster of a program.       I will be voting Republican this year, in the hope of      finally getting the ACA repealed. I just hope it happens      before my checkbook goes on life support.  Or the letter to the editor from Carl in Lusby, Maryland:       I can't afford my health insurance now under      It's been a burden on our joint income, which is just above      the limit for qualifying for subsidies; and for 2017, I am      facing a 61 percent rate increase.       I'm faced with either paying a premium that will bankrupt      me and my wife, or paying the tax penalty at the end of the      year, which will also be unaffordable. And there are probably      several million Americans who are in the same boat as I am.  You know what, Carl? We listened to you. We listened, and now we are going to lead. We have moved a bill from the legislative process to the rules, what it says, for reconciliation. We have done hours of debate in three other committees. We will continue the process, as the rules say. We will go to the Rules Committee and then we will come to this floor. And for those who have written, change will come.  Yes, the Republican-appointed CBO Director and the Democratic CBO Director, as the gentleman, Mr.Speaker, from across the aisle says, agree that the premiums will go down, as so many Americans have asked for. We will put Medicaid on a sustainable path.  We will give Republican and Democrat Governors flexibility so they can manage their States in a better form. And most importantly, we will give America exactly what they asked for, the freedom to choose their own health care, the options of having more so they can direct what they want and desire, at the same time, having a lower cost.  So I welcome the gentleman for his questions. I know that wasn't about scheduling, but I think this is too important, because those 113 hearings we listened to the people before us, and we promised we would act, and we are keeping that promise as we move forward.

621,topic-id,853,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information. People, I am sure, listening to this colloquy must get confused because they hear one representation from somebody who sounds pretty reasonable, my friend, Mr.McCarthy, and then they hear exactly the opposite from me. So they will have to make a judgment.  The bill that is going to be on this floor next week was introduced a week ago It was marked up less than 42 hours later.  My friend, the majority leader, Mr.Speaker, said: I love to listen to constituents. Not a single constituent on his side of the aisle or my side of the aisle, Mr.Speaker, had the opportunity to testify on this bill. Not a single one of my constituents, or the majority leader's constituents, had the opportunity to know what the CBO said was going to happen; that 24 million people[[Page H2172]]would lose their insurance, 14 million next year; that Medicare would be put at risk; and Medicaid would be gutted by 2021. Not a single constituent was listened to because they had no opportunity to come and say: this is what I think.  The testimony to which I referred was yesterday. I don't know the dates on the letters that the gentleman just read, but perhaps they were just within the last few days.  But I will tell that 63-year-old woman that what this bill does, if you got a 60 percent increase, will up that by 66 percent because you are going to go from a 3-to-1 ratio to a 5-to-1 ratio on which seniors, and 63 years of age, regrettably, from my standpoint, are referred to as seniors. The bill that is going to be considered will allow the insurance company to do a 5-to-1 ratio, rather than a 3-to-1 ratio, so that 60 percent is going to go up by 40, maybe get to 100 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the American people know about transparency. That means they can see something.  The gentleman says: Well, now it is online. Yes, they had 40 hours, give or take, to see this bill from Monday night to Wednesday, when it was marked up, and it was marked up and passed in the Ways and Means Committee in the dead of night, sort of like they passed the prescription drug bill, at 5:59 in the morning. The majority leader wasn't here. I was here. Perhaps there is a predilection to middle of the night. By the time the Energy and Commerce Committee passed it, they had been in session for over 24 hours and were bleary-eyed.  As I told him last week, Mr.Speaker, my folks were not up at 4 a.m. watching the Energy and Commerce And I would tell him further that--he said the bill was now online and people had an opportunity to read it. Perhaps, Mr.Majority Leader, Mr.Speaker, that is why the Affordable Care Act has now got more support from the country than it has had at any time since its existence; where there are 49 percent of Americans who now like the Affordable Care Perhaps the reason that is happening now is because they have had the opportunity to see the alternative that the Republicans have offered and are offering on                              {time}  1215  This bill that they offered is going to significantly raise--I will tell Colleen--her out-of-pocket expenses.  And, yes, under their bill, the CBO says that perhaps the premiums will go down. Why will the premiums go down? Why does insurance go up and down? Because the risk goes up and down; and the greater the risk, the more the cost. But if you don't allow people who are sick people to get into the system because they can't afford it, then the risk goes down. When the risk goes down and you shut people out of the system and 24 million people are out of the system, yes, of course, the rates go down because you are insuring the healthy.  Now, Americans know that very well because they know they have automobile insurance--which, by the way, they are mandated to have in almost every State, if not every Why are they mandated to have it? So the rest of us are protected when we have an accident or we are protected from our rates going up because there is not a broad spectrum of the insured so that the risk can be minimal for the insurance company.  So I say to my friend that CBO has told the truth. The Americans are seeing that, and they don't like that. I would urge those on the other side of the aisle to be very careful when they vote either Wednesday or Thursday on this bill because this bill is going to have a very detrimental effect on the American people.  Now, I understand there are going to be two other bills. There are going to be four bills on the floor, as I understand it. Can the gentleman inform us of when we will see the details of this additional legislation?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr.I ask the gentleman which bills he is referring to?

624,topic-id,484,"Lastly--and I know you are glad to hear that comment, as are the folks waiting to do 1-minutes--we have received a letter from Secretary Mnuchin on March 8. It was directed to the Speaker, Mr.Leader, and like most Secretaries of the Treasury, he is hoping that we will pursue financially responsible and confidence-building policies.  I won't read the whole letter, but he says in the last paragraph: ``As I said in my confirmation hearing, honoring the full faith and credit of our outstanding debt is a critical commitment. I encourage Congress to raise the debt limit at the first opportunity so that we can proceed with our joint priorities.''  Mr.Speaker, I ask the majority leader whether that is going to be scheduled in the near term because, on March 15, we met the debt-limit extension. This administration and every previous administration have taken steps to prolong the time before we default by using extra mechanisms so that we are, in effect, not investing in the retirement system or something else and paying our debts.  I have indicated publicly, Mr.Speaker, and I reiterate here, that I will urge my side to support a debt-limit extension if it is clean. What I mean by ``clean,'' if it does not incorporate something that is not agreed to and there is not a consensus on. By that I mean, simply, if there are things that we have a consensus on that need to be passed, certainly including those in the debt-limit extension would not be objectionable. But if there are items in that bill designed to force us to vote for what is a responsible policy but takes something that we obviously very strongly disagree with, we will not do so.  So my questions to the majority leader are: A, can we expect a clean debt-limit extension? B, can we expect that in the near term, as Secretary Mnuchin requests, so that we can put that matter behind us and not undermine confidence in our fiscal posture as a nation?  I yield to my friend.  Mr.I think we both agree that responsible fiscal policy is important to our country's ability to succeed, and that includes honoring the full faith and credit of the United We expect to continue working closely with Secretary Mnuchin to ensure that America is on the right path to a strong fiscal future.  We know the amount of debt that has been added in the last 8 years has been tremendous. I know that the gentleman, when he looks to what we do next week--to be able to lower premiums, save more than $300 billion of the deficit, and let people have more choice--that is also a first step.  Now, I do not have any immediate action to announce, but we will relay any information to the Members as we move forward.  I thank the gentleman.  Is that going to be your last question?

627,topic-id,485,"I guess the answer to that question, Mr.Speaker, is what will determine an upset. Will the American people be upset? Will the Republicans be upset? The answer to that question remains in the hands of our Republican colleagues, because what I want to do in observation, I disagree with all three of the propositions that the majority leader said in his closing statement.  This is not going to reduce the budget. Yes, on its face, they give a $600 billion tax cut to the wealthiest in Where do they take it from? Medicaid, some of the poorest people in That is where that money comes from.  Premiums are going to go up. Deductibles are going to go up. You can quote me on this 2, 3 years from now. I don't think your bill is going to pass. But if it did pass, that is what would happen. You won't be able to test me because I don't think the bill is going to pass. It may pass this floor, but it will not become law.  The majority leader's statement, Mr.Speaker, that that is what the American people are expecting, I disagree with that. What the President of the United States said he was going to give to the American people is insurance for everybody. The majority leader ignores the 24 million. He hasn't spoken about that. He spoke about some other observations in the CBO report, as did Speaker I don't blame him. I would try to point to some positive indicators myself.  I think this is going to up the deficit, it is going to up costs, and it will decrease the insured and make hospitals have more uncompensated care. We will have this debate next week, Mr. But on the last issue, I would hope, Mr.Leader, that we do agree on fiscal responsibility. I happen to believe, as you know, the debt limit issue is a phony issue, a totally political issue. It has been used as a political issue on both sides of the aisle. There should be no question but of course the United States is going to pay its debt, of course the United States is going to pay people whom it has bought things from, and of course it is going to pay people moneys that they have been promised. Of course it is going to do that. This is not about new spending. It is about spending that we have already incurred.  I would urge the majority leader to bring a clean bill to the floor. I will work with him. We will get the overwhelming majority of Democrats to vote for that. Let's not blame one another for the debt. There is plenty of opportunity to do that, and both sides are guilty of that result.

841,topic-id,1113,"Mr.Speaker, this week we will consider the most important bill that this House will consider in this  Every day we are hearing from more and more Republican Members of this House and of the Senate who oppose--who oppose--who oppose--the dangerous healthcare bill on the floor this week.  Just yesterday, conservative Republican Representative Justin Amash tweeted the following--a very conservative Republican from the mid-part of our country said this: ``While I've been in Congress, I can't recall a more universally detested piece of legislation than this GOP healthcare bill.'' Or health no care bill.  This is just the most recent in a long list of statements by Republicans on the demerits--demerits--of the bill to repeal the Affordable Care  It is interesting that they have named it the American Health Care The only thing they struck from our title was ``affordable.'' It should tell you something about the bill. They replace it with a system that requires Americans to pay more and get less.  This bill has been rushed through the committees without a single public hearing--not one, no testimony or expert view. And when the committees marked it up, it did not have what we call a CBO score.  That is simply Washington-speak for the agency that is nonpartisan, bipartisan, with the Director appointed by the Republicans to give us the advice of the consequences of the enactment of such legislation.  They came back and told us that there would be 24 million less Americans insured by 2026. That would total 58 million uninsured Americans as a result of this bill just 9 years from now.  Republicans are rushing it to the floor for two reasons. First, they know that if the American people see what this bill would do and what it would cost, it wouldn't pass.  As a matter of fact, we have some information on that already because, at town meeting after town meeting after town meeting that Republicans have held and Democrats have held on this bill, the overwhelming number of people that came to those town meetings said: This is a bad bill. It will hurt us. It will hurt our health care. It will hurt our families. It will hurt our children.  We are rushing this bill that was introduced just some 2\1/2\ weeks ago. It was introduced on a Monday night, late at night. It was marked up less than 36 hours later in both committees. And they were so intent on getting it marked up and speeding it along that they held a hearing for 26 hours straight. Excuse me. It was not a hearing. No witnesses. They just held a markup for 26 hours straight.  Now, I am sure, Mr.Speaker, that millions of Americans were awake at 4 a.m. in the morning to see what the committee was doing. Obviously, I am not sure of that at all. Perhaps that was the strategy.  Now that the CBO score which I just related to you has been released, we know the harm that this bill will bring. As I said, 24 million Americans kicked off their insurance, including 7 million Americans who are currently covered under plans provided by their employers, premiums for individual policyholders rising 24 to 29 percent.  This is not my view. This is the Congressional Budget Office, whose Director was appointed by this Republican His predecessor, Elmendorf, testified in a hearing that we held, because Republicans refused to hold a hearing on this bill, and he agreed with the Republican-appointed Director and Congressional Budget  So you have a bipartisan agreement that this bill will harm Americans--and not just those 24 million It will harm all Americans because their premiums and copays and deductibles will go up. States will be forced to drop 14 million Americans from Medicaid--and I understand there is a manager's amendment that is going to make it worse--while cutting benefits and provider payments.  A less fiscally sustainable future for Medicare, they shorten the life of Medicare's fiscal sustainability by 3 years, from 2028 down to 2025.  The list goes on, Mr.Speaker, of the reasons why this bill would be a disaster for families in our country.  The second reason they pushed the bill through so quickly is because they wanted to bring it to the floor this week--not next week, not the week after, not after thorough consideration, not after hearings, not after listening to the American people, but this week.  Why this week? Because this week marks the seventh anniversary of the enactment of the law they are seeking to repeal, in other words, optics, spin, propaganda, message. That is what their timeline and their bill are all about: messaging--not results, not reform, political messaging.  This is the fulfillment of a campaign pledge based on a premise that is no longer sustainable. Seven years after the law's enactment the facts are clear. It has expanded coverage, improved benefits, banned discrimination against women and people with preexisting conditions and disabilities, and prohibited annual and lifetime limits on coverage.  Now, they keep some of those things in their bill because they were so popular they thought they couldn't get rid of them. But they have voted 65 times to repeal all those benefits.  Is the Affordable Care Act perfect? Of course not. In the areas where it has fallen short, let's fix it--together.  But this bill--this bill repealing the law and making Americans pay more for less--will throw our healthcare system into turmoil and put millions of families and small businesses at risk. That is why doctors oppose it. That is why hospitals oppose it. That is why senior organizations like AARP oppose it. There are literally 1,000 organizations, plus, that have opposed this legislation.  We are now hearing reports, Mr.Speaker, that Republican leaders are making secret backroom deals with individual Members in order to win their support, the kind of desperate maneuvering that shows how unpopular this bill is.  Republicans, Mr.Speaker, must remember that, as the governing majority, they will be responsible for what happens to our healthcare system under their watch. And I do not just mean this bill. I mean the lack of certainty and the turmoil that they have been creating for the Affordable Care Act market since not only Trump was elected, but since they started attacking this bill some years ago.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, for the sake of their constituents, for the sake of the children of this country, for the sake of those who are at risk because of health challenges that confront them, I urge my Republican friends to abandon this dangerous bill and instead work with us to strengthen our healthcare system for all of our citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2244.txt,566,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1101, SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH",2017.0,21.0,March

462,topic-id,1873,"Mr.Speaker, this evening I rise to speak on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and I believe some of my colleagues will be joining me, to talk about the budget that has just been released by this  I would like to say, Mr.Speaker, that while it is being called a skinny budget, we call it the billionaire's budget. It is the same misguided, rambling, unfocused, bloated giveaway to rich and corporate interests that has been offered for years.  My belief is that a budget is a statement of our values. This budget ensures that the rich get richer at the cost of working people, the environment, and the future of our country.  Funding has been axed for nearly 20 agencies, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the In addition to elimination of these important agencies, the billionaire's budget guts funding for several other important agencies.  You can see here by this chart from The Washington Post exactly what is happening: the Environmental Protection Agency chopped by 31 percent; the State Department cut by 29 percent; Agriculture cut by 21 percent, the Labor Department by 21 percent.[[Page H2140]]  And the cuts go on through every single agency of critical importance to the American people: Department of Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development at a time when we have a tremendous housing crisis in this country.  Transportation, from a President who said that he was going to invest in our infrastructure, yet here you see that the Transportation budget has a 13 percent cut.  Mr.Speaker, the reality is that the cost of security for the Trump Tower is $183 million a year. The budget for the National Endowment for the Arts is $148 million a year.  There are some other cuts that we could do if we were that concerned, but let's talk about housing. Housing access and affordability is squarely on the chopping block in this billionaire's budget.  With a $4.3 billion cut, HUD will lose its Community Development Block Grant program. Now, some people don't know exactly what the Community Development Block Grant program does; and, in fact, it sounded like Director Mulvaney didn't know that either when he was asked about a critical program that is funded through this Community Development Block Grant program, and that is funding for Meals on  There are communities across this country that fund their Meals on Wheels program, which is funding for meals for the elderly who cannot get to somewhere where they can get a meal, and so we take them a meal. That is Meals on Wheels, an incredibly bipartisan, beloved program. Unfortunately, that would go away because the CDBG program would be cut; and, therefore, the Meals on Wheels program would be cut.  These programs are an integral part of building up our communities, both through affordable housing as well as through some of these critical programs that go as wraparound services to affordable housing.  The city of Seattle, which I represent, is currently in a state of emergency due to its housing crisis. Right now, there are around 3,000 people experiencing homelessness in the city and nearly 10,000 in the surrounding areas--veterans, families, LGBTQ youth.  This is unacceptable. Access to stable housing is absolutely critical to making sure that members of our community are safe and able to access the services they need to get back on track and live full lives.  Let's talk about Health and Human The Department of Health and Human Services is facing an 18 percent cut to its funding, which could have devastating--and I am talking about life and death--consequences here, absolutely devastating impacts.  It would decrease the funding for the National Institutes of Health, for cancer and medical research, critical programs that help us to figure out how we save lives in this country and actually are part of the innovation that the United States offers. Gutting this funding would put us at a grave disadvantage, and it would put people's lives at risk.  Transportation, another critical area that this President promised that he was going to invest in. He was going to make sure we were bringing forward jobs, that we were investing in our infrastructure, our crumbling roads and bridges, making sure that we are investing in critical transit and transportation projects. But in this budget, the Transportation budget is facing a 13 percent cut. That is nearly half a billion dollars from the TIGER grant program, which has allowed our country to carry out critical infrastructure improvement projects not just in one kind of a city, not just in urban areas, but urban and rural areas alike.  The billionaire's budget would also cut funding to all new fully funded grant agreements, including some really important projects in cities across the country.  In Seattle, our critical streetcar project would be cut; and light rail expansion, which we have been working on for years, the State has invested in a bipartisan way--when I was in the State senate, we actually passed a $15 billion transportation infrastructure package because we knew that we had to deal with the transportation infrastructure needs of business, of our communities across the State and the influx of people into our                              {time}  1845  We agreed in a bipartisan way that this was something we needed to do. Part of that agreement included being able to fund the next phase of light-rail across our region.  Our Sound Transit CEO, Peter Rogoff, calls this budget a ``body blow.'' I couldn't agree with him more. We are looking at potentially a $7.7 billion cut to Sound  These are major transportation projects for our cities. They would create jobs, which is what this President said that he wanted to do, is create jobs. But by gutting these funds and gutting investment in transportation infrastructure, we will be stopping the very projects that are going to create those jobs and help our cities and rural areas make the necessary upgrades that they need to thrive.  Mr.Speaker, one of the worst areas that is hit in this budget is the environment. This billionaire's budget is an all-out assault on our environment and efforts to fund research and curb climate change.  President Trump has found ways to wreak havoc on our efforts to protect our planet by, in this budget, cutting climate research and protection funds to multiple departments. This isn't just the Environmental Protection Agency, but we are talking also about NASA space exploration and many other areas that ensure that we preserve this planet for the next generation.  I have got a 20-year-old, Mr.Speaker, and when I was running for Congress, he said to me: Mom, you have got to work on climate change. It is one of the most important issues facing my generation. You are the stewards of our lands. If you don't take care of this planet, then we won't have anything left and my children won't have anything left.  This is my 20-year-old son telling me this. Mr.Speaker, I promised him I would do everything I can for his generation and future generations to protect our planet.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest cuts in this budget is to the Environmental Protection This is a 32 percent cut to the Environmental Protection This decimates all of our work on climate change, all of the research that we need to do so we know how to protect our climate, all of the work on environmental justice programs, which is really essential when you think about who is taking the burden of climate change. It is our low-income communities, communities of color, and other vulnerable and marginalized communities.  I have always believed that we should rename the Environmental Protection Agency makes it sound like it is something off in the distance, like it is about something out there. But, in fact, what the Environmental Protection Agency does is monitor our water so that we have clean water to drink and use. It monitors our air so that we have clean air to breathe and we don't have asthma and other respiratory diseases that come with air that is so polluted that we can't even survive in it. It ensures that we are protecting human health.  We could rename the EPA the Agency for Clean Water, Clean Air, and Human Health, and I think that that would cover a lot of what the EPA does.  The EPA's cut is going to result in 3,200 lost jobs. That is 20 percent of the department. Research programs would be discontinued both domestically and around the world, and programs like the Clean Power Plan and numerous restoration projects, including a critical restoration project in the Puget Sound, the Puget Sound Restoration, would lose 93 percent of its funding. This is true of the Great Lakes region. There are places in Republican and Democratic districts across this country that are going to suffer and see environmental protection being rapidly undone.  President Trump has made it painfully clear that he and his administration are enemies not only of the environment, but of the science that tells us that yes, we must address climate change because it is real and it is manmade. Yet, we are fighting efforts to consistently undermine the research and the science that shows us exactly[[Page H2141]]where we are as a country and what we must do in order to protect our environment.  Let me talk about education for a second. With the appointment of Betsy DeVos to the Department of Education, President Trump has signaled that his administration has every intention of doing whatever they can to privatize our education system. The billionaire's budget takes the first steps in that process.  It increases charter school funding by $168 million and it adds $250 million to create a new, private school choice program. It cuts $3.7 billion in grants that go toward after-school programs, aid programs, and important teacher training.  This budget would decimate Head Head Start is a program that has been shown to be successful. When you invest early in kids' education and you make sure that you give them that early support, it definitely has an impact in diminishing and breaking that school-to-prison pipeline.  These are investments that save us money in the long run. Not only are they the most humane thing to do and the right thing to do, but they are actually cost-effective programs that stop us from having to spend millions of dollars down the line when people can't get a great public education.  We should be investing in our public education program and making sure that we are helping kids to go all the way from early learning to higher education. That is the foundation of a great country, when we are educating and investing in our students to have that kind of a great education.  Mr.Speaker, I see that my colleague from the Progressive Caucus is here. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.Raskin), the wonderful Representative from that State, because I know he has got somewhere to go right after this. I invite him to come up here, and I thank him for his leadership on all issues constitutional and otherwise.

464,topic-id,875,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his consistent brilliance and leadership. I so appreciate it. It has been a tremendous honor to serve with him here.  I want to talk about another area that we haven't covered yet, which is the State and development programs budget. This is essentially our efforts around diplomacy and development around the world. This would be incredibly hard hit. The prime target is the United Climate change initiatives at the United Nations would lose all of their funding. The government would cut back its regular contribution to the U.and pay no more than 25 percent of the cost of U.peacekeeping operations. The budget would hit all of the multilateral development banks, like the World Bank, which would be trimmed by $650 million over 3 years, and cultural programs like the East-West Center in  Today a number of Republican colleagues talked about how misguided this cut was, and it made me very hopeful, to be honest. Representatives Hal Rogers and Ted Yoho both agree that this cut is absolutely misguided.  Several retired three- and four-star generals wrote a letter to Congress expressing their deep concern over these serious budget cuts that are being made to the State Department because they know that diplomacy goes hand in hand with any kind of defense that has to be put out there. You have got to have the two together. Here is what they said: ``The State Department, USAID, Millennium Challenge Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way.''  In 2013, General Mattis himself said that if more funding for development wasn't provided, he would have to buy more bullets. Development programs are inextricably linked with our national security, and this President should not be cutting these funds if he wants to bolster national security. If he wants to bolster national security, then we should be investing more of our dollars into diplomacy and development as two of the other legs of a three-legged stool. Unfortunately, he is going in the opposite direction.  Our aid and development efforts have to be well-rounded and holistic. I know this because I have worked in international development before all over the world. I have worked along the borders of Laos and Cambodia, in I have worked across south I have worked in Latin I know and I understand that our relationships and our ability to build[[Page H2143]]strong multilateral coalitions and to invest in the stability of countries as war is happening there is absolutely essential to preserving peace.  The generals wrote: ``We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle East and north Africa to preventing pandemics like . . .''  This 29 percent cut is absolutely unacceptable and will not keep us safe.  The billionaire's budget doesn't just cut funding for these programs, though. It also increases spending, and not for the benefit of our communities. This administration is calling for $3 billion to detain more immigrants, deport more people, and build a bigger border wall. The staggering increase to detain an unprecedented 45,700 men and women is unacceptable.  Mr.Speaker, 167 men and women have died in detention since October 2003. The organization that I used to work at put out a human rights abuses report about the detention center controlled by the GEO corporation, private detention center way back in 2005 or 2006. We looked at all of the human rights abuses that were happening not only in that detention center, but we did research on what was happening around the country.  Among the 35 death reviews in this recent report that came out that have been released through Freedom of Information Act requests, substandard medical care contributed to at least 15 deaths. And even when government investigations concluded that a facility violated government detention standards, the government fails to hold these private facilities accountable and make sure that changes are made to address deficiencies that lead to the loss of human life.  Instead of spending $3 billion on immigration enforcement and detention, here is what we could do with that money: We could create 45,000 new middle class jobs. We could build 184 new elementary schools. We could hire about 55,000 new kindergarten and elementary schoolteachers. We could provide close to 337,000 Head Start slots for young kids. We could pay for nearly 311,000 people to attend a 4-year college per year. We could help States protect and save up to 12,000 at-risk wildlife and plant species in the United States every year for the next 2.3 years. By the way, we could also provide nearly 2.1 million households with solar energy. We could weatherize over 460,000 homes nationwide, saving the average household about $283 a year. And we could provide 10 million lifesaving HIV/AIDS treatments.  Mr.Speaker, this budget is about profit over safety, privatization over public good. It is about war over peace and diplomacy. And it is about incarceration over rehabilitation. It is fundamentally about billionaires and lobbyists over the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2139-3.txt,2354,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF,2017.0,16.0,March

1337,topic-id,882,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my good colleague from Connecticut so much for that incredibly compelling testimony of why we cannot let this bill pass.  Let me summarize what you heard in this last hour from Members across our country who are terrified. Frankly, this plan--TrumpCare, the pay more get less plan, the broken promises plan--might actually pass. We have to make sure that it does not pass.  So, in summary, TrumpCare strips healthcare coverage from 24 million It cuts $880 billion--that is almost a trillion dollars--from Medicaid expansion, and it gives $600 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans and corporations while cutting benefits for seniors, working families, and the most vulnerable among us.  Frankly, we don't know everything it does because there have been amendments after amendments that have been passed today. We still don't know what the full impact of this bill is, yet they are pushing through a vote tomorrow if they can get enough votes to pass it.  TrumpCare is going to raise the cost of health care by about $14,000 for those between the ages of 50 and 64. That is the age tax you have heard about on the floor tonight. And it is going to raise premiums for almost everyone. It puts a 30 percent penalty for getting health care to anyone who suffers any kind of a catastrophic event that throws you off of health care. If you lose your job and somehow you end up without health care for a couple months, you are going to have to pay 30 percent more in order to get your health care back.  You heard from Representative Kennedy about mental health, you heard from Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton about work requirements, and that is just a piece of what this TrumpCare bill does.  Tomorrow I will join my Democratic colleagues and hopefully enough Republican colleagues who know that our job is to make sure we provide health care for everyone across this country. Tomorrow I will vote ``no'' for the 24 million people who will lose their coverage. I will vote ``no'' for the almost 15 million people who will lose their coverage under Medicaid expansion alone. I will vote ``no'' for the millions of low-income women who rely on services from Planned I will vote ``no'' for the tens of thousands of people who will literally die each year if the Republicans succeed in repealing the health care that we have now.  Let's be clear that the Republican majority has been passing legislation and voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act for 7 years, yet they could not come up with a plan that would, in fact, do what they promised, which is to make sure that we are covering more Americans at lower prices. As my friend, Representative Raskin, said, this is not a healthcare plan. A[[Page H2340]]healthcare plan would cover more people. This is a tax plan to take the benefits that working families were receiving on healthcare coverage across the country and convert it into tax benefits for the wealthiest, $600 billion in tax benefits.  People around the country are calling in to say if you care about the American people and if you care about providing health care for all of us, this is a bad plan, you should not vote for it. And Republicans are hopefully listening to constituents across the country, to their Governors in Republican States, Republican Governors who have said how much Medicaid expansion has helped their They have asked and pleaded for people to keep what we have; to make it better, yes, but not to strip $880 billion away.  Just recently, Paul Ryan, the Speaker of our House, was quoted as saying that he has been dreaming about yanking health care away from the people who need it the most since he was ``drinking at a keg.''  This is what he said: ``So Medicaid, sending it back to the states, capping its growth rate, we've been dreaming of this since I have been around--since you and I were drinking at the keg. . . .''  Well, I don't know what he was thinking about when he was drinking at the keg, but I can tell you that what we have been dreaming about as Democrats, as people who care about the health care of people across this country is that we cover people, that we don't put anyone in a position where they are one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy, that we make sure that kids can get asthma inhalers, that we make sure that grandma and grandpa can go into the nursing home and get the care that they need. If we pass this bill tomorrow, those grandparents are not going to have the care that they need. Nursing homes are going to shut down. We are going to take away jobs from rural areas, rural hospitals across this country.  Mr.Speaker, today, as we close this Progressive Caucus Special Order hour, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I believe we all have the interests of the American people at heart, and if we do, then I hope we will stop this TrumpCare bill from moving forward tomorrow.

But the Affordable Care Act has improved the quality of life for tens of millions of people all across this country.  As a result of the Affordable Care Act, people born with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied health insurance.

Nearly half a million Syrians have been killed by this conflict. More than 13 million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes and continue to face starvation and sieges by pro-Assad forces. Assad's barrel bombs and Russian airstrikes still target hospitals and schools. Syria's neighbors have provided refuge to nearly 5 million, mostly women and children. At the same time, many Syrians continue to risk their lives in an attempt to find safety on Europe's shores.

Ankara, Baghdad, Beirut, Brussels, Paris, San Bernadino--these are just a few of the places impacted by As long as the Syrian conflict continues, violence and extremism will continue to spiral out of the region. It is time for the United States and international community to hold the Assad regime and its backers accountable for their actions. The Trump administration should take an active role in resolving this conflict. The Syrian conflict has many dimensions--leaving this to the Russians and hoping that they can end this war is not a strategy. American leadership, along with support from regional actors and the international community, is the only meaningful approach towards bringing peace to Syria and its citizens and justice to the Assad regime for its brutal actions.  I am pleased to introduce this resolution with Senators McCain and Rubio and Murphy that condemns the Assad regime's blatant disregard for international law and human life and asks the Trump administration to pursue a strategy that can help bring the brutal conflict to a peaceful conclusion.

990,topic-id,1368,"I thank the gentleman so very much for taking the time, after formal votes have occurred today, to help us enlighten the American people on what is really at stake here.  I have to say, President Trump carried the State of Ohio by about 450,000 votes out of all the votes that were cast. And there was this slim hope, I think, on behalf of some of the people who voted for him, that though he was a billionaire, that there was perhaps a kind heart that would minister to the people of our country, helping them get more jobs, helping them deal with their everyday challenges, including health care.  Unfortunately, this bill is cruel, and it is dangerous. It helps the billionaire class. Why in heaven's name, of the people that are drafting this bill on the Republican side of the aisle, would they be giving billions and billions and billions of tax giveaways to the wealthiest people in our country; to those that, frankly, if you take away a couple of million, they wouldn't miss it anyway. You know, when you have that much money, normal life is kind of distant from your world.  But what TrumpCare is giving to the rank and file, people are going to have to pay more for less coverage, and millions and millions of people are going to lose their coverage completely.  Now, you know, 75 percent of the people who go bankrupt in this country go bankrupt because of health bills that they can't pay for. And so when you start tinkering around with people's health insurance and their coverage, you are playing with wildfire, and that is what is happening on the Republican side of the aisle.  Now, it used to be that most Americans received their health insurance through employment, just like in We had an employment-based health insurance system. I like that system. I like for workers to share in the profits of the companies that they help make money for.  But what has been happening over the years, with so much outsourcing that Wall Street is more than happy to finance, right, companies are plucked up from Ohio and put in Mexico, put in China, put in all these other places around the world. People lose their health insurance. They lose everything. They are lucky if they can hang on to their houses.  Then what happens? What happens to them? Well, if they are lucky, they might get a job that pays a third of what they earned before in a company that doesn't pay health insurance.  Take Walmart, the biggest employer in the country. Go take a look at their employees and what happens. What is happening is the corporations are throwing on to the back of the public sector, the Federal Government, the responsibility to pay for health insurance. So all the profits that Walmart makes, it doesn't benefit the workers there with any health insurance. The companies have ceded their responsibility to provide health insurance as a condition of employment, and they have transferred that to, guess what, the taxpayer. So what is going on here is a big shift in responsibility.  The Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan, and the head of it is a Republican, I might say, but it is the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that with TrumpCare, next year alone, 14 million fewer Americans will have health insurance.  Some of those currently on the Affordable Care will drop off, and I am very worried about the 900,000 Ohioans who were finally able to get insurance, some of whom work for Walmart, some of whom work for small employers who couldn't afford health insurance, some of them who worked for big corporations that spit them out when they moved and outsourced their jobs, that[[Page H2284]]they are going to be among these numbers.  We are told by 2020, 21 million people will lose their coverage in the country; 24 million by 2026, and perhaps the total number of uninsured Americans rising to reach 52 million. That is going backwards.  In this bill, they expect 70 million people who are currently on Medicaid--all right, guess what? They are in nursing homes.  The Republican Party always says they are the pro-life party. This is an anti-life bill. This is going to cost illness and death across this country.  Here is a story already in my district in A man named Joseph is self-employed, and he used to get his insurance from his wife's employer. Thank God she had employer-provided health insurance. She retired, and now the family faced a choice, forced upon them by the Republican leaders in Congress and President  They faced the threat of no health coverage, so Joseph heard all this debate here. He wasn't sure what was going to happen to him in this fiscal year of 2017, so his choice was to go on the healthcare exchange and risk losing coverage if the Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act and pull the rug out from under him; or he could opt for the guarantee of 18 months of expensive COBRA insurance. So he opted for the expensive choice of COBRA, which cost him and his family hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars in additional costs per month, and he is putting off a knee replacement because of the uncertainty even consideration of this bill is causing.  Don't tell me that this isn't cruel and dangerous. And this family isn't the only one in America that is facing that kind of terrible health choice.  The TrumpCare proposal in States like Ohio, where we have a lot of rural counties, we are going to have hundreds of thousands of people out of work, nurses, long-term care aides.  I just had people from Hospice in my office this afternoon, and we were talking about home-health care for Hospice patients versus institutional care, the rising numbers of Vietnam veterans coming into Hospice facilities.  Well, guess what? Who is going to pay for all of that in the TrumpCare? These people will be dropped. They will say to the States: well, we will give you a little bit of money, but we will cap the money, you know.  And then what happens after 2020? Hey, it is like dropping you out of an airplane with no parachute. Good luck.  We can't do this. This is a death bill. This is a death knell for the American people. We can't allow the American people to be treated in this manner. So we ought to be repairing and fixing and looking in the windshield, not the rearview mirror of where we need to take health insurance in this country, but not put so many millions, ten and tens of millions of Americans at risk, and doling out--Congressman Garamendi, maybe you could repeat those numbers--over $600 billion in tax giveaways to the richest people in this country, many of whom caused the financial crash of 2008. They owe the They owe the people of this Republic for what they did.  I have families in my district still underwater on their mortgages, if they were able to hang on to their homes at all.  The wealthy of this country, starting with Wall Street, owe the American people a lot. And all those employers who abandoned their responsibilities and pushed the cost of health insurance on the public sector because they didn't have the decency to help ensure their own workers, well, shame on you. Shame on you.  For all the small businesses that finally got health insurance through this program, thank you for respecting your workers. Thank you for respecting the Affordable Care  We can do a whole lot better than And I really feel sorry that this new President, for whom many of the people in Ohio voted, doled up this kind of a flawed piece of legislation that is cruel and, honestly, will result in so many more illnesses across this country, because people worry about health insurance.

TSA was created within the Department of Transportation in 2001 to address the security vulnerabilities that were exposed in the attacks of 9/11. At that time, the administrator was given a 5-year term. However, when TSA and its functions transferred to the Department of Homeland Security a year later, the 5-year term officially terminated by statute.  Many of the issues and bureaucratic challenges that TSA faces today stem from a lack of consistent leadership at the top. Since I came to Congress in January 2015, TSA has had no less than five different individual administrators, both as appointees and as acting administrators. This is a staggering number in such a brief period of time.  A revolving door of leadership has further exacerbated the numerous problems that plague this young agency. It is unacceptable that this has gone on for more than a decade. The American people deserve better, and that is why we are here today with this bill.  This bill addresses these issues by reestablishing the administrator's position, level, and 5-year term, just as Congress originally intended when it created TSA in the wake of 9/11. Additionally, this bill updates Federal statute to reflect current policy by clarifying TSA's proper role within the Department of Homeland  While this is only one step in addressing the many challenges at TSA, this legislation will provide for more consistent leadership at such a critical security agency.

I rise in support of H.1309, the TSA Administrator Modernization Act of 2017.  When the Transportation Security Administration was created after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress intended for the administrator to serve a 5-year term, like the administrator of the Federal Aviation  However, since TSA moved from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, there has been a lack of clarity about the length of the administrator's term. The measure before us today clarifies Congress' expectation that TSA administrators serve for 5 years.  In TSA's short history, it has had six Senate-confirmed administrators. None has served more than 4 years. The last TSA administrator, Peter Neffenger, served just 2 years.  Stability at the top is critically important as we push TSA to improve its performance and address ongoing challenges.  For example, after recent covert testing carried out by the Department's inspector general revealed alarming weaknesses in checkpoint screening operations, Administrator Neffenger focused TSA's attention on addressing its detection rate failures, improving training, and reducing vulnerabilities associated with commercial aviation screening. At the same time, Administrator Neffenger worked with Congress to increase TSA staffing levels in response to long wait times at security checkpoints during the peak travel season last summer. Under his leadership, TSA successfully reduced wait times that had reached as long as 3 hours at some airplanes, without compromising the effectiveness of security measures. And while confronting those urgent short-term challenges, Administrator Neffenger was also focused on addressing TSA's longer-term challenges related to employee recruitment, retention, and morale.  I regret, as I know my colleague, Mr.Katko, does, that Administrator Neffenger did not have the opportunity to stay on and continue making progress within the administration. But I think we can all agree that TSA needs steady leadership in order to continue to evolve and fulfill its mission to protect the traveling public.  We can help ensure that TSA will have that stability and sustained focus at the top by passing this bill today.  I thank my colleague from New York, Representative Katko, for introducing this bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of our colleagues to give it their full support.  Madam Speaker, I urge support for H.1309. This bill was unanimously approved by the Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month.  Enacting H.1309 will provide TSA with stable, sustained leadership the administration needs to chart a more consistent course and overcome its longstanding challenges.  I would also like to commend my colleague, Mr.Katko, who has been absolutely dogged in his support of TSA and ensuring that it has the support and the resources that it needs. I thank him for his work on this bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Her comments about Admiral Neffenger, in particular, were very poignant because he was doing a great job at TSA and he was only there 2[[Page H2212]]years. What he did in 2 years really made a big difference in the trajectory of that agency. Much like other Federal agencies that are empowered to do very important things, like the FBI who has a long-term tenure, I think the same thing needs to be done here.  Admiral Neffenger and people like him should be in control of the agency for extended periods of time because then, and only then, can we make the true changes that we are going to need.

287,topic-id,806,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to share the story of a family that I have come to know. They came from a humble place, scraping by. Amidst instability in their native land, they could barely keep food on their table. For years, their government ignored their struggle and suffering. Like so many others, they dreamed of a better life in  Finally, they managed to cobble together enough money to make the dangerous journey to our shores. Yet, once here, they discovered that life wasn't so easy. They were resented for their accents, their faith, and their foreign ways. Doors were slammed in their faces when they sought work.  So they worked harder. They leaned on each other and those who came before. They forged a community and they organized. They built churches, businesses, and schools. Slowly but surely, they began to enjoy some measure of success and stability.  Mr.Speaker, I am sure that there are Garcias or Asgaris or Rodriguezes that share that same story, but the one I tell is not theirs.  This family's name is Struggling immigrants whose quest for a better life took them from Ireland's potato famine to Boston's immigrant barrios. It is the ageless story of a young man looking for a better future, of a family in search of a safe place to settle down, of the sacrifice that any parent would make for the benefit of their children. And it has been repeated millions of times in every corner of our world in the over 150 years since my ancestors fled their home to find a new one.  My father has a memory of my great-grandmother, Rose, that he shared with me once. He was playing outside with friends one day when she called him in. As he fidgeted around and impatiently tried to sit still, she pulled out a big scrapbook and flipped to a stack of carefully folded newspapers in the back. One after another, she opened them up to the help wanted section. There, she pointed to ad after ad marked in big block letters: No Irish need apply.  My great-grandmother's message was clear: Don't forget where you came from, don't forget the blood and the sweat and the tears that generations before you have shed so that you would never feel the sting of prejudice.  For my family and so many others, this became a deeply personal fight. In July of 1964, a young Attorney General named Robert Kennedy sat in front of the House Judiciary There, my grandfather urged Congress to act on immigration reform. Our system, he said, ``is a source of embarrassment to us around the world, it is a source of anguish to many of our own citizens, it is a source of loss to the economic and creative strength of our nation as a whole, it is inconsistent with our principles and out of step with our history.''  The opposition that he and other advocates have faced half a century ago sounds eerily familiar to so many of us today: Immigrants will flood our cities and towns. They will take American jobs. They will poison American culture. They aren't from here. They aren't like us. They are somebody else's babies.  Fifty years later, the opposition still hasn't updated their talking points. Fifty years later, our broken immigration system is still a source of embarrassment, but worse, of anguish and of loss. Fifty years later, we face a threat unlike almost any we have seen in recent history: a President who has built an entire campaign--and now an administration--on the scapegoating of immigrant families.  We have watched President Trump threaten our most fundamental American values with border walls and bad[[Page H2088]]hombres. We have heard his racial epithets. We have seen cold-hearted executive orders. We have stood in horror as his administration sweeps the country with raids that appear unprecedented in their utter disregard for family, community, and common decency.  That is why I stand here today, on the eve of Patrick's Day, the proud son of Irish immigrants and the humble beneficiary of our country's golden doors, to deliver a message to immigrant families: President Trump does not speak for all of us, and his immigration policies are opposed by leaders in Washington who do not take your patriotism for granted. We are grateful for your contribution to our communities, our culture, and our economy. We understand your willingness to walk to the ends of the Earth, to navigate oceans and mountains and deserts and war zones because every parent would do the same. We know what you have risked to give them a better future and what you have sacrificed to be a part of our United We stand by your side in the fight ahead.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

1087,topic-id,478,"Mr.President, if I make it to Heaven--and I hope I do--the first question I am going to ask God is why bad things happen to good people. We have had some bad things happen in Louisiana to some really good people, as my colleague from Louisiana just referred to.  This past weekend, while most of us slept, Louisiana lost yet another officer in the line of duty. East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office Sergeant Shawn Anderson--as shown in this photograph here--was a law enforcement veteran. He was a military veteran, and he was a father. He served high-risk warrants. He had been recognized for doing his job without having resorted to firing his weapon. In short, he was an American hero, and he was a Louisiana hero.  On Saturday night, Sergeant Anderson was just doing his job. He went into a barbershop in search of a suspected rapist. Sergeant Anderson lost his life. A line of law enforcement vehicles escorted his body from the scene, and their flashing blue lights lit up the dark night.  It has been a tough few months for our law enforcement families in We have buried six officers who were shot and killed simply because they were wearing a badge.  In January, Westwego Police Officer Michael Louviere stopped to help at a traffic accident, and he was shot in the back of the head. Michael was not even on duty. He was driving home and saw an accident and immediately stopped his car to help. That is the kind of person he was.  The Presiding Officer and all of those listening to me today, no doubt, saw the news footage as to what unfolded along a busy Baton Rouge highway last summer. July will no longer be just about hot dogs and fireworks for us in The shootings that took the lives of three law enforcement officers shattered our summer and broke our hearts.  Just a month earlier, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Deputy David Michel was shot three times in the back--not once, not twice, but three times--and he died in His killer, apparently, shot him because the killer did not want to return to jail.  I would ask all of those who wish to, to join me in saying a prayer for these law enforcement officers and their families. They were sons and they were fathers and they are going to miss out on holidays and birthdays and graduations. They were men who sacrificed their lives so we could sleep a little bit better at night.  Let us also, while we are praying for these brave men--and, yes, women too--pray for an end to the violence.

1181,topic-id,346,"Mr.Speaker, a few months ago, a woman from my district walked into my office and told me about her daughter, a young lady diagnosed with acute mental illness at just 4 years of age.  A decade later, the stories that that young mom shared would split your heart: stories of countless ER visits, endless fights with insurers and courts,[[Page H2296]]a little girl being boarded at a hospital for 21 days while they searched up and down the East Coast to find a bed where she could stay.  At 14 years old, she has now spent half of her life in residential care. But it was how her mother ended that story that has stuck with me. She looked me in the eyes and told me that: ``Compared to other people I know, we have been lucky.''  Mr.Speaker, that is not luck. This is a mental health system so broken that it is hard to recognize.  And how have our Republican colleagues followed up in response? They have offered a piece of legislation that is one of the largest assaults on our mental health system in recent history.  The GOP repeal bill will remove guaranteed behavioral health coverage for everyone covered under the Medicaid expansion. It will abandon those suffering from substance abuse disorder to fend for themselves in a country ravaged by opioid abuse. It will allow work requirements for care, forcing countless people to somehow choose between getting treatment and keeping their job. It will help insurers further skirt parity laws that require them to treat the mentally ill fairly. It will send out-of-pocket costs soaring for the most vulnerable among us.  Mr.Speaker, one in five Americans today suffer from mental illness. These brave men and women and their families that love them deserve more than the cheap luck of a broken system. They deserve more than the empty rhetoric of a bill that ``might'' cover or ``could'' cover the care that they need. They deserve an ironclad commitment from their government that we will have their back. This bill does not do that.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2295-2.txt,2172,ADVOCATING FOR PATIENT-CENTERED HEALTH CARE,2017.0,22.0,March
1328,topic-id,835,"Mr.Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for adding her voice on such an important issue before our country today and for leading our efforts here this afternoon on the House floor.  There are an awful lot of important components to this bill that we are debating now and that will supposedly come before us tomorrow afternoon. One of the critical pieces of it is how we are going to treat people suffering from mental illness.  Now, the bill itself does a number of things across insurance marketplaces and across Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, but I think it is critically important that we look at this through the framework of what health care is supposed to be all about. Health care, at least from my understanding, boils down to one simple principle. It is how we treat each other in our time of need and this commitment that we make as a country to each other, that, yes, I care about you and your family and want to make sure that you get the care that you need when you need it. Because with health care, at some point, I am going to need that same care as well: a loved one of mine, my children, my family members, and I hope that you would be there for me the same way that I would be there for you.  So if you look at this bill through that prism, one of the pieces that stands out is the fact that, for the Medicaid expansion population, about 11 million people across our country, this bill strips what is called the essential healthcare benefits from those 11 million people. Now, that is a bureaucratic term, but it means some of the most basic aspects of health care: maternal care and newborn care, preventive services, wellness, ambulatory care, and, yes, mental health services and addiction, behavioral health.  So what does that actually mean? It means that because of existing legislation, the Federal law, mental health parity, which says that if mental health benefits are, in fact, offered as part of a healthcare package, insurance package, that it has to be offered in the same way that physical health care is. You should treat your access to behavioral health care the same way we would treat access to health care if you needed cancer treatment or a broken leg. But the mental health parity law does not require mental health benefits to be offered at all. The Affordable Care Act, however, says that in order for a plan to be qualified, it does have to offer an essential health benefits package, included in that being access to mental health care.  So those two laws together work in tandem to have created a massive increase in access to behavioral health and mental health services, including, critically for the moment that we are in our country, access to opioid treatment.  What this bill does is strip those essential benefits, including access to addiction services and mental health care, from that essential benefits package and says to the States: Good luck, you can pay for them if you want to, providing nowhere near the sufficient funding to cover all of the demands that our Republican colleague says the funding will be there for.  Now, to make matters even more convoluted in this, it was clear, during the debate in our committee 2 weeks ago for 28 straight hours, that some of our colleagues actually thought these protections were maintained when we pointed out that, in fact, they were stripped. There was then a different version of this bill that was brought forth for consideration called the manager's amendment. That manager's amendment happened to reinstate those benefits, which was great, and I applaud my Republican colleagues for doing so, aside from the fact that they then realized that they included those benefits and they offered an amendment to strip them back out, just in the past 36 hours, recognizing that there was a bill that they thought offered these benefits--the package of essential health benefits--for 11 million people to begin with, they found out that it didn't, in fact, offer it; they fixed it and put them back in a bill, realized they did it inadvertently and took it out again and are now laying that bill supposedly before our consideration tomorrow.  If health care is, in fact, that commitment we make to each other in our time of need, how does this bill answer that question? The average cost of a birth in this country is roughly $10,000. Medicaid itself pays for half of the births in our Maternal care and newborn care are covered under the essential health benefits, but not anymore for the Medicaid expansion population. For that population, having a child could very literally bring you to bankruptcy. That is the bill that this Republican Congress is putting forward for your consideration tomorrow.[[Page H2337]]  That is one of the many reasons why I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

1347,topic-id,342,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congressman Gallagher for his bipartisan leadership on the term limits initiative, and my friend General Bergman for his leadership on this issue.  I don't think term limits are a partisan issue. The Economist had an article that the turnover rate in the people's House is less than European monarchies. European nobility turnover is at a faster rate. Incumbency reelection is 96 percent. When folks say, ``Why can't you just vote people out of office,'' it is not looking at the actual statistics. Ninety-six percent of folks here are reelected, and that is not what our Founders intended.  James Madison and Alexander Hamilton agreed: ``The security intended to the general liberty consists in the frequent election and in the rotation of the Members of Congress.''  They envisioned a place where people would come, serve, and go back home to their communities.  Thomas Jefferson said that people ought to live, lawmakers ought to live under the laws that they pass. The only way we get back to our founding ideals is if we pass some version of term limits so that people do their public service, and then return to the communities where they reside.  This bill on term limits is really a move against political dynasty, and that is one thing that this election showed us people really were not for. They don't like the idea of a few families, or people connected, holding the reins of power.  Let me end with someone who I think summed this up so eloquently, which is Barbara Bush, our former First She said: ``If we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great eligible people to run. And I think that the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes, there are just more families than that.''  This is from Barbara Bush, who understood the essence of democracy is to have new voices, new families, new ideas. That is why I hope that people across the aisle will support the initiative for term limits.  ",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2340.txt,1525,HEALTHCARE PLAN BAD FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS,2017.0,22.0,March

It has been almost 3 years since a whistleblower shocked the Nation by disclosing 1,400 veterans languish without care at the Phoenix Since then, many others have come forward to report excessive wait times, substandard care, and dirty facilities in VA hospitals all across the country.[[Page H2134]]  The issues we have seen at different VA hospitals have been completely disgraceful. However, what is even more shocking is that many of these whistleblowers have reported some sort of retaliation from hospital directors or the VA's Office of Inspector General, even though Federal law specifically prohibits harassment or retaliation of Federal employees who bring wrongdoing to light.  The recent reports about VA employees facing retaliation is disheartening and it is unacceptable. We need to protect these employees who are trying to ensure that the VA is transparent and accountable to all of our veterans.  Mr.Speaker, my amendment is very simple and commonsense. It merely builds upon existing language in the bill seeking to protect whistleblowers.  Under the bill, a whistleblower can still be fired during the expedited procedure with limited recourse. This amendment would close that loophole.  This amendment would also cover those who come forward to a central whistleblower office instead of just a special counsel.  And, as my colleagues have noted numerous times on the floor today, one-third of our VA employees are veterans. This amendment also works to protect them from unjust firings without due process.  We should never tolerate fraud, waste, or abuse on our Federal agencies. This is especially true when it comes to caring for our Nation's veterans. The brave men and women who have put their lives on the line should be provided with the best quality of care, and it is imperative that the whistleblowers who have stood up to protect our veterans should be fully protected from retaliation.  We should provide whistleblowers with the confidence to step up and help make a change. Helping improve our veterans' health care is dependent in part on the encouragement and protection of whistleblowers within the  Mr.Speaker, in closing, I say this. No one in this body wants to vote on a bill that may give potential whistleblowers doubt about coming forward. Let's give them the assurance they deserve by voting for this motion to recommit, which will strengthen the whistleblower protection language in the underlying bill.  Mr.Speaker, I urge support for my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2114.txt,99999999999999,SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH FAIRNESS ACT OF 2017,2017.0,16.0,March

Currently, when a veteran appoints a fiduciary to help them manage their VA benefits, the VA automatically adds the veteran's name to a list that prevents them from purchasing a firearm. It makes no sense to take away a veteran's constitutionally protected rights simply because someone else is managing their finances.  Opponents of this bill argue that dangerous or suicidal veterans could have easy access to guns if this VA process is stopped. However, the program does not make any determination on veterans' mental health or the dangers they pose to others. The VA system focuses only on whether veterans receive assistance with their finances.  The right to bear arms is too important to deprive veterans of due process without a judicial determination of whether the veteran poses a threat to themselves or others.

Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to improve the law, this bill will eliminate coverage for 24 million people, while drastically increasing healthcare costs on hardworking middle class  Over the next 5 years, Rhode Island officials estimate Medicaid cuts would cost the State $595 million to make sure that 75,000 low-income adults don't lose coverage.  Now, this is a burden that my State or others cannot afford to bear, and it will decimate services and supports for low- and middle-income adults, children, seniors, and especially people with disabilities.  Mr.Speaker, we are better than this as a country. Americans' health will be jeopardized if consumer protections and comprehensive coverage developed under the ACA are cast aside in a partisan push to repeal.  Let's not do this. Let's join together instead and make improvements to the ACA to make it better. Let's not work against us to repeal it.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this unconscionable bill.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-23-pt1-PgH2363-2.txt,1668,SPEAKING AGAINST THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT,2017.0,23.0,March
218,topic-id,1041,"Mr.President, I want to take the chance to have just a moment to be able to reflect on what the Senate has just completed. We have worked through a process of identifying what is called the Congressional Review Most Americans are not[[Page S1835]]familiar with this because it is so seldom used. In fact, it has only been used one time before this Congress successfully.  It is a moment for the Congress to be able to look back at regulations that have been promulgated by the administration and say: Was that the intent of the law?  It is something that we have worked at for a long time to be able to get as a frequent part of this national conversation. We call it the REINS It allows Congress to be able to look at each major regulation when it comes out from the administration and ask the simple question: When the regulations are created, are they consistent with the statute? That is what regulations are. No administration can just invent policy and say: We think this is a good thing to do. That is the task of That is why the Constitution says that all legislative powers shall reside in the Congress, because an administration can't make up the law. It has to come from this body, from the House of Representatives, and then be signed by the After that is done, then regulations are created that have to be consistent with the law.  The Congressional Review Act was created years ago to allow Congress to have a second glance at regulations as they are put out and say: Is that consistent with the statute we passed? This Congress has already gone through multiples of those.  In the last 6 months of the Obama administration, many regulations were created. When they were created, they were not consistent with the statute. This Congress has already turned back billions of dollars of regulations from the American people. One of those was done this week. Ironically, it is an issue that deals with unemployment benefits and drug testing.  Many States have requested the ability to be able to do drug testing for unemployment benefits. And this is not a situation where this Congress believes that all people on unemployment benefits need to be drug tested or are unemployed because of drug use--far from it.  In 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation In that, it allowed States, if they chose to--they don't have to but if they chose to--to do drug testing for benefits eligibility, for unemployment benefits under two circumstances. One of them is if the applicant was terminated from their employment based on the unlawful use of a controlled substance. In other words, if they were just fired from a previous job because they were using drugs, they wouldn't be able to get unemployment benefits because they had already been certified as a drug user. The second one is that if the only available suitable work meant that they had to be drug tested, then they could be drug tested.  What is the design of this? The design of the policy was to encourage people to get back to work. If they were fired from a previous job because they used drugs, it is a natural thing to say: Before you can get unemployment benefits, we want to make sure you have gotten off drugs since that time period you were fired, or if you will be drug tested for the only job that is available to you in your targeted area, you are not available to be able to take that job if you haven't already had some sort of drug testing.  It is a commonsense measure, and it is given to the States to say to the States: You can choose to do this or not to do this, but if you choose to do it, you can, because unemployment benefits are a partnership between the Federal Government and local  We believe this is one tool of many to be able to help people who are trapped in the addiction of drugs to have one more incentive to be able to get off that addiction. Multiple different methods are also used within States to enable them to walk alongside families and individuals and help them get off their substance abuse habits as well.  It is a powerful motivator to say to people: If you want to get some support into your family to help you transition back into a job, the law says that to be on unemployment benefits, you have to be available for work. And if this person is currently addicted to drugs and using drugs, they are not available for work.  This measure was passed in 2012. The Obama administration took 4 years to promulgate the rules off of this commonsense measure, and once they finally promulgated the rules, they created a set of rules so complex, so complicated, with so many exceptions built into it, that the rule meant nothing. It put us in the situation of saying: What Congress passed 4 years ago, we actually wanted that to go into effect to give those States the right to be able to do it.  So this Congress--the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted and this week the Senate also voted to be able to block out that last-minute regulation from the Obama administration, which they took 4 years to promulgate, and to be able to say to the States: If you choose to do drug testing with someone who was fired from a previous job because of drug use or because the only job available to that person will have drug testing, if you want to help families be able to get off substance abuse and to be able to set this standard for them, you can.  We have an epidemic of drug use in our We should do everything we can to not only deal with the interdiction of drugs coming into the country but to also deal with abuse of drugs in our country. This is one of those measures, and I am glad my State and other States will again have that opportunity to be able to use this.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgS1834.txt,2050,ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,15.0,March
220,topic-id,1461,"Mr.President, on January 15, 2017, an incredible ice storm came through my For some States that haven't seen ice storms, they are beautiful, but boy are they destructive. As freezing rain comes down, it lands on power lines, lands on trees, destroys the trees, power lines come down, and it is incredibly difficult for families and for regions when this happens. You can't move. You can't function. You can't travel the streets because they are covered with ice. It is very destructive.  The northwest part of our State experienced an ice storm like that on January 15. That ice storm devastated the Woodward area and all over the northwest--trees, debris, damage, power out for weeks in that area.  Then, in early March, it was starting to warm up. The forecasters from the National Weather Service and the Forest Service saw the forecast coming out of rapidly dropping humidity levels and very high winds, with a lot of debris damage still in the area. It was the perfect storm for wildfires.  They prepositioned assets in that area to be able to respond if they broke out, but on March 6--just a week and a half ago--wildfires broke out all across northwestern Four large fires in particular broke out simultaneously in multiple areas. Some of them were started by some of those same power lines that were weakened by the ice storm. Now the high winds--60 miles an hour--are taking down those weak power lines, and they are striking the ground and starting a fire spontaneously out in a field.  There were four individual fires across this area covering 315,000 acres just in One of those fires spread straight across the Kansas border and burned an additional 472,000 acres. To give you a point of reference of how large these fires were, the total fire damage that was done in acres is greater than the entire State of Rhode Twenty homes were destroyed, 3,000 cattle were killed in the field, 6,500 hogs were killed, and 7 people died in the fire.  Let me give you a picture of what we faced in this area as I went out last Friday with Senator Inhofe to tour the area both from the air and on the ground and to talk to farmers and those individuals who are trying to work through this very difficult process. Those farmers and ranchers are facing something you can't even imagine in their fields. For miles, there is no grass. The cattle that did survive the fire had literally no food on their ranch for miles. Hundreds of miles of fence line were taken down. Each mile of fence in Oklahoma, just a simple barbed wire fence, costs about $10,000, and hundreds of miles of fence line were destroyed.  We have animals that burned alive as they tried to escape the fire. We had deer that, as they were running across the fields, got caught up in the barbed wire fence and 16-mile-per-hour winds, and the 16-mile-an-hour flame caught up with the deer in the fence and burned them alive as they tried to escape.[[Page S1836]]  We have families who have lost absolutely everything.  We have volunteer firefighters across much of this area who would literally be fighting the fire in one county in one area and hear on the radio about how a fire had broken out in another county on a road right near their own home, and literally volunteer firefighters fighting one fire could hear on the radio about the destruction of their home at a different fire.  In different places, the volunteer firefighters and those who were gathered, both career and volunteers, would see a raging fire at the home of their neighbor, of people they knew. In western Oklahoma, you know your neighbors in that area. You know the folks in the county. They would head out to a home as the fire was rushing at them and try to fight it off, try to cut a fire line to be able to stop it. Eventually, the fire would get so close, they would literally take their fire equipment and park the equipment between the fire and the home and spray down their equipment in hopes that the fire would jump over the house as the firefighters just huddled behind their own equipment hoping the fire didn't come to them. They saved several homes by using that extreme method.  Neighbors took their own farm equipment and their own tractors and created fire lines to be able to protect their neighbors' homes.  These small community firefighters fought fires for hours and hours. They saved a lot of lives, and they saved a lot of structures.  I can't even begin to tell you the pain of walking through that area, what has been described by many as walking across a moonscape of destruction where there is literally nothing left.  What have we seen in that? I will state that what we have seen is a tenacious spirit from people who survived an ice storm, were without power for weeks in many areas, and then had a wildfire come right behind it and destroy what was left. Over 20,000 bales of hay have already been donated from farmers all over Oklahoma who are trying to feed the cattle that are still left--20,000 bales. Understand the expense of 20,000 bales of hay being donated but also understand the efforts of all the truckdrivers who loaded up their vehicles and personally paid the gas money and the travel expenses to be able to deliver that hay over hundreds of miles to those folks. Oftentimes, the travel of that truckdriver and the gas required are more expensive than the hay that is in the back of it, and they are delivering as much as they possibly can.  I have to thank the folks from the Farm Bureau; the Oklahoma Cattlemen's Association; Western Equipment; Oklahoma Farm Credit; the Red Cross of Oklahoma; the Salvation Army; the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture; the Oklahoma Forestry Service; Southern Baptist Disaster Relief; Oklahoma emergency management--first responders from all over the State, volunteer and career firefighters who worked very long and difficult hours. USDA and FEMA were also on site. I thank Harper County Extension; all the emergency management folks from Beaver, Harper, and Woodward Counties; all the folks who have donated, places like Love's Travel Stops that have donated so much to be able to move things there; the United Way; Cleanline Energy and their donations; and untold numbers of civic organizations and churches from around that community.  As I looked at many of those folks in the area last week and met with some leaders and pastors in the area, I reminded the folks that the devastation they face is not something that will be recovered from quickly. Springtime will come soon, and the area that is just black earth right now will spring to life with green grass again in the weeks ahead. But the loss of those fence lines, the loss of thousands of animals, the loss of homes, the loss of structures, will take a very long time for the folks--the farmers and ranchers who don't live on a high profit margin.  I have continued to encourage the pastors and churches in that area to walk alongside some families who will have a hard time recovering from this for a long time. I have encouraged our Oklahoma agencies and our Federal agencies to do what we can to be able to step in with repairing fence lines and helping them recover from a very traumatic event.  My wife and I stood with a rancher who talked about going out into the field after the fire. His home was completely destroyed. As he traveled out to the field around him checking on his cattle, he found dead cattle but also found cattle with their faces completely burned, blinded, with coyotes chasing them down. He said all he could do was stand there in the field and cry. These are going to be long days.  I am grateful that there are neighbors taking care of neighbors. I am proud of the people of Oklahoma watching out for each other. As we walk through this, God willing, we will continue to be able to hug and take care of our neighbors in the days ahead.  I want to tell this Senate and the people of the United States that this was a wildfire as big as the State of Rhode Island, and many people haven't even heard of it. But I can assure all of you that the folks in Oklahoma have experienced it, and we will walk through it together as a  With that, Mr.President, I yield back.

Republicans are using the repeal-and-replace legislation once again to target women's health by defunding Planned No matter how many times it has been substantiated, it is a fact, it has been stated, the Republicans do not seem to understand or refuse to accept the fact that Federal dollars do not pay for abortions.  Planned Parenthood provides a variety of preventative care, including contraception and cancer screening for millions of Americans and women in this country.

In fact, in ordinary times, these nominees would be unanimously confirmed during wrap-up on the Senate floor.                            richard boulware  Mr.President, one nominee we are not considering today is Judge Richard Boulware, whom President Obama nominated in 2015 to fill a seat on the Sentencing Commission previously held by Judge Ketanji Brown Judge Boulware was confirmed to serve as a district judge in June 2014, becoming the first African-American man to serve on the U.District Court for the District of His nomination to the Sentencing Commission had the strong support of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which said that Judge Boulware would ``bring a much needed and valuable perspective to the work of the Commission because of his experience.'' Judge Boulware clerked in the Southern District of New York, served as a Federal public defender, and represented the Las Vegas branch of the NAACP on a range of issues, including voting rights, police cameras, and solitary confinement.  Despite his clear qualifications, Senate Republicans blocked Judge Boulware, and his nomination was returned to the White House at the end of last year. President Trump renominated Judge Reeves and Judge Breyer, but I am disappointed that he failed to do the same for Judge The Sentencing Commission does not have a single person of Color serving as a commissioner; yet its work on criminal justice issues has a significant effect on communities of color. Judge Boulware should have been confirmed last year, along with Judge Reeves and Judge While I support the two nominees before us today, I want the Record to note my deep disappointment and concern that Judge Boulware is not among them.  For nearly a decade, I have worked with Senators from both parties on bipartisan legislation to reform our criminal justice system. The Sentencing Commission has also studied the issue and brought about needed change to the sentencing guidelines. The Bureau of Prisons continues to consume nearly a quarter of the Justice Department's budget, even as violent crime rates have gone down; but instead of taking meaningful steps to reduce these costs, the Trump-Sessions Justice Department has signaled it intends to more aggressively charge low-level offenders with crimes carrying mandatory minimums. The Attorney General also lifted restrictions on the use of private prisons that serve only the interest of wealthy corporations. This is deeply troubling on moral grounds. Incarceration should not be a for-profit business. It is also troubling to me in my role as vice chairman of the Appropriations Instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on private prisons, we should be directing our limited resources to train and protect officers on the streets and to reduce recidivism and crime.  The Sentencing Commission has brought much-needed fairness to the Guidelines in the past, and I hope it will continue to do so once its new members are confirmed, Although we should also be voting today on Judge Boulware's nomination to the commission--rather, we should have voted on it last year--I will support the nominations of Judge Breyer and Judge                           breyer nomination  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1862-2.txt,1383,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,21.0,March
1063,topic-id,823,"Mr.President, last Thursday the Trump administration submitted its first budget blueprint to The President called it ``America First, A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again.'' The title would seem like a ``Saturday Night Live'' skit if the topic were not so serious. Like some of the President's tweets, his budget is a hasty list of appallingly unbalanced, shortsighted, and, I believe, politically driven priorities.  He proposes to eliminate or drastically cut programs that benefit the middle class and safeguard its most vulnerable citizens, programs that protect our environment, programs that promote our interests overseas but also security at home. Instead, he wants to spend billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars on a misguided wall along our southern border and increased spending for the  He says his proposal causes ``strength, security and resolve.'' He couldn't be more wrong. You don't want to make America ``great again'' at the expense of middle-class families and the most vulnerable among us. We are not a ``great'' nation if we abandon our shared desire to cure cancer, the desire to bring an end to Alzheimer's disease or diabetes. We don't do that by slashing billions for the National Institutes of You can't switch complex and promising medical research off and then say: Well, maybe someday later we will just turn it back on again.  We are not a great nation if we eliminate heating assistance for the 6 million vulnerable households that receive Some 21,000 of those households just had to dig themselves out from a historic snowstorm in my State of And we are not a ``great'' nation if we don't protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.  You don't make America stronger by eliminating the very programs that strengthen our alliances around the world and make our Nation more secure. We are not a strong nation if we simply pour more money into the Pentagon but then renege on commitments to international peacekeeping and security alliances or slash funding to respond to humanitarian crises or cut our diplomatic presence around the world. Interesting enough, when the other body spent millions of tax dollars to investigate a lack of security in Benghazi and came up with nothing, this budget slashes huge amounts that could be spent on security in our embassies, just as they voted to cut out hundreds of millions of dollars from a Senate budget that would have improved our security.  The President says he prefers hard power to soft power, but it is not either/or. The notion that soft power is weak or wasteful is mindless. If you are cutting programs that feed millions or prevent AIDS or treat tuberculosis and malaria, well, that doesn't help. It makes the world less stable, less secure.  I am afraid the budget proposal is divorced from reality. It has a lot of partisan campaign promises. He promises infrastructure investment--and all of us would agree with that--but then it cuts critical Federal funds for proven successful State transportation projects. He claims it will save rural America, but he cuts those Federal programs that spur rural economic development. That is not a budget with vision.  We need a serious budget proposal--a proposal that acknowledges the devastating effects the Budget Control Act and sequestration have had in our country and a budget that charts a path forward, rather than doubling down on further cuts on programs for the middle class. We need a budget proposal investing in our citizens and in our military, not a proposal that pays for one at the expense of the other.  We have a lot of work to do. I am the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations I would say we have[[Page S1870]]to finish the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills and then get to work on fiscal year 2018.

1103,topic-id,603,"Mr.President, article 2 of chapter I of the Charter of the Organization of American States, of which Ecuador is a party, states that one of the OAS's purposes is ``to promote and consolidate representative democracy, with due respect for the principle of nonintervention.''  I mention this because the second round of Ecuador's Presidential election is scheduled for April 2, less than 2 weeks away. In the first round, Lenin Moreno, who is supported by outgoing President Correa, received 39 percent and his opponent, Guillermo Lasso, received 28 percent, so it is a hotly contested election.  But democracy is about more than elections. There is no institution more fundamental to democracy than a free and independent press. A free press helps protect the rule of law, to ensure that no person or group is above the rules and procedures that govern a democratic society. A free press helps ensure transparency to prod governments to be honest and accountable to their citizens.  Although wavering at times, Ecuador has a history of democratic government of which its citizens can be proud. It has a long tradition of recognizing the importance of freedom of the press. Ecuador's first constitution, written in 1830, stipulated that ``every citizen can express their thoughts and publish them freely through the press.'' Ecuador's 1998 constitution guaranteed the right of journalists and social communicators to ``seek, receive, learn, and disseminate'' events of general interest, with the goal of ``preserving the values of the community.'' Even Ecuador's current constitution protects the right ``to voice one's opinion and express one's thinking freely and in all of its forms and manifestations,'' and the right to ``associate, assemble and express oneself freely and voluntarily.''  Yet, since President Correa was first elected, freedom of the press has been under assault. He has called the independent press his ``greatest enemy.'' He sought to intimidate and silence his critics in the media and civil society, like Janet Hinostroza, El Universo, Vanguardia, El Comercio, Xavier Bonilla, and He publicly vilified Catalina Botero, a respected Colombian lawyer and former OAS Special Rapporteur for Freedom of He pursued criminal charges against columnists and newspaper owners who had criticized his policies. During this period, the number of state-owned media organizations exploded, growing from just one government-run news outlet to a media conglomerate that today is made up of more than a dozen outlets echoing the government's self-serving declarations. These actions are a threat to democracy, and they damaged relations with the United  On April 2, when the people of Ecuador elect their next President, they alone will decide Ecuador's future. What is important at this stage is to ensure that the electoral process is free and fair, that the press can participate freely, and that the election is open to international observers, including the  Whoever wins on April 2, I hope Ecuador's next President is someone who genuinely believes in the freedoms of[[Page S1885]]expression and association that are enshrined in Ecuador's I hope he defends the right of a free press, an independent judiciary, and the right of civil society organizations to function without government interference. These rights are part of the foundation of the representative democracy referenced in the OAS The alternative is unaccountable government. That is, in fact, where Ecuador was heading, after President Correa orchestrated the adoption of a new constitution in order to run for reelection in 2009 and again in 2013.  I hope the result on April 2 will signify a commitment to uphold Ecuador's Constitution and the beginning of a new relationship with the United States, based on a common devotion to the fundamental rights of citizens.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1884-3.txt,1383,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,21.0,March

Chen recently made the difficult decision to not seek reappointment. He leaves behind a legacy which future leaders will undoubtedly follow.  Chen has long graced Vermont as a top leader in healthcare. Before his appointment as health commissioner in 2011, Chen served in the Vermont House of Representatives from 2004 to 2008 and in his last term was the vice chair of the Health Care In 2008, he was honored with the Physician Award for Community Service by the Vermont State Medical  Prior to his election to the State legislature, Chen worked for more than 20 years as an emergency room physician and medical director at the Rutland Regional Medical Chen also served on the clinical faculty at the University of Vermont's College of Medicine and as vice chair of the University of Vermont's board of trustees. He obtained his medical degree and completed his residency at the University of Oregon's school of medicine as chief resident.  Chen's work to improve public health awareness and education has long made Vermont a nationwide leader in healthcare. As Vermont's Commissioner of Health since 2011 and briefly as the interim Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2014 to 2015, Chen led the charge to expand public health education and resources across the Chen was especially instrumental in the fight against opioid and substance abuse. I was proud when he testified at the field hearing I held on the issue while ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2014. In the years after, he worked to strengthen State resources for treatment and education programs. He has worked to improve the State's prescription drug monitoring system in order to curb harmful opioid prescribing and misuse.  Chen also led efforts to reduce tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol use among youth. In 2013, he and I worked to secure a $10 million grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to expand substance abuse efforts in Vermont among young adults at risk of developing habits in alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and illicit drug use. Since his efforts, the conversation regarding youth substance abuse, especially on marijuana, has become a major public health discussion in the Vermont Statehouse and beyond. He also worked to expand nutrition education in schools and to increase awareness surrounding the importance of vaccines. For instance, 2 years ago, after the outbreak of Ebola, Chen worked with Vermont's top health facilities to strengthen defenses against the disease, while educating patients on the importance of disease prevention. He also led efforts to increase vaccinations for children in efforts to prevent the spread of disease at school.  Chen's dedication to public health promotion did not stop at the State level. In 2009, Chen testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on Vermont's experience with healthcare reform and the creation of Vermont Health In 2014, he became chair of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Food Safety and Modernization Act Surveillance Working Group where he continues to strengthen foodborne illness surveillance systems across the country.

1109,topic-id,530,"Mr.President, I want to call the Senate's attention to the current situation in Guatemala, where upholding the rule of law has too often been the exception rather than the rule.  For centuries, most Guatemalans had no access to justice. This was exacerbated during--and in the years since--the civil war, when an estimated 200,000 people were killed or disappeared. Most of them were innocent victims of the armed forces, and only a small number of the military officers and their accomplices who were responsible have been punished. In fact, the armed forces and their benefactors have for the most part successfully avoided justice, by threatening prosecutors and witnesses and paying off judges.  At the same time, Guatemala is experiencing the corrosive effects of drug gangs, smugglers, and organized crime. Former President Perez Molina is under arrest, and other high-ranking officials have been implicated in corruption. Rampant gang violence and a lack of job opportunities have caused tens of thousands of Guatemalans, including unaccompanied minors, to seek safety and employment in the United  Two individuals, Thelma Aldana, Guatemala's Attorney General, and Ivan Velasquez, the head of CICIG, the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, have been courageously investigating these high-profile cases and working diligently to bring those responsible to justice. Both are respected former judges, Aldana a Guatemalan and Velasquez a  The United States, with the support of Democrats and Republicans in Congress, has provided funding to both of their offices.  It is difficult, dangerous work. They have received anonymous threats in an attempt to intimidate them, and there is a concern that President Morales may oppose the renewal of Mr.Velasquez's term of duty, which ends in September, or request the U.Secretary General to remove or replace Mr. This would be of great concern because no democracy can survive without the rule of law, and there can be no rule of law without independent investigators, prosecutors, and judges.  In Guatemala, with its history of impunity, Thelma Aldana and Ivan Velasquez are making history by showing the Guatemalan people that justice is possible. It is possible even in cases in which the perpetrators are high-ranking government officials, members of their families, or others with wealth and power who have long evaded justice.  Guatemala needs our support to reduce poverty and malnutrition, improve education, combat crime, reform the police, and strengthen its economy and public institutions, but none of that can be achieved or sustained without political will and a transparent, accountable justice system. I know this from my own experience, first as a prosecutor, and more recently as the senior member of the Senate Judiciary  I have been here a long time, in fact longer than any other I know Guatemala's history and the daunting challenges it faces. Its people deserve better, and they need leaders who respect the rule of law.  If Guatemala's leaders support Thelma Aldana and Ivan Velasquez for as long they are willing to make the personal sacrifice and continue their important work, we will do our part by supporting the Alliance for Prosperity, but if there are attempts to undermine or curtail the work of these two outstanding prosecutors, then Guatemala's leaders should look elsewhere for support.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1885.txt,1383,HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,2017.0,21.0,March

Since then, I have seen our country slide into new wars. I have seen scandals that have consumed this town and our I have seen horrific terrorist attacks that have shaken our country to its core, from Oklahoma City to 9/11, and others. All of these events, in different ways, have tested our country. But I have never seen a threat to our democratic institutions like I see today.  There is still much we do not know about Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, but what we do know is deeply disturbing. Last night, reports indicated that there is evidence that certain Trump officials coordinated the release of hacked documents with Russian officials. And on Monday the FBI Director confirmed that the FBI has been investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia since July of last year.  Already, the Intelligence Community has made public its conclusion that Russian President Putin waged a multifaceted influence campaign to delegitimize Secretary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the Worse, he intended to undermine public faith in our democratic process. What is even worse is that this interference did not end on November 8, election day. It is ongoing. That--whether you are a Republican or a Democrat--should concern every  According to the Intelligence Community, President Putin will continue using cyber-attacks and propaganda campaigns to undermine our future elections. This is nothing less than an attack on our democracy. It should outrage all Americans, no matter what their political affiliation, and we need to know all the facts.  Frankly, my experience here tells me we need a thorough, independent investigation. We need to send a clear message to President Putin that America, our country--the country that the Presiding Officer and I revere--will not tolerate future efforts to manipulate our most sacred democratic process, our elections.  All of us here know that President Trump is not going to lead such an investigation. He is not going to deliver this message. The President, unfortunately, spent much of the 2016 campaign supportive of President Then-Candidate Trump refused to call on Russia to stop meddling in our election, saying: ``I'm not going to tell Putin what to do.'' He even encouraged Russian hacking on live television, pleading: ``Russia, if you're listening, I hope you'll be able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.'' It is unprecedented. No candidate, in my memory, of either party has ever called on another country to interfere in our elections that way.  This was occurring as the President was claiming to have had no role in weakening the Republican Party's official position on Russia's incursion into Of course, we have now learned that this was false, and his campaign played a central role in softening his party's stance on  I do not know why the President is so enthralled with President Vladimir Putin, a man who has shown such disregard for personal rights, even as he has made himself one of the wealthiest people in the world. It may be simply because Russia is heavily invested in the Trump brand. Years before the President denied having any financial relationships with the Russians, his son admitted that Russians own a disproportionate share of Trump assets, saying: ``We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' Now, just how invested Moscow is in Trump is not known. The President broke with precedent of both Republicans and Democrats and did not release his tax returns. But I imagine there would be quite a sigh of relief if the only secret in the President's full tax returns were that he did not pay his share of taxes and paid far less than the average  The President, though, is not the only one in his administration incapable of telling the truth when it comes to His Attorney General provided testimony that was not true before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to questions from me and Senator Franken about Russian contacts, and we know his first National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, resigned after lying to Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian  President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, also resigned after questions were raised about his extensive activities in Russia and Of course, now it has been reported that Mr.Manafort earned $10 million per year for secret work on behalf of  Another former adviser, Roger Stone, had early warning of the release of hacked documents. He has admitted to having conversations with ``Guccifer 2.0,'' the Russian-connected hacker responsible for the cyber-attack on the Democratic National  They say that where there is smoke there is fire. There is so much smoke here that it is getting hard to breathe. The President unfortunately continues to make matters worse. This week alone, he continued his untruth about President Obama personally ordering a wiretap of Trump Tower, something everybody knows is not true. I think members of his own administration's inner circle are embarrassed every time he persists in this.  On Monday, the President ramped up his own influence campaign to undermine the integrity of this investigation, tweeting ``fake news'' as the Director of the FBI prepared to testify under oath in the House of  Now, I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the FBI's investigation thus far, but I have every reason to believe it is eventually going to be at risk. That is why we need somebody independent--independent of the Congress, independent of the administration. We need an independent special prosecutor to lead this investigation and to ultimately decide whether there is sufficient evidence to prosecute. A special prosecutor would not report to the Attorney General, who himself is a witness to this investigation. And a special prosecutor, unlike the Attorney General or even the FBI Director, cannot be fired by the  I have thought long and hard about this. I went on my experience here with administrations beginning with President Gerald Ford straight through to today. It takes a lot of thought to call for a special prosecutor, but this is one where we need it, where the American people have to have somebody they can trust outside Republicans, Democrats, and the Congress, and certainly outside the administration.  Our Nation is at a precipice. We can either confront what happened in our election and get to the bottom of it with an independent investigation and make sure it never happens again. Or we can just pretend this is another Washington scandal and allow it to be filtered through a familiar partisan lens. That would be a terrible mistake. In all my years here, I have never seen a time when another country--one that has shown its animosity toward us--has tried to interfere in our elections. If Russia can get away with interfering with our elections, what else can they interfere with in our democratic Nation? They do not share the ideals we do. They do not allow free elections. They do not allow freedom of expression. They do not allow their people to speak out. Why would anyone think that they would have America's interests at heart?  Today we have a counterintelligence investigation into the campaign of a sitting There is evidence that this campaign colluded with a foreign adversary to impact our Presidential election. This is not normal. We must not treat it as such. I would feel this way no matter who had won the election--no matter if they were Democrat or Republican, because it goes beyond one party.  President Putin's goal last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode American's trust and faith in government, something that has sustained us through two World Wars, through a Civil War, through all the other problems this Nation has faced. That trust should sustain us long after every one of us in this body are gone.  This is a responsibility that we as Senators have to our great Nation: not to think of ourselves for the moment, but to think where this Nation is 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and 100 years from now. We must do that. We owe that to the American people. Republicans and Democrats alike, we owe it[[Page S1951]]to the American people. We take an oath to uphold our  We come here, all of us--and I have great respect for every Senator here in both parties--we come here hoping to do the best for our Our Nation is in peril. All of us would stand together if we had an adversary attack us. All of us would stand together if somebody declared war on us. We have done that in the past. We did that after Pearl We did that other times in our Nation's history. Well, because this is done quietly behind the scenes, it is a great attack on us.  As I said, President Putin's goal last year was to undermine our democratic institutions--to corrode Americans' trust and faith in our government, no matter who is If we do not get to the bottom of Russian interference, he will no doubt be successful. And if anybody doubts it, if he is successful, he will try it again.  That is why we should stand united and call for a truly independent investigation. The American people deserve nothing less. We can sit here and talk about this bill and that bill, but it is so rare that we have something overriding. This is overriding. Let's have an independent investigation.

Mr.Friedman has made a career of derogatory and inflammatory statements about U.policy in the Middle East, about former U.officials, about the Palestinians, and about American Jews who have views that differ from his own.  He has written falsely that President Obama and Secretary Kerry engaged in ``blatant anti-Semitism,'' that liberal American Jews are ``far worse than kapos,'' and that they ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil.''  He has accused the State Department of a ``hundred-year history of anti-Semitism,'' apparently because diplomats in both Republican and Democratic administrations have not always agreed with the actions of some of Israel's leaders.  Those comments alone should disqualify him for this sensitive position.  Mr.Friedman has also raised millions of dollars for Israeli settlers and bragged about leading the effort to remove the two-state solution from the Republican Party's platform.  Regarding the two-state solution, he wrote that it is ``an illusion that serves the worst intentions of both the United States and the Palestinian Arabs.'' That renunciation of longstanding U.policy should also, by itself, disqualify him for the job of Ambassador to  Mr.Friedman is certainly entitled to his own views as a private citizen, even if they are offensive and counter to U.interests and values. But can anyone honestly say that this nominee is qualified or suited to represent the American people in Israel?  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel, who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents going back as far as President Reagan, say the answer is no.  An alliance as longstanding as ours with Israel, which has far-reaching consequences for the entire Middle East, requires effective daily management by an experienced diplomat who not only has knowledge of the region but the temperament and appreciation of our short- and long-term interests.  I do not see how anyone could conclude that Mr.Friedman possesses the requisite temperament or objectivity. The record is devoid of evidence that he appreciates the critical distinction between the interests of the United States and the parochial interests of an extreme constituency in Israel that he has fiercely advocated for over the course of his long career.  Mr.Friedman's confirmation hearing provided him the opportunity to assuage concerns about his divisiveness, including the many disparaging remarks he has made and his close identification with and support for, the Israeli settler movement.  During the hearing, he disavowed his past undiplomatic statements, saying he was speaking as a private citizen.  Mr.Friedman's remarkable confirmation conversion falls far short of convincing evidence that changing his title to ``Ambassador'' will cause him to divorce his life's work and objectively serve the interests of the American people.  We all want what is best for the American people. We also share a desire to find a viable solution to the[[Page S1958]]Israeli-Palestinian conflict that protects the rights and security of both peoples.  Neither goal can be achieved by pursuing policies that further inflame tensions and erode the role of the United States as an honest broker for peace.

Mr.Speaker, 2 weeks ago Republicans unveiled their dangerous plan to repeal the Affordable Care  A plan the CBO confirmed would rip healthcare away from 24 million  This week--on the 7th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act--their terrible plan will make it to the House  Mr.Speaker, one thing is clear: the proposal Republicans wrote in secret backrooms would be a disaster for struggling families, seniors, and people with disabilities.  Their proposal would mean 24 million fewer people with health insurance and 2 million jobs lost.  Their plan defunds Planned Parenthood and rations healthcare for low-income  It would make working people sicker, in order to provide a $600 billion tax giveaway for billionaires.  We know who this plan will devastate the most: communities of color, especially African  By ending Medicaid as we know it, at least 1.5 million low-income African Americans could lose their coverage.  And millions more would lose access to high-quality healthcare with the elimination of the ACA's marketplace.  Mr.Speaker, this is outrageous.  We know that African Americans already suffer from shocking health disparities, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.  And sadly, these disparities are all too often fatal.  Mr.Speaker, when we wrote the ACA, we worked hard to ensure that our healthcare bill would help end these disparities.  I was Chair of the CBC at the time and addressing harmful health disparities--especially for African Americans--was at the top of our priorities in drafting the  The final legislation was a huge step forward for underserved families--particularly communities of color.  Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved, including those living with pre-existing conditions.  Take the issue of HIV/AIDS for example. Although they represent only 12% of the population, African Americans disproportionately account for 44% of new HIV cases and 40% of those living with HIV in the U. Before the ACA, many African Americans living with HIV didn't have any insurance at all.  Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved.  Let me be clear: For people living with HIV in this country--repealing the ACA could mean a death sentence.  Without the Affordable Care Act, people living with HIV are at risk of losing access to the medicine and doctors that keep them healthy.  Clearly, health insurance is critical to keeping people healthy and reducing health disparities.  Mr.Speaker, we know that the ACA works.  It has provided healthcare for over 20 million Americans--7 8 million of whom are African American--since it was signed into law.  And because of this bill, young people, working class people, and people of color now have high-quality, affordable healthcare.  But Republicans don't seem to care.  They are on a rampage to make America sick again--and we must stand in their way.  Mr.Speaker, millions of Americans are making their voices heard in protests, in town halls and in the streets.  And their message is simple: ``Keep your hands off of our healthcare.''  I'm standing with the millions of Americans who are in opposition to this disastrous healthcare bill.  The fight to protect affordable healthcare is on.  We will not rest until Republicans and Trump end their cruel campaign to kick American families off their healthcare.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2226-3.txt,1501,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1101, SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH",2017.0,20.0,March
917,topic-id,358,"Mr.Speaker, I first want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition, first, to this terrible rule, of course, which made no Democratic amendments in order, but also in strong support of Congressman Polis' amendment that requires the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to score the final bill, which is the bill to take away health care from 24 million people, to score it as amended by the Republican manager's amendment before the bill is on the House floor.  This clearly is nothing new for Republicans, though. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, Republicans shamefully pushed ahead with the markup of their terrible ACA repeal bill without a score from the Congressional Budget And this week, on the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans' terrible plan to repeal this lifesaving legislation will make it to the House floor.  One thing is clear. Republicans' proposals, of course written in secret back rooms, would be a disaster for struggling families, seniors, people with disabilities, low-income individuals, the poor, and the middle class.  It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people, reduce benefits, increase rates for those who can least afford this, and transfer $600 billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy. That is outrageous, but it gets even worse.  Late last night, in secret back rooms, Republicans introduced a dangerous manager's amendment that doubles down on the war on women's health and the poor, low-income, and struggling families.  Yes, once again, Republicans are attempting to move forward with a vote on the final GOP's take away health[[Page H2265]]care from 24 million Americans, a bill that includes a manager's amendment, without an updated Congressional Budget Office score.  The American people deserve to know the full damage of this disastrous bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and support Congressman Polis' amendment to ensure that we have updated Congressional Budget Office scores before this bill is brought to the House floor.

Opioid Abuse Crisis  ",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgS1900-6.txt,1983,MONTENEGRO'S ACCESSION INTO NATO,2017.0,22.0,March
1419,topic-id,3743,"Mr.President, I rise today because of the crisis we have with the country's opiate addictions--prescription drugs--in the Presiding Officer's wonderful State of Alaska, the State of West Virginia, and every other State in the  West Virginia has the highest drug overdose death rate in the Nation due to prescription drug abuse. Just in 2016, West Virginia reported 818 overdose deaths, which is 4 times the number that occurred in 2001 and is a nearly 13-percent increase just from 2015, when it was about 607. More than 700 West Virginians died from an opioid overdose last year, and 42,000 people in West Virginia, including 4,000 youth, sought treatment for illegal drug use, but they failed to receive it. There is no place for them to go.  The Presiding Officer and I have spoken about this, and I appreciate his willingness and openness to look at how we cure that. I have a bill called the LifeBOAT Act, which the Presiding Officer has been so graciously looking at. It is something that I believe would give us the funding mechanism, and it won't be a hardship. It also gives exemptions for people who have chronic pain from cancer and all the chronic illnesses that are out there. Basically, the opiate drugs that are sold on a day-to-day basis by the millions and millions--it is a one-penny revenue source, one penny per milligram. That would give us the funding mechanism we need in order to continue to have expanded services for addiction.  I have been involved in public service for quite some time, and 20 years ago, I would have thought anybody who has fooled with drugs, whether legal prescription or illicit drugs--it would be a criminal act and they should go to jail for it. Well, we have put people in jail for consumption for the last 20 years, and it hasn't cured one. So I have come to the conclusion, basically, in looking and talking to the experts, after we have had two decades of evaluating this, that it is an illness, and an illness needs treatment. We don't have the treatment centers, so we are letting people go untreated, and that is basically sinful in this country.  There are 2.1 million Americans who abuse or are dependent on opioids--2.1 million. I think to get the scope of how bad the situation is, and this epidemic, when you think about how over 200,000 people have died since 2000--200,000--any other catastrophic cause of death in this country would be of pandemic proportions, and we would do whatever it costs in order to get the National Institutes of Health to find a cure. We would. But with this, we kind of sit back idly.  According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users abused prescription opiates before moving to heroin. It is a segue for people to move right into tougher, stronger, powerful drugs.  Heroin use has more than doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25 in the past decade, and 45 percent of the people who used heroin were also addicted to prescription opiate painkillers. Between 2009 and 2013, only 22 percent of Americans suffering from opioid addiction participated in any form of addiction treatment.  Think about the enormity of this epidemic. The United States of America, our great country, makes up only about 4.6 percent of the world's population; yet we consume 80 percent of all opiates produced and consumed in the world. How did it happen? The Presiding Officer and I grew up in a time when this wasn't prevalent, but how did it happen?  I will tell you one thing: We have to cure it. It is ravaging and destroying every part of this great country. We are taking so many productive people out of the workforce because they are addicted. If you talk to your police and law enforcement anywhere in this country, they will tell you that 80 to 90 percent of all of the calls they make in the form of justice are due to opiate or drug use. It is horrible what it is costing us in real time, in real dollars, in real people's lives.  There is another bill I have out there, too, and I call it last chance. It really deals with this. If we know we have a problem--we have people whom we don't have in the workforce because three things keep you out of the workforce: You are either addicted or convicted or lack of skills. You have an addiction; you have been convicted of a crime, so you have a record; or you have a lack of skills or a combination of the three.  I can tell you that the addiction and conviction usually go hand in hand. People who are addicted often have a larceny or maybe even a felony on their record, and it is so hard for them to get back into the workforce. If you get them in a treatment center, there is no carrot to say: Stick with this because you are going to be clean.  It takes a lot of fortitude for a person to stay with the program when they have such an addiction and a craving. But if they know that at the end of that 1 year in a treatment center, there is a chance for them to expunge their record if it wasn't a violent crime, if it wasn't a sexual crime--but it was probably grand larceny, because usually they will steal from their family, and then once the family gets tough with them, they will steal from any type of extended family, and then they will steal from the neighborhood or anywhere they can get the money to support their habit.  What my bill says is that after 1 year in a certified treatment program, they complete another year of mentoring, helping other people get off and stay off and maybe not start, then they are able to, with their sponsors--people who say: Yes, they have completed this program; yes, they have mentored for 1 year--they can go before the arresting officers and the sentencing judge to see if they can get that expunged to give[[Page S1904]]them a clean start. It is the Clean Start I call it last chance, but officially it is called the Clean Start It is one way to get this workforce in America producing again because if not, the only thing they have waiting for them is a minimum wage job, and the skill sets most of them have are going to go unused and unproductive. So these are things we are working on.  When you look at the misuse and abuse of opiates and what it costs our country, think about this. This was in 2013, the last figures I have--an estimated $78.5 billion in lost productivity, medical costs, and criminal justice cost. In 2013, it cost our country $78.5 billion. So we are paying for it. It is like ``Pay me now or pay me later.'' We are paying for it.  That one penny on every milligram of opiates that are produced and consumed in this country would raise about $1.5 to $2 billion a year. I would hope it would raise none, but it would raise that much because of the amount of consumption we have. We consume 80 percent of all of the world's opiates. With that, we can start creating treatment centers and curing people.  For the past year, I have been coming to the Senate floor to read letters from West Virginians and those struggling all throughout our country with opioid abuse. They all mention how hard it is to get themselves or their loved ones into treatment. Sometimes it takes months, and sometimes it never happens. Most of the time, it never happens. This problem stems from a lack of a system to help those who are looking for help. We need permanent funding. We talked about that. That is why I introduced the LifeBOAT  Today I am going to read a letter from a mother from West Virginia--she is no different from a mother from Alaska, I can assure you--who lost her daughter to drug abuse after she struggled to get her into treatment facilities she desperately needed. This is Leigh Ann Wilson's story.       On behalf of the families who have lost their children to      addiction, I ask that any health law reforms contain a      serious effort to ensure effective addiction treatment for      all who need it, whatever it takes.       Just yesterday, the Boston Globe published a special report      about my daughter, Taylor Leigh  Leigh Ann's daughter is named Taylor Leigh       My youngest child was one of West Virginia's promising      young people, a former Girl Scout, Cabell Midland High School      graduate and Marshall student who wanted to turn her love of      books into a career as a librarian. But drugs destroyed her      life despite her willingness, and months of effort, to get      treatment.       Taylor's overdose was the first--  You have to listen to this because you are just not going to believe what happened in Huntington, WV, on this day.       Taylor's overdose was the first of 28 that would be      reported in Huntington in the span of five hours on 15,      2016. The horror of that afternoon made national news. Then      the reporters left. Our nightmare, though, was just      beginning.       Taylor and I would spend the next 41 days trying to get      help. We drove door to door in search of inpatient treatment      beds to isolate her from the heroin world. All we found were      waiting lists; out-of-state centers that wouldn't take West      Virginia Medicaid; and doctors who discouraged Taylor from      inpatient treatment, saying she could do without it.       Then Taylor put her name on Prestera's waiting list for      Suboxone, a drug proven to reduce withdrawal symptoms. No one      told her how long she might have to wait. Though evidence      suggests that the combination of counseling and prescription      drugs to reduce cravings can be very effective, our lawmakers      have restricted the availability of this medication.       On September 28, 2016, Prestera Center called to inform me      that Taylor had been accepted into the Suboxone program.  That was September 28, and, as I told you, this overdose happened on August 15.       On September 28, Prestera Center called to inform me that      Taylor had been accepted in the suboxone program. I had to      tell her that she had overdosed and died 3 days before. The      next February I got a call from Prestera Pinecrest following      up on Taylor's application for recovery housing and to see if      she was still interested.       Before she passed away, Taylor herself told the Boston      Globe reporter that the real story that needs to be told is      why there are no treatment beds when our state has a crisis      epidemic.  Your State, my State--almost every State in America has this.       Why must it be so hard to get addiction treatment in a      state with the nation's highest drug death rate--818 deaths      last year, most of them from [legal prescription drugs]?  Think about how this epidemic has gotten to this proportion. We have a drug that is put on the market by the This is an organization, a Federal agency, that is supposed to make sure that we have for consumption a safety net built into it. So the FDA gives their stamp of approval: This is a product that can be used, and it should be of help. Then it goes to the DEA to find out who is allowed to dispense it without any type of education or any type of work to make sure that there is competency in our doctors who are prescribing it--or I might say overprescribing it. Then it goes to the doctor, who is the most trusted person outside of our family, who says: This is going to help you. This is good for you. This is what we are talking about--what is killing West Virginians and Americans every day.  If you need heart surgery, you have insurance providers around the State that would compete for your care. That is what she is saying. There is someone there; for any other treatment or any other need for treatment of any illness, we can find help, but not for this.  This has been such a silent killer that I know--and my family included. Everyone I talk to--anybody I talk to knows somebody in their immediate family or extended family or a close family friend. All of our young interns here know the same. They know people. But we keep it quiet; especially if it's in our family, we keep quiet because it is embarrassing. We don't want anybody to know that we have failed as a family structure. Something fell apart for this to happen. Why would someone have to turn to drugs when they have a loving, caring family? We just don't understand, so we keep quiet about it.  It isn't a Democrat or Republican or liberal or conservative cause. This is a killer that has no boundaries; it attacks everybody. That is what I am saying. When you see a mother who is doing everything she can to get her daughter somewhere just to save her life and can't get her in--we are talking about this one penny: What is a one-penny tax, Joe? I can't vote for any new taxes.  I am not asking you to vote for a tax. I am asking you to look any of your constituents in the eye and say: We have a program that is lifesaving for you or your family member. God forbid if you ever need it, but we have it.  We don't hesitate to put taxes on cigarettes. We didn't hesitate. Everybody voted for taxes on cigarettes. Everybody has voted for taxes on alcohol. I am asking for one penny--one penny to save thousands and thousands of lives in I guarantee that there will not be one person to vote against it--a Republican or Democrat who would not vote for something that is going to put permanent funding for treatment centers in the most needed areas in America and saves people's lives.       There aren't enough resources to accommodate the addiction      problem in the heroin capital of the United States, Taylor      [herself told] a reporter. If no one changes it this whole      city will go under.  Let me tell you what this city of Huntington is doing right now. I met with them last week when I was home. They are going to have a center of excellence starting with Marshall University, the city of Huntington, Calvert County, and the entire organization. All the policymakers are working together because this is something they are fighting every day. This center of excellence is built around this. We know we have a problem. We have people overdosing. We are trying to save lives. We are trying to get them clean, and we are trying to get them back into the workforce.  The center of excellence is going to start at conception for a mother who may be using and conceives a child. How do we get her clean? How does she have a healthy baby versus a drug-addicted baby?  We have Lily's Place down there, and what they are doing in neonatal care is unbelievable. They are trying to get this baby weaned off the addiction that the mother passed on in her pregnancy. Then we want to make sure that mother goes back home with the baby in a clean home because, if not, the cycle will continue. This is what the center of excellence is going to do.[[Page S1905]]  The success we think we are going to have, starting at ground zero in Huntington, WV, will be able to be shared all over the country because they are going to take a holistic approach. You just can't say: I am going to treat the addict. I am going to treat the cause. It goes further than that. These children are being born to a drug-infested mother and a father or a person who is paternal or into a family that is still drug-infested. It does nothing but perpetuate the cycle. This is what we have to stop if we want to save the country.  Here is what I tell children, and I will tell all of our young interns. I go to schools and talk every day. I tell them that there is not another country that will take on the United States of America militarily. No one compares with the greatest military that the world has ever known, that history has ever recorded, the United States of It is not going to happen. Nobody can take on this great economy of ours--the greatest economy in the world, $19 trillion, almost $20 trillion The closest economy we have next to us is China, with an economy that is about half of ours, $10.5 to $11 trillion. Then it drops off the scale with Japan and then Russia is at $2.5 to $3 trillion. No one compares to the United States of America for the economy and military might we have as a superpower--the only superpower left in the world, the United States of We are the hope of the world, the United States of  I tell them: They don't think they have to fight you. They don't have to take over our economy. They think we will give it to them. They think we will give it to them because we have a lack of skill sets. Our education attainment is not as high as what they are doing, and our addiction problem means we will not be clean enough to be able to perform. They will just sit back and wait because time is on their side. They can sit back and wait for us to turn it all over. And you might be the last generation that lives in our country as the only superpower, the United States of God, I hope that doesn't happen, but we have to fight this. We just can't continue to keep talking about it.  We have a good piece of legislation. Think about this: I introduced this bill a year ago--introduced it to honor Jessie Grubb and her mom and dad. Her dad served in the State legislature with me. We have been friends for a long time. Jessie was 30 years old. She was a promising young girl. She got sexually molested when she was in college. She came home, hid it from them, was depressed, got started on--they gave her some pain pills, some drug suppressants so she could cope with it. She got addicted. She overdosed a few times. She was trying to cure--she was 30 years old. She had gone to She was in treatment. She had been clean for 6 months. She was a runner, an athlete. She was doing her first marathon.  She had a hip injury, and she went to the hospital. When she went to the hospital, her mom and dad went up there. So here was the mom, the dad, and the girl; they went to admissions. She said: I want you all to know, I am so proud that I am a recovering addict, and I am 6 months clean. I want to make sure you all know that. The parents reiterated it.  She goes into this, and there are no laws--nothing. They ask her all different types of questions: Are you allergic to penicillin--whatever it may be? They make sure that her chart is marked right, so that another attending physician or another attending nurse or the night shift or whatever looks and sees that they can't do that because it says she is allergic to that or they shouldn't give her this because of her condition.  She goes in and she gets treated and she has an infection. They want to treat the infection, so they put a port in to treat the infection because that is how she would be treated with that.  The discharging physician did not know she was a recovering addict. He saw a healthy young lady with an injury and knew that she was going to have pain, so he prescribed her some pain medication. He prescribed her 50 OxyContin on the afternoon she was discharged, and she overdosed and died by 1 in the morning.  Jessie's Law basically says that if the guardian or parent and if the patient both come in and identify their problem and they want you to mark their charts accordingly, that should be done. Pretty simple, right?  Let me tell you what has happened. For 1 year it has been stalled because of HIPAA privacy laws. All this was going on; 1 year was up, and I called They had written me a letter that said: Do you think anything will ever happen?  So we went back again and started working on it. Here's what we did to change it. I said: David, we are going to have to take the parents or guardians off of it. If the patient themself asks for that, freely and willingly asks for that, we think that will pass muster, and all the different interest groups out there that are so concerned will basically accept that.  So we have that piece of legislation called Jessie's God forbid, if someone has a constituent or a loved one and it is not known, they can lose that child, just like that.  These are all things that we are dealing with after the effects of addiction. Huntington, WV, and Marshall University are going to take on an effort that I think is heroic: How do we start from the beginning, conception, and make sure that child doesn't grow up to be an addict, make sure that family can get clean enough, and make sure they can be given the responsibility to care for that child so that they can grow up not in an addicted environment? That is what we are trying to do. We are at ground zero.  I am hopeful for this great country and this new generation that we are counting on that they can keep themselves clean and still continue to be the hope of the world, and they truly are.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1490,topic-id,6335,"Thank you, Mr. We have a historic debate going on here in Yes, there is a lot of discussion about the Russians cracking into our elections using electronic technologies. We have a President of the United States who is contending that his predecessor in the White House wiretapped his apartment in the Trump We have stories about the compromise of websites all across America--this company, that company, millions of healthcare records, people's privacy compromised, front page, above the fold. This is huge. What is going on in our country when this new technology allows for such an invasion into the privacy of the President of the United States, of citizens all across our country?  These hearings are going on right now in rooms all across Capitol Everyone is concerned. Everyone is cross-examining witnesses, saying: How can this happen in our country? And then they are told: Oh, it is this new electronic technology which is out there. It allows for the ability to be able to crack into the privacy of Presidents and ordinary citizens. It makes it possible to make television sets that are purchased and then can be turned, from a remote distance, into a monitoring device just looking at you in your living room. How can this happen? What are the rules? Is there going to be any protection for the American people? So night after night, story after story, look at the compromise of the privacy, the security in our country, but out here on the Senate floor tonight we have the Republican response. The Republicans are saying to the American consuming public: You have no privacy. If you are at home, if you have Comcast or Verizon, if you have AT&T, and they are gathering all this information about you as your broadband provider, every site you go to, everything you are doing, everything your children are doing, what they are saying as of tonight, no privacy, no privacy if you have bandwidth. Everything is out there to be captured by these big broadband barons, and then they can sell it. They can sell it.  What is the Republicans' answer?  They say: Well, the internet thrives because of a light touch--a light touch. No, ladies and gentlemen, that is not what created what we have here today. We had to pass new regulations in 1996. I know, I was there. I was the Democrat on the committee in the There was no broadband--not one home in America had broadband in 1996. Can I say that again? Not one home in America in 1996 had broadband.  Today, for a 12-year-old, a 50-inch screen plugged into broadband, that is a constitutional right. It didn't exist in 1996 anywhere. Was it because it hadn't been invented, that people hadn't thought through broadband, they hadn't thought through what was possible? It was because these companies decided, because they were pretty much all monopolies, that they weren't going to deploy it. So we had to change the rules in order to unleash this revolution.  Now they are saying: Yes, but a light touch says no privacy protections. That would be bad. People don't really want privacy protections. That is not how I remember it when I was growing up.  When I was growing up, when the salesman knocked on the front door, you know what my mother would say? Don't answer the front door. We don't want the salesman in our living room. That is what my mom said. Now, is it different today? Is everyone saying: Yes, come on in. Come into the kitchen. Come into the living room. Come into the bedroom. Come look at the kids who are sick. Come look at Grandma who is sick. We want you to see our house. We want you to know everything about us, Mr. Now the broadband provider knocks on the front door. The broadband provider says: I want to provide this great new service with a light touch. Let us go into the key rooms into your house--in your living room, in your bedroom--let us put in this broadband technology, but we are also going to gather all this information about every member of your family--your mother, your father, your children--and we are just going to gather it all, and then we are going to sell it to anybody we feel like selling it to.  Let me ask you this. Have the values of the American people changed in one generation or are they the same? Do people want total strangers to know everything about you, and you have no right to say no? None? Because that is what this debate is about tonight, ladies and gentlemen. It is all about whether the Republicans are going to take away the rights of people to protect their children, to protect their families from having all of this information which the broadband providers encourage people to put online to be then sold as a product. Did you go to a healthcare website to find out something about a disease a child in your family has? Well, that is now a product to be sold. There are plenty of insurance companies that would love to know all the people who have gone to that website to find out about that disease. Do you really want that? That is what this debate is all about. How much privacy are people entitled to in this country?  Are we going to give it to the broadband companies to determine that? That is what we are voting for tonight. They are saying: We need harmonization, meaning we need a standard which is voluntary--voluntary. The broadband companies decide what the level of privacy is. You subscribe to that company. You now have that level of privacy protection. What does that mean? That means if they don't want to provide any privacy protection, that is the standard. They are saying: Well,[[Page S1937]]that law could then be enforced because they promised you no privacy. Now, if they violate that policy in any way, we could go after them. That really is what the Republican Party thinks about the private, most intimate information that ordinary families put online because there is only one company that knows everything, and that is the broadband provider, that is Verizon, Comcast, AT&Every other one of the thousands of websites, they know what is on their websites. They don't know what is on the other websites. Only one company, your broadband provider, knows everything--has all of your information. Now what is the standard? What is the standard? The Republicans say: No standard. Don't worry about it.  Yes, the Federal Communications Commission put a new rule on the books. Yes, the Federal Communications Commission says that if they want to gather this information about your children, they have to get your permission in order to sell that information to somebody else. That is the rule right now. They gather information about your children. They have it. If they want to sell it, they have to get your permission. You have to check a box. Yes, take all of the information on my child's computer, and sell it. Sell it to people out there who want to know about my child.  That is the rule today. What they will say, as we vote tomorrow at noontime, is no more permission from the parents--none, zero, zilch.  You are on your own, kids.  Sorry, parents. The Republican Senate decided you don't keep those protections. Why? Because it is a light touch. People really do not care about privacy in the modern era. It is kind of like--privacy? Get over it. You don't have any. Get over it. Get over it, say the You don't have any privacy.  Now we are going to hear them shedding crocodile tears about all of the electronic hacking that goes on in the United But do you know that all of that combined is not even a thimble compared to the compromise of the privacy of 320 million Americans that is going to be possible after this rule is repealed tomorrow? It is the rule that gives American families the right to say: No, I don't want you gathering that information about my children. No, I don't want you to sell information about my children. That is gone. That is the vote the Republicans will cast tomorrow. The die is cast. They are all going to do it.  It is unbelievable to me that, in one generation, we have gone from people not letting the salesman into the living room to allowing one company to come in and gather every bit of information about every member of the family who is online all day long. It is amazing to me.  Do you want to know what I believe? I believe I have the same values that my grandmother had. I believe I have the same values as my mother had. I don't want anyone coming into my living room. My mother didn't want anyone coming into the living room. My grandmother didn't want anyone coming into the living room, and I am sure my great-grandmother in Ireland didn't want anyone coming into the living room to whom they did not give permission to come into the living room, especially when the kids were at home, but that is not the Republican view. The Republican view is: Oh, the big broadband barons don't like it? That is great. That is fine.  What is next? Think about it. They can get the information about when all of your family members are online, where they went, who they were talking to, who they emailed. All of it is available to the broadband company. It is just a product to be sold to the highest bidder.  Who wants this information out there? You can make billions of dollars by selling this information to other companies that would love to data mine your family so that they can profile your kids, profile grandma--profile anybody in your family--just so they can start to send in information and try to sell you stuff.  Do we really want people to be able to sell this as a product? The privacy of America is for sale. Is that what we have reached--that we are monetizing privacy?  We are saying: Hey, we are just getting in the way of the entrepreneurial spirit of Do you know what? For our whole history, we have gotten in the way of the entrepreneurial spirit of The salesman knocks on the door, and you tell the salesman: Go away. You are not getting into our living room, Mr.We don't want you in our living room.  So there are two sides to this. Yes, you want the entrepreneurial spirit to thrive, but, simultaneously, you should have a right to say: No, Mr.I don't want your product. I don't want you in my living room. I don't want you to have access to all of the information of my children. Sorry, Mr.I am sure you could have made a fortune, but the fortune comes at too high of a price.  Ultimately, the founding principles of our society are that, yes, we are capitalists, but we are capitalists with a conscience. We understand that there should be limits to how far you can go in making a buck. There should be a limitation.  What the Grand Old Party wants to do is to roll back the broadband privacy rules that give you an ability, if you want, to say yes. You can just click and say yes to all of these companies. Take all of my information. Take all of grandma's information. Take all of the kids' information. You can just check that and say yes. That is in the law. Do you want to give up all of your privacy? Push ``yes.'' Yet, under the existing law, you can also push ``no.'' I don't want to give up my privacy. It should be the consumer's choice. It shouldn't be Big Congress's and Big Government's.  Big Government is now deciding you have no privacy. The government is moving in. Replacing Big Mother and Big Father is Big Big Government is siding with Big Business and Big That is what is happening here today, and it is leaving behind Big Mother and Big Father, who care about their kids. They are taking away the authority that parents have had since the beginning of time up until now.  The broadband revolution now makes it possible to monetize privacy--to make money, to give entrepreneurs a chance through light touch regulation--which will create more jobs out there. Jobs for whom? Jobs for people who are learning about your kids, jobs for people who are learning about how to make money off of your kids, jobs for people who do not care about your kids. They care only about making a few more bucks.  How hard is this? Which business school do you have to go to to have a 3-by-5 card to figure this out? It is pretty simple, huh?  What is the job of the Senate? The job of the Senate is to ensure that we animate these technologies with human values, that we say to the inventor, to the entrepreneur: Oh, I love that whole idea of an automobile; that is fantastic. But do you know what? Why don't you build in some brakes? We are going to put up speed limits. We are going to have seatbelts. We are not going to allow you just to put it out on the road and just endanger the public or the passengers. We are going to have some rules.  It is great. Yes, invent that new medicine, but we are also going to say to you: Hey, do you know what? We are going to have a child's safety cap on top of that medicine so a kid cannot get access to it.  We balance it. We animate each new technology with the values that our parents had and that our grandparents brought from the old country. It does not change. It is always the same. The polling is 80 percent--Democrat, Republican, Independent, every ethnic group, every income group.  Do you know who does not like the rules? Entrepreneurs--entrepreneurs who want to monetize your privacy.  But it is always going to be at 80 percent, because what is, really, the differentiating issue? Why would a Republican mother want her kids to have their privacy compromised? You know that she does not. You know she does not. She doesn't even know that this debate is going on. She doesn't even know that, after they repeal this rule, it will be the Wild  So there are real rules. Again, it is the most important set of rules because it is the broadband provider. They get every bit of information. This is not just: Oh, I subscribed to this newspaper, and I am reading this newspaper. Oh, I am at Oh, I am[[Page S1938]]over here at ESPN sports. Oh, oh, oh. There are hundreds of thousands of websites, and that website knows only about what you did on that website. No, that is not what the broadband company knows. They know everything. They know everywhere you went. That is why they want this repealed. Just think of how valuable that is. Just think of how much money they can make by selling all of that information about you and your family.  That is what we are debating tonight. We are debating a fundamental change in our country. Is it a heavy touch as opposed to a light touch to say that people's privacy--that the security of their families--should be protected? Then let's just shut down these hearings we are having and all of the crocodile tears being shed about what is happening in our society.  How can all of this happen?  We go into top secret briefings. We get told: Oh, they tapped into this. They cracked into that. People--Senators--sit there, and they ``tsk, tsk'' as to how terrible it is. Then, simultaneously, up here on the Senate floor, they say: Oh, by the way, we are just going to take away the right of a mother and father to say, ``No, you cannot crack into the information that our family is putting online.'' Oh, sure. You don't want to get into the way of an entrepreneur who can figure out how to make money off of that. Why would we care about that?  The absurdity of it all--the total absurdity of it all--is that all of these people who are ``entrepreneurs'' can get fabulously rich without compromising children's privacy, grandma's privacy.  For somebody in the family who has a disease and just wants to go to that website and find out about that disease all by himself and who does not want anybody else in the family to know, why can't he do that without wondering whether everyone else who went that website is now going to have that information sold? The phone company or the cable company will say: Oh, great. Let's go find the insurance company that is in this region that would want to know that that person might have that disease. You might not want to give him insurance, especially after the Affordable Care Act is repealed by the  Who cares about that, right? You have no privacy. Get over it, say the Get over it.  Just think if we applied that to phone calls. What if people said the phone company should be able to sell the number of the person and the name of the person whom you called? How would you feel about that? Would you like that to be a product? You called this person at this time for a half an hour. Then you called that person back again another half an hour later. Then you called him again at night. Would you like people to know that--just as a product--and get the name, the number, the time, and how long the call lasted? We have laws against that.  Would you like people to know which channels you are switching to? Say you have a satellite dish and are switching from channel to channel, and at 11 o'clock at night, you are just going to stop on this channel. They know which channel you stopped on.  I passed a law back in 1999 that prohibits that information of which channel you stop on from ever being made public. You cannot sell that information. I am proud of that. Whose business is that? But it is there. They have it. They have that information.  Now we have reached a broadband revolution. Oh, isn't this great? Isn't this a fantastic revolution? Didn't it occur because there was a light touch? No, there was not a light touch. You see, we deregulated the telephone industry and the cable industry so that we could have the broadband revolution beginning in 1996.  But here is the paradox of deregulation. The paradox of deregulation is that you need more regulations in order to make sure that the competing companies can gain access to the capital markets to raise the money so as to finally put pressure on the telephone and cable companies to deploy broadband. That is the paradox of deregulation. You need more, so you open it up to more competitors who then wind up forcing these companies to finally deploy broadband even though they had it decades beforehand. Interesting, isn't it? It is the paradox of deregulation. You need more.  Even as we did that, we knew that we were going to need privacy laws because this aggregation of information is something that goes right to the heart of this kind of tension that exists in a capitalist society.  Some people say: No rules. You are interfering with my ability to make money.  That is what the car company said about airbags, and that is what the car company said about seatbelts: Do not mandate to have us put it in as it is going to undermine our product.  But, over time, mothers and fathers finally said: No, no, no. You cannot do that. I don't want the kids in the front seat with no seatbelts. I don't want people in our family in the backseat with no seatbelts.  The same thing is true with safety device after safety device. So privacy plays that role when we are talking about information.  Now, if the first step is broadband, no privacy, then, logically, they should support the whole idea that if you are on your iPhone and you have called 50 people today, it is a product. So all of those people you called should be information the telephone company can sell. What would the argument be from the other side? The other side would say, that is a light touch. That is a light touch. It is going to make it possible for the phone company to make more money. And believe me, they would make a lot of money if they could sell the information about who every American called all day long.  Well, they don't want to touch that because phones are still kind of sensitive. They don't want to go there. But broadband, that is different. Websites, that is different. For some reason, that is different because what you are doing on the website, what you are doing with your email in the modern era is what you do on your phone every day, right? It is what you do on your phone. So the goal has to be that we have the accountability for the Republicans as we do this, this evening.  President Trump is constantly railing about the fake violations of his privacy--totally fake violations of his privacy. You would think that a crime had been committed, but there wasn't. It never happened. But the way he yells about it, it is almost un-American for anyone to compromise the privacy of him or anybody else. But these are going to be very real compromises of the privacy of ordinary people in our country.  So I am just going to give to my colleagues the little Constitution that is now on the books to provide protections for all It is very simple. It requires the broadband company to, 1, get consumer consent before using or sharing subscribers' personal information--get your consent--2, promote transparency by saying to the broadband company that they have to tell each consumer that they are actually collecting this information about them. They have to constantly be telling you that. 3 is to ensure that the broadband companies adopt data security protections and notify consumers if a breach occurs; that is, if all of this information is now wide open for God knows who--some hacker who has gained information--they have to put in the toughest possible security. Then, if it does get compromised, they have to tell the consumers immediately. They can't delay a month because it might be bad PR, 2 months because they are afraid it is going to affect their bottom line. They have to let people know that their personal information has been compromised.  So that is it. That is what is bugging them. That is what is bugging the They want to make sure you don't keep these protections.  So what does that mean? Well, after we vote tomorrow, after the Republicans take these rules, these protections off the books, after the internet service providers, or the ISPs, get what they want, ISP will no longer stand for ``internet service provider.'' It is going to stand for ``information sold for profit.'' It is going to stand for ``invading subscriber privacy.'' That is what ISP will stand for after tomorrow at noontime, high noon--the end of privacy online, except for a light touch where it is voluntary. And we know these broadband companies are definitely voluntarily going to give the highest possible protections to American families. We know that. Because if they wanted the highest possible protections, they have them right now. They[[Page S1939]]want them off the books so they don't have to do anything. It will be voluntary.  So these broadband behemoths want to take control away from the subscribers and relentlessly collect and sell your sensitive information without permission. It could be about your health, about your finances, about your children. It can track your location, draw a map of where you shop, where you work, where you eat, where your children go to school, and then sell that information to data brokers.  That is going to be an incredibly profitable industry that the Republicans are opening up this week. Right now, they are drafting up their business plans, just a 3-by-5 card all across the country. They have already basically decided that the Republicans are going to have these votes; so let's get on with these new rules.  The broadband industry says that they are an unnecessary burden, but, in fact, this whole area is one that actually goes to the heart of who we are as I think that whether you are a very conservative person or a very liberal person, there should be a small core number of American values that brings us together, and I would put privacy in that group. We can fight over the Affordable Care We can fight over how many new nuclear weapons we need. We can fight over gay marriage. We can fight over many, many issues--some of them religious, some of them just strategic in terms of what is best for our country moving forward--but how can we fight over your family's privacy? I don't understand the ideological differentiation that is artificially being created by the broadband companies' insisting that the Republicans repeal those privacy laws because all of this is now going to be done without your consent, without your permission.  If they wanted to document now how many times you search online for heart disease, breast cancer, opioid addiction treatments, and then sell that information to an insurance company, they are going to be able to do that. You are giving them permission just by subscribing. And you know what they say: Oh, the marketplace will work; you can just go to the other broadband providers in town. Oh, there is no other broadband provider in town? You are in rural America? Oh, sorry, you have to use our company. Oh, there are no rules if you want to use our company--no rules.  They will say: Well, let the marketplace sort it out. What marketplace? Maximum, in most places, there are two companies you can have broadband service from, and they are both going to say privacy protection is voluntary. So there is no privacy. It is all going to happen without your consent, and they will just say: Oh, it is just so we can harmonize the rules. Yes, they are going to harmonize the rules. They are going to harmonize them so it is very efficient. You have the same nonexistent voluntary guidelines that the broadband companies are going to put on the books.  So you should want to choose, yourself, what information Verizon--if it discloses information about your family--gets to disclose. You should decide that, not You should decide that. What they really want is to allow AT&T to choose whether it protects consumers' sensitive information from breaches and unauthorized use, and guess what the broadband barons' choice is going to be? They are going to choose to pocket their profits and throw your privacy out the door.  Republicans want to sideline the Federal Communications Commission--our broadband privacy cop on the beat--and create an unregulated Wild West where internet providers can do whatever they want with your private information. They want to allow broadband companies to write their own privacy rules. That is like asking a burglar to program your security system. It makes no sense. Oh, come on in, Mr.Burglar, program my security system, and then you can do whatever you want in my living room when I am gone on vacation this weekend. Just take anything you want--any of my private information, any of my private furniture, anything you like in the house.  So we know the broadband industry--your wireless, your cable, your telecommunications provider. They can't self-regulate themselves. These same companies struggle to show up on time to install or to fix your service. You might have to wait all day to have the cable guy come and fix your cable system. They give you a range that goes like this: Well, we will be there between 9 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon; right? And now they are saying: You can trust us. We are going to protect your privacy. You know we are the cable company. You know we are the broadband company. You can trust us.  Do we really trust the broadband industry to determine what privacy protections they give to their customers? Strong broadband privacy rules mean that we don't have to do anything. That is their definition. Let's be clear. The big broadband barons want to monetize this. The subscribers have already given them money. It costs a lot of money to subscribe to broadband service so the kids can have a 50-inch screen that is plugged in to be able to see all of these things that are on the incredible multidimensional, multifunctional screens. We are already paying a fortune for it. But they say that is not enough. That is not enough. We need, say the broadband companies, to ensure that we can also make more money, and then taking all that information by invading your privacy and selling it. Broadband providers want to do more than simply provide Americans access to the internet. They want to sell that privacy information to the highest bidder.  This brings us to the great divide between ISPs and those who wish to protect the free and the open internet. The 21st century broadband internet is not a luxury. It is an essential telecommunications service, just like telephone service. Just as telephone companies cannot sell information about Americans' phone calls, an internet service provider should not be allowed to sell sensitive consumer information without affirmative consent of that family.  In fact, by putting the broadband privacy rules on the books, the FCC did harmonize privacy protections. They harmonized broadband privacy protections with the privacy framework that has prevented telephone companies from mining and selling information about our phone conversations for decades. Yes, that is what they did at the They said: the same protections for broadband information as we have for phone company information when you are dialing the numbers of people all day long. That is how they harmonized it. They said that in the 21st century, broadband is the essential service that the phone was in the 20th century, and the information on both should be given the same level of protection. That is harmonization. That is a reflection of the revolution that took place in telecommunications in the 1996 Telecommunications That is what they are trying to take off the books--the harmonization of the standards that go back to grandma and grandpa. They made sure in 1934, when the Communications Act was written, that those protections were there. But, somehow or other, in 2017, it is no longer important that people don't know whom you called, that people don't know whom you are online interacting with.  So why did they do it? Well, they did it because broadband and telephone services are essential telecommunications services that Americans rely upon to thrive in the modern economy. The Federal Communications Commission, last year, under Barack Obama, just made sure that you got the same privacy protections. Broadband and telephone companies should not be allowed to exploit their privileged positions as telecom gatekeepers to use, to share, to sell sensitive information about Americans' online activities or phone calls. Yet, here we are, chipping away fundamental broadband privacy protections from the American public.  Now, all of this begs the question: What other privacy protections are the Republicans now going to put on the chopping block? Do they now oppose the FCC's rules preventing telephone companies from collecting, using, and selling sensitive information about Americans' phone calls? They certainly oppose the FCC's rules for preventing broadband companies from partaking in similar interests and practices.  Now, the broadband industry will tell us that these rules are unfair because they are different from the privacy[[Page S1940]]rules for websites--Google, Why should there be different rules? Well, every person out there knows what the difference between Google and the broadband provider is. Google is one app; it is not thousands of apps. So the whole argument is fallacious from the get-go. When you use Google, you understand what your relationship is with When you use ESPN.com, you know what the relationship is with ESPN.com. But when you are using every service, now you are talking about the broadband companies. They are the only ones that know everything about you, what you are doing online, all day long, every single day. That is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, following along their supervision of the telephone industry, which they have had rules on the books to ensure that information can't be sold without your permission.  Why is this so important? It is important because in the 21st century, having broadband service is like having oxygen in your lungs. Everyone uses it. Everyone is using it all day long. Everyone's information is in the hands of these companies. People might as well stop breathing as to disconnect from their broadband provider. That is why we need strong rules--not self-regulation--to prevent the internet service providers from mining and selling our data without consent.  This is, for me, a historic fight to defend America's fundamental right to privacy. The broadband industry will say that if we don't take these rules off the books, subscribers will be confused. There will be one set of standards for the individual website and another set of standards for the entire broadband internet service provider industry. Frankly, consumers are only more confused about why we aren't doing more to tackle these important privacy issues. Consumers are confused about why we are spending time on the Senate floor taking away privacy protections. Consumers are confused about why we would allow broadband companies to sell their sensitive information to banks, to insurance companies, to advertisers, to anyone else willing to pay top dollar for your personal information without your consent. They are confused about why we would rescind the rules ensuring broadband providers adhere to the best data security practices protecting subscribers' sensitive information from breaches and unauthorized use, when we know there are unauthorized hacks every single day. We are in a historic fight to defend America's fundamental right to privacy online, a fight to allow consumers, innovators, entrepreneurs, the millions of Americans all across this country who rely upon the internet to control their own information.  Instead of protecting our healthcare, instead of protecting our environment and protecting our privacy, Republicans want to give it all away to their friends and allies and big corporations. Those corporations don't care about consumer rights. They have one concern, and one concern only, and that is their bottom line. That is making money.  The cornerstone of our country is capitalism with a conscience--with a conscience. Massachusetts' unemployment rate is 3.2 percent. We are proud of that. We are a capitalist Massachusetts is proud to have one of the lowest unemployment rates in our country. We believe in capitalism, but we also believe we can have capitalism with a conscience. In this instance, it means the protection of the privacy of people online, from having that family's sacred, secret information compromised for a profit, with no ability--no ability, no right, none--for a family to say no. Take the broadband service or leave it. If you take it, you have no privacy.  The only people in this country who can protect those families are 100 Senators who will be voting tomorrow. I ask the Republican Senators, why would they strip this privacy protection from ordinary families? Why would they deny the right? All I can say is, overnight, all we can really say is we tried. We really tried to protect the privacy of That vote tomorrow will represent that showdown moment.  If we lose, please, out of good conscience, Republicans, just stop all this public concern about the compromise, the privacy, the President, the national security apparatus in our country. Believe me, the ordinary American is going to be made far more vulnerable tomorrow than anything any Russian entity is ever going to do. It is going to be what we did to ourselves, what we allowed to happen to our own citizens at the hands of their own United States Senate that is going to be a far greater threat to every ordinary family in our country.  I urge a ``no'' vote from my fellow colleagues on the Senate floor tomorrow. This goes right to the heart of whether we understand technology, we understand the responsibility we have for the American people, to protect them from the worst aspects of it.  There is a Dickensian quality to the internet: It is the best of technologies, and it is the worst of technologies, simultaneously. This technology can enable. It can ennoble. We want that to be extracted from the internet. But it can also degrade. It can also debase. It is the job of the U.Senate to protect the American people from that aspect of the internet. Tomorrow, if the Republicans have their way, they will remove the protections of the privacy of Americans and allow for an expansion of the degrading and the debasing of the privacy that ordinary Americans are entitled to in our country.  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the opportunity to be here.

1616,topic-id,1537,"Mr.President, today, we are truly in a historic fight, a fight to protect one of the most treasured and revered American values--our right to privacy. Make no mistake, our privacy has never been more in danger, and the American public knows it.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when a smart TV can listen to its most intimate living room conversations--your conversations with your children, with your parents, with your spouse.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when it seems that every day there is a hack on the databases of one of our country's largest companies--Yahoo!, Target, Home Depot, JPMorgan  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when the Russian surveillance machine--firing on all cylinders--hacks the U.election, threatening to undermine our sacred democratic system.  The American public knows its privacy is in danger when both Chambers of Congress hold countless hearings, launch investigations, and receive briefings on the rapidly growing cybersecurity threat to our Nation and the impact both on our national security and to the public.  The American public wants us to do more to protect its privacy. The American public wants us to do more to protect its sensitive information. Yet what do the Republicans in Congress want to do today on the Senate floor? They want to make it easier for Americans' sensitive information to be used, shared, and sold without their permission.  Today, the Republicans are seeking a vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution that would allow Comcast, Verizon, Charter, AT&T, and other broadband companies to take control away from consumers and relentlessly collect and sell their sensitive information without the consent of that family.  That is sensitive information about your health, about your finances, even about your children. They want to track your location and draw a map of where you shop, where you work, where you eat, where your children go to school, and then sell that information to data brokers or anyone else who wants to make a profit off of you.  They want to document how many times you search online for heart disease, breast cancer, opioid addiction treatments, or AIDS treatment, and then sell that information to your insurance company. They want to know what games your teenagers play or shows they watch so they can then target ads to your family--and all of this done without your consent.  What the Republicans are bringing to the floor today is going to basically change the definition of ``ISP''--internet service provider--to ``information sold for profit.'' It will stand for ``invading subscriber privacy.''  President Trump, himself, is outraged about fake violations of his own privacy, but we should all be alarmed by this very real violation of privacy that will occur today if the Senate decides to roll back these important consumer protections.  Here on the Senate floor, the Republicans are fighting to make it easier for your broadband provider to use and sell that same type of information--remarkably detailed and sensitive dossiers of information about you, your kids, your parents, your grandparents--320 million  The Republicans are trying to rescind the Federal Communications Commission's broadband privacy rules, which simply require your cable, wireless, or telephone company provider to obtain consumer consent before using or sharing subscribers' personal information; promote transparency by disclosing what they collect about internet and wireless users; and adopt data security protections and notify consumers if a breach occurs.  That is it. That is what this whole debate is all about--whether consumers, not the broadband providers, have control over their sensitive information.  The big broadband companies and their Republican allies say we need a light touch regulatory framework to protect Americans' broadband privacy--a light touch approach, like with the Federal Trade Commission, which does not prescribe actual privacy rules. The Federal Trade Commission only enforces the privacy policies companies create for themselves, and then they bring an enforcement action if a company violates its own very low standards, but if Comcast's or AT&T's or Verizon's policy is that you have no privacy, there is nothing for anyone to enforce. It would be impossible for the internet service provider to violate its own nonexistent or very low privacy protections.  Let's be clear here. When the broadband behemoths say ``light touch,'' they mean ``hands off.'' They mean hands off their ability to monetize captive consumers' sensitive information.  Let's be clear. When the big broadband barons and their Republican allies are firing their opening salvo in the war on net neutrality, they want broadband privacy protections to be the first victim.  When Republicans say we need to harmonize regulations, they really mean self-regulation. Self-regulation is the ultimate dream of the Republicans, who are beholden to those special interests. They really want to allow broadband companies to write their own privacy rules.  Is this really what the American public wants--a harmonized, light-touch approach to protecting their sensitive information from their broadband providers? Does the American public really want us to allow our broadband companies to ignore reasonable data security practices, making consumers' sensitive information more vulnerable to breaches and unauthorized access?  This resolution does just that. The internet service providers even oppose[[Page S1948]]following reasonable data security practices.  We should know better. The American public wants us to strengthen our privacy protections, not weaken them. The American people do not want their sensitive information collected, used, and sold by any third party, whether that be your broadband provider or a hacker.  At its core, this debate is about our values--our values as a people, our values as a society. While technology has certainly changed, our core values have not changed as a country. For generations, we have valued the right to choose whom we let into our homes, whom we communicate with, whom we share our most sensitive secrets with, but now the Republicans and the broadband industry are telling us that we must forgo those rights just because our homes are connected to the internet and our phones are connected to the internet.  With many Americans across the country having only a couple of broadband providers, at most, to choose from, they will not have the option of changing service providers if their privacy protections are not transparent or robust. And throughout it all, while the internet service providers monetize your personal information, the monthly bill will continue to show up for the service that is siphoning off your sensitive information.  My colleagues, we know the attack on the free and open internet is coming. Net neutrality is on the chopping block, and this is the first step in ensuring that the few and the powerful control the internet. We must stop this today, so I urge my colleagues to join with me.  The fundamental principle here is that every person should have the knowledge that information is being gathered about their families when they use the internet; second, that they have notice from the company that that information is going to be resold to a third party, to someone else, not to the broadband company; and third, that you have the right to say no, that you do not want that information about your family member to be resold.  When we were all younger and the salesman came to the front door and knocked, your mother told you to tell the salesman that they could not come into the house because the privacy of your family did not warrant allowing a stranger into your home. The broadband companies now say: Well, we are in your home, and we are wired in every room, and we now have the right to take all of the information of your family and sell it. What sites do your children go on? What sites do you go on to look for help for the disease that someone in your family might have?  Now the broadband companies say they are coming right through the front door. They are going into every room in your house. The American people have the right to say what they have always said: No, you cannot take those secrets of our family. You cannot take how we use that information.  So this vote that we are about to take in the next couple of hours on the Senate floor goes right to the heart of who we are.  We now hear more about the Russians, and we hear more about companies whose information has been hacked. Then the Republicans are crying their crocodile tears about the compromise of privacy of people in our country, and then they come to the floor and take all of the information online in the family and allow it to be sold as a product. That is just fundamentally wrong. It goes contrary to the values of our country.  I urge very strongly a ``no'' vote from the Members of the Just remember: This is the privacy vote of all time on the Senate floor--of all time--because there has never been anything like the internet going into our homes. No one should be allowed to take all of that information and just sell it without getting their permission.  Mr.President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution.  I yield the floor.

1682,topic-id,1574,"Mr.President, I rise to speak again today about the epidemic of deadly, illicit fentanyl plaguing our Nation and how, through bipartisan legislation I have introduced today, we can help to stop this dangerous opioid from flowing into our country from abroad.  I want to start by providing some basic information about fentanyl. What[[Page S1976]]is fentanyl? Well, fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be misused, the current fentanyl epidemic in our country is being fueled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and illicit versions of chemically similar compounds known as fentanyl analogs.  Fentanyl, in its powder form, is often mixed with other illegal drugs like heroin or it is disguised in pill form to resemble an opioid painkiller like Many drug users overdose on fentanyl because they have no idea it is cut into whatever substance they are injecting or whatever pills they are swallowing. They simply do not realize just how deadly fentanyl is.  In fact, just a few salt-size grains of fentanyl can kill an adult. Where does illicit fentanyl come from? According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Mexico is the primary source for illicit fentanyl trafficked into the United Distributors in China are the principal source of the precursor chemicals, the chemical building blocks used to manufacture fentanyl in Mexico and elsewhere.  China is also a source of finished product illicit fentanyl coming into the United Why is illicit fentanyl trafficking increasing? Well, we are in the midst of an opioid epidemic that has begun with the overprescription and resulting abuse of prescription opioids like When users found those pills too expensive to sustain their addiction, they turned to cheaper heroin.  Now they are turning to even cheaper and more powerful fentanyl, which has become an extremely lucrative product for drug dealers and drug cartels. According to the DEA, a kilogram of heroin can be purchased from Colombia for about $6,000 and then sold on the wholesale drug market for $80,000--purchased for 6,000, sold for $80,000. By comparison, a kilogram of pure fentanyl can be purchased from China for less than $5,000 and then sold on the market for $80,000 as well.  Because it is so potent that 1 kilogram of fentanyl can be cut with agents like talcum powder or caffeine, resulting in 24 kilograms of product to be sold, that means that one $5,000 kilogram of fentanyl actually reaps a whopping profit in the neighborhood of $1.6 million.  What has been the impact of the fentanyl epidemic on the United States? Well, the DEA is so concerned about fentanyl that in March of 2015, it issued a nationwide alert that highlighted the drug as a threat to health and public safety. Between 2014 and 2015, overdose deaths in the United States from synthetic opioids, principally illicit fentanyl, increased 72 percent.  In 2015, there were more than 9,500 such overdose deaths in the United Last year, it is estimated that my home State of Massachusetts suffered more than 2,000 opioid-related overdose deaths, largely fueled by the deadly rise of illicit fentanyl. In fact, Massachusetts ranked second notionally per capita in synthetic opioid deaths, which includes fentanyl, with the number of deaths between 2014 and 2015 increasing by 109 percent.  Massachusetts authorities are now finding fentanyl in 74 percent of the State's opioid overdose deaths. If those figures hold up, that means last year there will have been roughly 1,500 fentanyl-related deaths in Massachusetts in 2016. If the fentanyl epidemic were to hit the entire Nation as hard as it is hitting Massachusetts, the country would lose almost 75,000 people each year to fentanyl. Think about that. Those are more deaths than the United States suffered in the entire Vietnam war.  Fentanyl is the Godzilla of opioids. It will overrun communities and lay them to waste, unless we take action now to stop it. So how do we stop it? There is no easy solution to a crisis caused by a drug that is so small, so powerful, so profitable that those who traffic in it just want to make money, but we know we must act.  First, we need to raise awareness of the dire threat fentanyl poses to our We need to educate the public about it. We need to elevate the issues to the highest levels of our government and the governments of the countries from which it comes. To help with that effort, last week, the Senate adopted a bipartisan sense of the Senate resolution on fentanyl trafficking that I introduced with Senator Rubio from I thank him for his partnership on that resolution. I thank Senators Toomey, Shaheen, King, Johnson, and Nelson for adding their support.  The resolution calls on our government to use its broad diplomatic and law enforcement resources in partnership with Mexico and China to disrupt the trafficking of fentanyl. We are seeing the signs of some progress. In October of 2015, China added 116 synthetic chemicals, including 6 fentanyl products, to its list of controlled chemical substances. In February of 2017, China agreed to make carfentanil, a powerful fentanyl analogue, and three other fentanyl analogues illegal.  Earlier this month, I led a group of 10 Senators in urging Secretary of State Tillerson to secure the votes of the 53 member nations of the U.Commission on Narcotic Drugs in favor of the scheduling of the fentanyl precursors. Last week, the Commission voted unanimously in favor of controlling these substances. This international cooperation is expected to yield meaningful dividends in the fight against illicit fentanyl.  Fentanyl will require us to build bridges to our international partners, not walls. Indeed, I recently visited Mexico, where I met with law enforcement officials at the border, on the front lines of the smuggling and trafficking of narcotics into the United That is why today, Senators Rubio, Brown, Capito, and I introduced legislation to help this front line of drug detection at the border. It is called the INTERDICT It provides badly needed high-tech equipment and other resources to U.Customs and Border Protection to help it detect and interdict illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United  Here is how it works. There are two principal ways drugs like fentanyl are trafficked into the United First, coming from Mexico, they are smuggled across the southwest border of the United They are hidden in vehicles, beneath false floors, behind hidden compartments, and elsewhere. The drugs are also carried into the United States by people, sometimes hidden in the hollowed-out heels of their shoes.  Second, illegal fentanyl is also purchased online from overseas vendors in China and elsewhere--often on the dark web--and then shipped to Mexico or directly to the United States through the mail or express consignment carriers.  Fentanyl shipped this way is often concealed inside legitimate goods, with fentanyl suppliers using various methods to mislabel shipments. For example, some conceal the powder in those small silica packages that say ``do not eat'' placed alongside everyday items. Others gift wrap shipments or label them as household products like laundry detergent to avoid detection.  Customs and Border Protection has many different methods it uses to find contraband being smuggled into the United States at the border or through the mail. These include drug-sniffing dogs, various kinds of scanners, fiber-optic scopes, and physical searches. When Customs and Border Protection finds a suspicious substance using those and other methods, it has had success identifying it as an illicit drug like fentanyl with the help of high-tech, handheld chemical screening devices.  So anytime Customs and Border Protection finds a suspicious powder, pill, or liquid, it can use a handheld device--really something that looks and feels like a Nintendo Game Boy--to conduct a test, in the field, with real-time results. That means narcotics like illicit fentanyl can be detected, identified, and seized quickly and on the spot. Those rapid results provide vital information for law enforcement officers to continue their investigation and, if appropriate, proceed with seizure and arrest. Not only does the use of this technology disrupt the flow of the drugs into the country, it protects the health and safety of law enforcement officials from exposure to dangerous substances like illicit fentanyl.  Often, Border Patrol agents don't know what the powdery substance they have uncovered is and whether it poses a threat to them. That is especially alarming with illicit fentanyl, given its strength.[[Page S1977]]  Exposure to a small amount by contact with the skin or through inhalation can be fatal. Increased use of these high-tech devices will provide important protections for our law enforcement officers on the front lines. The INTERDICT Act also provides for additional equipment back in Customs and Border Protection laboratories, including more scientists who analyze and interpret test results.  The INTERDICT Act ensures that Customs and Border Patrol will have hundreds of additional portable chemical screening devices available at international ports of entry and mail and express consignment facilities and additional equipment and personnel available in their laboratories so that they can provide support during all operational hours.  Again, I thank Senator Rubio, Senator Brown, and Senator Capito for working together on a bipartisan basis so we can give these additional tools to fight this fentanyl epidemic. I urge all my colleagues to support this bill to fight the scourge of illicit drugs. It knows no political, geographic, or socioeconomic boundaries. It is the epidemic of our time.

I am not sure how many of you grew up without power steering in your vehicles, but if you know anything about the lack of power steering--and I think back to the tractors I drove growing up, and that tractor, you could not turn that wheel until you started the tractor moving--or if you had a Ford truck or a Dodge truck or a Chevy truck and it didn't have power steering, you couldn't turn that truck until it started moving.

Unfortunately, ObamaCare has failed. When this first came about, I was so excited. I was hoping that this would be a healthcare bill that would work. But, unfortunately, it is true that this healthcare bill is dying very quickly.  One-third of counties across this country no longer have a provider to take care of the exchange.

And I want to make sure these people are at the front of the Medicaid line rather than at the end of the line.  This country cannot afford to give Medicaid to able-bodied We need to prioritize the dollars that we have for those that need it the most.

There are going to be more steps.  I have complete faith in Tom Price, our new HHS Secretary, that he will be deregulating health care, which is the most regulated business in the country right now. Give Price 60, 90 days to deregulate medicine and start encouraging competition, and we will start bending this cost curve downward.  We need to empower free markets. We need to empower States to have more local control. We are expanding healthcare savings accounts, but there are many more things we need to do. This is just the start of healthcare reform.  This is the first chapter of a new book on healthcare reform. There are many more chapters to go. I cannot wait to improve health care, to improve quality and start driving the cost curve downward.

I believe that there is absolutely nothing that is common sense about preventing those who defend America from having the opportunity to defend themselves. There is no common sense in that whatsoever.  I listened to your emotional remarks here, and I listened as you gave zero specifics on the mental illness that my colleague specifically talked about being worried about.  Specifically, what mental illnesses is it that had you concerned?  I would encourage you to have the courage to be specific and say exactly what it is that you mean so that there is no confusion.  Now, the true intent of my remarks today are to talk about my favorite part of going to the VA, and that is sitting next to my fellow veterans when I sit down at one of the clinics at my local VA hospital. Whether it is a marine from Iraq, whether it is a sailor from World War II, a soldier from Vietnam, an airman from Korea, whenever we sit down next to each other, there is a camaraderie that exists immediately.  One of the first things that is said is usually some sort of off-topic joke about the branch that the other person comes from. It is that camaraderie of shared service that unites us in a way that half a century of age can't divide. I can tell you, we have common experiences, and we have common healthcare challenges as well.  It is important for veterans to come together and for the VA to establish and maintain expertise in providing for our unique healthcare needs. Unfortunately, too many VA facilities have lost their hunger to provide care. They have lost the passion to meet the individual needs of veterans, and it has become way too much of a rarity that a veteran's needs are truly met when they enter the VA facility.  You cobble that together with enough bad experiences from underperforming employees, and it forces veterans to ask: Where else can I go for my care?  That is why I am excited to see the House bring forward two bills this week that get at the crux of the matter: authority to hire the best employees and the ability to remove underperforming employees.  Today we will debate the VA Accountability First We will provide the VA Secretary the flexibility to either remove, demote, or suspend an employee for misconduct. It can be very little that is more important to go on at the  Tomorrow we will debate H.1367 that will bolster the Secretary's situational awareness to recruit and retain the very best employees.  You know, when a veteran like myself or my peers goes to the VA, we are not given a choice in our provider. We go there, and they look at a person like me and they say: Your last name is We are going to assign you to Alpha clinic. This is your provider, and there is no choice.

551,topic-id,425,"Mr.Chair, I thank Representative Wenstrup for his thoughtful amendment, and I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for bringing it to the floor today.  Clearly, there are staffing shortages within the Department of Veterans Affairs, and, clearly, something must be done. Personally, I think this legislation is a good first step toward improving the VA's ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit and retain high-quality employees, and onboard new hires.  The amendment I am offering today speaks to the identification of staffing shortages portion of this bill. Under current law, 38 U.S.7412 to be exact, the inspector general of the VA is required to submit a report to the VA Secretary annually highlighting the five personnel occupations with the largest staffing shortages throughout the After receiving this report, the Secretary is then permitted to recruit and directly appoint qualified individuals to fill those vacancies.  Section 2 of the bill before us does something important to current law. It will require the IG to report on not just the five occupations with the largest staffing shortages, it will require the IG to report on the five clinical and five nonclinical occupations with the largest shortages in the Additionally, it will require this reporting to be done for each medical center. Mr.Chair, I think this is a wonderful change, one that is sorely needed.  What my amendment would do is add to this expanded reporting requirement a simple clarification: the IG must report on, at minimum, the five clinical and nonclinical occupations with the largest staffing shortages at each facility. It would allow the IG to report on more than the five occupations with the largest shortages, should his findings require it.  This amendment is not an additional reporting requirement. It simply makes clear that should the IG find additional staffing shortages, he may highlight those so that the Secretary may fill them more quickly. It is a simple attempt to avoid the necessity of passing similar legislation 2, 3, or even 4 years from now.  Our veterans need the care that they have earned and that they deserve. They need it now. The first step in that endeavor is making sure that the VA staffing levels are adequate.  Again, Mr.Chair, I am pleased to see this amendment on the floor today and to do my small part in ensuring that veterans get the care they need. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which would allow the VA inspector general to highlight additional staffing shortages within the  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

His support has been instrumental in ensuring the consideration of this bill, and I am deeply grateful to him.  One hundred years ago, Jeannette Rankin was sworn in as a Member of the United States House of She was the first woman elected to Congress, and was elected before passage of the 19th amendment which granted women the right to vote.  Jeannette Rankin was a trailblazer her entire life. In 1902, she graduated from the University of Montana with a degree in biology. Afterward, she became active in the women's suffrage movement, moving to New York City and assisting in the founding of the New York Women's Suffrage Party and working for the National American Woman Suffrage  Rankin would eventually return to her home State of Montana, and was elected to office in the congressional election of 1916. Upon winning, she declared: ``I may be the first woman Member of Congress, but I won't be the last.''  I am happy to say that she was right.  In recognition of Congresswoman Jeannette Rankin's many accomplishments, and in celebration of the centennial anniversary of her service in Congress, Secretary Zinke and I introduced the 100 Years of Women in Congress  Because Jeannette Rankin was a woman of science more than 100 years before our current push to have more women enter STEM fields, we felt it appropriate to rename the Department of Agriculture's Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program after her.

It will continue to do so in the future, but now it will also recognize the many contributions Jeannette Rankin made to American life.

1429,topic-id,4517,"Mr.President, the most important words in our Constitution are the first three words, ``We the People.'' With those words, our Founding Fathers laid out the vision, the principles, and the foundation for our new Nation's government. It would be, as President Lincoln so eloquently described, ``a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' It would not be a government by and for the privileged. It would not be a government by and for the powerful. It would not be a government by and for the elite, and it certainly would not be an authoritarian government.  I believe it is more important than ever for us to recommit ourselves to that vision, a vision of a nation that measures successes, not at the boardroom table but at the kitchen tables of hard-working Americans across this land, the vision of a nation that derives its power and authority from the people.  In order to do that, we must resist President Trump's dangerous tilt toward authoritarianism. Throughout his candidacy and now within the walls of the White House, President Trump has viciously and repeatedly attacked the media. He has inflamed people's anger toward immigrants, toward religious minorities, toward refugees, and he has undermined or attacked individuals who publicly stand up to him and the shortcomings of his policies. These are four strategies used by authoritarian leaders from time immemorial to consolidate power. These are strategies that are incompatible with our constitutional ``we the people'' construction of government, and we must call out and resist these strategies.  President Trump's authoritarian leanings were there from the beginning. Like many figures throughout history, he rode into office as much on a cult personality as on the merits of his policies. It started with the nicknames and the unrestrained insults, calling opponents crooked and lyin' and phony, calling critics dumb as a rock, incompetent, crazy, or dishonest. He escalated the calls to toss out or hurt protesters at his rallies. At one point, he promised to pay the legal bills of a man arrested for punching a protester at a rally in North Then there were the ``lock her up'' chants that he repeated himself, calling for imprisoning a political opponent. Threatening to throw your opponent in jail if you win is a strategy usually seen only with dictators.  Mr.Trump himself best summed up his populist cult personality when he said at one campaign event: ``I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?'' The scary thought is that he was probably not so far off the mark. This aggressive and unswerving loyalty is a challenge to our ``we the people'' democracy.  Let's take a look at Senior White House Policy Adviser Stephen Miller's declaration on Face the Nation last month. He said: ``Our opponents, the media, and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the President to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.''  That is an interesting statement to make: The President's powers will not be questioned. What a bold, un-American, authoritarian statement to make because here in America, our Nation, our national government, is premised on the concept that we can challenge our leaders. It is not only a privilege, it is a responsibility. Yet Mr.Trump has repeatedly attacked this fundamental American principle and those who exercise it.  Take, for instance, his attack on freedom of the press. Demosthenes, an ancient Greek statesman, orator, and legal scholar of the third century B.once said: ``There is one safeguard known generally to the wise, which is an advantage and security to all, but especially to democracies as against despots--suspicion.''  What Demosthenes was saying is that in a democracy we don't take the statements of our political leaders simply at face value. We test those statements against the facts to find our way to the truth. In the United States, a free and open press is how we exercise that suspicion and find our way to the truth.  Thomas Jefferson believed that. He said: ``Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press.'' Our liberty depends upon the freedom of the press.  Benjamin Franklin echoed that belief when he said: ``Freedom of speech is ever the Symptom as well as the Effect of a good Government.''  John Adams wrote: ``The liberty of the press is essential to the security of the state.'' It is so essential, in fact, that the Founding Fathers enshrined our commitment to a free and open press to the very First Amendment to the Constitution, that ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.'' Yet what we have seen time and again from President Trump is an endless attack against the fourth estate, against the press. He said: ``The media is very unfair. They're very biased.'' He complained on FOX News last  He attacked the New York Times in that same interview, not for the first or last time, saying: ``You look at The New York Times, I mean the fail--I call it `The Failing New York Times.' ''  Apparently any news story critical of the President is now ``fake news.'' He tweeted in February: ``Any negative polls are fake news.''  And when asked about leaks from the intelligence community during last month's press conference in the East Room, he said: ``The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.''  His staff has gotten into the action, too, pushing at one point the Orwellian term, ``alternative facts.'' During an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Kellyanne Conway said: ``Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts,'' and, in the administration, ``we feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there.''  The White House has taken their fight with the media so far as to block access to outlets they disagree with, banning outlets such as CNN, POLITICO, the New York Times, and Los Angeles Times from an off-camera press briefing last month.  But of all of President Trump's relentless attacks against the media, the most disturbing to me was when he tweeted in February: ``The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!''  President Trump, I have a message for you: A free and open press is not the enemy of the American people. A free and open press is the salvation of our democratic It is an essential warrior in our Republic against fake news, charlatans, and those who would use fake news and attacks on the press to advance authoritarian government.  I thought my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, made a very apt analysis when he said that suppressing free speech is how dictators ``get started . . . when you look at history, the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press.'' Senator McCain went on to say: ``If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press.''  So this is a major concern, this attack on the media, and particularly an attack on news organizations that work to vet their reporting before they[[Page S1910]]share it with the American people. In other words, we are in the ironic situation that the very groups under attack by President Trump are the groups that work hardest to get true facts, actual facts, vetted facts, carefully fact-checked information to the American people. That is the foundation for a national dialogue: carefully vetted information so that we know when we read it, it is reliable. That is the type of news we need more of in this  Mr.Trump's authoritarian tactics aren't just limited to his war on the media. His second approach is to attack and scapegoat immigrants, religious minorities, and refugees ever since he stood in the lobby of Trump Tower and said:       When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their      best. . . . They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime.      They're rapists.  Since then President Trump has made it his mission to turn the American people against Mexican immigrants, to make them the enemy. He has talked about the ``bad hombres'' flooding across our southern border, stealing our jobs, committing crimes, and murdering American citizens. In his mind, the people coming from Mexico are all dangerous, violent cartel members transporting an endless supply of drugs across our country in order to ruin But this storyline is completely at odds with the facts. First, drug cartels do not ship their products into our country through the backpacks of immigrants.  Recently I traveled with a congressional delegation to the U.S.-Mexico border to examine this issue. The experts on the border told our delegation that drugs come into the United States through freight, in trucks, and through tunnels--not through backpacks. What this means is that a proposal to build a wall, whether it is 20 feet high or 30 feet high, will be absolutely useless in diminishing the flow of drugs into our country.  I will tell you what else they told us. They said that an end zone defense does not work against drugs. If you want to stop the flow of drugs, you have to work carefully with regard to everything from the moment they are being manufactured or shipped into Mexico until they migrate north. That means you have to work in close cooperation with the security agencies of Mexico, with the police, and with the intelligence agencies of That cooperation requires a very close coordination between respected partners, and disrespecting the partners of Mexico is the best way to damage the ability to intercept drugs that are coming into the United  We also know that the underlying premise of there being a flood of Mexican immigrants coming into our country is false. A 2015 study from the Pew Research Center found that between 2009 and 2014, there was a net outflow of 140,000 Mexican immigrants from the United They were migrating from the United States to Mexico, a net outflow. A more recent Pew Study determined that the number of undocumented Mexican immigrants in America has declined by more than 1 million since 2007. If you take the span during the Obama administration, there was an outflow, not an inflow--the exact opposite of the story line the President is presenting.  What about those violent crimes being committed by undocumented criminals? The data does not support the In fact, the New York Times reported that ``several studies, over many years, have concluded that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.'' Between 1980 and 2010, among men aged 18 to 49, immigrants were one-half to one-fifth as likely to be incarcerated as those born in the United  When you look closer, the attacks on immigrants fall apart, as I have pointed out, but that is what authoritarian leaders do. They create a false enemy, and they use the perception of that enemy to generate hate and fear. They use that hate and fear to consolidate power. It is our responsibility as citizens, as the press in the United States, and as legislators to resist this authoritarian strategy of President  Another of his strategies is to attack religious minorities in our country and abroad. Take for instance his pledge on the campaign trail for a ``total and complete'' shutdown on Muslims entering the United As we know, Mr.Trump followed up on this approach after the election by asking Rudy Giuliani to help fashion a legal Muslim ban.  During a FOX News interview, Mr.Giuliani said:       Trump called me up. He said, Put a commission together.      Show me the right way to do it legally.  To attempt to meet constitutional muster, Trump aimed his ban at immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations.  Rudy Giuliani went on to say in that same FOX News interview:       What we did was we focused on, instead of religion,      danger--the areas of the world that create danger for us,      which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly      legal, perfectly sensible. And that's what the ban is based      on.  But, as William Banks, the director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University, observed, ``Since 9/11, no one has been killed in this country in a terrorist attack by anyone who emigrated from any of the seven countries.''  The President's own Department of Homeland Security recently reported that citizens from the countries listed in the Muslim ban are ``rarely implicated in U.S.-based terrorism.'' In fact, the report concluded that individuals who died in the pursuit of or who were convicted of terrorism were far more likely to be U.S.-born citizens than to be immigrants.  Here is the great irony and the tragedy of President Trump's effort to demonize Muslims: Instead of protecting the United States, he is damaging the security of the United His attacks feed perfectly into and therefore strengthen ISIS's recruiting strategy of claiming that the United States is at war with Video of his speeches and public statements, especially Trump's call for a Muslim ban, has already been featured in ISIS's recruiting tools. In addition, it weakens the Muslim leaders we are seeking to partner with in taking on It undermines those leaders' support from their own countries in their cooperating with the United  Trump's strategy does double damage to American security, and I wish his impact against religious minorities stopped there. I wish it stopped long before there because it is incompatible with the fundamental premise, the fundamental values of the United States of America, which is religious freedom. Yet, throughout the course of his campaign, he gave voice time and again to the views and opinions of White nationalists and anti-He did not directly attack the Jewish community, but his White nationalist rhetoric and actions have had the effect of doing it indirectly. When he needs news or information, he turns to the White nationalist Breitbart News--a fake news source which has infamously attacked American Jews with stories like ``Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew'' and another one that attacked Anne Applebaum of the Washington Post, which read: ``Hell hath no fury like a Polish, Jewish, American elitist scorned.''  But President Trump does not just tap into the Breitbart White nationalist themes; he brought the former executive chair of Breitbart, Steve Bannon, into the White House as his chief strategist and then appointed him to the Principals Committee of the National Security This individual has no business being anywhere near the Capital of the United States and certainly not on the Principals Committee of the National Security Bannon is a man who has not only been embraced by White supremacists for his views, but according to testimony from his ex-wife, he has said he does not want his children going to school with Jewish kids and had once asked a school administrator why there were so many Hanukkah books in the library.  If you think this theme has not had a real effect on our country, you are wrong. When Donald Trump was elected, the KKK and other White nationalist groups celebrated. They felt free to come out of the shadows. They felt bold enough to hold an annual White nationalist conference right here in Washington, DC, at the Ronald Reagan Building, steps from the White House, because they finally felt like they had one of their own in the Oval  These nationalist groups are so emboldened that we have seen more[[Page S1911]]than 100 bomb threats called in to Jewish community centers around the country since We have witnessed the desecration of Jewish headstones in cemeteries in Louis and in  Last month the President, speaking to a roomful of State attorneys general, said he condemned these threats. I applaud him for condemning them. But then he turned around and said: ``You have to be careful, because the reverse could be true.'' What did he mean by that? Commentators have suggested that the President meant by ``the reverse could be true'' that the bomb threats, the Swastika graffiti, and the desecration of Jewish burial sites might actually be the work of Jewish Americans to generate criticism of President There is no evidence of that, and I certainly do not believe it to be true. What I do believe is that a ``blame the victim'' tactic is reprehensible and in itself an anti-Semitic strategy.  The President has also dedicated a significant amount of time to trying to make the country fear refugees, to demonize refugees. Many of us grew up in a world in which Lady Liberty's words of ``give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free'' stirred our hearts because, unless you are 100 percent Native American, you are tied in through your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents, your ancestors. You are tied to those who immigrated to the United States, who came here, often fleeing persecution, often fleeing famine. This Nation gave them a place to stand and in which to build a new life and thrive and hand down a better, stronger nation to their children. That is a property of our history. That is a value deeply rooted in our hearts.  The President, instead, has dedicated his energy to attacking refugees, those, like our ancestors, who came here, fleeing persecution and fleeing famine, especially Syrian refugees, who are fleeing for their lives in search of a safe haven. He has falsely claimed they represent a ``great Trojan horse'' that threatens the safety of Mr.Trump says these victims of war have to be subjected to extreme vetting because we have no idea who these people are or where they come from. The fact is that we do know who they are. We know exactly where they come from because before they can come here as refugees, they already go through extreme vetting. It takes 18 months to 2 years of vetting, on average, before refugees are given tickets to come to the United States of America, and if at any point during that 18 to 24 months something does not add up, they do not get the tickets.  Now, if ISIS or another terrorist organization wants to get people who are dangerous into our country, they do not go through an 18- or a 24-month vetting process. They come on tourist visas or student visas or business visas. Going through the refugee process would be the worst possible way to do it.  As an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute reminded us in October of 2015, of the 784,000 refugees who have been resettled in our country since September 11, 2001, 3 have been arrested for planning terrorist activities. None of them got past the planning phase, and only one of those three was talking about potential attacks here in the United The others were talking about sending money and weapons to al-In other words, no one has been injured by those 784,000 refugees.  These are just some of the pieces of the President's authoritarian strategy to demonize groups, to create hate, to create fear, and to try to consolidate power. As a result of his activities, we have seen waves of hate crimes and violence and bigotry sweep across our  Latino and Latina students in our schools and in our classrooms have been forced to confront classmates' bullying and taunts, chants of ``build the wall'' and ``go back to your country,'' and graffiti sprayed on walls to ``build the wall higher.''  We have heard reports of verbal and physical attacks against people of the Muslim faith.  A woman at San Jose University lost her balance and choked when a man attempted to rip off her head scarf.  A Muslim student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus reported having a knife pulled on her.  A Muslim teacher in Georgia found left on her desk a note that read that a head scarf is not allowed anymore and that she should hang herself with it.  Within the last 8 weeks, four mosques around the country have been burned to the ground.  Just recently, a man in Kansas went into a bar, hurled ethnic slurs at two Indian engineers, and shot them, killing one and seriously injuring the other.  As I mentioned earlier, since January, there have been more than 100 bomb threats against Jewish community centers.  Throughout history, we have seen this tactic used by an executive here, an executive there, by a dictator here, a dictator there, in country after country, to characterize minority communities as a threat to be feared in order to make the body politic afraid, to make them angry, and to make them willing to support authoritarian exercise of power.  What is our job? It is our job to expose this strategy, to call attention to this strategy, to address the myths that are used to instill fear and the falsehoods that are used to instill hatred. It is our job to oppose this authoritarian game plan in every way possible.  The third leg of President Trump's authoritarian attacks are ones that go against public opposition to him and attack the protests of the people of the United What was the President's response after millions of people in cities all around the country--and all around the world, for that matter--joined the women's march to stand up for the fundamental values of peace, tolerance, and equality? His response was a rebuke and a dismissal. He tweeted:       Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression      that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?  Well, President Trump, they did vote, and they all voted overwhelmingly for your opponent, by a 3 million-vote margin.  We saw similarly disparaging responses from Republican lawmakers like the Facebook post from a State Senator in Mississippi who said:       So a group of unhappy liberal women marched in Washington,      D.We shouldn't be surprised; almost all liberal women are      unhappy.  After countless citizens around the country began showing up at townhall meetings to make their voices heard, what was his response? He dismissed these engaged citizens as ``so-called angry crowds,'' and then he tweeted: ``Professional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to make America great again!''  I have held a lot of townhalls since January, many of them filled beyond capacity with regular citizens who are deeply distressed by what they are seeing in our country. At one townhall, more than 3,500 people showed up. We had so many people that the hundreds of folks who couldn't get in had to stand outside the building in the cold, listening. We took a speaker and put it in the window so those outside could hear, and they watched through the windows.  This is ``we the people'' government. This is American citizens saying: Your strategy, President Trump, is not Your strategy to divide us into factions in America and to pit one faction against another, to demonize groups, to incite hate is just wrong.  I find it truly disheartening to see the President attacking citizens exercising their voice, which is often the most basic civic duty.  President Jefferson said there is a mother principle for our government, and the mother principle is that the actions of the government will only reflect the will of the people if each and every citizen has an equal voice. We know, in the modern day of campaign financing, some citizens and, indeed, often some noncitizens--that is, massive rich corporations--have a very loud voice compared to the average citizen. So citizens, to compensate, are saying: We are going to show up. We are going to take our time and our energy and we are going to join together and we are going to send a lot of emails to Capitol Hill, a lot of letters to Capitol Hill, but we are also going to show up in the parks and the streets to[[Page S1912]]march in order to say this strategy, this authoritarian strategy, or this strategy to take away healthcare from millions of Americans is absolutely unacceptable. And the President somehow is living in a fantasy world where he thinks they are paid? I don't think so. I don't think this last weekend, when 800 people showed up at Redmond, OR, to my townhall, that a single one of them was paid--not a single one.  When we look across the country and we see the 7-year-old who wanted to be at a townhall because he doesn't want us to cut funding for PBS in order to build a wall, he wasn't paid, or the Muslim immigrant who risked his life for our Nation in Afghanistan as a military interpreter and now wants to know ``Who is going to save me here,'' he wasn't paid.  American citizens are using their voice as designed in our ``we the people'' Constitution, but in the mind of our President and in the words of his adviser, Stephen Miller, his powers are very substantial and will not be questioned, not even by the citizens and voters of this great  Well, they are being questioned, massively, by citizens raising their voices in every possible way.  American citizens everywhere are deeply disturbed by what they are seeing unfold in our They fear we are headed down a dark and dangerous path that will betray the founding principles of our ``we the people'' government, and they have every right to be anxious and concerned.  There have been allusions made by a number of experts to Mr.Trump's actions and the early days of Vladimir Putin's regime and especially his relentless war with the media. All of these are reasons citizens are fired up, raising their voices to oppose the authoritarian tactics of this administration.  While the President seeks to dismiss the legitimacy of these voices, I stand here today to praise those Americans for standing up, for taking on their responsibility as citizens to create a powerful, courageous chorus, a public stand against the authoritarian strategy of President Trump--his strategy of attacking the media, his strategy of attacking immigrants, his strategy of attacking refugees, and his strategy of attacking religious minorities.  A friend sent me a message the other day saying:       I'm more devastated daily. I can't believe the Republicans      are not stopping this, saying something. How can this be      happening? Don't the Republicans see what's happening? I weep      for my kids.  Millions of Americans across the country are feeling those same fears. It is up to all of us here, imbued with the awesome responsibility to speak for and represent the people of this Nation, to stand up against advancing authoritarianism. It is right for us to fight for a free, open democratic republic, with a ``government of the people, by the people, for the people.''  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

843,topic-id,593,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come here to the floor and talk about what is really happening under the Affordable Care Act, better known by the American people as  I just left a meeting with the President of the United States where he lobbied my colleagues to make clear to the American people what a disaster this law has been and why the law needs to be repealed and replaced with something far better.  Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that ObamaCare is failing Healthcare costs continue to rise, and people have less coverage and less choice today than ever before. No doubt, some have benefited from the law, but millions more Hoosiers have been hurt by the law and are worse off today than they were before this law was passed.  I have heard from countless Hoosiers in the Sixth District of Indiana, who are hurting under ObamaCare and who have sent me here to repeal this disastrous law.  There is one message from a constituent from Greenfield who said: ``I am a perfectly healthy human being, and I used to pay $230 a month with a $500 deductible for my health care. Since ObamaCare, my premiums have risen to over $1,480 a month with a $10,000 deductible.''  Or a dad in Shelbyville, who lost the healthcare plan he liked when[[Page H2246]]ObamaCare took effect, and whose prescription costs for his daughter have now doubled and tripled under  Or the owner of a small telecom company in southern rural Indiana, who tells me that he and his employees have faced higher health insurance rates every year since ObamaCare with out-of-pocket costs increasing as well, not to mention the endless paperwork and red tape. He says: ``ObamaCare has been an absolute disaster for small businesses and our employees.''  I heard from a cancer survivor from Vevay, whose plan went from $199 a month to over $800 a month, and who couldn't keep her plan or her doctor. She says: ``I am a cancer survivor, and the old policy has taken me through three surgeries and worked well for me. Now we're paying over $1,300 a month with a $5,000 deductible, and the policy paid nothing the entire year. Then, we received a notice that, in 2017, the premium would raise again.''  Or the family physician from Muncie, who told me his patients have ``more limited options, longer wait times for approval of vital procedures and medications, and--through the confusing nature of the health insurance marketplace--have ended up with plans they didn't understand and couldn't afford.''  Or the hardworking mom and wife in Shelbyville, whose husband lost hours at work because of ObamaCare's full-time employee mandates, and whose own health insurance increased in cost with less coverage. She says: ``We work hard for our benefits, and now the benefits are terrible. I am paying more for worse coverage, and we lost income. It was a double whammy.''  These Hoosiers and so many others are being crushed by ObamaCare and its burdensome taxes, mandates, and fees. We can do better for Hoosiers, and this week we will. We will start the process of repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with something better.  This week, Congress will vote on the American Health Care Act, the first phase of our plan to repeal and replace This is a transformational change that will do away with ObamaCare's costly mandates, provide much-needed relief to Hoosiers, and create a healthcare system that actually lowers costs and increases choice. We are going to keep our promise, come together, and get this done.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2245-2.txt,2130,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,March

216,topic-id,2548,"Mr.President, we have been talking a lot about the weather here in Washington, DC, the past couple of days. We got a little bit of snow yesterday in some parts. People are still kind of plowing out of their driveways. I am looking at the daffodils that were out 3 days ago, and they are now buried, and the cherry blossoms are a little bit crispy on the trees.  So many of us are not feeling like spring has really sprung here. But in Alaska, in my home State, when we think of spring, one of the things that brings a smile to the face of so many of us is that it means it is time for the Iditarod, the Last Great Race on It is an exciting time of the year for so many, when we come together to celebrate a 1,000-mile race across some pretty desolate territory in the State of  The race itself has a much storied history, one that is somewhat unique to the State of Alaska and to our culture. The race commemorates a lifesaving diphtheria serum run to the community of Back in 1925, diphtheria had raged through the community, and there was no way to get the serum to We did not have aircraft that could make it that far. Remember, it is pretty cold in February and in We still don't have a road. We really had no way to move the diphtheria serum.  So it was determined, after a great deal of debate and discussion and pros and cons that they would use a dog team relay to get the diphtheria serum to There are names of dogs that have now become infamous, like Togo, Fritz, and Balto, which led this amazing race. Today, the memory of that lifesaving race is lived on in a race that features just a little bit shy of 1,000 miles, again across pretty frozen isolated areas. It involves 1,000-plus dogs that are in the running.  For many of us, there are 1,000 more reasons that you really would not want to do that. But I have to tell you, as I look at these mushers, as I look at these dogs, and as I look at all that goes into the mushing history of our State, it makes me excited about not only the men and women who are the mushers but the true athletes, the K-9 athletes, and all that they give up.  I was home in Anchorage last weekend for the ceremonial start on It is a great deal of hoopla. There are not too many communities in America where you actually truck snow into the downtown part of your community, fill the streets up with snow so that the dog teams can launch from downtown. Thousands of people gather to watch the start. We were commemorating the 45th annual Iditarod race.  The official start was on Monday morning in Fairbanks, AK, a town that I also call home, having gone to high school there. The route this year was from Fairbanks, what they call the northerly route, up to It shaves a little bit of the miles off. I think this year it was about 979 miles. So it was not quite 1,000 miles, but still good enough to test a man or a woman and their dogs.  It was kind of tough starting in Fairbanks on the morning of the race. Temperatures were around 50 below. They hit the river, went right past the house where I grew up, and went downriver. By the time they got to the first checkpoint there at Tanana, the temperatures were 50 below and people were talking about how you stay warm on a sled and who has bad frostbite that is coming back after years of running.  Let's just put it this way. The Iditarod is not for the timid or the weak. It takes real grit to run this race. When you think about all the hoopla that comes with the ceremonial start and all the people who came out in the community, then you get on the trail and you are alone. You are by yourself. We have 26 different checkpoints between Fairbanks and As a musher reaches a checkpoint, there is an appreciative audience of the villagers who come out to cheer them on.  Again, the villagers can't offer help with taking care of the teams. The mushers have to do it all themselves. But there is a lot of time to think and reflect about the beauty surrounding you, a lot of time to worry about whether or not you have moose or wolf or bear or whatever is out there keeping them company. But truly, this is not only an endurance race, but it is a race that challenges the mind. There are stretches of just almost mind-numbing isolation in the cold where you are just focusing on your team in front of you.  But as you can see, when you get out--this is right on the outskirts of Nome; this is coming in at the end of the race--there is a lot of isolation out there. The temperatures that you are dealing with are tough on a human being. Over the course of this past week, the temperature range was a 70-degree range. The temperature in Nome yesterday at the conclusion was 4 degrees above zero. So it is on the positive side, which was good news for the mushers. But that is a pretty substantial range that you are going through.  It is an amazing race in terms of the strategy that goes into it. You would think: Well, you just get your dogs in line. You know where you are going to feed them. You know where you are going to let them rest.  But the strategy that goes into a race like this is really quite unique to the various mushers. What we have seen with this race is an extraordinarily fast race, where the winner was averaging between 10 and 11 miles per hour between some of these checkpoints. It is pretty extraordinary to have your dogs keep up a pace like this.  Some mushers will hop off their sleds and run alongside their dogs when they are going uphill, just to take some of[[Page S1834]]the weight off the sled. But think about that. You have been going for a week. You have been going around the clock pretty much for some of these. You are exhausted. You are freezing cold. Now you are going to jog behind your dogs to lighten the load. This is, again, extraordinary. Many of the others, as they are approaching the end, will keep their strongest dogs, shed the nonessential gear, and switch to a lighter sled to push through on the final stretch.  But there are a lot of different tactics. When a dog is tired, you can put them in the basket so the dog can rest, kind of like a coach on a basketball team: You need to be put on the bench and just kind of take a breather here. We do it with the dogs as well. But this is a race not only about the endurance, but it also is one where there is a great deal of work to ensure that these high-performance athletes are cared for and that their safety is looked after.  Again, if a dog gets too tired and is just not right, mushers can leave them at a checkpoint to ensure their well-being so that they are not pushed too much. Again, putting them in a basket, making sure that the dogs are cared for. There is a veterinarian at every step along the way. The vets check the dogs out at every checkpoint. The mushers have to carry the veterinary check record, if you will.  These vets are not local vets. There are some 50 vets that volunteer to come to Alaska for the Iditarod and go out there along the trail to one of these checkpoints and to do the checks before the race and after the race.  When I was in Anchorage last week, I was visiting with a veterinarian from The Presiding Officer probably might even know him. But he comes every year. This was his eighth He volunteers his time because, again, it is an amazing race with amazing K-9 athletes. They are the ones who get the care and attention. I don't know that there are any doctors out along the trail for the mushers, but the dogs are well cared for.  It is required and there is mandatory rest that is taken. Mushers can determine where the 24-hour rest period is taken. There are two 8-hour stops, one along the Yukon River and one at White Mountain, just before you get to But, again, you think about the demands on the individual as they are mushing along at this pace.  There is a story out of this year's race about a musher. I think it was day 3 into the race. A team comes into the checkpoint. They are clipping right along, but there is no musher. The musher had fallen asleep while standing on the runners of his sled and just kind of fell off his sled.  He had a pretty good team, if I can just say. They were obviously following the trail from teams ahead of them. That team just went on and ended up at the checkpoint there. It was a little while later that another musher came along and saw this musher walking, following his dog's footprints. He gave him a ride to the next checkpoint where his dogs were all there just waiting for him, saying: You know, we got here first. Where were you?  But it kind of speaks to some of the issues that go on along the trail. There used to be a time, up until this year, when there was no two-way communication devices that were allowed--none at all. So as to your cellphone, you could not have your cellphone with you.  It was designed to make sure you were not gaining unfair advantage in determining where other mushers were ahead of you or behind you. But for safety reasons, I think there is a recognition that being able to send out an alert if you need it is probably wise and important. A thousand miles is a lot of land to cover. There are a lot of things that can go wrong when it is just you and your dogs along the trail.  The news. The news is big about the 45th Iditarod race. This year, the winner, a fabulous gentleman by the name of Mitch Seavey, blasted the overall record--extraordinarily impressive. He set the Iditarod record of 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds. What is wonderful to add to this story is that this is the fastest time. The next fastest time, the fastest time that we had had up until this year, was the year prior, which was set by his son. Think about that. What athletic competition, what sport can you have a father and a son go in toe to toe beating the all-time record? Last year, the 29-year-old son was the winner. This year, the 57-year-old dad is the winner. And who came in second this year? The son.  When I was at the ceremonial start and I had the opportunity to see Mitch Seavey, I went up to him, and I said: OK, I know everyone is betting on Dallas Seavey to win because it would be win 5 for him, but I am going with the old guy.  Fifty-seven is not so old. Mitch Seavey certainly demonstrated that just yesterday.  The Seavey family is Iditarod legend. Dan Seavey, who is Mitch's father, ran the very first Iditarod in 1973, and then some 44 years later, his son Mitch and his grandson Dallas are still going at it. Mitch won in 2004 and in 2013, and his son Dallas won in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016--again, a father and son kind of trading off second and third places during each of these.  It is extraordinary when you think about the records that have been broken with this race, and the closeness of the race is exciting to look at. When the second and third place finishers came in--Dallas came in just 5 minutes ahead of the third place musher, Nicolas Petit, who calls Girdwood his hometown, as does one of our young pages here, and it is a place I call home as well.  So there is a lot of excitement with the winners, not only with Mitch Seavey's record-smashing race but also the fact that he is the oldest racer to win, at 57. Again, as he has reminded us, 57 isn't that old.  I will acknowledge that both Dallas and Nicolas Petit came in breaking last year's record as well.  So for the sixth year in a row, we have had a Seavey champion. You talk about a family of champions, this is pretty amazing. This one is Mitch's third win, and it is an extraordinary win.  I spoke to Mitch not too long ago to offer him my congratulations, and I told him: As a parent of two 20-somethings, I like the command you demonstrate. You have still got it in you. You are going to be a fierce competitor.  But what Mitch told me was really a lovely statement. He said that what was so great was to be at the finish line seeing his son coming in and seeing Dallas genuinely happy at Mitch's win. He said that they were head-to-head competitors all throughout the race, and Dallas didn't make that five-time win that he was hoping for, that so many of us Alaskans were hoping for, but he was so genuinely proud of his father.  As of this afternoon, we have 10 mushers who have crossed the finish line. I wish all of the other mushers and their fearless dogs good luck as they continue to make their way to Nome over the next few days and beyond.  This is an event that I love to celebrate with my colleagues. I love to brag about the amazing men and women, not just the Alaskans but from all over the country and really from all over the world. Our fourth place finisher is from Norway, Joar Leifseth He was right up there all the way to the end. It is men. It is women. Jessie Royer was the first woman in, and she came in fifth place. Aliy Zirkle crossed in eighth place. So they are remarkable men and women--Alaskans, Americans, and people from truly around the globe--who come to compete.  Truly the ones we celebrate with great enthusiasm and gusto are these canine athletes that demonstrate to us all that there is no end, there is no limit to their love to run, their love to compete, and their desire to excel.  I am pleased to be able to celebrate with colleagues from the Senate in recognizing the 45th Iditarod race, the Last Great Race on  With that, Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1062,topic-id,2533,"Mr.President, there have now been two speakers on the floor this afternoon speaking to H.69, which is the disapproval resolution on Alaska fish and wildlife refuge rule. I have come today to speak in strong support of this resolution, which will effectively overturn a rule imposed by the previous administration related to fish and wildlife management on millions of acres of refuge land in the State of  I would like to start my comments by acknowledging Senator Sullivan, for his lead on this initiative, and Congressman Young, as he moved this measure through the House just a couple of weeks ago. What we saw in the House measure and the final vote was a bipartisan vote that secured passage through the House, and I thank Congressman Young for his able leadership there.  I also want to thank Senator Sullivan for his comments and for really doing an excellent job in outlining and explaining why this Fish and Wildlife Service rule is bad for Alaska, bad for hunters, bad for our Native peoples, and bad for  Like my friend and colleague, I am here to encourage Members of the Senate to see this rule for what it really is. It is a clear departure from Federal law. It is unwarranted regulatory overreach, and, from all accounts, it is a direct attack on States' rights.  Now, we will have discussion back and forth on the floor about various hunting practices, and we will see beautiful shots of wildlife and suggestions that, somehow or other, this is about a specific hunting practice. This is bigger than wildlife refuges in the State of This is an issue that is not just isolated or contained in the State of This resolution is specific to Alaska, but I would suggest to[[Page S1868]]my colleagues that for all of those of us who care about States' rights, who care about the promises made to our States about how they operate and how they manage activities in their States, this is something that we must all pay attention to because this is a direct attack on States' rights.  I look at this and suggest that this rule is a solution in search of a problem. Again, there are those who would say: Why is the Senate spending 10 hours to debate practices within a refuge in the State of Alaska? Is this not just so parochial an issue that it ought not take our time? However, I would contend that this foreshadows what is in store for the rest of the country if we are not adamant in ensuring that this rule be repealed by  Now, for those who may not be familiar with Alaska or gaming management laws within our State or within our national wildlife refuges in general, I think it is important to cover some basic facts and perhaps a little bit of history here to illustrate why this rule is so flawed. Alaska, like every other State in the Nation, holds primary legal authority to manage its fish and its wildlife, including on Federal refuge lands.  So let's not get confused here and think that because we have Federal lands, somehow or other the States do not have primacy when it comes to management of fish and wildlife. Alaska holds legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife within its borders. This is clear. This is unambiguous. Congress explicitly provided that authority specifically to our State in not one, not two, but three separate laws. The first of these is the Alaska Statehood Act; then the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--ANILCA; and the third authority was through the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration In three separate authorities, Congress made it clear: Alaska, you are to manage the fish and wildlife within your borders.  Our Statehood Act gave Alaska the right to manage its fish and its wildlife as soon as the State could assemble a department of fish and game, which we actually did in our first year of Then, in 1980, ANILCA, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, affirmed twice that nothing within its text was ``intended to enlarge or diminish the authority of the State of Alaska for management of fish and wildlife on the public lands.''  Again, it is very clear, not only within the Statehood Act, but within ANILCA, that management would be left with the The authority to manage our fish and our wildlife--through decisions based on sound science and that make sense for our local communities--is something that we in Alaska take very, very seriously. For us, State management of fish and wildlife is practically sacrosanct. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is one of the key reasons the State of Alaska voted to join the Union, so we have pretty good reason for the emotion and the passion that come with this authority to manage our fish and our wildlife.  I am proud to acknowledge that not only am I the first Senator to serve in the Senate who was born in Alaska; I was actually born in the territory. My parents and my grandparents were engaged in the battle for Some think it was about the land. For most of the discussion that I recall from my family, it was all about fish. It was all about the salmon. One of the reasons we fought for Statehood was management of our fisheries. The Federal management of Alaska salmon fisheries prior to Statehood was absolutely appalling, with salmon stocks falling from 113 million in 1934 to just 25 million in 1959. We saw the management from the Federal side, and that experience left Alaskans absolutely committed to State management and the preservation of both fish and game, so we negotiated that for ourselves. We put it into law; we enshrined it into law in several different places. And we expect our Federal agencies to abide by that.  Those were the terms of the deal when we entered the Union as a State: Alaska is to manage the fish and wildlife within our borders. It is our right and our responsibility, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We have an entire department of fish and game dedicated to it and, as Senator Sullivan rightly noted, a department that has been recognized for the good work they do, the strong science they utilize. We are proud of the efforts they make to ensure that this management is done for sustained yield, the principle we stand by in our State's constitution. For decades now, we have done just that, until the National Park Service in 2015 and the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2016 took it upon themselves to propose regulations to take control away from Alaska, despite what was contained in our Statehood agreement, in ANILCA, and in the National Wildlife Refuge Administration  The National Park Service's rule is outside the reach of the Congressional Review So while, in my view, that also deserves repeal, it is not the focus of our debate today. Instead, the resolution we are discussing focuses on the Fish and Wildlife Service rule that was finalized over the protests of Alaskans in August of last year. The rule itself was packaged perhaps innocently enough. The Fish and Wildlife Service spoke of clarifying ``existing mandates'' for conservation and biological diversity, and the agency claimed it was outlawing a few methods of predator control, couched its rule as a victory for public participation, and then promised us that it did not change Federal subsistence regulations or impose new regulations on subsistence users.  On the face of it all, it sounded as though it was going to be not so bad--if you take the agency's description at face value. Many who are outside of Alaska are looking at this and saying: Why are you making such a big deal about all of this? The Department of the Interior is just clarifying some hunting rules, so it can't be that big of a deal.  But the answer on that is: This is a big deal.  Some of our opponents will allege the repeal of this rule will legalize brutal predator-control practices. What the Senate should know is that it is already illegal for hunters to use certain practices--gas against wolves, traps to harvest bears. You cannot do this on national wildlife refuges in So those arguments are false and, unfortunately, serve mostly to distract from what this rule is really about. As I mentioned at the outset of my comments, what this is really about are the States' rights, States' authorities, and, effectively, States' control.  First and foremost, I am here to defend the rights of my home State and all of the States to manage fish and game within their boundaries. The game management rule severely erodes the authority of Alaska to make these decisions, and I think it sets a terrible precedent for the other 49 If you think, this rule is just about Alaska, that this is not something you need not worry yourself about--well you really actually ought to be worried. Especially so if you have Federal lands within your Your State could be the next one where Fish and Wildlife Service comes in and says: No, it's not going to be you, State, that has this management authority. We're going to come in and tell you what can and cannot be done.  The Fish and Wildlife Service freely admits its rule will impact 54 million acres of refuge land inside the State of This is an area 10 times larger than the size of the State of This is not insignificant. Really, this is truly the camel's nose under the tent.  If Congress allows this rule to stand, it will effectively override U.Supreme Court rulings from 1896 and 1979, which held that the States have the power to ``protect and conserve wild animal life within their borders.'' The States' power in this area is subject only to specific Federal authorities articulated by Congress, such as the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection  The precedent being set for Alaska--and every other State--should be sufficient reason for us to oppose this rule. But I also need to speak to some of the particulars included within it, especially the Obama administration's claim that it would not change or restrict subsistence uses.  This regulation made significant and substantive changes to regulations related to the hunting of bears. While I realize that not everyone may agree with hunting, I urge you to listen to what my colleague from the State of Alaska said in his comments and what[[Page S1869]]he outlined in terms of subsistence to Alaska Natives, subsistence to those who are in areas so remote that ``rural'' is not even the right way to describe it. We call it Bush There are no stores, there is no Safeway, there is no Whole Foods, and there is no Stop-N-There is no place where you can go to get your meat, to get your fish. In many areas there just isn't even a store, much less a store where you can buy Hamburger Helper or whatever it is that you are going to provide for your family. That model just does not exist in certain parts of our State, so what the people who live there do is hunt. That is how they provide for their families. They hunt and they fish and they gather. That is subsistence. That subsistence is not only nutritional sustenance, but for many, it is also their cultural identity, whether you are the ``People of the Caribou,'' the ``People of the Whale,'' or the ``Salmon People.'' The Native people who have been part of this corner of the world for millennia relate to their food source, making sure that not only their traditional diets can continue, but how they are able to practice this subsistence lifestyle matters greatly.  The regulation we are talking about today jeopardizes the ability of many of those Alaskans to sustainably harvest wildlife, to hunt, to feed themselves and their families. So when we think about the Alaska model of management and how it works to achieve healthy populations, this rule we are dealing with right now upsets that balance. It makes significant changes to the types of activities allowed when hunting bears without the support of the State or the traditional user groups. In updating regulations governing public notice and participation, the rule eliminates tools and obligations necessary for meaningful engagement with affected It curtails the use of local knowledge and insights for refuge management. It relies on an arbitrary and unscientific interpretation of the agency's national biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health policy.  The sustainability of Alaska's ecosystem depends on good, sound management--expert management--of fish and game populations. But under this regulation, well-established best practices employed by wildlife management professionals are more vulnerable to what could be unscientific or certainly bureaucratic second-guessing. That has sweeping implications for wildlife populations and for those who depend on them. If left in place, this rule will be applied to the entire refuge system either unilaterally or through litigation, placing our Nation's fishing and hunting traditions at even greater risk.  Those who actively participate in the sustainable management of our Nation's fish and wildlife populations understand the dangers presented by this rule, and they are overwhelmingly opposed to it. Senator Sullivan mentioned a list of the organizations that have voiced their support. I will not repeat many of the names, but it includes the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represents all 50 It includes subsistence users, guides, outfitters, tourists, hunters, anglers throughout the country, and dozens of conservation groups, from the Alaska Outdoor Council and the Alaska Professional Hunters Association to Ducks Unlimited, Safari Club International, the National Rifle Association, and the Boone and Crockett When you have a coalition that is this strong, that is this broad and yet united against a Federal rule, you know something went terribly awry with the regulation.  I would encourage the Senate to see through some of what I consider to be misleading arguments that some of the outside groups are making against us and to really see this rule for what it is--that this Fish and Wildlife Service game management rule for Alaska refuges is the very definition of Federal overreach. It defies the will of Alaskans, while disregarding sound scientific game management principles. It will result in less stable populations of fish and wildlife within our It will harm our subsistence users who hunt, not for sport but for their literal cultural sustenance, their nutritional sustenance, and, again, so much of their identity.  I again want to thank those that have been leading on this issue. This is a bad rule that deserves repeal. I would encourage all of my colleagues to look carefully at this. Look carefully at this, not just as a rule that is parochial and limited to just Alaska alone, but look to it within the context of what this does and what it says when it comes to States' rights and States' ability to manage fish and wildlife within their own State borders.

1439,topic-id,3256,"Mr.President, the House is still on schedule to vote tomorrow on a reform of one-sixth of the American economy that the American public has not seen. This is, frankly, unprecedented--this rush job, this attempt to jam through a massive rewrite of the American healthcare system, intentionally done so fast that the American public cannot keep up with what is a truly disastrous piece of legislation. It is a train wreck. It is a dumpster fire. I cannot come up with enough words to describe how bad this legislation is going to be for the American public.  Bill Kristol, who is an icon of the conservative movement and who has been arguing for the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act since it was passed, tweeted out this:       This healthcare bill does not, A, lower costs; B, improve      insurance; C, increase liberty; D, make healthcare better. So      what is the point?  Frankly, many Americans, many healthcare professionals, and many consumers are asking the same question: What problem does this bill solve?  Whatever you want to call it--the American Health Care Act, TrumpCare, RyanCare--what problem does this bill solve other than a political problem?  Clearly, Republicans have a political problem. They have promised, for the last 6 years, to repeal the Affordable Care Now they have control of the White House, the House, and the Senate, and they feel pressured to make good on that promise.  It does solve a political problem for the The passage of this bill in the House or the Senate would allow my Republican friends to say: We told you we were going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and--doggone it--we did it. But it does not solve any other problem in the American healthcare system. It makes the existing, remaining problems even worse. The Republicans know this because, for 6 years, we have heard criticism--relentless criticism--that the Affordable Care Act was rammed through the process, that it was passed without Members' knowing what was in it, that it was shoved down the throats of the American people. Well, imagine our surprise when the replacement to the Affordable Care Act is being pushed through at absolutely light speed compared to the passage of the Affordable Care  So we look at what happened when the Affordable Care Act was passed, and the HELP Committee that I sit on, the Finance Committee in the Senate, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee held dozens of hearings--dozens of committee meetings. The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate alone debated hundreds of amendments and accepted 130 Republican amendments to the Affordable Care  This time around, the HELP Committee isn't even going to have a meeting on the replacement. The committees in the Senate aren't going to have anything to do with this bill. The substitute language that Speaker Ryan has filed likely will not even get a CBO analysis before it is jammed through the House tomorrow. Why is that? Because Republicans are so fearful that the American public will have the time to take a look at this and realize what it is.  I don't often say that Bill Kristol is right, but he is right when he says that this bill doesn't lower costs, it doesn't improve insurance, increase liberty, or make healthcare better, so what is the point?  Here are three really simple ways to understand this bill. This bill is all about higher costs for consumers, all about less care for Americans, all in order to finance tax cuts for the rich. These are the three prongs of TrumpCare: higher costs, less care, and tax cuts for the rich. You don't have to spend a lot of time deep inside this bill to figure out what it is all about.  So costs go up, CBO says 15 to 20 percent, just in the first couple of years for a number of reasons, but primary amongst them is the fact that the help that you are going to get to afford insurance just dramatically decreases. For low-income Americans, here it is: You get $1,200 less if you are 27, you get $1,100 less if you are 40, and if you are 60, you get really hosed. If you are 60, good luck affording insurance. Your subsidy goes down by $5,800. It gets even worse than that because this bill allows for the insurance companies to discriminate against older Americans by jacking up the ratios that you can charge older Americans versus younger Americans from 3 to 1 to 5 to 1, so the average low-income, sixtyish-year-old in this country will be paying about $15,000 more out of pocket for healthcare.  What problem does that solve? Talking to people in Connecticut, I didn't hear a lot of my constituents who are in their fifties and sixties say: Let me tell you the problem with the American healthcare system. I am paying way too little. I need to be paying--if I could be paying $13,000 more, that would scratch me where I itch.  Nobody says that the problem with the healthcare system today is that costs are too low. It is the opposite. Costs are too high. Yet the first prong of TrumpCare: higher costs. That is not me saying it; that is CBO saying it.  I will give my colleagues the exception to this because let's lay all of our cards out on the table. CBO does say that if you are young, healthy, and relatively affluent, you might get a lower rate. Let's be honest about that. So if you are young, healthy, and you are affluent, you might get a lower rate. But that is a sliver of the population compared to all of the people who are going to be paying higher rates, especially older people and especially low-income people, because the subsidies don't change if your income goes up, and because of the discrimination made legal in this bill, older people have to pay more.  So, basically, another way to think about this in terms of how costs are going up is the more you need healthcare, the less help you get. If you are low-income and you are older, you get less help. If you are younger and higher income, comparatively, you get more help from this bill. Again, that is not attacking a problem that I hear about very often. People who need more help tend to need more help.  Here is the second chart. All of this is done in order to give a big tax cut. So here is the amount of tax cuts in this bill for people making $10,000; here is the amount for people making $20,000 to $30,000; here is the amount of the tax cut one gets if you are at $50,000 to $60,000. We see a trend line. It is about the same amount if you are making $10,000 up to about $200,000. The amount of tax cut you get from this bill in that range is zero. But if you are making $200,000 or more, well, here is where the money is, up to the point where people who are making the highest incomes in this country get over $1 million in tax cuts.  It repeals some tax provisions in the Affordable Care Act that were used to finance the subsidies, but all of those tax provisions affect the very top income level earners. So there is a tax cut in this bill, but it gives you zero if you make less than $200,000 a year. It gives you a lot if you are making more than $200,000 a year.  Here is the last chart: less care. Here is what CBO says will happen if the Affordable Care Act remains. This is a really important line to look at here because part of the narrative, part of the explanation for this piece of legislation is that, in Paul Ryan's words, ObamaCare is in a ``death spiral,'' and Donald Trump says it is ``collapsing.''  The Congressional Budget Office--which is run by a man who was handpicked by the Republican caucus in the[[Page S1918]]House--the Congressional Budget Office says: No, actually, it is not collapsing; it is not in a death spiral. If we do nothing and allow the Affordable Care Act to remain--yes, over 10 years, the number of people without insurance will go up by a little bit, up to 28 million, but the death spiral happens if you pass There is a death spiral coming into the American healthcare system. There is a humanitarian catastrophe that is about to hit us, but it only happens if you choose to pass this piece of legislation that is pending before the House of Representatives today.  Now, I hear this legislation can't pass the U.Senate because my Republican colleagues understand this. So I am not necessarily talking directly to my Republican colleagues here because I trust that they understand the collapse of the American healthcare system that occurs when, in a very short period of time, you create 24 million more uninsured people.  But, remember, Donald Trump said during the campaign that no one was going to lose healthcare. Republicans in the House said that everyone who is on healthcare today will get to keep it. CBO says that is not even close to true. In the first 2 years, 14 million people lose care, and eventually those who are uninsured goes to 52 million. The Presiding Officer knows this, and my Republican colleagues here know this.  This 52 million, it is not that they are totally outside of the American healthcare system. If there is an emergency, they go to an emergency room, and the emergency room covers their care. That is the most inhumane way to run a healthcare system, to wait until you are so sick, so ill, that your cancer has ravaged your body so badly, you have to show up in the emergency room, but they will get that care--often the most expensive care--and we will all pay for it. Part of the reason that CBO says that rates will go up is because this 52 million gets their care from emergency rooms. The emergency rooms and the hospitals pass that cost along to private insurers, and everybody's premiums go up.  Here is another way to think of this. I know these numbers tend to get a little hard to digest, a little hard to understand as they get thrown around. Here is what 24 million people losing healthcare looks like. How many people is 24 million? Twenty-four million is the entire combined population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and This isn't a minor shift in the number of people who will not have healthcare. This is a seismic change. The entire population of 17 States loses healthcare over the course of 10 years if this bill is passed.  By the way, let's be honest about who these people are. Yes, many of them will be people losing healthcare in the private marketplace. CBO says people who have private insurance will lose it because of this bill, either because their cost-sharing goes up and they can't afford it or because their employer might not offer it any longer. But a lot of this is in the Medicaid population, and you have to make a decision. The Medicaid population is, by and large, poor people, disabled people, elderly Americans, a lot of children, a lot of kids. The Members are going to have to make a decision about whether their conscience will be OK with 24 million. Most of them are pretty sick and disabled and pretty young--if you are OK with that many people losing coverage.  So Paul Ryan is right; it is a three-pronged approach. The three prongs are higher costs, less care, in order to finance tax cuts for the rich. It doesn't solve any problem that exists today in the healthcare system, except for maybe, as I mentioned, that very narrow issue of young, healthy, affluent They will probably do a little bit better here. But everybody else does worse.  By the way, here is what CBO says is the reason why those young, affluent healthy Americans do better--because you kick old people off of insurance. The only reason that premiums stabilize in years 3 and 4 and 5, according to CBO, is because this bill jettisons millions of older, relatively sicker Americans off of healthcare. So as you just kick old people off healthcare, then it gets a little bit cheaper for the younger people who remain.  So even the small percentage of Americans who, from a monetary standpoint, do a little bit better under this bill, they only do better because individuals who really needed care lose it under this approach.  This bill is moving really, really fast. It is moving really, really fast. Its impact is absolutely stunning. My hope is that it gets stuck somehow, that Senators of goodwill recognize, as Bill Kristol did in his tweet, that this bill doesn't actually solve any problems. Maybe they recognize that it looks an awful lot like the Affordable Care For the Speaker's reputation as being a big ideas guy, there are no new ideas in this legislation. It is essentially just the Affordable Care Act dialed down from 10 to 3.5, making healthcare unaffordable for everybody. The subsidies are still there; they are just much less. The individual mandate is still there; it just applies it in a different, more cruel way. Instead of paying a penalty when you lose coverage, you now pay a penalty when you lose coverage and try to sign up again. It is the same concept; it is just the penalty applied at a different place, and the insurance requirements are there.  So there are no new ideas. If you were ideologically opposed to the Affordable Care Act, there is no reason why this solves any of your problems. And from a practical consideration, it raises costs, it doesn't improve insurance, and it kicks a lot of people off healthcare.  My final thought is this: I know this issue of healthcare has become probably the most partisan, in part because there are some real important philosophical questions at the heart of this debate. I don't apologize for the fact that I do believe that healthcare should be looked at as a human right. I really think that in this country, we give you access to education; we should give you access to healthcare as well. You are living in the most powerful, most affluent country in the world. You probably shouldn't die because you are not rich enough to afford access to a doctor. It seems like something we should be able to do for you. So there are some serious ideological differences because I know a lot of my Republican colleagues don't view it that way. They view healthcare as a commodity much more so than I do. But we have shown the ability to work together on healthcare and on some pretty controversial pieces of it.  At the end of 2016, just 2 months ago, we passed the 21st Century Cures That wasn't easy. That was $6 billion of additional spending on medical research in this country. It included legislation that Senator Cassidy and I wrote--the Mental Health Reform Act--that had some tough reforms on our insurance markets requiring insurance companies to cover more mental illness. We had to work through some very tough issues with Senator Cornyn, who opposed our legislation until we worked out issues he had, and then he became a supporter and champion of it. We had to work through some difficult issues, but we passed a big healthcare bill at the end of 2016, with Republicans and Democrats supporting it. Frankly, in the end, some progressive Democrats voted against it and some conservative Republicans voted against it. It wasn't without controversy even until that final vote. But we have shown the ability to be able to work together, so why don't we do the same thing here?  I submit there are still big problems in the healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act didn't solve every problem out there, and even some aspects of the Affordable Care Act have to be amended, have to be changed. But let's work together on ways to keep what is working in the Affordable Care Act and make improvements to the parts that aren't working as well. Let's move into territory that we haven't covered yet, like drug prices, and do something about that.  Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave a speech earlier this week in which he told Americans that if you pass this legislation, drug prices will come ``way, way, way down.'' That is his quote, that drug prices will come ``way, way, way down.'' That is not in this bill. TrumpCare doesn't have anything that controls drug prices. Drug prices are not coming way, way, way down, but[[Page S1919]]we could work together to try to make sure that happens. We could have a tough conversation about what we are willing to pay when it comes to drugs, whether we are willing to let the rest of the world free ride on the contribution of the United States to global research and development. That would be a very important discussion to have. I bet it wouldn't get all 100 of us, but it would allow for Republicans and Democrats to work together.  Instead of ramming this bill through this process, through the reconciliation process, which means you can do it without a single Democrat supporting it, let's sit together and try to work out a bipartisan approach to improving our healthcare system.  I know why Speaker Ryan is pushing this bill through so fast. He knows it doesn't solve any problems that exist in the American healthcare system. He knows that the only problem it solves is a political problem--a political problem created by the promise that Republicans and this President made to repeal the Affordable Care But because they are doing it so fast, so ham-handedly, the replacement is going to result in disaster for That is not me saying that. That is the Congressional Budget That is Bill That is Republicans and Democrats all across the country.  Whatever happens tomorrow in the House of Representatives, the Senate will have a chance to be the adults in this conversation. Senate Republicans will have a chance to take a big step back and start over, and they can start over in a partisan way, or they can start over by reaching out to Democrats and saying: Let's try to work this out together. We may not get to that point where we have a bipartisan agreement, but, boy, it would be nice if my Senate Republican colleagues would at least try because if they don't, then Paul Ryan is right--there will be three prongs to what will be called TrumpCare, if it isn't already: higher costs for consumers, less care for Americans, all in order to finance a giant tax cut for the rich. This isn't what the American people thought they were getting, and we have a chance in the Senate to do so much better.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1650,topic-id,2499,"Mr.President, at this hour, we still don't know what the House of Representatives is going to do. They are amending and changing and modifying the reform of one-sixth of America's economy under the cover of darkness, trying to secure the votes necessary to fulfill a political promise. We await their decision as to how much havoc they wreak.  I wanted to come down to the floor today to address for a moment the exceptional process that is occurring right now, as we speak, in the House of Representatives and to talk about one of the reported changes they are considering before sending the product over to the  Just to review for a minute, Speaker Ryan likes to talk about his approach to healthcare as a three-pronged approach. Well, the Congressional Budget Office, headed by a gentleman handpicked by the Republican House conference, agrees that it is a three-pronged approach; they just have a little bit different interpretation of those three prongs.  First, they say higher costs--15 to 20 percent spikes in premiums for everybody right off the bat and then dramatically higher costs, especially for older people, sicker people, and poorer people. If you are young and if you are relatively affluent and healthy, you may make out a little bit better under this proposal, but if you are not in that category, you are going to pay a lot higher costs and get less care.  This is the headline from the CBO report: 24 million people lose health coverage. That is catastrophic. That is the total population of 17 U.We just kick them off health insurance without anywhere to go other than our emergency rooms.  Remember, all of this is in order to finance a giant tax cut for the rich. I had a chart up here yesterday that showed that in this bill, if you make zero to $200,000, you get no tax cut, but if you make over $200,000, you get a nice, healthy tax cut. It could be up to $7 million on average for some of the wealthiest taxpayers. So there will be higher costs for everybody, except for maybe a very small slice of the population, but with less care. I mean, it is a nightmare when it comes to the number of people who lose care under this bill, all in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.  That is the background on what TrumpCare is and what the American Health Care Act is. People hate it. I mean, people hate it. There is a new poll out by Quinnipiac University that shows stunning numbers. The approval numbers for this bill are under 20 percent.  Republicans kicked the living you know what out of the Affordable Care Act, and they never got its approval ratings down to under 20 percent, as has happened to the American Health Care Act in its third week of existence. That is pretty impressive, for 18 percent of Americans to approve of a bill that has only been out there for a few weeks. And it is not because they don't know anything about it; over 50 percent of Americans don't like it, 18 percent support it, and 56 percent don't support it. Across demographic groups, across age groups, everybody hates this thing because they get it. They are not dumb. They know that this is taking healthcare from them and passing along higher costs to them in order to finance a tax cut for the rich. It is pretty simple. People really didn't need a lot of time to understand it.  Republicans in the House know that as this thing hangs out there, it is getting less popular. It is hard to get less popular than 18 percent. Those are tough numbers to do worse than. The reason Republicans are racing this bill through the process is because they know how deeply unpopular it is because they know it is a scam. They know it is essentially just taking healthcare from Americans and forcing them to pay more in order to finance a tax cut for the rich.  What is happening today in the House is they are blowing up their rules in order to push a bill through that no one will have looked at. It is possible that they are going to file a gigantic reform to the entire American healthcare system and then call a vote on it within hours. Come on.  In 2009 and 2010, Republicans were blistering critics of Democrats, who they said were forcing the Affordable Care Act through the process too quickly. But in 2009 and 2010, the House held 79 bipartisan hearings and markups on the health reform bill over the period of an entire year. House Members spent nearly 100 hours in hearings, heard from 181 witnesses from both sides of the aisle, considered 239 amendments, and accepted 121 amendments.  This bill was introduced 2 weeks ago. The first time the American public ever looked at it was 2 weeks ago, and the House is rushing it through today. Two weeks. Fourteen days. Twenty days. Not a year. Not 79 hearings. Not 100 hours of hearings. And we are talking about bringing it up before the Senate for a vote next week, with 20 hours of debate on a reordering of one-sixth of the American economy.  It is really extraordinary how this bill is getting jammed through the process because Republicans know that every day it hangs out there, more people figure out what it is--a massive transfer of wealth from regular, ordinary Americans, through less care and higher costs, to the very rich and also insurance companies and drug companies, which get a big tax cut.  On today's modification of the bill, the talk today is that in order to make the bill a little bit meaner and a little bit crueler, the House is going to remove from the underlying law the requirement that insurance companies cover a basic set of what are called essential benefits. This change is being demanded by the very, very conservative wing of the House Republican conference. They call themselves the Freedom This is a group of sort of the most radical Members in the House of They are demanding that these essential healthcare benefits be stripped out of the law in order to get their votes.  Let's talk about what these essential healthcare benefits are. Basically the law now says that if you are offering an insurance plan and you want to call it health insurance, then you have to actually offer to cover healthcare. So the essential healthcare benefits--what every plan today has to offer in order to be able to call itself insurance in this country--are ambulatory patient care, which means outpatient care, emergency care, hospitalizations; pregnancy, maternity, and newborn care; mental health and substance abuse care; prescription drugs; rehabilitation if you get injured; lab services; tests; chronic disease management--management for diabetes or heart and liver conditions; and pediatric services, services for kids. That is it. Those are the essential healthcare benefits.  Frankly, if you are buying a health insurance plan, wouldn't you expect that it would cover your emergency care if you were to go to an emergency room? If you are buying healthcare in this country, what good is it if it doesn't cover a hospitalization when you get very sick? If you are buying an insurance plan in this country, don't you think it is going to cover your kids when they need basic pediatric services?[[Page S1961]]  So what is happening now is something different from healthcare reform in the House of What is happening now is a radical rethink of what healthcare insurance is. If all of a sudden health insurers don't need to cover the cost of your hospitalizations, don't need to cover mental illness at all, don't need to cover addiction coverage at all, then is it really insurance any longer? If it is not covering that list of things, what is it covering?  CBO has an answer for this. CBO says that if there is an insurance plan that doesn't cover this list of benefits, they won't count it as insurance. So when they are giving you the numbers of people who will have insurance or not have insurance after this bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says: We don't really count it as insurance if it doesn't cover basic stuff, such as hospitalizations, outpatient services, prescription drugs, and pediatric services.  So what is happening now in the House of Representatives is really a radical rethink of healthcare insurance. Under the law they are contemplating passing, healthcare insurance wouldn't need to cover anything. You could buy an insurance plan, pay your premium, and then be told that it doesn't cover your kid when he gets diagnosed with schizophrenia, that it doesn't cover your daughter when she gets in an accident and has to go to the emergency room, that it doesn't cover your spouse when they get really sick and are hospitalized for 3 days. What kind of coverage would that be any longer if it didn't cover that list of things?  Let's be honest. This would be a massive transfer of cost to individuals. The 1 prong of TrumpCare is higher costs. If insurance companies don't need to cover any of these things anymore but you still have to buy them, then it is just a massive shift of costs to individuals because, remember, TrumpCare penalizes you if you don't buy insurance.  The Affordable Care Act did the same thing, admittedly. The Affordable Care Act said: If you don't buy insurance, you are going to pay a penalty. But that is why the Affordable Care Act said that insurance has to really be insurance. It has to cover stuff because if we are going to require you to buy it or we are going to penalize you if you don't buy it, then insurance should really be insurance.  Well, TrumpCare penalizes you if you don't buy insurance. You would pay a massive penalty. For a lot of people, the penalty could be $5,000 if they don't buy insurance. But now the change they are considering in the House of Representatives means the insurance product you will be forced to buy won't cover diddly.  By the way, when your insurance company doesn't cover it and you have to pick up the cost, it is going to cost you way more money. Everybody has probably seen a bill from a hospital. Let's say you had to go in and get a colonoscopy. You get your bill, and you always sort of scratch your head because you see two numbers--you see the number the hospital bills and then you see the number your insurance company pays. Often, the number the insurance company pays is like one-third of what that hospital billed. Why is that? It is because the insurance company is negotiating with the hospital on behalf of thousands of patients, so they get that price way, way down. The insurance company only pays a fraction of the cost that is billed. If you don't have insurance coverage for it, if all of a sudden it is not a benefit in your plan because the American Health Care Act told insurance companies they didn't have to cover a hospitalization, then you will pay that higher price. You don't get the insurance company discount. You will pay that higher number. That is going to bankrupt people.  The families in my State, when their child gets hooked on heroin, they are going to find a way to pay for that care so that their child doesn't become another statistic, another one of the 900 who died in my State last year from overdoses. They are going to do everything possible to get that child care for that addiction. They will mortgage their house, they will sell their house, they will drain their savings account, they will sell off every possession they have to make sure their child does not die from an overdose and so that child gets the care they need. If their insurance company won't cover it, then they will do everything necessary to cover it, and you will have a rapid increase in the number of people whose lives are ruined, who go bankrupt because of their medical costs--something that doesn't happen right now because the Affordable Care Act gives you real subsidies to afford care. It gives you real help to be able to buy insurance, and it requires that insurance companies actually provide you with insurance.  This is an extraordinary thing that is happening in the U.House of Representatives right now. Nobody likes this bill. Healthcare experts think it is a joke. The American public has roundly rejected it. It is getting meaner and crueler every day in order to round up the votes necessary to get it passed. Why? Because this bill is not about solving any problem in the healthcare system. It doesn't solve a single problem. Again, except for this narrow group of younger, healthier, affluent people whose premiums will be a little bit less, everybody else is worse off. It only solves one problem, a political problem--the promise that the Republicans made to repeal the Affordable Care But they didn't spend any time thinking about how to actually do it. So they are stuck now with an awful bill that nobody likes, that doesn't solve a single problem, and that is getting meaner and meaner every single day.  It was bad enough, and now this bill is frankly getting into some really radical territory--talking about totally rethinking insurance and letting insurance companies offer you a product that covers nothing and then it requires you to buy it. Think about that. We are going to require you to buy insurance, but the insurance isn't going to cover anything. TrumpCare, the American Health Care Act--whatever you want to call it--has three prongs: higher costs, less care, and tax cuts for the rich.  We will have an opportunity here in the Senate to get this right. As to the House of Representatives, I don't know if they are going to pass this. I don't know if it is going to fall apart. But we will have a chance to get this right. Republicans and Democrats coming together, we can admit together that there are still a lot of things that are wrong in our healthcare system.  In the Affordable Care Act, there are some good parts of it, but other parts need improvement. We can come together and decide to tackle this problem--the high drug costs, whatever it may be--together and reject this partisan, rushed approach in the House of It does nothing except give us higher costs and less care in order to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.

1435,topic-id,816,"Mr.President, when President Trump was running for office, he made a lot of promises to the American people. He promised the middle class he would stand up for them. He promised workers he would bring good jobs back to their communities, and he promised to drain the swamp of corporate lobbyists that muck up our democracy with dysfunction.  Well, we are just over 2 months into this Presidency, and all we have seen from this administration is a series of broken promises, whether it is Cabinet picks who are billionaires, Wall Street bankers, and corporate CEOs; or his plan to jam through a healthcare bill that the President himself admits will hurt middle- and working-class families; or his proposed budget, which guts everything from job-training programs to assistance for low-income families who pay their heating bills, to meals on wheels, which provides hot meals to low-income grandparents. It is clear President Trump is standing with his billionaire and corporate lobbyist friends at the expense of the people he promised to stand up and fight for.  While we have made many improvements in our economy in the last 8 years, we have a lot of work left to do. Too many people in our country today are working multiple jobs trying to support their families and pay their bills, and they are still struggling to make ends meet. That is what we should be talking about today on the[[Page S1915]]Senate floor--how to build an economy that works for everyone. We should be working together to make sure that people are making a decent wage to support their families, that corporations aren't getting rich at the expense of their workers, and that hard-working people aren't risking their lives in dangerous conditions at work.  Instead, what we are doing today is that my Republican colleagues, with the backing of President Trump, are trying to roll back a rule that protects workers and prevents work-related deaths and injuries. This rule allows the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA--an agency whose sole purpose is to keep workers safe on the job--to accurately monitor and prevent workplace injuries and fatalities in our Nation's most dangerous industries.  Dangerous businesses have been recording serious workplace injuries and deaths for more than four decades, and this rule simply affirms the policy enshrined in the OSHA law itself of 1970 that these records have to be accurate--a precedent of keeping workers safe and monitoring dangerous workplaces.  After a recent court case put this important safety practice at risk, OSHA issued this rule to clarify their recordkeeping practices. This rule is not new. It does not impose added obligations or costs on employers, and it was actually suggested by the court in its decision. And it does not cover small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  We should be trying to make workplaces safer, but in rolling back this rule, President Trump and my Republican colleagues are doing exactly the opposite. This is not something we should be playing politics with. Without this rule--if it is overturned today by the Senate Republicans--some of the most dangerous industries will then be able to hide worker injuries and keep falsified records of injuries and workplace deaths, and it will make it more difficult for OSHA to punish low-road companies that are putting their workers' lives in danger.  Every year, more than 4,800 workers are killed on the job in America, and 3 million more suffer serious injuries and illnesses. We have found that it is often the same companies that are repeat offenders. Without this rule, OSHA cannot sanction employers for keeping fraudulent injury records for multiple years before OSHA walks in the door to conduct an inspection.  So many people in this country get up every day and go to work at tough, dangerous jobs to support their families and drive the economy. Those workers deserve to be able to trust that their employer isn't knowingly putting their life at risk. Without this rule, corporations and dangerous industries can take advantage of their workers, and OSHA will not have the tools it needs to stop it. We should not overturn this rule. If we do, recordkeeping will become elective.  This goes against everything President Trump promised to middle- and working-class families on the campaign trail. He promised to stand up for them, to bring back good, respectable jobs to their communities. Instead, he wants to allow his billionaire corporate friends to take advantage of workers and threaten their safety, and, unfortunately, it appears my Republican colleagues are now onboard.  Instead of doing President Trump's bidding, I urge my Republican colleagues to do what President Trump promised and start putting workers first by abandoning this deeply harmful effort.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

1614,topic-id,1284,"Mr.President, I want to start by addressing the news last night that Republican leaders have decided to try to make their awful TrumpCare legislation even worse. TrumpCare wasn't enough of a giveaway to insurance companies, and it didn't do enough harm to women, seniors, and people with preexisting conditions, so Republican leaders decided to double down in efforts to appeal to their extreme conservative base.  They are now claiming that they can take away essential health benefits like maternity care, mental health care, and preexisting conditions through the reconciliation process, but here are the facts: Republican leaders know, just as Democrats do, that measures to take away these critically important protections cannot survive the reconciliation process and could never get 60 votes in the They are simply trying to sell conservatives a bill of goods today in the rush to jam this through, but the more they scramble, the more harmful this bill gets for patients and families and the worse it will be for any House Republican who will be held accountable for their votes on it.  As we all know, today marks 7 years since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. While some here in Congress may view this as an ideal opportunity to ram through a reckless, harmful repeal of the law, I, for one, think about today a little differently.  I remember 7 years ago, standing with a young constituent of mine from Seattle, Marci Owens, as we watched President Obama sign the Affordable Care Act into law. I had met Marci when she was about 11 years old, in the midst of some of the most heated moments of the healthcare reform debate, and to this day, I will never forget the story she told me about her mom, who all of a sudden had become sick, was forced to miss work, and because of that, she lost her job and lost her health insurance. Ultimately, because she wasn't even able to see a doctor or get any care, she died as a result of her illness.  I took that story with me, along with countless other stories of families unable to access care, pay for medication, or see a doctor. I used them as motivation as my colleagues and I worked tirelessly to pass the Affordable Care  Just last month, I was proud to have Marci, who is now 18, attend President Trump's joint address to Congress as my guest. Today, Marci is still sharing her story and advocating for affordable healthcare, as well as transgender rights. She, along with millions of others across the country, is once again standing up, speaking out, and making it clear that we cannot go backward.  I come to the Senate floor to share some of the stories of families in my home State of Washington who are worried, who are afraid, and whose lives will be at risk if President Trump and Republicans take us down this dangerous path to repeal, people whose voices need to be heard more than ever.  I want to make it very clear why we are here and what is at stake. The House Republican TrumpCare bill would have a profoundly negative impact on the lives and the well-being and the financial security of people across the country, people who are truly terrified about the uncertain path forward. Yet, for having such a profound impact, Republicans are seemingly doing everything they can to limit public discussion on This bill was rushed through four House committees without a single public hearing, no testimony, no expert view. House Republicans voted the bill out of two of these committees without a CBO score, without knowing how many people would be impacted.  In the Senate this week, every Senate Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee called on the chairman to allow for a hearing to talk about this bill, but he refused. He ignored the request, and he held a hearing on other health policy instead. That the Health Committee--the Health Committee--has not been allowed to hold a single hearing to talk about and debate TrumpCare is appalling and shameful.  Not to be outdone, of course, the majority leader, instead of committing to give all Senators time to review and evaluate the bill, has now said the bill will go straight to the floor for a vote as soon as next week, prompting even Members of his own party to come out against this plan.  In all, these efforts are unprecedented. They are wrong, and they speak volumes about the kind of bill they are trying to ram through, because we now know many of the facts of the bill.  This bill will kick 24 million people off their coverage. It will cause premiums to skyrocket. Seniors will pay more for their care. It will put at risk those who are struggling with mental illness and substance use disorders, including opioid addiction. It would end Medicaid as we know it.  Predictively, it attacks women's constitutionally protected healthcare and rights. It defunds Planned Parenthood and puts insurance companies back in charge of other critical parts of women's healthcare, including maternity care, cancer screenings, and contraception. This bill undermines women's access to healthcare and women's ability to make their own healthcare decisions in virtually every way a piece of legislation could.  I oppose this bill in the strongest terms. I am going to be doing everything I can to fight back against it, and I know Senate Democrats will as well.  Families across the country are looking to us, and they have nowhere else to turn. Like many of my colleagues, I have constituents coming up to me constantly when I am at home, asking me what is going to happen if TrumpCare becomes law. They are bravely sharing deeply personal stories about their health, their families, and their fears--something they should not have to do. They deserve to be heard.  Erin Zerba from my home State of Washington deserves to be heard. She has been a teacher for 19 years and teaches in two rural school districts, but because of her part-time standing in both districts, she is ineligible for insurance. If it weren't for the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, she would have no options.  As Erin puts it, she is ``terrified'' to learn that Medicaid would be gutted under She has multiple disabilities, including autism and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. She has had repeated surgeries following a difficult pregnancy. The medication she has to take every day is very expensive. There is no generic form. She is one of those millions of people.  I have to say that we are going to fight back in every way we can because the TrumpCare bill that is being rushed through the House with giveaways being given to Senators for their votes is not the way we take care of people in this country. I am deeply worried about the process of this bill.  I see the Democratic leader on the floor, and I know how important it is for him to speak. I just want to say, as the ranking member on the Health Committee, it is appalling to me that we have had no hearings, no expert witnesses, no markup. We have not seen this bill, and it is being rushed through. It will impact every single American and deserves the time of day, not some created chaos and deadline timeline that was created simply to fulfill a campaign promise and not to do the right thing for the American people.[[Page S1945]]  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1188,topic-id,825,"Mr.Speaker, President Trump and Speaker Ryan have said that the Affordable Care Act that we have now is a disaster, that it is a calamity.  There are problems with it. For some people in some plans, premiums are too high.  So what do the Republicans want to do?  Raise the premiums.  For some people in some plans, deductibles are too high.  So what do the Republicans want to do?  Make the deductibles much higher.  Let's get away from the rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act and look at what the Republicans plan to do with the bill that we are going to be voting on presumably in the next few days: raise the premiums, raise the deductibles.  They say that you will not be disqualified for preexisting conditions and that you will still be able to get insurance, but not if you let your coverage lapse in 6 months. If you are laid off from your job and you lose your insurance and 6 months later you get insurance, no, you are going to have to pay a 30 percent higher premium in order to get coverage. So their guarantee is worth nothing.  What does the bill that we are going to be voting on do?  This bill would throw 24 million people off of coverage. Twenty four million Americans would lose their health care, the security of mind that they have now. This bill would destroy about 2 million jobs. This bill would force families to pay higher costs, higher premiums, higher deductibles.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a 50- or 60-year-old person making $26,000 and who, under ObamaCare, is paying, after the subsidies, out of pocket $1,700 a year for health insurance, will, under this new Republican bill, after the appropriate subsidies that this bill will give, pay not $1,700, but $14,000 on a pretax income of $26,000.  So this bill will increase costs, throw 24 million people off of coverage, and impose an age tax. People above 50 years old will have to pay five times as much as younger people for insurance, a very crushing age tax.  Why? Why do this?  Because they say people need more freedom to choose their health care.  People don't need more freedom to choose their health care. People need better health care. They need coverage. They need security. They need coverage that will take care of their health needs at a low cost. That is what they need.  The ObamaCare, the existing bill that we have, the Affordable Care Act, gives them that, not as well as it should. We should make improvements to it. It is not an improvement to throw 24 million people off of coverage, increase the cost, and institute a crushing age tax.  Why?  It is to give a tax benefit of $2.8 billion to the richest 400 families in the United This bill would be the largest transfer of wealth from low- and mostly middle-income people to the top 1 percent in American history.  Let me just address one last thing. People are being bribed to vote for this bill. People are being bribed legally. Provisions are being put in the bill to say: Hey, if you vote for this bill, you will benefit, your State will benefit.  There is nothing wrong with that. It has been done before.  Let's take a look at one of those bribes, the so-called New York bribe. New York, along with 15 other States, takes advantage or utilizes a provision in the law that has been in the law since 1965 in Medicaid in which the State share of Medicaid is borne partially by the State and partially by local governments. Sixteen States have elected to do that.  This bill says that New York State only will be prohibited from sharing the burden of Medicaid with local governments. So $2.3 billion will be shifted from various local governments onto the State's taxpayers, except for New York Upstate counties will lose their share. New York City will have to keep it. The State will have to bear the burden. So it is a $2.3 billion increase for State taxpayers.  Now, eight Republicans, we are told, from upstate New York are going to vote for this bill just because of that. They don't like the bill in other respects, but because of that provision, which will relieve some of the burden from local counties, they are going to vote for the bill; and they say so. Representative Collins of New York said so. He would vote for that bill. He got a number of other people to agree. That is why the provision is in the bill.  But it is not going to happen. It is flatly unconstitutional. They are selling their votes for something that is never going to happen, and that is just wrong. This bill should not be approved. It is a sellout to the people of the entire country.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2297.txt,850,OPPOSING AMERICANS LOSING THEIR HEALTH CARE,2017.0,22.0,March

1070,topic-id,2374,"Mr.President, we have seen TV clips about various Members and Senators around the country having townhall meetings. For example, three of our colleagues this past weekend--Indiana was one of them--had tremendous townhall meetings with a good exchange of information.  With this looming House of Representatives healthcare bill, which I refer to as TrumpCare, since the President has endorsed it, I wanted to see a particular group in our society who is extremely vulnerable and those are the older Americans who are not 65--not old enough to be eligible for Now, be careful because there are people lurking in these halls and the administration who would like to raise Medicare eligibility from age 65 to 67. But that is not what is confronting the House of Representatives; it is what is going to happen to those people below the age of 65 for their healthcare. Under current law, once they hit 65, they are eligible for  I reached out to a particular group of These are folks whom I did not know that our offices in Florida had become aware of because they had written about the healthcare debate that is going on and, in many cases, had described their circumstances.  Yesterday, the group of 8 or 10 whom we had in my Orlando office were all in the age range of 50 to 64. I want to tell the Senate about this group of people because, if approved in its current form, the House healthcare bill, TrumpCare, would dramatically increase healthcare costs for folks in that age group, 50 to 64. Those are folks who either get their healthcare through expanded Medicaid or they get their health insurance through healthcare.gov, which is the exchange, whether it be on the State exchange or the Federal exchange because the State does not participate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, a 64-year-old making $26,500 could see their[[Page S1873]]healthcare costs go from $1,700 a year, which they pay now under the Affordable Care Act, all the way up to $14,600 a year under the House plan, That is a dramatic jump, obviously. Do we think that is really too much of an extreme example?  I want to tell you what these people said. If you look at what the House is proposing, the dramatic rise in cost is due in large part to two provisions contained in the House bill, one that would allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times as much as younger people; the second one caps the Federal tax credits meant to help seniors pay for the rising cost of health insurance. Federal tax credits is a fancy way of saying ``subsidy.'' So if you are a senior and you are above 138 percent of poverty, which for a single individual is approximately $16,000 a year--by the way, who making $16,000 a year can afford health insurance? That is why we need the remaining 19 States, my State of Florida included, to expand Medicaid up to that 138 percent of poverty. But if someone is between that level and all the way up to 400 percent of the poverty level, which for a single individual is about $46,000, $47,000 a year--in that zone of 138 percent of poverty up to 400 percent of poverty, there are these tax credits or subsidies. The one with the lower income gets more of a subsidy in order to buy private health insurance on the private marketplace through the exchange. As they get up to 400 percent, a person making $46,000 or $47,000 a year--can they really afford health insurance? Not the real cost, unless it is some huge deductible plan that doesn't give them much. That is why these folks need some assistance. That is in place. That is the law. That is the Affordable Care Act, which has been so maligned over the last several years.  Aside from health insurance, there is the expansion of Medicaid that has helped a lot of people. There are still 4 million people in this country who would benefit if those 19 remaining States would expand Medicaid up to 138 percent. They are left in the cold. They are not getting health insurance; they are not getting healthcare. They are eligible to have it, and the Federal money is there to draw down to enable them to have that Medicaid, but 19 States, including my State of Florida, have decided not to expand it.  With all of that as background, I asked these folks to come in. According to the AARP, there are millions of Floridians in that age group of 50 to 64 who currently receive Medicaid or tax credits to help them pay for the insurance through healthcare.gov; there are millions who are eligible. So the group came in, and here's what I learned. I am going to give you some personal vignettes.  Marshall Stern is a 61-year-old heart transplant survivor who lives in Kissimmee, Marshall has had a serious heart condition since he was a young man. Three years ago, his condition worsened, and it resulted in several hospitalizations, after which he was told he would need a heart transplant. Since he is on full disability, he was told that he had to enroll in Medicaid or he would not be eligible for the transplant. Just the medication for the posttransplant operation costs around $100,000 a year, which, obviously, Marshall would not be able to afford without Medicaid coverage. He also is going to have to take this medication for the rest of his life if he is going to live. He worries that the House TrumpCare bill will turn Medicaid into a block grant program, which is a fancy way of saying: We are going to cut it off, and you are not going to get any more money, and you are going to have to finance it from your own State resources. Governors and State legislatures are going to have to share more of the burden of healthcare costs. He is worried that if that House bill passes and Medicaid is threatened as we know it, he is not going to be able to have the medications he needs to stay alive. This is what Marshall told me, and it was very dramatic. He said: ``It is as good as saying that I die.''  For the rest of us who are not facing that, imagine having a fellow tell you that. This is serious business.  Let me tell you about Susanna She is a 62-year-old living in Altamonte Susanna's husband lost his job in 2009, and she lost her employer-provided health plan during the recession. The couple blew through their IRA, and they ended up selling nearly everything they had.  They eventually moved out of the country to save money, but in 2014, they decided to move back. Why? Because the Affordable Care Act passed, and the ACA made it possible for them to afford health insurance again. This is what Susanna said:       If they shred [the ACA] like they're [threatening] to,      we're going to be hightailing it out of here, because dealing      with the health care [costs] and insurance makes you sick.      We're getting by, but if the ACA goes away, and if they make      these changes they're talking about, we'll be uninsured      again.  I was going to show you a picture. These are the folks whom I met with yesterday. I will not point out the individuals, and I am going to talk about some of the others, but you can see almost everybody. There is one person who is outside the photograph. But we sat down for an hour's conversation, and I heard their stories.  I wish every Senator and every Member of Congress would go out and talk to people who are real people with real problems and understand how petrified they are. These folks look like our neighbors and our friends. They look like the people whom we go to church with. They look like the people who have children or grandchildren whom we play with, and they are petrified. They are scared to death that they are not going to have healthcare.  So let me tell you about another one of these ladies. Terri Falbo is a 59-year-old living in the Orlando area. She moved to Florida back in 2012 to take care of her elderly mother and disabled sister. For 25 years she had good health insurance through her employer where she lived up north, and she rarely used health insurance. After losing her job in 2006, as we went into the beginnings of the recession, she purchased an individual insurance policy that cost her $500 to $650 a month. Prior to the ACA, she had to make withdrawals from her retirement account. She had to max out her credit cards to pay for the premiums. As a result, she depleted all of her reserves and all of her retirement funds. Since the Affordable Care Act was implemented, she has had an affordable policy because she qualifies for the monthly subsidy of over $600, bringing her premium payments to $70 a month with a zero deductible. She could have gotten a policy with a $5,000 deductible for $3 a month. At her age, she needed assurance that she would be able to have the healthcare she needed, so she paid $70 a month because of the subsidy. Yet that is not what is protecting her in the House TrumpCare bill.  Under that proposed healthcare plan, her maximum subsidy would be less than $300 a month, which means she would end up paying $4,000 more per year--an amount that she simply cannot afford. That is what she told me: ``I cannot afford it.'' She said she would have to go without health insurance instead. Before the ACA, she was desperately trying to have health insurance, and she depleted all of her retirement funds.  There is another lady who is sitting around that table in the picture I showed, Nancy She is a 51-year-old self-employed actor who is living in She is active. She is healthy. She chose to pursue a career in the arts. The unstable nature of her profession has often left her unable to afford health insurance. So she has gone without it most of her adult life as an artist, as a performer.  Since the ACA took effect, however, she has, finally, been able to afford health insurance, thanks to the subsidies. She told me that it has been a relief for her to be able to go to the doctor not only for checkups but, actually, when she has a problem, to fix it.  If Congress passes the House TrumpCare bill, her premiums are going to go up. She has no doubt that she will, once again, be unable to afford health insurance and healthcare. She told me that she fears simple health issues will fester, becoming serious, chronic, and expensive to treat. Remember, I said they were petrified--that they were scared to death. There is an example. Finally, she has health insurance after all of these years of going without because she did not have an employer who paid for her.  Let's take another one. Marilyn Word is a 63-year-old retiree living in Marilyn lives mainly off of Social Security payments but is not[[Page S1874]]old enough to qualify for She is under that magic year of age 65, at which one is eligible.  After retiring, Marilyn enrolled in an insurance plan through the ACA exchange, and she is eligible for annual tax credits to help her pay for her insurance. Marilyn told me that she was extremely worried about the increased premiums that she would likely have to pay under the House TrumpCare plan.  I will give you another example of a lady who is sitting around that table. Sharon Brown is a 58-year-old widow. She lives in the Orlando area. Since her husband's death, Sharon has been dealing with several medical issues and pulling money out of her retirement account to pay for her current plan. She has a nest egg from her husband's life insurance money, but due to her health condition, she will likely need long-term medical care. This is what she told me:       My premium's pretty high because I've got multiple medical      conditions that make it so I cannot work. I've done a lot of      reading on this . . . and the cost of my healthcare [under      the TrumpCare plan] will amount to double what I make right      now in income.  She looked at me with this pained expression on her face and said: ``It's very scary, and the anxiety that goes along with this happening right now is making it worse.''  Sharon told me that she is a lifelong registered Republican--she volunteered this--and she said that the bill being considered now is forcing her to reconsider her party. She said:       I'm changing my political affiliation to independent. I      want to vote my conscience.  When one puts faces to these stories--to these people about whom I have just talked and about whom we just talked yesterday--the House TrumpCare plan ends Medicaid as we know it because it cuts off the amount going to the  I understand that in the House, in trying to fix up some things just last night, they filed an amendment in an attempt to address some of the problems. One of the things they were trying to fix would allow States to choose between capping or block-granting the Medicaid Under either proposal, the Federal Government is going to be contributing less to the States, and that means more money will have to be picked up--the tab--by the Just ask the Governors how much more they can pick up.  I urge our House and Senate colleagues to join all of these people whom I have talked about and vote as Sharon said--with their consciences on what they are going to do to folks like them. Gutting Medicaid and forcing struggling, older Americans to pay more for health insurance is simply not the right thing to do. For a change, we ought to be trying to do the right thing.

1425,topic-id,861,"Madam President, there has been a lot of conversation from so many of our fellow Senators about the opioid crisis that has been devastating individuals and families across the country. We heard this particularly in New Hampshire as it was a topic of discussion last fall during the election. It was an opportunity to bring to the Nation's attention--because of the eyes being focused first on the New Hampshire primary--of a real opioid crisis.  What we also then discussed was that it was not just affecting a few States, it was affecting most of the That is the case with my State of Addiction to opioids has reached staggering levels, and the situation is only getting worse. In 2015, more than 33,000 Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses. That is 15 percent more people than had died just the previous year. I don't have the figures for last year, 2016.  So Florida is right there in that national trend. What Florida saw between 2014 and 2015 was a 22.7-percent increase. It is staggering because in that year, Florida suffered over 2,000 deaths from opioid overdoses. Earlier this month, our office interviewed a woman from Florida for yesterday's Committee on Aging's hearing.  She is caring for her 7-year-old grandson because his mother lost custody, was later incarcerated due to her drug addiction. Sadly, this story is all too familiar. The number of grandparents serving as the primary caretakers for their grandchildren is increasing, as was the case with the lady from Florida who testified at the Committee on Aging hearing this week. They are primary caretakers for their grandchildren. It is, in large part, because of the opioid epidemic.  In addition to the devastating loss of life and the challenges for the new caregivers, opioid abuse is straining local and State budgets. Just last month, the vice mayor of Palm Beach County sent a letter to the Governor urging him to declare a public health[[Page S1908]]emergency in Florida citing the loss of life and financial impact--in this case to Palm Beach  Yesterday, several of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the majority leader of the Senate highlighting some of our concerns with the House of Representative's healthcare bill that I call TrumpCare and how it is going to impact those with substance abuse disorders because one of the things we are most concerned about is how the proposed changes in Medicaid that they are going to vote on at the other end of the hall--right down here tomorrow, they are going to vote on the House of Representative's healthcare TrumpCare bill.  The changes they make to Medicaid would prevent States from being able to respond to the opioid crisis because Medicaid plays a critical role in the fight against opioids, but changing the Medicaid Program to a block grant or a cap is going to shift costs to the The States are not going to pick up that additional cost. It is going to eliminate also some of the Federal protections, and it is only going to hurt our people who rely on Medicaid to help them as we are combating this opioid crisis because with less Federal funding, how are States like mine going to provide the necessary services to help individuals with substance abuse disorders?  Congress ought to be doing more to help with this crisis, not less. How many times have you heard a Senator, like this Senator, come to the floor and talk about the opioid epidemic? Yet we are just about to do it to ourselves if we pass this TrumpCare bill. Remember, last year, while so many of us, including this Senator, were early supporters of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016--it was signed into law last year. The law takes a comprehensive approach to this opioid problem.  A few months ago, a lot of us, including this Senator, voted to provide additional funding to start implementing this crucial new law to fight opioid addiction. Despite this progress, the House tomorrow--probably, tomorrow night--is about to pass legislation that would completely undermine last year's bipartisan efforts to respond to the epidemic and to undercut healthcare for millions of people in this country.  Opioid abuse is a deadly, serious problem, and we cannot ignore it. We should be investing more resources into helping these people and their families, not cutting them at the time we need them the most.  Again, I make a plea. We made progress last year with the law. We passed the new law. We made progress, giving some additional funding. The crisis hasn't gone away. We still need to respond.  But at the very same time, what we see happening to the Medicaid Program--eliminating Medicaid as we know it, healthcare for the people who are the least fortunate among us--is that we are about to cut back on all that progress we have made on this opioid crisis. I hope that we will think better of this and not do it to ourselves.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING The clerk will call the roll.

1455,topic-id,3344,"Mr.President, we are talking about taking privacy rights away from individuals if we suddenly eliminate this rule. Do you want a large company that is an internet provider, that has all the personal, sensitive information because of what you have been doing on the internet--do you want that company to be able to use that for commercial purposes without your consent? That is the issue.  If you want to protect people's privacy, I would think you would want to require that an individual who has paid money for the internet provider to provide them with the internet--you go on the internet, and you go to whatever site you want. You do business. You do personal business. You do banking. You go on the internet and you buy things. You talk about your children's school, about when you are going to pick up your children, maybe what your children want to wear to school. You want to talk on the internet about anything that is personal. Do you want that internet provider to have access to[[Page S1926]]that information to be used for commercial purposes without your consent? If you ask that question to the American people, they are going to give you a big, resounding no.  Should the internet provider use that information if you give your consent? Then that is fair game. If you give your consent so that they can alert you before a certain day--you might want to give a certain gift to your wife on her birthday, and they might have all that information, but maybe you don't want them to have the information about where your children go to school.  Personal, sensitive information is what we are talking about; therefore, the whole issue here is, do you want the internet provider to be able to use that information without the person's consent, or do you want the person to have to actually effectively opt-in in order to give the internet provider that consent? To me, this is a clear-cut case of privacy.  You can fancy it up, talking about FCC rules and so forth--and we have the author of the Telecom Act, Senator Markey, here, and he is going to talk about this and protections that were put in for telephones. But back then, remember, it was just you call from this number to this number on such and such a day for such and such a period of time. Even that was protected. But now--just think about this--we are talking about all the personal transactions that you do every day through the internet.  So I rise today in opposition to this resolution brought under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove the Federal Communications Commission's broadband consumer privacy rules. I would think that the distinguished Senator sitting in the Chair, who values privacy as he does--that this is going to be something he would be concerned about, as well as every other Senator in this Chamber, because you know that if you ask your constituents ``Do you want your privacy invaded without your consent?'' you know what the answer is going to be.  Americans care about their online privacy. They want to have control over how their personal information is exploited by third parties. In fact, a recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 91 percent of adults feel they have lost control of how their personal information is collected and then used. That same study found that 74 percent of Americans believe it is very important that they be in control of who can get information about them, and a majority believe that their travels around the internet--the sites they visit and how long they spend in that location--are sensitive information that should be protected. I hope the Senators are going to pay attention to this because we are talking about sensitive, personal information.  Do you know that your geolocation is something that you are transmitting over the internet? Do you want your location and where you have been to be in the hands of somebody who could use that for commercial purposes? I don't think so. That is why this past October the FCC provided broadband subscribers with tools to allow them to have greater control over how their personal online information is used, shared, and then sold.  The FCC has been protecting telephone customers' privacy for decades, and it updated its longstanding privacy protections to protect the privacy of broadband customers. In fact, it is safe to say that what the FCC did last October was the most comprehensive update to its consumer privacy and data protection rules in decades.  The FCC put in place clear rules that require broadband providers to seek their subscribers' specific and informed consent before using or sharing sensitive personal information and give broadband customers the right to opt out of having their nonsensitive information used and shared if they chose to do so. The FCC also gave broadband subscribers additional confidence in the protection and security of their data by putting in place reasonable data security and breach notification requirements for broadband providers.  Simply put, the FCC decided to put American consumers--each one of us who pays these monthly fees for our broadband service--in the driver's seat of how their personal online data is used and shared by the broadband provider to which they have been paying a monthly fee to use their service. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.  Please understand that broadband providers know a lot about every one of us. In fact, it may be startling, the picture that your broadband provider can develop about your daily habits and then sell to the highest bidder.  Your home broadband provider can know when you wake up every day either by knowing the time each morning that you log on to the internet to check the weather and news of the morning or through a connected device in your home.  That provider may know immediately that you are not feeling well, that you kind of feel sick, assuming you peruse the internet, like most of us do, to get a quick check on your symptoms. In fact, your broadband provider may know more about your health and your reaction to illness than you are willing to share with your doctor. Think about that.  Personal privacy? If you let this go to the highest bidder, personal privacy of sensitive information is going to be out the window.  Your home broadband provider can build a profile about your listening and viewing habits given that today most of us access music, news, and video programming over broadband.  Your broadband provider may have a better financial picture of you than even your bank or your brokerage firm or your financial adviser because they see every website you visit across every device in your home and can build a thorough profile about you through these habits.  If you live in a connected home, the home of the future--and the future is now, by the way--they may know even more details about how you go about your day-to-day activities. Your mobile broadband provider knows how you move about through the day, your geolocation. They know through information about that geolocation and the internet activity. All of that is through--guess what--this mobile device. Don't you think this is connected to the internet? And that is not to mention the sort of profile a broadband provider can start to build about our children from their birth. It is a gold mine of data, the holy grail, so to speak.  It is no wonder that broadband providers want to be able to sell this information to the highest bidder without the consumer's knowledge or consent. And they want to collect and use this information without providing transparency or being held accountable. Is this what you want to inflict upon your constituents in your State by changing this rule about their personal, sensitive privacy? I don't think so. You better know what you are doing when you vote tomorrow. This vote is coming about noon tomorrow. You better know.  As a country, we have not stood for this in the past, this kind of free utilization of information by entities that may want to have a unique look at who we are. We place stringent limits on the use of information by our doctors. We place stringent limits on our banks. When it comes to our children, I mean, that ought to be off-limits.  Broadband providers can build similar profiles about us and in fact may be able to provide more detail about someone than any one of those entities can. Passing this Senate resolution will take consumers out of the driver's seat and place the collection and use of their information behind a veil of secrecy, despite the rhetoric surrounding our debate today suggesting that eliminating these commonsense rules will better protect consumers' privacy online or will eliminate consumer confusion.  Don't fall for that argument, In fact, the resolution will wipe out thoughtful rules that were the product of months of hard work by the experts at the agency on regulating communications networks of all kinds. Those rules were crafted based upon a thorough record developed through an extensive multimonth rulemaking proceeding. The FCC received more than one-quarter of a million filings during this proceeding. They listened to the American people.  The agency received extensive input from stakeholders in all quarters of the debate, from the broadband providers and telephone companies to the public interest groups and from academics to individual consumers. We are going to wipe all of this away at noon tomorrow[[Page S1927]]with a vote that you can do it by 50 votes in this Chamber? I don't think this is what the people want.  On top of this, the rules are based on longstanding privacy protections maintained by the FCC for telephone companies, as well as the work of and the principles advocated by the Federal Trade Commission and advocated by State attorneys general and others in protecting consumer privacy. The FCC rules put in place basic safeguards for consumers' privacy based on three concepts that are widely accepted as the basis for privacy regulation in the United States and around the world: notice, choice--individual choice, consumer choice--and security, those three. They are not the radical proposals that some would have you believe they are.  First, the rules require broadband providers to notify their customers about what types of information it collects about the individual customers, when they disclose or permit access to that information, and how customers can provide consent to that collection and disclosure.  Second, the rules give consumers choice by requiring broadband providers to obtain a customer's affirmative opt in; in other words, I give you my consent before you can use or share my sensitive personal information.  As I mentioned earlier, sensitive information includes a customer's precise geographic location--I don't think you want some people to know exactly where you are--your personal information, health, financial, information about your children, your Social Security number--how many laws do we have protecting Social Security numbers--the content you have accumulated on the web, web browsing, and application usage information.  For information considered nonsensitive, broadband providers must allow customers to opt out of use and sharing of such information. Broadband providers must provide a simple, persistently available means for customers to exercise their privacy choices.  Third, broadband providers are required to take reasonable measures to protect customers' information from unauthorized use, disclosure, or access. They must also comply with specific breach notifications. In other words, if somebody has busted the internet and stolen all of this information from the site, don't you think you ought to be notified that your personal information was hacked? Well, that is one of the requirements.  So then I ask my colleagues: What in the world is wrong with requiring broadband providers to give their paying customers clear, understandable, and accurate information about what confidential and potentially highly personal information those companies collect? What is wrong with getting their consent to collect that information from their subscribers?  What is wrong with telling customers how their information is collected when they use their broadband service? What is wrong with telling customers with whom they share this sensitive information? What is wrong with letting customers have a say in how their information is used? What is wrong with recognizing that information about a consumer's browsing history and ap usage, sensitive and personal information, should be held to a higher standard before it is shared with others? What is wrong with all of that?  What is wrong with seeking a parent's consent before information about their children's activities or location is sold to the highest bidder? Do we as parents not go out of our way to protect our children's well-being and their privacy? Trying to overturn this rule is what is wrong.  What is wrong with protecting consumers from being forced to sign away their privacy rights in order to subscribe to a broadband service? I want your internet service. Do I have to sign away the rights to my private information--private, sensitive information? What is wrong with making companies take reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of consumers' data?  What is wrong with making companies notify their subscribers when they have had a breach? Again, I ask my colleagues: What in the world is wrong with giving consumers increased choice, transparency, and security online?  Supporters of the joint resolution fail to acknowledge the negative impact this resolution is going to have on the American people. This regulation is going to wipe away a set of reasonable, commonsense protections. I want to emphasize that. Is it common sense to protect our personal, sensitive, private information? Of course it is. But we are just about--in a vote at noon tomorrow, with a majority vote, not a 60-vote threshold, a majority vote here--we are just about to wipe all of that out. It will open our internet browsing histories and application usage patterns up to exploitation for commercial purposes by broadband providers and third parties who will line up to buy your information.  It will create a privacy-free zone for broadband companies, with no Federal regulator having effective tools to set rules of the road for collection, use, and sale of that uniquely personal information of yours. It will tie the hands of the FCC because they cannot go back. Once this rule is overturned, they cannot go back and redo this rule. It will tie the hands of the Federal Communications Commission and eliminate the future ability to adopt clear, effective privacy and data security protections for you as a subscriber, in some cases even for telephone subscribers.  To be sure, there are those who disagree with the FCC's broadband consumer privacy rules. There is an avenue for those complaints. These same companies that are pushing the joint resolution have filed for reconsideration of the rule at the FCC, and there is a judicial system. That is the appropriate way. Go back and get the FCC to amend--if you all are so concerned--or let the judicial system work its will, but do not do it in one fell swoop in a majority rule in this body tomorrow at noon.  In fact, the critics of the FCC's rules have an open proceeding at the FCC in which they can argue on the record with an opportunity for full public participation to change and alter these rules.  If the FCC did it--you have a new FCC, a new Chairman, a new majority on the FCC--let them be the ones to amend the rules after all the safeguards of the open hearings, of the comment period, all of that. By contrast, what we are using here to invade our privacy is a blunt congressional instrument called the Congressional Review It means that all aspects of the rules adopted by the FCC must be overturned at once, including changes to the FCC's telephone privacy rules.  It would deny the agency the power to protect consumers' privacy online, and it would prevent the FCC--get this--prevent them, the FCC, the regulatory body that now has a new chairman and a new majority--it would prevent the FCC from ever adopting even similar rules. I don't think that is what we want to do because it does not make sense. That is exactly what we are about to do.  I also want to address the argument that the FCC rules are unfair to broadband providers because the same rules do not apply to other companies in the internet ecosystem. Supporters of this resolution will argue that the other entities in the internet ecosystem have access to the same personal information that the broadband providers do.  They argue that everyone in the data collection business should be on a level playing field. Well, I ask my colleagues whether they have asked their constituents that question directly. Do Americans really believe that all persons who hold data about them should be treated the same? I venture to guess that most Americans would agree with the FCC that companies that are able to build detailed particulars about you and build those particular pictures about your lives through unique insights because of what you do every day in their internet usage--shouldn't those companies be held to a higher standard?  In addition, the FCC's rules still allow broadband providers to collect and use their subscribers' information. The providers merely need to obtain consent from those activities when it comes to their subscribers' highly sensitive information.  The FCC also found that broadband providers, unlike any other companies in the internet ecosystem, are uniquely able to see every packet of information that a subscriber sends and receives--every packet of information that you[[Page S1928]]send or receive over the internet while on their networks. So if you have a provider, they are on your iPhone, and you are using them, they are seeing everything. That is not the case if you go to Google because Google sees only what you do while you are on But the internet provider, the pipe that is carrying your information--they see everything that you do.  Supporters of the joint resolution also hold out the superiority of the Federal Trade Commission's efforts on protecting privacy. They argue that there should be only one privacy cop on the beat. But, folks, that ignores reality. The FTC doesn't do everything. There are a number of privacy cops on the beat. Congress has given the FCC, the FTC, the FDA, and NHTSA regulatory authority to protect consumers' privacy.  You had better get this clear because the FCC is the only agency to which Congress has given statutory authority to adopt rules to protect broadband customers' privacy. The FTC, the Federal Trade Commission, does not have the rulemaking authority in data security, even though commissioners at the FTC have asked Congress for such authority in the past. Given recent court cases, the FTC now faces even more insurmountable legal obstacles to taking action, protecting broadband consumers' privacy.  So don't be fooled by this argument that folks are telling you over here that it ought to be the FTC, the Federal Trade As many have pointed out, elimination of the FCC's rules will result in a very wide chasm, where broadband and cable companies have no discernible regulation while internet ``edge'' companies abide by the FTC enforcement efforts.  Without clear rules of the road, broadband subscribers will have no certainty of choice about how their private information can be used and no protection against its abuse--no protection, my fellow Americans, of your personal, sensitive, private data. That is why this Senator supports the FCC's broadband consumer privacy rules.  I want to encourage my fellow Senators: You had better examine what you are about to do to people's personal privacy before you vote to overturn this rule tomorrow.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the joint resolution.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.Tillis).

1330,topic-id,580,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for that introduction.  I want to thank my colleagues for presenting their profound thoughts on this most important legislation that we will consider tomorrow. The simple truth is that what this bill does is it removes 24 million people and takes them away from having affordable health care and health insurance, while, at the same time, giving $600 billion in tax cuts for the richest people in Some pundits have described it as one of the biggest transfers of wealth and travesties perpetuated upon the American people in American history.  I am calling upon the Republicans here in this Chamber and President Trump to withdraw this legislation, sit down in a bipartisan way--the way this Congress operated for several hundred years under open rules--and see what we can do to fix what is wrong with the American healthcare system, not do away with it and scrap it in the devastating manner that they have chosen to do so.  The simple truth is, as I said, this guts Medicaid, and it guts health care. Under this $600 billion tax break, think about it, if you make $1 million a year, every year you are going to get a $67,000 a year tax cut. Imagine that. That is more money than the average person makes in America in a year, and they are going to get that every year going forward in perpetuity, while we are saying to a young family who is struggling maybe because someone in the family has cancer or maybe somebody got hurt or injured in an accident, oh, that is going to cost too much money to insure you, you are one of the 24 million who we are getting rid of.  What kind of a country is it that would do something like that? My colleague, Mr.Kennedy, I thought, stated it so well. We are all in this together. That is what insurance does. Life is perilous at best. We don't know who is going to get sick. We don't know who is going to have an accident. It may be when you are elderly; it may be when you are young. That is what health care and health insurance is all about, coming together and making sure that we all are cared for and get the care that we need when we need it.  Senator Kennedy talked about preventive care. If you can catch prostate cancer or if you can catch lung cancer at a stage I or a stage II level, you save a life. But you have to have insurance to go do that and see your doctor. If you don't have insurance, guess what? You don't get a diagnosis until it is at the third or fourth stage level, at which point it is too late, costs tremendous amounts of money to treat, and, most likely, the prospects for survival are not good.  Mr.Speaker, I call on the President and my colleagues, please, the President in particular, honor the promise that you made to the American people in your campaign which resonated with enough people to get you elected President of the United Stand up for the elderly, stand up for urban and rural, stand up for all Americans, stand up for rural communities, and rural hospitals.

How many of you--how many of us--could pay $10,000 a month, no matter what job we have? That, along with her diabetes, makes her a paradigm of the kind of person whose life and death depends on this bill.  I want to just say a few words not about all of the important information you have had, but about what I call the worst of the worst.  First, let me congratulate my Republican colleagues on doubling down on the number without health care because you double the number without health care. As we are rising with the number who have health care, you now turn downward. We can't possibly live with that, and I don't think the American people will allow you to get away with it.  I think about our hospitals, and people say: Why should we pay any attention to the hospitals? Well, when we get back in the era of uncompensated care, what you will have is the Federal Government will never compensate your hospital, so you will compensate your hospital. We are back in the era of free health care, except there is no such thing as free health care. You and I will be paying for it out of our pockets.  What they do to the tax credits is shameful. Flat tax credits, unrelated to the costs, replace the kind of tax credits we have in the Affordable Care Act, which are just, as you might expect, up and down according to the value of insurance.  What good is a flat tax credit unrelated to the cost of insurance or to your income? Do my Republican colleagues really think they are going to fool anybody with those kinds of replacements?  What is perhaps worst of the worst is the work requirement. You get sick, you can't afford to work, you have got to be on the Affordable Care Act, and you need Medicaid in order to do it. They tell you that you have got to go to work in order to--while you are sick, I guess--get your Get sick, go to work, and qualify for health care under the Republican plan.  Those are just some of the worst of the worst. I have got a whole list here, but I thought it important to focus on who gets hurt and why, and why we are simply not going to let that happen.

722,topic-id,380,"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.1029, the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017.  Once again, Madam Speaker, I stand before you to urge the passage of H.1029. As we know, the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of pesticides. To facilitate and expedite that pesticide approval process, pesticide manufacturers have long supplemented the EPA's annual budget. This system allows the products to be reviewed in a timely manner, without sacrificing environmental and safety protections. It is truly a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers, and, as you heard Mr.Davis speak about, it is a clear example of government at its best. It is exactly why I enjoy working on the Committee on It is exactly why I enjoy working with people such as Rodney We have a bipartisan, effective, public-private legislative solution for a more predictable pesticide evaluation process that literally helps everybody.  The Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, H.1029, is an exceptional piece of legislation not only because it is supported by a unique coalition of pesticide registrants, environmental groups, and agricultural labor representatives, but H.1029 provides a more effective, predictable, and transparent pesticide evaluation process. It promotes shorter review periods for reduced-risk pesticides and enhances scientific and regulatory activities related to farmworker protection.  My district on the central coast of California is not only bountiful in its agriculture, it is absolutely beautiful with its environment. Therefore, we on the central coast work hard to find that balance of being known as the salad bowl of the world and one of the most scenic places in the world. That is why our agriculture producers are the most thoughtful stewards of the land and recognize the need to protect the environment and the natural resources.  This legislation facilitates that balance. This legislation provides a unique coalition building and encourages the agriculture industry to work with environmentalists. Thus, H.1029 helps all of us who live and work in our community and, ultimately, our country. That is why I am absolutely honored to speak in this debate, humbled to share the floor with Representative Davis, and why I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

1655,topic-id,2553,"Mr.President, sovereign nations across the globe are brought together by different unifying forces. It can be a shared heritage, language, religion, or outside historical forces that led to borders drawn decades or centuries ago.  As a nation, we are unique. We are diverse in every sense of the word, but even in these polarizing times, we are overwhelmingly unified. We are unified by our belief in democracy, free enterprise, and economic opportunity. We are all entrusted in nurturing the ideas enshrined in our Constitution--the idea that our system of democratic government enables us to work toward a more perfect union. At a time when the promise of democracy is receding for far too many around the world, we must do everything we can to uphold our country's free and fair elections, the foundation of our democracy.  Our elections should serve as a global benchmark for the peaceful transition of power. As President Reagan said, we must be ``the shining city upon the hill,'' and we must lead by example. Our elections require a strong and steady commitment from our newly naturalized citizens; from families whose families fought in the Revolutionary War; from volunteers who cover 16-hour shifts to keep polling locations open; from country, city, and township clerks.  The preservation of free and fair elections requires a strong commitment from our highest elected official in the land. As Americans, we look to the President of the United States to safeguard our democracy from foreign adversaries.  When we are presented with clear and mounting evidence that the Russian Government, at the personal discretion of Russian President Vladimir Putin, orchestrated a campaign to undermine this most fundamental institution and interfere in our election, we should expect nothing less than a clear and forceful response from the White House that this kind of behavior is simply unacceptable. Unfortunately, what we have seen from President Trump and the White House so far amounts to little more than confusion, evasion, and a whole lot of smoke.  President Trump has spoken time and again about wanting to build closer ties with On the campaign trail, he frequently fawned over Putin's strength as a leader. In 2013, he asked his Twitter followers, ``Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow--if so, will he become my new best friend?''  While I don't believe that Putin attended the pageant, the nature of the Putin-Trump relationship remains an open question. It confuses me and quite frankly alarms me that President Trump speaks so fondly of a man who brutally cracks down on his political opponents and journalists at home while stirring up conflict and aggressions abroad.  Make no mistake, Vladimir Putin is no friend of the United States or of the American people. Our Nation's intelligence agencies agree with high confidence that his government orchestrated a campaign to undermine the integrity of our recent election, and Putin has sought at every turn to destabilize the international order that has kept the American people and our allies secure for decades.  Russia's interference in our election was not an isolated incident. It is part of a broader effort to undermine the NATO alliance and weaken western democracies. I heard from our French and German allies at the Munich Security Conference last month about their concerns that Russia will continue to engage in disinformation campaigns in European elections. As we aspire to be the free-market driven, democratic ``city upon a hill,'' Putin's government works to sow chaos globally in an effort to further consolidate power in his nationalist, self-enriching regime.  These attempts to destabilize Russia's neighbors and rivals are not limited to cyber space and computer code. These provocations involve military aircraft, ships, nuclear capable missiles, heavy artillery, drones, and efforts to redraw international borders.  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe that the highest duty of Congress is to keep Americans safe. Russia's dangerous and unprofessional military provocations not only place American servicemembers and NATO allies at risk, they endanger civilian lives and raise the specter of escalating regional conflict.  Just last month, Russian aircraft flew within a few hundred feet of the USS Porter in international waters in a dangerous mock attack--an action the ship's captain called out as ``unsafe and unprofessional.''  Last summer, while on a congressional delegation to meet with NATO allies, I heard directly from Estonian leaders about Russia's blatant disregard for their sovereignty. Russian forces kidnapped a border guard in Estonian territory and sentenced him behind closed doors to 15 years in prison, in what a top European Union official called ``a clear violation of international law.''  We have seen the Russians fly reconnaissance and fighter jets in international airspace, with their transponders switched off in order to avoid detection--at one point, nearly colliding in midair with a passenger airplane. NATO has been forced to scramble jets almost 800 times--let me repeat[[Page S1966]]that: 800 times--in 2016 alone, just to respond to Russia's encroachments on NATO airspace.  As the President speaks glowingly about Putin, Mr.Putin returns the favor by deploying a dangerous new cruise missile, in clear violation of the Reagan-era Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Simultaneously, a Russian spy ship has been spotted lurking off the U.coast, trying to gather intelligence information near the Navy's primary east coast submarine base.  We are also seeing Russia undertake the largest military buildup in the Arctic since the end of the Cold War and at a pace faster than we ever, ever saw during the Soviet era.  Russia is reopening defunct military outposts and building new ones all across the polar region. There are 13 new Russian airfields that are scheduled to open by the end of this year. The Russian military recently staged an exercise in the Arctic region with well over 12,000 troops.  As the Russians build up their forces in the Arctic, the United States is falling behind. Our principal maritime force in the Arctic is the U.Coast Guard, but they have only one heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star, that is capable of keeping Arctic shipping lanes open or conducting search and rescue missions year-round. A new icebreaker to replace the Polar Star is still a few years away.  In contrast, the Russians have over 40 icebreakers in their fleet, many of them nuclear, with plans for three new icebreakers underway. At a time when we should be investing in our Arctic capabilities, the Trump administration has been considering deep cuts to the Coast Guard's budget.  Russia's expansionist activities and military probing are not occurring in a vacuum. The numerous threats and provocations that I have outlined occur as Russia continues to wage war in eastern Ukraine in the wake of their illegal annexation of Crimea, destabilizing the opportunity for the Ukrainian people to chart their own political and economic destiny. There are 10,000 people who have lost their lives in this conflict as a direct result of Russian aggression.  Last year, as I traveled with my Senate colleagues to Estonia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine, I learned firsthand about the efforts in these countries to strengthen their civil institutions and root out corruption, build lasting partnerships, and stand up to Russian provocations. While they are doing their part, they continue to look to the United States for global leadership.  This year, U.troops deployed to Eastern Europe to demonstrate our ironclad commitment to our NATO allies, where they were welcomed with open arms. We are working with our partners in Iceland to enhance their capabilities to detect and respond to a recent increase in Russian submarine patrols.  I am also proud to stand with the airmen of the 127th Wing of the Michigan Air National Guard, who deployed from my State to build on their long record of successful cooperation with our partners in  When the Kremlin is threatening our allies, buzzing our Navy warships, and meddling in foreign elections, now is not the time to call into question the commitment or the resolve of the United States of  Vladimir Putin's world view is shaped by his time in the KGB during the Cold He is committed to projecting Russian strength, both at home and abroad, through intimidation and aggression. Strength is what he respects. If Putin's provocations are not met with a strong response, they will continue and likely escalate, putting American interests and the American people at risk.  Top officials in the Trump administration have been dispatched to crisscross Europe and reassure the world of our commitments to global security. I joined Vice President Pence and Secretary Mattis in Germany last month for the annual Munich Security  They spoke of America's commitment to NATO and the international order, which was built from the ashes of World War II, in an apparent attempt to reassure our nervous allies, but our allies are not trying to understand the aims of the Mattis administration or the Pence administration. They are trying to determine if President Trump will stand behind NATO and the institutions that have served as a counterweight to Russian aggression for decades.  The American people are also watching the White House, and they deserve to know that those who serve at the highest levels of government will always have America's best interests at heart. But every week we are faced with mounting evidence that the Trump administration and the Trump campaign have ties to Russia and are working to cover up their interactions with Russian officials.  Earlier this week, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director Comey announced that the FBI was ``investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian Government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.'' This bears repeating. The FBI Director has confirmed that there is an active investigation into coordination between a Presidential campaign and a foreign adversary. This is just the latest development in a long string of disturbing revelations about President Trump's associates.  Ousted campaign chairman Paul Manafort has a deep web of business and political connections to Russian interests. Other campaign advisers have backed off previous claims that they never spoke with Russian officials. In fact, the coverup of these interactions has already resulted in the first resignation from the Trump administration.  Not long after President Obama imposed sanctions on the Russian officials and military intelligence agencies that were responsible for interfering in our election, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had a secret, off-the-record discussion with Russian Ambassador Kislyak, in which he discussed lifting these sanctions under the incoming Trump administration.  Top officials at the Justice Department clearly warned the White House that Mr.Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail. He resigned only after it became clear that he misled the public and the Vice President about the substance of these off-the-record conversations.  But it doesn't just end there.  The Attorney General, at best, misled the Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings about his record of contact with Russian officials. He testified under oath that he ``did not have communications with the Russians'' during the campaign. When it became clear that he had actually met with the Russian Ambassador at least twice last year, including in a one-on-one meeting in the final weeks of the campaign, he was forced to recuse himself from the Justice Department's criminal investigation into this very, very serious issue.  It has been my experience that, when people are caught covering up their meetings and contacts with someone, they usually have something to hide. If you have nothing to hide, there is no reason for a coverup.  The serious national security implications of the Trump administration's potential ties with Russia cannot be overstated. This is a time when we need to make clear that Russian aggression will not stand. Instead, the President has attempted to distract the public through unsubstantiated allegations about the wiretapping of Trump Tower--an allegation that has been refuted by FBI Director Comey and others. President Trump continues to double down by calling into question the motives of those who want assurances about integrity in our elections.  Let me be clear. This is not about partisan politics. When there is so much smoke, there is probably some fire somewhere. If another country is infiltrating our government and political institutions or if Vladimir Putin has favors to cash in from officials at the highest levels of government, that is a serious problem.  Russia has endangered our servicemembers, threatened our allies, illegally annexed Crimea, engaged in war crimes in their bombing of Aleppo, and actively worked to undermine our democracy. These revelations are only adding more smoke to the Russia fire, and it is clear we need a special prosecutor to investigate.[[Page S1967]]  The American people expect this investigation to be free from any political interference or influence or bias. We need someone to cut through the smoke and clear the air. An independent special prosecutor should be appointed to examine Russia's campaign to interfere in our election as well as any association or coordination between the Trump campaign and  I also believe that the time has come to create an independent, nonpartisan commission to fully investigate Russian interference. Earlier today, I cosponsored legislation introduced by Senator Cardin that would create such a commission and provide it with the necessary subpoena power to get the answers that the American people clearly deserve.  This is not about Democrats or Republicans or about relitigating the 2016 election. This is about our national security. This commission, modeled after the 9/11 Commission, would provide a comprehensive report on what occurred last year and make recommendations as to how we can best defend the integrity of future elections.  This is about how we move forward together. This is about how we maintain the independence of our government from foreign influence and instill faith in Americans that the White House is truly working for them.  This is about moving past months of coverups and finally extinguishing this smoldering Russian fire or proving that all of this smoke is, truly, just a series of misunderstandings.  This issue shakes the foundations of our democracy, but our Union has survived harder challenges than this.  At a time when the public's trust in government is called into question, we must do everything we can to restore faith in the integrity and the impartiality of our institutions.

Not one of the hundreds of constituents spoke in support of the legislation. Instead, many said they will be among the millions of Americans who will lose their coverage under this bill.  One of those voices was Ed Saxby of Cape Elizabeth, pictured on the board next to me. Ed stood beside his wife and granddaughter as he bravely spoke about his own battle with cancer. He said that the odds of survival are against him because TrumpCare will take away the tax credits he needs to afford healthcare coverage as a retiree living on a fixed income.  Ed's wife, Jill, asked me if those who are championing TrumpCare would be willing to trade places with those whom it will harm.  I pose that question today to my Republican colleagues.

What do you have to lose, Mr.Speaker? Such was President Trump's constant refrain to the African-American community when rallying for their support of his administration's various policies.  Mr.Speaker, today, I rise to say that with critical elements of the American healthcare policy on the chopping block, African-Americans have a lot to lose, possibly even their lives.                              {time}  1930  There is as much at stake if President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress healthcare policies take shape in their current form.  By illustration, I want to address the impact on low-income families and individuals in the Virgin Islands who rely on Medicaid, and, presently, Medicaid is capped in the Virgin You can look at our territory as an example of what will happen when there is a cap on services, which could compromise a State or local government's ability to administer those most in need.  Since its inception, Medicaid has been an open-ended program that was intended to expand and contract with need, especially when States and localities face crippling economic downturns of both manmade and natural origins. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, and of those, the majority of enrollees are children and individuals with disabilities.  Under the Affordable Care Act, widely known as ObamaCare, millions of African Americans finally gained access to healthcare coverage. In 2015, approximately 11.2 million African Americans became eligible for Medicaid through the expansion, health care that they previously did not receive and which would have cost this country much more if that early-warning health care was not taken care of.  President Trump and Republicans in Congress propose converting Medicaid from a shared payment program between States and Federal Government to an arrangement much like a block grant, where the Federal Government puts a cap on its payment assistance, creating a huge cost shift to the If you want to know what you have to lose if caps on Medicaid are enacted nationwide, look no further than my home, the Virgin It is a grim outlook.  Federal caps on Medicaid programs in the Virgin Islands are set on a per-enrollee basis. Unlike States in the mainland where Federal Medicaid spending is open-ended depending on the needs of the people, the Virgin Islands can only access Federal dollars up to an annual ceiling. Beyond that cap, the Virgin Islands' government is responsible for the remaining costs. That means many Virgin Islanders who would qualify in other States and in other circumstances don't get the healthcare coverage that they need now.  Under the proposed fiscal arrangement, spending caps don't take into account the cost of providing services or unpredictable changes in a community--such as the closure of a major employer or a natural disasters--forcing a cost obligation for critical support services onto the already strained budgets of the territory.[[Page H2227]]  As a result, States and local governments, increasingly, would have to make tough choices to either reduce services for recipients of Medicaid or restrict eligibility and enrollment of additional people who may need it. Those are the choices that Virgin Islanders must make. So the most vulnerable of our constituents--in this case, children--who need the safety net that Medicaid, by definition, is supposed to provide have that final option cut out from under them.  When it comes to Medicaid coverage, the Virgin Islands struggles to provide low-income families with Medicaid services for three major reasons:  First, while the Affordable Care Act raised the territory's Federal Medicaid assistance percentage up to 83 percent for newly eligible enrollees, this increase in Federal match funding did not apply to those previously enrolled, which the Federal Government only matched at 55 percent in the Virgin Islands, requiring that the remaining costs be covered by the Virgin Islands government, a government already strained to meet basic needs.  The Virgin Islands and the smaller territories are not included in the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital, DSH, program, which would shoulder the unanticipated costs our hospitals must take on to provide adequate care for individuals who use hospitals for basic services since they have no insurance.  Three, With no Affordable Care Act exchange and no Federal subsidies to create our own health exchange, many Virgin Islanders were only able to obtain coverage through the Medicaid expansion if they met the already strenuous requirements. That means that 30 percent of Virgin Islanders presently have no health insurance.  This is what the rest of the States are going to have if this American Health Care Act, as it stands, is passed. A cap on Medicaid is a cap on medical services that our constituents just can't do without; and in poor communities, it is going to be even more impactful.  When ObamaCare provided increased funding to expand Medicaid, the island of Saint Croix was able to start a monthly homeless clinic at the Frederiksted Health Care Center about 15 months ago. That clinic has been able to serve many people, providing them with medical care, showers, meals, and transportation.  On Thomas, with the East End health clinic, they were able to expand their services and increase dental services to people who were sorely in need of that. If this funding decreases or is lost altogether, it is highly unlikely that this initiative can be continued.  Our current healthcare struggle is set to become a future hardship for mainland American States that provide Medicaid to a significant number of their population should the current proposals to cap Medicaid nationwide become law.  How do we avoid this? Do not place a cap on Too many in the African-American community have everything to lose if healthcare policy goes in this direction.

That, then, creates this huge burden on a hospital for those families to be taken care of, for individual care and individual need.  Particularly in the African-American community, when you have things like diabetes, hypertension, all of these diseases which need constant monitoring and primary care physicians to take care of and to ensure that they do not become life-threatening, and come to a place where then they are coming to the hospital, it is in the millions of dollars that you are going to need support and care for the servicing of individuals with these diseases.

1172,topic-id,711,"Mr.Speaker, when Queen Helen of Sparta was abducted by the Trojan prince Paris, Helen's jilted husband convinced his brother, a Greek king, to lead an expedition to retrieve her. He was accompanied by a fleet of more than a thousand ships. They crossed the sea to Troy and demanded Helen's return.  The siege, punctuated by all sorts of battles and skirmishes, lasted more than 10 years until one day when Odysseus had a bright idea. He said: Hey, guys, let's build a really massive wooden horse. Let's pretend like we have given up and sailed our fleet behind some island, but really about 30 of us will hide inside the horse. We will have someone tell the Trojans that it is some kind of gift to Athena, the goddess of war, and they will haul it into their city. When they are asleep, we will all sneak out, open the gates for everybody else, and totally kill everybody in the city.  And that is the legend of the Trojan horse.  So what is the moral of that story and why am I reciting Greek lore on the floor of Congress today?  Well, because history has a way of repeating itself. Today we have our own Trojan horse, a so-called GOP healthcare bill, TrumpCare, that professes to be about health care but, in reality, is a Trojan horse to give tax breaks to the wealthiest in the country.  Let's take a serious look at it. We are told that it is the replacement to the Affordable Care Act, a bill that has offered insurance to over 20 million people in this country. Now that replacement is supposed to fix the problems of the Affordable Care Act and ensure health care for everyone, as promised by President  But the covert part of TrumpCare was that he got busted last week when the Congressional Budget Office, our nonpartisan agency that evaluates bills, said that, in reality, the bill does little to improve health care. In fact, it[[Page H2293]]said 24 million people would lose access to health care, not gain it. And it said older Americans would pay more for health insurance than under the Affordable Care Act and get fewer subsidies, and that more people on Medicaid would lose access to health care as well.  So how can a supposed healthcare bill actually reduce health care?  Well, when it is only a pretend healthcare bill.  And what else did the CBO say?  Well, they said this bill also includes almost $600 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals in our country, insurance companies, and Big  It gets worse. Those tax cuts for the wealthy, just how bad are they?  Well, the 400 richest families in the country making more than $300 million a year will get an annual tax cut of $7 million each. So Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos get $7 million a year while a retired farmer in Janesville, Wisconsin, in Speaker Ryan's district, earning $26,000 a year may have to pay $14,600 for the same health care she got under the Affordable Care Act, but the old cost was only about $1,700. That is a 750 percent increase on low-income, older Americans so the richest can bank millions.                              {time}  1015  And the CBO said another tax cut in TrumpCare provides about $275 billion in tax breaks that only the top 2 percent of Americans can get, while 98 percent of us will never see a dime.  And who else gets tax cuts? Insurance companies get a tax break of about $145 billion, drug companies get a tax break of $25 billion, and medical device companies get a break of about $20 billion. That is almost $600 billion worth of tax cuts for the wealthy, and what do we get? Less health care for more money.  That is not a serious healthcare alternative. That is a tax cut for the wealthy disguised as health care, and you and I get to foot the bill.  That is what is called a Trojan horse.

890,topic-id,239,"Mr.Speaker, there is kind of a rather ridiculous healthcare bill that this body may or may not be considering soon.  First of all, it creates an entirely new entitlement program at the State level rather than the Federal level.  Second of all, in an unrelated matter, it provides huge tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires--mostly in New York and California--which has nothing to do with making health care affordable. I mean, it is fine. Republicans want to do that. We get that. They always want to cut taxes for millionaires, but don't put it in the same bill as we are here trying to provide health care for people and bring down our insurance rates.  Third of all, this bill that is supposed to somehow help is going to increase insurance costs to American families by 15 to 20 percent. Most families can't afford that, and 24 million people will lose their insurance.  So there is just no way, shape, or form that this bill makes any sense.  There are a lot of positive improvements and suggestions that we can make to the Affordable Care There are a lot of great ideas with us providing a public option, more pricing transparency, a lot of great ideas that probably Democrats and Republicans support; but, frankly, they missed the mark on this bill.  These aren't ideas that Democrats or Republicans support, because they are bad ideas that cost families money.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2252-5.txt,1910,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,21.0,March
892,topic-id,1364,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Collins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today, one that provides for consideration of H.372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, a good bill that I support.  Mr.Speaker, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act amends the McCarran-Ferguson Act so that the health insurance companies would no longer be exempt from Federal antitrust regulation.  Currently, unfortunately, most types of insurance, including property or life insurance, are exempt from Federal antitrust regulations and statutes. The McCarran-Ferguson Act makes it clear that the insurance industry heretofore has been regulated only by Additionally, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have retained authority for antitrust enforcement involving mergers and acquisitions of insurance companies, but not dominations of markets and competition.  As a result of this exemption, the health insurance industry does not[[Page H2254]]have to share pricing information, and actually can currently communicate with one another to fix prices. Now, that doesn't make sense.  I firmly believe that the more transparency in our healthcare system, the better off consumers will be. Repealing the health insurance exemption of the McCarran-Ferguson Act may improve competition, but it would almost also result in more transparency in health insurance. It is something that we sorely need. So I intend to join many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting the underlying bill because it increases transparency.  The reality is that this bill does nothing to replace the protections of the Affordable Care It doesn't even make a dent in addressing the many problems created by the Republican healthcare legislation, the American Health Care  Mr.Speaker, so I don't want anybody listening to this to be distracted by a bipartisan bill that we hope becomes law. In any way, shape, or form, this bill does nothing when, in 2 days, we are considering a bill that threatens the health care for 24 million Americans, increases prices for Americans who are currently insured by 15 to 20 percent, and throws millions off of the rolls of the insured.  The Republican healthcare bill that is coming to the floor Thursday will cause a huge disruption in coverage for millions of It creates an entirely new entitlement program. It would throw 24 million people who currently have insurance out of insurance. And for anybody who still has insurance, their rates go up 15 to 20 percent.  How is that a good idea? It is not.  This bill today does nothing. I don't even think the advocates of it would say it does anything to address those increases in costs for consumers or 24 million people losing their health care or the creation of a brand-new costly entitlement program in a time of record deficits.  For constituents--and we all represent people from our districts--for people like Greg and Nikita, Coloradoans who have shared their stories with me, the passage of the American Health Care Act, the Republican healthcare bill, would devastate their lives.  Greg was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2014, in his midforties. After several surgeries, his doctors told him his condition is inoperable and could only be treated chronically by medication. It is a very expensive injection that has so far been successful, thank goodness, at keeping the tumor from growing and allowing Greg to live an ordinary life.  Now, Greg needs this shot every 3 weeks. It is thousands of dollars each time. And despite working at least two jobs, it is not something that Greg could afford to have--Greg would not have health care without the Affordable Care He would have to quit his jobs and become destitute and go on  The Republicans are basically saying to people like Greg: We want you to be lazy. We want you to quit your job so you could have health care. We want you to live off the government dole of this brand-new entitlement program that we created to hand you money rather than work for yourself and pay for your own insurance.  That is the message the Republicans are sending to people like Greg across the country.  Nikita lives in Boulder and has spent much of her life battling endometriosis. In 2014, she was having trouble walking because of her condition and she missed work for a few weeks. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, she was able to afford the surgery that she needed to improve her mobility and manage her pain.  In her message to me, Nikita emphasized that affordable health care is what allows her to work and to be a citizen that pays taxes and contributes to society rather than somebody who is shut in at home, living off the government dole like Republicans are trying to force her to do with the new entitlement program that they are creating.  If Nikita didn't have the healthcare coverage she obtained through the Accordable Care Act, she said that she would be on disability and Medicaid, costing the government far more money and preventing her the dignity of holding a job and working to support herself and paying taxes.  Both Greg and Nikita expressed fear that the benefits they receive under the Affordable Care Act would disappear if the Affordable Care Act is dismantled in favor of this new Republican entitlement program that encourages people not to work. The American Health Care Act threatens to pull the rug out from so many of my constituents and millions across the country while simultaneously raising rates by 15 to 20 percent for people who are currently insured and paying for their own insurance.  Look, H.372 is a fine bill. Republicans are using it as a talking point, claiming that somehow it addresses costs in some meaningful way. And given how complicated the healthcare system is and the critical role that we all have to play in it and every little piece plays, it is important to lay out the facts of the Republican plan, which H.372 does nothing to address.  It is a fact fewer people will be covered under the Republican plan. The Congressional Budget Office says 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage over the next decade.  It is a fact that middle-aged Americans will pay five times more in premiums. The age tax is a big part of the Republican healthcare bill. Americans ages 55 to 64 will see their cost increase by over $8,000. Most of my constituents in that age group simply can't afford that every year.  It is a fact that those currently enrolled in Medicaid programs are at risk of losing their coverage. The Republicans' concern that Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act was coercive, they should be equally concerned about the per capita cap in the Republican plan. It is the flip side of the same coin.  Those are just some of the many troubling facts about the Republican healthcare bill.  H.372, removing the antitrust exemption, is a fine bill. It does nothing to address any of those problems or change any of those facts and figures that I cited as to why this bill doesn't fix health care.  In fact, frankly, this bill is a distraction from the real topic we should be discussing--how to improve health care in this country. I don't think we should improve it by giving tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, forcing people like Greg and Nikita not to work and to be destitute in order to get health care and go on the government dole, creating a brand-new entitlement program that States administer, increasing the costs of insurance for people who are already insured by 15 to 20 percent.  Mr.Speaker, if those are the answers, what is the question? Is it how to make health care cost more and how to have less people covered?  If that is the question, the Republican bill is a good answer.  That is not the question my constituents are asking me, and I don't think it is a question their constituents are asking my Republican colleagues.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

893,topic-id,274,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Two weeks ago, the Republicans pushed ahead with their healthcare bill, despite not knowing the impact of the legislation. A week later, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office announced that the bill would take health insurance away from 24 million people and increase costs by 15 to 20 percent for those who currently have insurance.  Mr.Speaker, late last night the Republicans introduced a major manager's amendment that changes the bill, frankly.  Mr.Speaker, just as it was irresponsible to move forward without knowing the full effects of the original bill, it is completely reckless to even know whether this manager's amendment makes it better or worse and the impact that it has on health care for American families. It is reckless to consider and vote on their amended bill before the Congressional Budget Office even says how much it costs, or how much it will increase insurance by, or whether it throws people off insurance rolls.  Mr.Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would require a CBO cost estimate that analyzes the impact of any legislation amending or repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as the impact of any manager's amendment to that legislation to be made publicly available before the bill may be considered on the House floor.

898,topic-id,1769,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I am awaiting the graphic presentation about some of what is at stake in this debate about the Affordable Care Act, the fundamental debate about whether we try to fix health care in this country, make insurance cost less, or whether we move backwards under this Republican healthcare proposal.  The Republican healthcare proposal would create an entirely new entitlement program administered by the In creating this program, it would throw 24 million people who have healthcare insurance today off of the insurance rolls. They would become uninsured  It would add an age tax on older It would also increase the cost of health care for people who have health care today and pay for it, by 15 to 20 percent. Now, they wouldn't be getting more for that 15 to 20 percent.  Mr.Speaker, if you can believe it, they would actually be getting less insurance for that 15 to 20 percent because many of the requirements that insurance has to have are rolled back, the Federal protections under this Republican healthcare bill.  Somehow, at the same time it does all these things, the same time it costs 24 million Americans their insurance, the same time it increases rates by 15 to 20 percent--and, by the way, these figures are from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was appointed by  These are solid predictions that are done by people who were appointed by We are not citing any outside group or naysayers who don't like the bill. These are the objective Congressional Budget Office numbers that we are citing here in their entirety.  So, in addition to costing people 15 to 20 percent more, this bill also, for reasons unknown, gives an enormous multibillion-dollar tax break to millionaires and billionaires in New York and That is where most of them live. Now, there are a few in other places, of course, too.  But it is just unclear why, at the same time Republicans are trying to change the healthcare law, they want to go back to giving enormous tax cuts to the wealthiest We are not even talking the wealthiest 1 percent. We are talking, like, one-tenth of a percent who are going to see the bulk of the benefit from these tax cuts, at the same time that health care is being taken away from 24 million people who have insurance today, and at the same time those who are fortunate enough to be able to continue to have it will have to pay 15 to 20 percent more.  That is why, Mr.Speaker, this bill is so unpopular. If you are going to go through the trouble of creating an entirely new entitlement program, at least do it in a way where it actually helps people afford coverage versus hurts their ability to afford coverage.  Now, I gave the example in my remarks of Greg, and that is far from unique because people today, who rely on the subsidies to be able to get health insurance within the Affordable Care Act, if the Republican bill passes, would have to quit their jobs and rely on Medicaid instead, or they would have to take a lower-wage job. Instead of earning $40,000 or $50,000 a year, they would have to quit that job and try to take a minimum-wage job so they could qualify for  Essentially, this Republican healthcare bill is telling Americans, you need to be lazy and not work if you want health care because, if you want to work a job, we are going to take it away. We are only going to provide it if you quit your job or take a minimum-wage job under  So that is not the message or the incentives that we want to send to the American people. One of the great aspects of the Affordable Care Act is it actually, for the first time, provided an incentive for people to get increases in their wages, to get better jobs, to work additional hours.  Before the Affordable Care Act, we were locked into a scenario where people who were on Medicaid lost their Medicaid benefits if they got a raise at work, depending on the size of their family. It could have been a raise from, let's say, $14 an hour to $16 an hour. They couldn't work overtime. They couldn't work a second job, as so many people do to escape from poverty because they would lose their health care.  The Affordable Care Act said: You know what? We are going to allow you and encourage you to work that second job, to get a raise and support your health care as you make your way out of poverty into the middle class. What a great idea.  The Republican proposal creates a brand new entitlement program, but rolls back those affordability protections that help people work their way out of poverty, and leaves no alternative for people like Nikita and Greg, other than you have to quit your job or work a minimum-wage job because, otherwise, we are going to take your health care away from you.                              {time}  1300  That is the reason that the projections came back--no surprise--that 24 million people will lose their healthcare insurance. It is the reason that healthcare insurance rates will increase 15 to 20 percent.  We don't know the reason that they are also giving a tax cut to billionaires in the same bill. We know they want to do that, but they should do that in a tax bill. There is an effort at tax reform. I think they are talking about giving an additional tax cut to billionaires in that bill. That will be debated separately. But it is unclear how--or it is more than unclear as to why it would help make health care more affordable to give a tax cut to billionaires. It just doesn't make any sense. Let's debate that under a different bill.[[Page H2257]]I am happy to do that. As part of a broader tax proposal, we will see what else is in it. We know Republicans want to do that, but they shouldn't do that under the guise of health care.  So, again, Mr.Speaker, what you have here in this Republican bill, which this current bill does nothing to change--and this bill will pass, it has passed before, and we hope the Senate acts on it to remove the antitrust exemption. This bill does nothing to change the facts on the ground that the Republican healthcare bill that creates a brand new entitlement program would make Americans pay more for less, 24 million people would lose their insurance, there is an age tax on older Americans, guts Medicaid, huge tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires, increases of 15 to 20 percent for Americans who are lucky enough to retain their insurance, and discourages work and encourages people to be lazy at home to get health care.  It is the opposite of what we want to do. It is contrary to the American work ethic, and it is contrary to all incentives around cost containment. I hope--I really hope, Mr.Speaker--that the House defeats this awful bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, even as we pass some of these commonsense bipartisan measures like the one before us today that, around the edges, could potentially affect antitrust within insurance companies.  Mr.Speaker, the bill under consideration today is a commonsense piece of legislation. It has passed the House before. Ultimately, however, it distracts from the elephant in the room. The American Health Care Act is the Republican bill to roll back and change the Affordable Care Act and create a brand new entitlement program while increasing the insurance rates for American families, providing tax cuts to billionaires, and throwing 24 million people off of the insurance rolls.  My colleagues across the aisle had 7 years to work with us to improve the Affordable Care Act, but they refused to work with us to make health care more affordable and to expand coverage. Instead, they have drafted a bill that does the exact opposite. No wonder we were unable to find common ground when our goals were different.  The goals of myself and Democrats have always been to reduce costs and expand coverage. Reading into what the Republican goals must be if this bill meets them, it seems like they are working to decrease coverage and increase costs--the opposite of what we are working for.  How will my colleagues look into the eyes of a former veteran or a small-business owner or a middle class family or my constituents like Greg or Nikita and somehow tell them that they would be better off under a plan that forces them to quit their jobs and become destitute? How will Republicans defend the vote to senior citizens when the age tax in this bill will force most seniors to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for healthcare coverage? What will my colleagues say to 24 million people who lose healthcare coverage entirely under this bill?  The Republican healthcare bill that this body will consider on Thursday will do extraordinary damage to the healthcare system and leave millions of Americans guessing as to how much healthcare costs will cost and what will be covered. The American healthcare bill threatens to roll back important protections in coverage gains delivered by the ACA, and discussion of anything else at this point is a diversionary tactic, plain and simple.  Mr.Speaker, let's defeat the previous question and figure out how much this mysterious manager's amendment even changes the bill for better or worse. My colleague, Mr.Yarmuth, made a very compelling argument about how we need to know the actual costs and benefits of any bill we vote on; yet, this body is being forced to vote blind on a manager's amendment that we saw for the first time today and could even change by tomorrow, and we won't even know how it affects the costs of this bill or how it affects the lives of Americans who have health care today or aspire to it.  Mr.Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to defeat the previous question and vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote ``yes'' on this commonsense bill to modify our antitrust statutes which Democrats and Republicans have supported overwhelmingly in the past, but never, not once, to take our eye away from the ball of trying to decrease costs rather than increase costs and trying to expand coverage rather than retract coverage.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2252-6.txt,1910,CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS,2017.0,21.0,March

911,topic-id,127,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today that provides for consideration of H.1101, the so-called Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017.  This bill, first of all, from a procedural basis, did not allow even a discussion of the amendments that my Democratic colleagues brought forward to improve the bill. This rule has something called the structured amendment process, which basically means that Democrats are locked out from presenting our ideas for improving this bill. We are not even allowed a 10-minute debate or a vote on any of the ideas that many of my colleagues brought forward.  The gentlewoman from Oregon (",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2260-2.txt,1910,BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN AMERICA,2017.0,21.0,March
912,topic-id,1485,"Mr.Speaker, Margo Sanger-Katz said, in part: ``But one piece of context has gone little noticed: The Republican bill would actually result in more people being uninsured than if ObamaCare were simply repealed. Getting rid of the major coverage provisions and regulations of ObamaCare would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance. . . . In other words, 1 million more Americans would have health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan, according to CBO estimates.''  So it is just unclear what the Republicans are trying to do here. If the goal was to come up with something worse than repealing the Affordable Care Act, they certainly reached that goal: less people will have coverage, more tax breaks for billionaires, higher rate increases for most On every account, it actually underperforms a cleaner repeal.  What Democrats wanted to do is improve the Affordable Care And I want to be clear, none of us have ever argued the Affordable Care Act is perfect. I pushed for fixes. So many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues have pushed for fixes to strengthen the law, like repealing the medical device tax, which adds cost to health care, and altering the Cadillac tax on insurance premiums.  In the Education and the Workforce Committee, I actually offered three amendments to show some of the ideas that I and some of my colleagues had to improve the Affordable Care They offered an amendment to establish a public option in the exchange, to provide a baseline of competition in every ZIP Code in this country--defeated on a partisan vote. I should add that my proposal for a public option--and I am a cosponsor of the bill to do the same--would actually reduce the budget deficit by over $50 billion.  I also offered an amendment for pricing transparency to help make the market in health care work. One of the major market fallacies in health care is a Byzantine pricing structure where, frequently, different entities and people are paying different amounts for the same thing. If we had simple pricing transparency and quality transparency, we would go a long way towards making markets work in health care--defeated on a party vote.  Finally, I offered an amendment that would have allowed reimportation of prescription drugs. When you have a situation where--we have a popular example of this in the EpiPen, costing Americans who need access to the EpiPen over $400, and yet in neighboring countries--Canada, Australia--EpiPens cost $40 or $50, one-tenth as much.  It is not unique to the By no means is that an exception to the rule. In fact, it is the rule. By allowing reimportation of prescription drugs, a proposal that was backed in the Senate in a bipartisan way by many of my Democratic and Republican colleagues as a budget amendment, we could actually reduce costs in health care, making the goal of expanding coverage even easier with those reduced costs.  You know, when I think about health care, I think it is important to think about who in our districts and States it most affects. I think of Pat Hayward, a constituent in my district who lives in  Pat has so many family members who would be directly impacted by the repeal of the For instance, her husband has melanoma and over the years has needed several procedures to remove cancerous cells from his skin.[[Page H2263]]Had those procedures not been done in a timely and efficient manner, it could cause major complications, including premature death for Pat's husband.  Prior to the Affordable Care Act, when they tried to change insurance carriers, her husband was told that any coverage would exclude coverage of cancers, the very type of coverage he needed, because it was a preexisting condition. They literally would have had to choose between bankruptcy or being forced out of their home and into destitution or not getting the lifesaving melanoma treatments that he needed.  But it is not just Pat's husband who has benefited and perhaps is alive and thriving today because of the protections of the Affordable Care Pat's eldest son took advantage of a provision that allowed him to stay on his parents' plan until he got a job with health insurance at age 25.  Their younger son has struggled with anxiety and panic attacks, but thanks to comprehensive mental health treatment and the protections of the mental health parity that are in the Affordable Care Act--and being rolled back under the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill to replace it--their son is now back in college and thriving.  Pat, herself, expressed gratitude. The Affordable Care Act covers wellness visits and tests like mammograms, which can detect problems early, reduce costs, and save lives.  I share this story--and Pat wanted me to share her story--because families like the Haywards are like families in every State, in every county, in every ZIP Code in the country. American families have faced their share of medical challenges, as have mine, and I am sure that yours has as well, Mr.Medical challenges crop up unexpectedly. They don't have any bias toward a political party. They affect Democrats and Republicans and Independents and Greens and apathetic voters and diligent participants in our civic system. They make no distinction.  But the Affordable Care Act is there to make it easier for families across our country to stay healthy, to get better, to save their lives so that kids can grow up with their parents healthy, kids can grow up and be able to go to school and get good jobs.  And like so many of my constituents, Pat told me she would rather see the current system improved than thrown out entirely, and I agree. That is why I offered the pricing transparency amendment, the public option amendment, and the reimportation of prescription drug amendment; and there are dozens of other ideas to improve the Affordable Care Act from my side of the aisle. I offered amendments in committee that would have codified these provisions into law.  I plan to continue to fight to improve access and lower healthcare costs, but dismantling the Affordable Care Act is simply counterproductive towards that end.  The Republican proposal to create a brand-new entitlement program would cause 24 million Americans to lose their insurance--over 1 million more than repealing the Affordable Care For those who are lucky enough to still have their insurance, it would increase rates by 15 to 20 percent.  It would also, for reasons unknown, have an enormous tax cut for billionaires and millionaires. We know Republicans want to do that, but they should do that through a tax bill, not through something that is supposed to be a healthcare bill--enormous tax cuts. We are not even talking the wealthiest 1 percent. Most of those tax cuts go to the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent of That certainly doesn't help reduce the cost of health care.  Again, this bill can be debated, and, frankly, many of us feel it presents a problem in the risk pools that remove consumer protections. There is a solvency issue around some of these groups. There is a legitimate debate to be had, but we certainly haven't heard anybody present that somehow this bill is any kind of answer to making health care more affordable or expanding coverage.  What we have before us over the next couple of days is a bill that not only is the answer, but is a bill that creates an even bigger problem. The Republican healthcare bill would dig us in a deeper hole with regard to health care, leaving more Americans without coverage, creating a costly, brand-new entitlement program, and raising rates for those Americans who are lucky enough to still have their insurance after the Republicans remove it from tens of millions of people.  If that bill is the answer, what is the question?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we make health care cost more for American families?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we have less people covered and throw 20 million people off of health care insurance?  Is the question, Mr.Speaker: How do we make sure that, rather than work hard and try to get a raise or work two jobs, Americans are forced to quit their jobs and be lazy and not work just so that they can have Medicaid eligibility, which is what the brand-new Republican entitlement program would do?  Or, is the answer to move forward in a bipartisan way to improve the Affordable Care Act, a discussion that so many of us are excited to have.  I was disappointed that my three amendments were shut out in partisan votes in committee, and I am hopeful that by resetting this process, we can work together to reduce costs and expand coverage. Defeating the rule today will be the first step towards accomplishing that.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

919,topic-id,212,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, first of all, over 150 amendments by Democrats were rejected to this healthcare bill before us today, contrary to the process of 8 years ago when over 120 Republican amendments were not only made in order, but were actually incorporated into the healthcare bill despite the fact that, for final passage, not a single Republican voted for it.  So when we talk about the record and the precedent, there couldn't more of a night-and-day difference between what is occurring today where Democrats are locked out and the effort 8 years ago where Republican ideas were welcomed in the process.

924,topic-id,124,"Mr.Speaker, reclaiming my time, again, that simply confirms what our previous question would simply require, that before the bill is voted on we will simply know how much it costs and who it impacts. What could be more important than finding that out.  I think it is important to note that Democrats have been shut out of the process, at the committee level, in the amendments I offered. Even the germane amendments of this particular bill before us today, Democrats were locked out.  Rather than allow Members of both parties to participate in reducing the costs of health care and increasing coverage, Republicans have come up with a bill that actually increases costs and decreases coverage.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2260-2.txt,1910,MUSLIM BAN,2017.0,21.0,March
926,topic-id,1065,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, the statistics we are talking about, the fact that it will cost Americans 15 to 20 percent more to get health care, the fact that it will cost 24 million Americans their insurance, these are not statistics that are made up by some group that wants to oppose the Republican effort. They are facts that are arrived upon by the Congressional Budget Office, the head of which was appointed by a They do diligent work to determine how much bills cost and what their effect is.  Now, of course, you know, those are best estimates. Maybe, instead of 24 million people who will lose coverage under the Republican healthcare bill, maybe it will be 25 million, maybe it will be 23 million. There is always a little bit of variation on what those predictions are.  But whether it is 23 million or 25.6 million, the fact that Americans--millions, tens of millions of Americans--will lose coverage under this Republican bill should be a flashing warning sign that it is time to slow down and work in a collaborative manner to improve the Affordable Care Act, rather than create a brand new entitlement program that throws 24 million people off the insurance rolls, and increases the cost for those who remain by 15 to 20 percent.  This bill immediately before us is a diversion from the real story in health care. In my home State alone, 600,000 Coloradans would likely lose coverage if the American Health Care Act is rammed through Congress, as my Republican colleagues intend to do.  The American Health Care Act would roll back important protections and coverage gains. It would create a brand new entitlement program, while delivering record tax breaks for billionaires in New York and  It is clear that this bill threatens the health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of families in Colorado alone, tens of millions across the country. It is time that we get this process right and slow down, rather than cramming a midnight bill through the House of Representatives that we don't even know the cost of, before we are voting on it.  This is simple, Mr.Democrats are excited to roll up our sleeves and work together to create a plan that will reduce healthcare costs. If you don't like the amendment I offered for allowing reimportation of prescription drugs, let's talk about other options.  What about Medicare negotiating prescription drug rates? What about removing tax deductibility for the advertisements for pharmaceutical companies?  What about expediting approval process at the FDA, which President Trump himself mentioned in this very Chamber as a proposal that can reduce the cost of approving drugs from the $1.2 billion it costs today, which is passed along to consumers, to a much lower cost, thereby passing the savings along to consumers.[[Page H2266]]  There are plenty of good ideas the Democrats and Republicans can work together on. None of them are this bill before us today. None of them are in the repeal of the Affordable Care So let's just stop this ridiculous partisan process.  I don't want 24 million Americans to be victims of partisanship in I don't want other Americans who pay for their healthcare insurance to be victims of partisanship in  I want to make sure that people in my district who are working hard and only able to afford coverage under the Affordable Care Act because of the healthcare subsidies are not forced into medical bankruptcy and to give up their jobs and rely on Medicaid because of Republican efforts to ram through this brand new entitlement program.  Let's get this right. There is plenty of opportunity to work together to reduce costs and expand coverage. The American Health Care Act does the exact opposite. It increases costs and reduces coverage.  And instead of these incremental bills, like this so-called Small Business Health Fairness Act, which actually winds up removing protections and pushing more costs onto working families and seniors, we should improve upon and fix the Affordable Care Act that we put in place 7 years ago. We should support innovation to produce healthier outcomes, to reduce costs, and, yes, to expand coverage across our country.  We have a unique opportunity in this Congress to put partisanship behind us, to work together to make affordable health care a reality for every American family. Because you know what? When you have a preexisting condition, like I talked about Pat's husband in my district who suffers from melanoma, it doesn't matter whether he is a Republican or a Democrat or Independent or whether he is not even registered at all.  What matters is that he is a father to two children, a husband to his wife, and he wants the ability to work with dignity, support himself, and have medical insurance to receive his lifesaving monthly injections that allow him to maintain his quality of life and continue to work and pay taxes and support his kids and family. That is what healthcare coverage is all about.  So let's stop this silly partisanship. This Republican American Health Care Act actually kicks more people off of the healthcare rolls than simply repealing By creating this brand new entitlement program, they are actually costing an additional 1 millions Americans their healthcare insurance.  But the answer is not to cost 23 million people their healthcare insurance. It is not to take it away from 24 million people. You know what the answer is, Mr.Speaker, is to provide a way that more people can work hard and pay into the system, and that we decrease the number of Americans who lack access to healthcare insurance which, in turn, reduces the costs for the rest of us because of the cost shifting that occurs within health care.  Mr.Speaker, I know so many of my friends on the Republican and Democratic side of the aisle, dedicated public servants with thoughtful ideas that they have based on their life experiences, that they want to present before this body to reduce the cost of health care. Let's let them do it. Let's have an open process.  So, 150 amendments from Democrats were shot down in committees, not even allowed to be debated, not even allowed to be included in this healthcare bill. Three of mine were shot down.

1250,topic-id,666,"Mr.Speaker, I have a privileged resolution at the desk.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.  The Clerk read as follows:  Whereas, in the United States' system of checks and balances, Congress has a responsibility to hold the executive branch of government to the highest standard of transparency to ensure the public interest is placed first;  Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every President since Gerald Ford has disclosed their tax return information to the public;  Whereas, tax returns provide an important baseline disclosure because they contain highly instructive information including whether the candidate can be influenced by foreign entities and reveal any conflicts of interest;  Whereas, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution states that no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of Congress, accept any present, emolument, Office or Title, of any kind whatever from any King, Prince, or foreign State;[[Page H2309]]  Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns is important towards investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, understanding the President's financial ties to the Russian Federation and Russian citizens, including debts owed and whether he shares any partnership interests, equity interests, joint ventures, or licensing agreements with Russia or Russian nationals, formally or informally associated with Vladmir Putin;  Whereas, The New York Times has reported that President Trump's close senior advisers, including Carter Page, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and General Michael Flynn, have been under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their ties to the Russian Federation;  Whereas, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told Interfax, a Russian media outlet, on November 10, 2016, that ``there were contacts'' with Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, and it has been reported that members of President Trump's inner circle were in contact with senior Russian officials throughout the 2016 campaign;  Whereas, General Michael Flynn, former national security adviser of President Trump, received almost $68,000 in fees and expenses from Russian entities in 2015, including by an entity recognized by U.intelligence agencies as an arm of the Russian Government;  Whereas, FBI Director Comey stated in the Select Intelligence Committee hearing on the Russian interference with the November 2016 election that ``there is no information to support those tweets,'' relating to President Trump's allegations that President Obama illegally wiretapped the Trump campaign;  Whereas, distracting investigators with dead-end leads and outrageous statements is a common tactic from those with a guilty conscience or in a deliberate effort to throw off investigators;  Whereas, according to his 2016 candidate filing with the Federal Election Commission, the President has 564 financial positions in companies located in the United States and around the world;  Whereas, according to The Washington Post, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic delegations;  Whereas, the chairman on the Ways and Means Committee, Joint Committee on Taxation, and Senate Finance Committee have the authority to request the President's tax returns under section 6103 of the tax code;  Whereas, the Ways and Means Committee used IRC 6103 authority in 2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51 taxpayers;  Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether or not their President is operating under conflicts of interest related to international affairs, tax reform, government contracts, or otherwise:  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the House of Representatives shall:  One, immediately request the tax return information of Donald Trump for tax years 2006 through 2015 for review in closed executive session by the Committee on Ways and Means, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, and vote to report the information therein to the full House of Representatives;  Two, support transparency in government and the longstanding tradition of Presidents and Presidential candidates disclosing their tax returns.

Mr.Speaker, truly, there is nothing more of a threat to the very integrity of the legislative branch in the House than ignoring our duty to provide a check and balance on the executive branch.  To restore the dignity of the House inherent in rule IX, clause 1, we absolutely must use our authority to request that President Trump's tax returns are given to the American people. The American people demand to know the full scope of the President's financial background because there are legitimate concerns which, frankly, were worsened this very week by the hearing in the Select Intelligence Committee where the FBI and NSA testified there is an ongoing investigation to determine if there was coordination between the President's campaign and  The Internal Revenue Code already has language that lays out a path for the Ways and Means Committee to obtain those tax returns and review them in a respectful manner; and, frankly, there is precedent for that provision being used. Fifty-one tax returns of Americans were requested the last time they used it.  The House needs to demonstrate that our Members are listening to the valid concerns about the integrity of the The House needs to show that we care about protecting our Constitution and our system of checks and balances.  When I look at the language, the privileges of the House, those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings, I can see nothing that fits that language more than this motion before you today.  Let's shine a light on the President's conflicts so we, as a Congress, and the American people can judge what is occurring, where the conflicts lie, whether his decisions are being made for himself or his business interests or foreign interests or for the greater good of the American people.  I call upon the Speaker to rule in favor of allowing this privileged resolution to move forward and for the President to disclose his tax returns immediately.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

These accusations should be taken literally and seriously.  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have seen absolutely no evidence that supports the President's claims.

The following day my colleagues across the aisle will vote to eradicate the undeniable progress it has made.  On Thursday, when the House votes on the American Health Care Act, we will vote to take away health insurance from millions of Americans; we will vote to raise premiums on seniors; we will vote to damage women's healthcare programs; and we will vote to reduce access to care for LGBTQ people.  Policies that were once derided as socialist are now mainstream, considering so many of the popular parts of ACA are retained in the Republican replacement.  The majority of the country does not want to repeal ACA but to improve it in a bipartisan way. The only way to create a meaningful change for the American people is to work together across the aisle.  As Lincoln said: ``We cannot escape history. We . . . will be remembered in spite of ourselves.'' A vote to repeal ACA will be a stain on that legacy.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgH2250-3.txt,1967,IMPROVING AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO HIRE AND RETAIN,2017.0,21.0,March
463,topic-id,1997,"Mr.Speaker, we are so proud of the leadership Congresswoman Jayapal is showing in both Washington State and Washington, D.C., in resisting these terrible cuts to the domestic budget of the people of the United States, in showing leadership, also especially in defending American values when it comes to immigration and affording a refuge to people fleeing political and religious repression all over the world.  She is a true leader and we are very proud of her. I am grateful that she is sharing a couple of minutes with me tonight to talk about the astonishing news of the day, which is the most dramatic and draconian budget cuts offered perhaps in our lifetime to the domestic budget of the United  It is going to take us many days--many weeks, indeed--to fully analyze what exactly will be axed with these budget proposals, but I wanted to start with a little exchange that took place today with Mick Mulvaney, who is leading the budget effort for the  He had a press conference and he was asked about the implications of these billions of dollars of cuts to Meals on He was asked about one specific program, and he had no problem basically casting Meals on Wheels to the curbside, saying: ``It's just not showing any results.'' Which is why the Trump administration apparently feels good about slashing the domestic budget, including the community development block grants which help support Meals on Wheels across the country.  Well, let's just take this one tiny little example, then. Meals on Wheels actually serves 2.4 million Americans between the ages of 60 and 100. These are people who, for reasons of illness or physical infirmity or simply poverty, cannot go grocery shopping for themselves or prepare meals for themselves.  Why don't we take a moment to praise the people at Meals on Wheels who actually do something constructive and patriotic for their country. They bring food to older people who might otherwise go without.  You might say: Well, that is just kind of mushy-headed and soft-hearted. We are in the age of the budget ax. We need to destroy these domestic programs that are a terrible burden on the taxpayers.  Check out a 2013 review of studies on the issue of home-delivered meal programs like Meals on The study says that these programs ``significantly improve diet quality, increase nutrient intake, and reduce food insecurity and nutritional risk among participants. Other beneficial outcomes include increased socialization opportunities, improvement in dietary adherence, and higher quality of life.''  Well, maybe you don't care about any of those things. Maybe you just consider about the bottom line.  Consider this finding. These programs are aligned with the Federal cost-containment policy to rebalance long-term care away from nursing homes to home and community-based services by helping older adults maintain independence and remain in their homes and communities as their health and functioning decline.  You see, for Mr.Mulvaney and President Trump and the Cabinet of billionaires and CEOs and ethically challenged Russian-influenced corporate titans, they don't care about how the program is actually working right here in American communities.  They don't care about facts. We know they have contempt for facts, which is why they give us their alternative facts. They don't care about studies and books because we know the President is their leader and he doesn't read books.  They definitely don't care about the elderly people who can't make it to the grocery store or who can't afford nutritious meals on their own. These are the same people, after all, that they propose to throw to the curb on Medicaid, with their proposal released last week in the cloak of darkness to repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid and replace it with a monstrosity of a program which even their own Members can't support. Under their plan, 14 million would lose their healthcare insurance. Millions of elderly people would lose their insurance.  Now, with this mean-spirited little proposal to take a relative crumb away from the community development block grant and from Meals on Wheels, they would deprive a lot of people even of a wholesome dinner delivered to their home.  Why do they want to slash all of these programs across the board: the EPA, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, the Labor Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Commerce Department, the Education Department, HUD, Transportation, Interior, and so on? Why?  Well, the President has announced he wants to take $54 billion out of that slice of the pie for nondefense discretionary spending, which accounts for only 16 percent of the overall budget, and put that $54 billion directly into the  Just to repeat, they want to take $54 billion out of the domestic budget, nondefense discretionary spending, and put it into the Pentagon for a military buildup.  But for what?  The world's second largest military power is We outspend them 10 to 1. We are a giant and they are a dwarf.  Vladimir Putin, in any event, is Donald Trump's best friend, his BFF, his bosom buddy. The Trump-Putin relationship may be the President's most successful long-term relationship, at least politically speaking.  All that money that goes to the Pentagon, why? What is it for? Is it possible that Mr.Bannon and Mr.Trump are thinking about a war drive?  The President has tweeted about World War III in a very cavalier and flippant way.  It is disturbing. Nobody really knows. But one thing we do know is that all of that money that goes over to the Pentagon, if history is any record, will be available for the beltway bandits, the inside players with political influence and the mega corporations to go and make a buck off of the American taxpayer.  We will strip it from the EPA, and we will strip it from the Department of State, and we will strip it from education and we will put it in the Pentagon, and that is where we know a lot of people are going to get rich.                              {time}  1900  They are going from Meals on Wheels to deals on wheels. That is the name of the game. No more Meals on It is all about deals on wheels. You have got to know the President, you have got to know the inside players in the[[Page H2142]]billionaire Cabinet, and then you can make some money.  Who are they going to sacrifice for this operation announced this week?  Well, it would take us all night to go through all of the domestic programs and projects that the American people depend on that are going to be sliced and diced because of this budget proposal, at least if it goes through.  But let's start with the National Institutes of Health, the The administration proposes to cut nearly $6 billion from the NIH--$5.8 billion they want to get rid of.  Now, what is the NIH, which happens to be in my congressional district in Rockville--and I am so proud of that--where we have got doctors and nurses and researchers and scientists who are working every day as part of the institutional world leader in biomedical research?  This is an entity that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. These cuts would devastate the NIH and their ability to research lifesaving cures and treatments for diseases.  What kinds of diseases are being treated there?  I am not going to be able to go through all of them because there are hundreds of them that are being researched, where treatments are being developed, where patients are being seen, where progress is being made. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Agent Orange and dioxin, aging, alcoholism, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, anorexia, anthrax, antimicrobial resistance, anxiety disorders, aphasia, arthritis, assistive technology, asthma, attention deficit disorder, autism, autoimmune disease. That is just the A's.  Let's keep going a little bit. Batten disease, biodefense, bioengineering, biotechnology, bipolar disorder, brain cancer, brain disorders, breast cancer, cancer, cannabinoid research, cardiovascular, cerebral palsy, cervical cancer, child abuse and neglect research, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, childhood leukemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, climate change, climate-related exposures and conditions, colorectal cancer, and on and on. That is just the A's, the B's, and the C's.  They want to cut $6 billion from the NIH, which is working to cure, address, study, and manage the diseases and the sicknesses that our people are dealing with; and just cavalierly they say they want to slash it so they can pour all of this money over to the military side for a reason unknown.  When they came down with their executive orders, which have now been struck down by multiple Federal District Courts as unconstitutional, as a violation of the Establishment Clause, as a violation likely of due process and equal protection and so on, what they cited was 9/11 multiple times. They cited 9/11. The odd thing, though, was that the three source countries for the 9/11 hijackers--Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates--were left off their executive orders, even right up until today.  Why?  Some people say it is because Donald Trump has extensive business dealings with corporations and governments in those three countries. Nobody really knows. But they developed those orders, which the GOP proudly once called the Muslim ban, in response allegedly to 9/11. Even if you could blame an entire people for the acts of individual terrorists, they didn't do it. They turned to some other countries because that didn't interfere with the President's business interests.  So we have got this huge military buildup and we have got the siphoning away of tens of billions of dollars of the American people's hard-earned money away from medical research and diseases and environmental protection all into the For what reason, nobody knows, and they haven't told us.  What a dangerous moment this is in the life of the American What a perilous time this is for a nation built on the principle that that great Republican President Abraham Lincoln called government of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Their budget proposal is a job killer. It is going to kill hundreds of thousands of jobs. It devastates and ruins the search for cures, the progress we are making in diseases like cystic fibrosis and diabetes. Diseases that afflict hundreds of thousands, millions of our people, they are just going to pull the plug on that. They are ransacking our children's education. They are hollowing out the rural communities. They are making urban life far more dangerous. They are weakening our leadership overseas. And, of course, because they don't believe in climate change, they are undermining our ability to respond to the great peril that faces us as a people.  Just like the proposal to trash the Affordable Care Act cannot go through this body because there must be a majority of responsible Members of this body who will not accept that terrible proposal that will throw 24 million of our people off their insurance, this body also cannot accept this terrible budget. It must have arrived here  If a foreign government, a rival to America, an enemy of America, had come up with this budget, we would regard it as an act of aggression against the American people. You could view it as a declaration of war against the prosperity, the health, and the welfare of our own people. But, alas, it didn't come from abroad. At least it was addressed that it came from the White It appears to have come from the administration, yet it threatens our way of life.  I would urge all of my colleagues to very carefully study this budget proposal over the next week or two and make clear that these are not the priorities of the American people, make clear that these are not the values of the American people, and this is not the future of the American people. We must continue to make progress. That means we must reject the Trump budget.

1335,topic-id,725,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her leadership on this Special  I think the message is getting through to the American people: 24 million of us are about to lose health care if this legislation goes through.  In my home State of Maryland, 375,000 people are estimated to be on the chopping block in terms of their health insurance. In my district, the Eighth Congressional District--Montgomery, Frederick, and Carroll Counties--we could have 75,000 or 80,000 people lose their health care.  We were able to cut the uninsured rate in half with passage of the Affordable Care Act 7 years ago, and now they want to turn the clock back and take us in exactly the wrong direction.  If a foreign power like Russia, for example, tried to throw 24 million Americans off of their health care, we would consider it an act of sabotage, aggression, and war, but this is something that is happening inside the country. Nobody knows why they want to do that to older people with this age tax, why they want to do it to children, to people who have special health needs, to the sick.  It is also getting through that there is going to be $600 billion that travels upwards in America through a tax break to the wealthiest That is $600 billion that is moving upwards. This is not a healthcare plan, primarily. It is a wealth transfer plan, while we toss millions of our co-citizens to the curbside.  Seven years ago, we passed the Affordable Care Millions of Americans have gotten health care for the first time, dramatically improving public health in lots of different ways, making sure that people could not be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting condition, making sure that people in their twenties could stay on their parents' plan, ending lifetime insurance limits, ending annual limits, requiring insurance plans to pay for preventive services like flu shots and cancer screenings and mammograms, dramatically improving the public health. This has been a great success.  Tom Paine once said you cannot ``make a man unknow his knowledge, or unthink his thoughts.'' The American people know that we have made dramatic progress under the Affordable Care We need to be moving more in the direction of covering more people and improving quality and reducing people's premiums and copays and deductibles.  This legislation, the repeal nightmare, goes in exactly the wrong direction. It jacks up everybody's premiums, increases the copays and[[Page H2339]]deductibles, while throwing millions of people to the sidelines.                              {time}  1700  I want to make one final point, which is the message has gotten through. The public opinion polls are showing that the American people are turning sharply against this terrible repeal plan, which means here in Congress the organizers of the plan are getting increasingly desperate, and they are making deals.  One of the deals that they have made with some upstate Republicans apparently is colloquially known around here as the Buffalo bribe or the Kinderhook kickback or the Hudson hustle. Someone called it today the Empire State enticement or simply Niagara calls.  There are some Republicans in upstate New York who are very nervous about voting for this bill, so what they have extracted is a promise, a very special provision that doesn't apply to the other 49 It applies only in New York, and it would say that New York State alone cannot assess its counties to participate financially in the Medicaid system. There are lots of other States that do it, but only New York could not do it. It could not assess the counties, except it could assess any jurisdiction with more than 5 million people.  Gee, what do you think that is? Maybe New York  Now, the problem with this other than it being sordid and unseemly--this Buffalo bribery, this Hudson hustle--is that it is unconstitutional because the Federal Government can try to persuade States to do something by offering money, but it cannot extract a concession through coercion, and it cannot treat one State differently from every other It violates the principle of equal sovereignty.  I would just say, Congresswoman Jayapal, this legislation is not only reactionary, taking us back to a past nobody wants to go back to, and not only dangerous, but it is also unconstitutional because of the Buffalo bribe that is built into it.

It is not to confirm him as the National Security  Lieutenant General McMaster was appointed by the President to a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Indeed, he is already serving as National Security The only remaining question is whether he will serve in the military grade of lieutenant general on Active  The position of National Security Advisor is one of the most important in our government. Not only does it require someone capable of providing timely and thoughtful counsel on national security matters, it entails coordinating advice and action across multiple executive agencies with responsibilities in the national security arena. Further, it necessitates a large measure of independence and knowledge.  This is not the first time we have considered an Active-Duty military officer for this position. Lieutenant General McMaster would be the third such officer to so serve, following Admiral John Poindexter under President Reagan and General Colin Powell under President George Herbert Walker  Many of my colleagues are rightly concerned about this and question whether it would be more appropriate for him to retire and serve in a civilian capacity. While I strongly believe it would be better for Lieutenant General McMaster to retire and avoid all perceptions of politicizing the military, he believes that serving in uniform will help him remain apolitical in service to this He can expect Congress to hold him to his word that wearing the uniform in this position will serve to keep the military above the political fray.  Some Members have expressed concern about the proper functioning of our national security apparatus and clear chains of command with respect to military advice provided to the President under this arrangement. While Lieutenant General McMaster would be the National Security Advisor to the President, providing day-to-day advice and counsel on all national security matters, General Joseph Dunford, as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would continue to be the ``principal military advisor'' to the President, while Secretary Mattis is the ``principal assistant to the President in all matters related to the Department of Defense.''  As Senator Sam Nunn described the issue with respect to the nomination of then-Lieutenant General Powell, in Senator Nunn's words, ``A military officer who knows that his next promotion depends on the Secretary of Defense and the top generals and admirals in the Pentagon may simply not, over a period of time, be able to make completely objective decisions based on the fact that his promotion, his pay, and his future depend on one department, and that one department is an active player in the government.''  This question centers on Lieutenant General McMaster's ability to retain the necessary measure of independence as he discharges his duties to the I ultimately believe, after careful consideration, that Lieutenant General McMaster will be able to balance these roles and provide advice and direction designed to further the Nation's interests and not simply those of the Department of Defense or indeed, to advance his own ambitions.  It is also my hope that Lieutenant General McMaster will be a moderating influence on a White House that desperately needs talented, informed, and professional advisers. This Administration has proposed a reorganization of the National Security Council structure that excludes the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence from meetings unless specifically invited. Lieutenant General McMaster assured the Committee that General Dunford and the DNI will be invited to attend any meeting of the Principals Committee of the National Security Council, and I appreciated that assurance.  The Trump Administration reorganization also added the President's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, to the National Security This politicization of the NSC is unsound, and I think without merit. The law creating the National Security Council is purposeful in trying to create a managerial and policy process that develops the best national security policy for our The idea that a partisan political operative like Mr.Bannon should serve on the National Security Council runs counter to longstanding practice, and must, in my view, be reversed.  It is my hope that Lieutenant General McMaster has the vast experience and knowledge and the requisite temperament and independence to provide the national security expertise that is sorely needed in the White  Moreover, Lieutenant General McMaster must have the support and the backing of the President so it is clear that he runs the National Security Council on the President's behalf. That support is not yet apparent. According to Politico just a few days ago, the President overruled Lieutenant General McMaster's advice and chose to listen to Mr.Bannon and the President's son-in-law, Mr.Kushner, in regard to the retention of a key intelligence analyst who had been brought in by Major General This is a worrisome sign that Lieutenant General McMaster might have a title and responsibilities but not the authority he needs. I indeed hope he has that authority and exercises it wisely.  I would also like to note that there have been reports about decisions Lieutenant General McMaster made as Commanding General at Fort Benning in allowing lieutenants under his command to attend schools while being investigated for allegations of sexual misconduct. I want to assure my colleagues that the Committee held a closed and classified executive session with Lieutenant General McMaster present to answer all our questions. The Committee thoroughly considered the facts and voted to confirm his third star by a strong bipartisan vote.  We are again taking a rather extraordinary step in voting on an Active-Duty military officer to serve as National Security Advisor for the first time in 25 years, but these are extraordinary times. Our Nation faces complex national security challenges, and 3 months into a new administration, we are on a second National Security Advisor already. We see a disorganized National Security Council and an enormous number of vacancies in the State and Defense  Lieutenant General McMaster has the opportunity to bring order to the chaos.

1652,topic-id,2164,"Mr.President, I rise today to discuss the deep and growing concerns about Russia's interference in the United States' 2016 Presidential election and the implications of Russia's broader malign activities for our national security.  On Monday, we learned from FBI Director Comey that there is an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election and whether associates of then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump were communicating with It is absolutely essential that Congress and the American people get clear and comprehensive answers on, first, what happened; second, what are Russia's strategic goals and intentions for further interference in democratic processes here and in Europe; and third, what we need to do to counter this threat going forward. That is why I have repeatedly called for an independent, transparent, special counsel to investigate the legal aspects of Russian efforts to influence our election and a bipartisan select committee within the Senate to look at all aspects of Russia's destabilizing activities here and around the world.  I am concerned that the politicization of the issue of Russia's[[Page S1962]]interference in our elections and its hostile actions against Western institutions and values is diverting our attention from what otherwise should be recognized as a clear and potent threat to America's security. We need to focus on what is critical: Russia is attacking American democracy as part of an even broader assault on our cornerstone NATO alliance and the post-Cold War international order.  The threat posed by Russia's actions is not merely ``fake news,'' as serious as that phenomenon may be, but a very real, very strategic threat to U.interests. Russia is testing America and the transatlantic community across multiple fronts.  Today, I will highlight just how broad and fundamental this threat from Russia really is.  What should be clear to everyone is that last year Russia engaged in a systematic and strategic effort to influence the U.Presidential election. While we do not know all the details of Russia's involvement, we know that in January the U.intelligence community--including the CIA, the FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or the ODNI--issued its assessment that Russia engaged in bold and unprecedented efforts to influence and undermine trust in the U.Presidential election.  Among the January intelligence report's findings were the following: first, that President Putin, in their words, ``ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.presidential election.''  The intelligence community also found that ``Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.''  The report further found that Russia's influence campaign was multifaceted and included covert intelligence operations such as cyber espionage against U.political organizations like the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National It combined the release of hacked information with overt propaganda efforts through Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media actors, or, as they are referred to, trolls.  Another key finding was that Russia's influence efforts in the 2016 U.Presidential election reflect--in the words of the intelligence community--``a significant escalation'' compared to previous information operations.  The intelligence community also warned that these Russian activities, including ``cyber-enabled disclosure operations'' likely represent a ``New Normal'' in Russian conduct toward the United States and our allies and partners.  The intelligence community further assessed that Russia will use the lessons learned from the 2016 U.Presidential election to influence future elections in the United States and overseas. We do not have to look very far for evidence supporting this conclusion.  Russia is alleged to have targeted an April 2016 referendum in the Netherlands on a partnership agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, which was overwhelmingly rejected by Dutch voters. This year, Russia is openly intervening in France's Presidential election to be held in For example, Russia has loaned tens of millions of dollars to the far-right National Front Party in France, whose leader, Marine Le Pen, has defended Russia's annexation of Crimea and criticized international sanctions against  Germany, which holds parliamentary elections in September, has also been targeted by Russian hackers and trolls--straight out of the Kremlin playbook we saw used here last year. Russia is attempting to steadily erode the integrity and western orientation of multiple Eastern European countries through a variety of state and state-controlled or state-influenced activities. These coordinated and focused Russian operations threaten to undermine the European cohesion which underpins the post-Cold War international order. This pattern of Russian interference will only intensify with time if it goes unchallenged.  Russia's malign activities also threaten our core security relationships with our transatlantic allies and partners. The NATO alliance has been the bedrock of our security relationship with our European allies. Since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, countries in Central and Eastern Europe have aspired to integrate more closely with the West, whether militarily through NATO membership or economically within the European Union, or both. But President Putin rejects the post-Cold War international order and seeks to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence over his immediate neighbors by weakening democracy, collective security, and economic cooperation across the region.  In pursuit of this strategic goal, Putin has demonstrated a willingness to use all tools at his disposal, including cyber hacking, disinformation, propaganda, economic leverage, corruption, and even military force, to violate the sovereignty of Russia's neighbors and undermine support for their further integration into  Since 2008, in neighboring Georgia, Russia has occupied two regions and recognized their independence, which the international community widely condemns as a violation of Georgia's territorial integrity. Georgia's aspirations since the 2008 Bucharest Summit to join the NATO Alliance have been on hold.  In Ukraine, Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and its continuing support to Russian-led separatists in eastern Ukraine are part of Putin's strategy of destabilizing the Kyiv government and blocking Ukraine's further integration westward. Putin has repeatedly used influence operations to hide the presence of ``little green men'' on Ukrainian soil, to spread disinformation about Ukrainian political leaders, and to influence financially corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs to support Putin is also using propaganda and other activities to try to break western unity in support of the United States and EU sanctions intended to pressure Russia to comply with its commitments under the Minsk agreements for ending the conflict in It is critically important to maintain, and potentially strengthen, these sanctions to change Russia's aggressive behavior and get to a peaceful political settlement to end the fighting in  In Montenegro, it appears that Russia has added political assassination as a potential weapon to block an Eastern European country from pursuing membership in Last month, the British press reported that ``Russian nationalists'' under the direction of Russian intelligence officials plotted to assassinate then-Prime Minister Djukanovic during Montenegro's elections in According to these reports, Montenegrin authorities foiled the assassination attempt just hours before the plot was to be carried out. This attempted coup d'etat represents a new and dangerous level of interference by Russia to discourage Montenegro and others from further integrating with the  As some of my colleagues have read in the February 14th New York Times article, Russia has fielded a missile system that violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF, Treaty--a ground-launched intermediate-range nuclear missile that threatens all of The INF Treaty was signed by President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. This landmark treaty dramatically reduced Cold War nuclear tensions by eliminating an entire class of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles that could have struck Moscow or Berlin in less than 10 minutes.  Now Russia has moved nuclear-capable, short-range, ground-launched Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave between Poland and The Iskander missile's range threatens German borders--something not seen since the 1980s. The Iskander deployment runs counter to a detente that has been in place since 1989, when President Bush reduced U.conventional forces in Europe--and Russia did the same--in order to relieve destabilizing tension in the region and lessen the risk of escalation or miscalculation. Furthermore, Russian aggression goes beyond the violations of the INF Treaty and the Iskander missile.  During the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Russia practiced snap nuclear exercises to test the readiness of its Armed Forces to send a signal that there was[[Page S1963]]a nuclear backstop to the invasion. More disturbingly, by invading Ukraine, Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum, a multilateral commitment in which Ukraine and three other former Soviet states pledged to transfer to Russia the nuclear weapons they retained after the collapse of the Soviet Union in return for Russian recognition of their sovereignty.  Besides unilaterally reneging on its Budapest commitments, in 2014 Russia has pulled out of the DOD and DOE--Department of Defense and Department of Energy--Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs, which secured nuclear materials at storage sites and national borders. Russia has some of the largest stockpiles of nuclear materials in the world that are vulnerable to insider threats. In 2016, Russia suspended its participation in the agreement with the United States to convert 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium for use as fuel for reactors.  Since the very beginning of the Cold War, nonproliferation and arms control agreements between Russia and the United States have always received a high priority from both countries, regardless of how relations in other areas went up or down. Russia's recent actions call into question whether this can continue.  Russian actions in Syria pose a further challenge to stability in the Middle East and the broader international community. Russia's military operations to prop up the murderous Assad regime belies Moscow's claim that it intervened to fight violent extremists, including ISIS and al-Russia has provided significant political, economic, and military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, even as he has slaughtered tens of thousands of Syrian civilians and used chemical weapons against his own people. Russia has repeatedly exercised its veto power in the U.Security Council on behalf of the Syrian regime in defiance of international standards and U.S.-led peace efforts, and, just last month, Russia vetoed a U.Security Council resolution seeking to punish Syria for using chemical weapons.  For all of these reasons, we must recognize that Russia's alarming interference in our election is only one aspect of a much broader and dangerous threat to our core national security interests. Russia's malign behavior needs to be investigated fully and in a manner that is free of political considerations. We need answers to key questions, including:  What are Russia's overall strategic security goals, and how do Russian influence activities in Europe and the United States advance those goals?  What are the tools of Russia's influence? How has Russia used, or continues to use, those tools in influencing campaigns in Europe? How do Russian activities in Europe compare to what was evident in the U.Presidential elections last year?  How has Russia used influence activities in concert with other unconventional warfare tactics and operational activities--for example, to support proxy forces in Ukraine and elsewhere?  What is the threat these Russian influence activities pose to U.democratic institutions? To NATO? To the European Union? To the post-Cold War liberal order and value system?  What are the weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the United States and European countries that Russia is successfully exploiting and magnifying?  Finally, how can the U.Government counter and deter Russia's influence activities, and what capabilities, structures, and other resources are needed for these purposes?  An investigation of these questions would best be conducted by an independent, transparent, outside body appointed in a bipartisan manner. However, if Congress cannot reach consensus to make that happen, then, as a ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I intend to work with the chairman to undertake the necessary effort within the committee and across the I believe we can work in a bipartisan fashion on this critical threat to our national security. I look forward to shedding light on this issue and examining what we need to do as a country to defend ourselves against and deter Russian malign influence.  As a final point, we are focused, of course, on what happened in 2016--and it is a topic of daily discussions and newspaper articles--but one of the most sobering factors is that we have an election in process right now for 2018. If it demonstrates the same interference, Russia could have an effect on that election. Indeed, there are indications that they are actually probing State election systems--the names of voters, how the States calculate and vote. Nothing has been established that would suggest they attempted to influence that activity, but the simple probing suggests that we have much to do to protect ourselves going forward--indeed, as much as looking back and finding out what went on in the 2016 election.  For these reasons, and many more, we have to work together, as I suggested and encouraged, in a bipartisan way to get at the answers--not just to look backward but to protect ourselves going forward.

1462,topic-id,374,"Mr.President, on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator Shaheen, I would like to recognize the contributions made to our Nation and its small businesses by the good work of America's small business development centers. As chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Ranking Member Shaheen and I understand the impact that boosting small businesses makes, with 99.7 percent of all firms across America being small businesses and their employees making up 48 percent of the total workforce.  America's small business development centers provide small businesses across the country with high-quality, low- or no-cost consulting, and a variety of educational programs. These centers operate in all 50 States to support an established network of small businesses while encouraging new entrepreneurs to develop and execute their unique vision, helping innovators get their own small businesses up and running.  Small business development centers are successful because they provide the services of a large consulting firm on a locally scaled level in areas that may go unnoticed by other programs. They provide tailored, individualized attention to over 450,000 entrepreneurs a year, which resulted in $6.9 billion in new sales in 2015. That same year, America's small business development centers aided in the creation of over 100,000 jobs, and the small businesses they serve averaged a growth rate of 15.5 percent, which is nearly eight times the national average.  One of many success stories that can be told is that of Velma, a marketing software firm in Nampa, Founded in 2006, the firm focused on empowering loan officers to create stronger relationships through a customized direct email program. The recession of 2008 hit Velma hard, and in 2010, the company entered into the small business development centers business accelerator program. The structure of the program provided organizational discipline, and the firm pivoted to providing email marketing for mortgage companies. Since the firm began participating in the accelerator program, Velma has quadrupled its employees and created a sustained positive cash flow.  It is a privilege for my colleague and I to recognize America's Small Business Development Centers Day today, March 22, 2017, and we wish them continued success as they work to support the next generation of America's small business owners and entrepreneurs.

1083,topic-id,993,"Mr.President, today I rise to speak in support of the President's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who, right now, is about two-thirds through his second day of hearings--better described perhaps as a grilling.  Simply put, I think the President made an extraordinary selection. Currently, Judge Gorsuch serves on the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which includes my home State of  Our State has seen firsthand how Judge Gorsuch interprets the law. He has had an outstanding judicial record while serving on the court. What is more, he is highly respected and supported by individuals in the judicial community who align on all sides of the political spectrum--except, inexplicably, the U. Judge Gorsuch's qualifications are not only noteworthy but extremely impressive. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law He received a doctorate in legal philosophy from Oxford, as a recipient of the Marshall Scholarship, one of the most prestigious scholars programs in the country. He has litigation experience from his time as a law partner, and he has clerked for not one but two Supreme Court  Examining his record during his time on the Tenth Circuit gives us some insight into the judge's approach to interpreting the law. When we read his opinions, we know he is a judge who follows the law, applying the text of the Constitution and statutes impartially. Of primordial importance to this body is his critique of the executive branch's tendency to assume the roles of the judicial and legislative branches.[[Page S1880]]  No matter which political party controls the executive branch, this body--the Senate of the United States--must protect its ability to legislate and create laws. The Founding Fathers intended for the separation of powers to remain inviolate.  Judge Gorsuch understands the role of the judicial branch and the significance of maintaining that balance of power. He has made it absolutely clear that he will not legislate from the bench. I repeat. He has made it clear that he will not legislate from the bench. That might just be the problem for those who would like to vote for a judge who would legislate from the bench.  I, along with many of my colleagues here in the Senate today, confirmed Judge Gorsuch over 10 years ago. Judge Gorsuch's record was so noncontroversial, the Senate unanimously supported his nomination. That includes the minority leader, Senator Schumer, and then-Senators Obama, Clinton, and  I repeat. Judge Gorsuch has received support from across the entire political spectrum. His judicial record over the past 10 years has made him even more deserving of the Senate's full support.  The American people went to the polls in November, knowing the next President would have the distinct honor of nominating the next Supreme Court The American people have spoken. As the Senate, it is now our responsibility to see through this nomination and appoint the judge to the High  The Wall Street Journal summed up what is happening within its editorial page today in pointing out that Senators want Judge Gorsuch to declare how he would vote in specific areas of the law--questions that every Supreme Court nominee declines to answer. Quoting from the editorial: ``At the 1967 hearings for Thurgood Marshall, then-Senator Edward Kennedy called it a sound legal precedent that any nominee for the Supreme Court would have to defer any comments on any matters which are either before the court or very likely to appear before the court.'' The Journal's editorial went on to say that in the 1993 confirmation hearings, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg emphasized: ``A judge sworn to decide impartially can offer no forecast, no hints; for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would also display disdain for the entire judicial process.''  I regret to say that profound advice apparently does not apply today.  One of my colleagues serving on the Judiciary Committee pretty well summed up the dilemma we have in the Senate when he said to the judge: ``If you fail to be explicit and forthcoming, the committee would have to assume his views were in line with Mr.Trump's.''  And there is the rub. Judge Gorsuch has written 789 opinions, with only 15 dissents from other judges. The apparent burr in the minority's saddle--the Democrats' saddle--has nothing to do with Judge Gorsuch or his qualifications. The problem is that Mr.Trump is now President  My question is this. All right, we know you feel that way. In every committee hearing that we have, we know you feel that way. When will this end? When will we get back to what is referred to as regular order? That question lies squarely with my colleagues in the minority.  I am really disheartened to hear the rhetoric coming from across the aisle in the days since the new President took office. The minority has taken extraordinary lengths to extend the confirmation process of the President's nominees--from shying away from our constitutional responsibilities and not voting on nominees in committee hearings to using unprecedented amounts of time to speak on this floor, disapproving of the President and his nominees, or anything else. These stall tactics are unbefitting of the world's greatest deliberative body. We have fallen from bipartisan deliberation, worthy of public opinion and support, to engaging with poisonous arrows of political procrastination.  With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch, we now have an opportunity to fix this sorry state of affairs. This is the opportunity we should seize to restore comity to the The people of this great Nation deserve nothing else.

1179,topic-id,796,"Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago this week, in this Chamber, the House gave final passage to the Affordable Care Act, better known as  I wasn't in Congress then. Many of us weren't. But for my fellow conservatives here today, that vote 7 years ago marked a decision point, or a moment of affirmation, to answer the call to public service and to help chart a better way for this country.  And for 7 years, we have made the case against As the law has been implemented, that case has been largely made for us. Millions have been forced away from the healthcare plan and doctor they liked, despite being told otherwise.  This year alone, in Alabama, health insurance premiums are rising by 58 percent. That is on top of the already steep increases the past 2 years. Our average deductible for the supposedly affordable bronze plan is now $6,000.  I have heard from countless constituents about the negative impact of I have listened to their stories about how higher costs and fewer choices have made it that much harder to keep their families healthy and make ends meet.  And in response, I made a promise--the same promise President Trump and every conservative in Congress has made over and over: Give us the majority in the House and the Senate, give us a Republican in the White House, and we will repeal ObamaCare and replace it with reforms that work.  So, Mr.Speaker, I am pleased that we are finally in a position to deliver on that promise. The voters gave us what we asked of them, and it is only right that we keep our end of the bargain.  With the American Health Care Act, we begin the process of repealing ObamaCare once and for all. This bill dismantles the taxes, mandates, and entitlement spending that make up the core of It cuts taxes on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, insurance premiums, and medical devices. It eliminates the individual and employer mandate penalties that have forced millions into expensive, inadequate plans. It replaces the ObamaCare entitlement with refundable tax credits so that people who don't receive insurance through work can put their own tax dollars toward a health plan of their choice.  Mr.Speaker, many people have asked why our plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare is a process. Why is this bill only one step and not the full package? It is an understandable question. For the last several years, Americans have been sold the false hope that government has a magic wand with which they can solve all of their problems. The truth is, of course, that it can't. It never can. And the only proof you need is ObamaCare itself.  That is why congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are taking a completely different approach than President Obama and the Democrats used 7 years ago. Instead of claiming we need to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, we have worked in a transparent way. The bill text has been posted online for 3 weeks. It has gone through three separate committee markups, and will come to the House floor in regular order.  Instead of one giant bill like ObamaCare, we are using a more responsible, three-step process. First, we will repeal ObamaCare with all its taxes, mandates, and spending through budget reconciliation. Next, the Trump administration will use executive authority to weed out the more intricate ObamaCare policies one by one to stabilize the market and lower costs. And finally, Congress will move forward with legislation addressing more specific policies, such as allowing individuals to purchase insurance across State lines.  I believe this will ultimately lead to better, more stable healthcare policy that empowers patients, increases choices, and lowers costs.  Mr.Speaker, no bill is perfect. I am sure if every Member of this body came up with their ideal health reform bill, they would each be pretty different. It is supposed to be that way, because we all represent different districts in different parts of the country with different needs.  There may well be some changes made here in the House or in the Senate that can make the bill better. That is part of the process, so I certainly remain open to those.  But, Mr.Speaker, I am confident this bill puts us on a path toward lower cost and better care, and away from government-controlled health insurance. It represents our opportunity to undo the damage of ObamaCare and help American families like we said we would.  For 7 years, we have been promising, and this is our chance to deliver.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the American Health Care Act and send it to the Senate, and get us one step closer to delivering on our promise.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2294.txt,1986,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1259, VA ACCOUNTABILITY FIRST ACT",2017.0,22.0,March

949,topic-id,662,"Mr.Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr.Speaker, last night, in an effort to secure more votes to pass the so-called American Health Care Act, the GOP made another last-minute attempt to modify its replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act--a replacement that I can only describe as a disastrous piece of legislation--by offering a short-term fix to try and regulate the massive rise in premiums that Americans over the age of 50 are expected to incur under their current plan.  H.372 is a measure that simply ends health insurance antitrust exemption. What is ironic is that the proposed legislation is being messaged by the GOP as a bipartisan bill, a no-brainer. But Republicans have never lifted a finger to end the antitrust exemption. For years, Congressman John Conyers and the Democrats have advocated ending health insurers' special treatment.  The reality is, while this is an unobjectionable bill on its own, H.372 has nothing to do with reversing the extraordinary damage that the GOP plan will unleash on this country. The fact is this will not help us solve the fundamental issues underlying the GOP's repeal-and-replace bill. Yet, instead of fixing what we know is not working under the current law, the GOP has offered this Band-Aid to help mend a bill that needs major surgery. H.372 is simply a complement to help fix our healthcare system, not an alternative.  One of the worst aspects of the GOP's repeal is the fact that it implements an age tax. Americans over the age of 50 will be forced to pay up to five times more than what young Americans would pay for coverage. In my district alone, we have roughly 89,000 people between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums and the cost of their insurance rise significantly.  I recently heard from one of my constituents within that age bracket. He is a retired firefighter who served our country for 29 years and is now disabled. So after many years of service, Ted is worried that if the GOP plan becomes the new law, he and his wife would be kicked off their insurance plans simply because their insurance would become unaffordable.  If this is what the GOP has offered to fix their disastrous repeal, then I am sad to say, my friends, you have missed the mark once again. According to the Congressional Budget Office, if the GOP repeal is enacted, 14 million Americans nationwide will be kicked off their insurance coverage by the end of this year alone.  So let me be clear. The problem with the GOP repeal is that as Americans age, they get less and less coverage. We need to protect those Americans who are fast approaching their Medicare-eligible years but who, for now, are still bearing the heaviest cost of private insurance.  My motion to recommit makes this possible by turning this Band-Aid of a bill into something that actually helps drive down costs for older It does this by allowing insurance companies to take part in the bill's safe harbor protections only if they charge individuals over 55 less than three times as much as younger Since insurance companies consider these safe harbors critical for their survival, this will reverse one of the worst parts of the Republican health plan, allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans five times or even more for health insurance.  I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to show that they aren't tone deaf and that they haven't lost touch with the needs and wants of their constituents, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to recommit so that we can protect our seniors and the most vulnerable of Americans among us.

1641,topic-id,970,"Mr.President, I rise to discuss the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as ObamaCare, on its seventh anniversary of being signed into law by our previous President, Barack  Looking back at what has happened to healthcare over the past 7 years, there isn't a whole lot of good news to report. Since that time, Americans have been hit with hundreds of billions in new taxes, healthcare costs have risen exponentially, and families have struggled with fewer options and reduced access to healthcare services.  Just in the last year, healthcare premiums have gone up 25 percent for the typical ObamaCare plan. That number is even higher in my home State of South Dakota where premiums have increased 37 percent. ObamaCare has also driven health insurance companies to completely leave the marketplace, leaving Americans with fewer insurance options. Again, I will use my own State as an example. Under ObamaCare, the number of companies offering insurance in the individual market in South Dakota has dropped from 13 to a mere 2 today. While this is unfortunate, we are better off than folks in Alaska, Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming, all of whom have no options at all, as only one insurer offers plans in those exchanges. This is also the case for more than 1,000 counties across the Nation, basically one-third of all the counties in total.  As a result of these skyrocketing costs and reduced options, the number of Americans enrolling in ObamaCare continues to drop dramatically. Projections continue to be millions fewer than predicted. Between 2016 and 2017, nearly a half-million fewer Americans signed up for the exchange. All of this has barely moved the number of uninsured South Dakotans between 2010, when ObamaCare was enacted, and today. So the health insurance market was crippled, premiums have skyrocketed for hard-working families, and our economy has suffered tremendously under the ACA, only to have the same number of insured and uninsured individuals in my home State as before we started.  Nationwide, Americans are rejecting ObamaCare in record numbers. We saw this rejection of ObamaCare repeatedly over the past 7 years, when the American people elected into office candidates who at least in part ran on the platform of repealing ObamaCare's higher taxes, fees, and penalties on businesses and investors have also taken a toll. Meanwhile, consumers who are facing higher premiums and deductibles have less to spend on goods and services. With one-sixth of our economy tied to healthcare, this has been detrimental to growth and to opportunity. It has also been easy to see how the healthcare industry has rejected ObamaCare over the past 7 years, with many insurers pulling out of the market and in other places the markets collapsing altogether. This limits competition and leaves little room in the healthcare industry, which is why ObamaCare is failing to control the cost of healthcare in our country. Cost control is a crucial component in providing truly affordable healthcare, and that begins with the elimination of ObamaCare's added bureaucracy and paperwork. We must get government out of the way and allow competitive markets to work once again, and that is what we are seeking to do with ObamaCare's replacement, which is expected to receive a vote in the House later today.  Since we started the process of repealing and replacing ObamaCare, my office has received a number of calls and emails from South Dakotans who have expressed concerns. I want to make it clear to them and to all Americans that during the period in which we transition away from ObamaCare and toward a more affordable, competitive system, we understand that the continuation of coverage is an essential component. We plan to include a number of items that are very important to the American public: guaranteed renewal of coverage, portability of coverage for those who change jobs or leave the workforce by retiring, and a ban on lifetime limits, because if you bought insurance, you shouldn't run out of insurance.  The provisions of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act which were included in ObamaCare should be included in our plans. There should be no exclusions on preexisting conditions if one maintains insurance from policy to policy, without lapses, and we should include provisions to allow children to remain on their families' plans until they are at least the age of 26.  We understand that there is a way to retain all of these positive provisions[[Page S1959]]which are vital to ensuring continued health insurance coverage for all American families who want it, while also providing a fair and open marketplace that provides a strong, healthy, competitive market. This, in turn, will bring affordable, efficient health insurance with innovative products that will actually help to control the cost of care. That is what the GOP alternative, while still far from perfect, is seeking to do. One thing we do know is that the end result will be better than  As a father and a grandfather, I understand how important it is to have access to affordable healthcare. No one should be priced out of healthcare coverage for one's family. But our current system is simply not working. After 7 years of ObamaCare, the American people are dealing with higher healthcare premiums, fewer options, more taxes, and reduced access to care. Health providers are struggling with more bureaucracy, with more time spent filling out paperwork instead of caring for patients, and being frustrated by ObamaCare's crippling new regulations.  As I have said from time to time, ObamaCare is a rapidly sinking ship, and there is simply no hope for a recovery. On its seventh anniversary, it is hurting more people than it is helping, and it must be repealed and replaced before it totally crumbles under its own weight.  I yield the floor.

Or that 60-year-old farmworker who had urinary problems and lower back pains, which scares me that he might have prostate cancer metastasized to the lumbar spine, and when asked when was the last time he saw a doctor, he said 6 years ago because that is when he lost his health insurance.  This Republican plan should be called the pain and suffering act or the pay more for less act, because that is what it will do. This bill will add 14 million more uninsured people within 1 year and 24 million more over the next decade.  We need to move beyond the Republican hyperpartisan ideology and listen to patients and their concerns. My patients in the emergency department ask me two of the most common questions, which are: Am I going to be okay? How much is this going to cost me?  I have never cared for an uninsured patient who chose to be uninsured. They didn't have health insurance because they couldn't afford it. And that includes the young, healthy patient who was in an unfortunate car accident and was left paralyzed. I never met a doctor who preferred their patients to be uninsured.  Yet, we know that the Republican bill's age tax--huge cuts to Medicaid--will reduce coverage and make millions more uninsured, increase costs of uncompensated care, while giving tax breaks to millionaires, raising out-of-pocket costs, and raising premiums and deductibles.[[Page H2294]]  The age tax is astronomical. The CBO said that a senior at the age of 60, making about $26,000, would have to pay about $14,000 in premiums. That is nearly half of their income, leaving very little for food and housing and their other needs.  This bill also will make it harder for doctors and hospitals to care for patients, due to the Medicaid block granting and the cuts. That is why the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the AARP, and many major provider organizations oppose this bill, because they also know firsthand the harm it would cause to patients. That is why AARP opposes this bill, because they know the harm it is going to cause to the elderly in our  Now, do Paul Ryan and President Trump really know more about patient care and providing care than doctors, nurses, and hospitals? Do they know more about taking care of seniors than the AARP? We need to end this hyperpartisan, ideological charade that puts the cost of health care on the shoulders of working families in order to give tax breaks to multimillionaires. We need to come together as one body to provide true health care, reduce the healthcare costs for millions of Americans, and provide the care that is needed.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2293-2.txt,2109,LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM,2017.0,22.0,March
97,topic-id,224,"Mr.Speaker, tonight I rise to speak of fairness, to speak of equity, to speak of parity for America's hardworking taxpayers. I want to talk about bringing parity between Americans who get their insurance coverage through their employer and those who are forced to purchase theirs on the individual market.  Currently, over 150 million Americans who have employer-sponsored health insurance enjoy a tax benefit to[[Page H2076]]purchase that health insurance. However, Americans who purchase their insurance in the individual marketplace, like farmers, small-business owners, plumbers, and mechanics, do not have a similar kind of benefit. Mr.Speaker, simply put, this is just unfair.  However, the American Health Care Plan helps fix this inequity by offering a portable tax credit to help these Americans purchase the health insurance they choose. These credits are also age-adjusted so older Americans who have higher healthcare costs will also see a larger credit to assist them in purchasing that insurance.  Mr.Speaker, I can tell you, many individuals and families in Florida's Fourth Congressional District will benefit from this reform and for the first time will be on a more level playing field in purchasing their health insurance. We are fighting for basic fairness. No American, no small-business man or woman, no farmer, plumber, or mechanic should be disadvantaged because of where they work or where they are forced to purchase their insurance.

I commend the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) for introducing this very important bill.  Over the course of the last Congress, the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee conducted rigorous oversight of TSA's technology and equipment acquisition process, and they found it fraught with waste and inefficiencies. The committee also found that TSA fails to effectively communicate its procurement needs with the private sector.  Our government relies upon private sector innovation to develop security technologies. However, that innovation comes with a price tag, and we cannot reasonably expect the private sector to spend millions of dollars in research and development of new emerging technologies without greater transparency and communication, both with the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security, as to exactly what their future needs and technology investments will be in the future.  This bill will provide greater transparency into TSA's acquisition plan, allowing for industry to better meet emerging needs, and enable better congressional oversight.  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.1353, the Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017.  Mr.Speaker, last Congress, I served as the ranking member of the Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, and we held multiple hearings on TSA's acquisition processes.  In the course of conducting oversight and engaging with stakeholders, we learned that deficiencies in TSA's planning for technology investments were causing serious issues for technology companies who produce products to meet the Agency's needs.  Under the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act, TSA was required to develop a 5-year technology investment plan. Stakeholders widely supported this strategy and welcomed the release of TSA's first 5-year plan in August of 2015, but that support eroded when the budget request for the same year did not align with the acquisition schedule in the 5-year plan.  The purpose of the plan was to give businesses the time and certainty they need to align their resources and planning to meet TSA's technology needs. Security technology manufacturers looked at the plan and invested significant resources in the technology that TSA planned to acquire, but then they saw the budget request and found that TSA had shifted direction and no longer planned to procure that technology.  That lost investment of time and resources hurts all technology manufacturers, but it can completely destroy small businesses and discourage small-business owners from working with the Federal  My bill, H.1353, will help solve this problem by requiring TSA to report to Congress on their 5-year plan annually instead of biennially, and it will require TSA to notify Congress and all relevant stakeholders of any changes or updates to the plan.  These commonsense steps will help ensure that there is ongoing engagement between TSA and industry stakeholders so that manufacturers of all sizes can continue to meet TSA's technological needs and continue to innovate and address security vulnerabilities.  Mr.Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.  I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonnie Watson Coleman, Congressman Keating, and Subcommittee Chairman John Katko for[[Page H2213]]being original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.  H.1353 was unanimously approved by the full Committee on Homeland Security earlier this month. Enacting my bill will ensure that TSA's technology objectives are more closely aligned with the industry's stakeholders that produce technologies to help TSA meet those objectives.

740,topic-id,685,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth  The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, spends over $7 billion, annually, on major acquisition programs. These programs secure our borders, protect our shores, safeguard our airports, and defend our cyber networks, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has reported that DHS acquisition management is on its high-risk list, since 2003, of areas most susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Recent watchdog reports have revealed alarming findings regarding DHS' acquisition efforts.  For example, in just 2016 alone, 8 out of 25 major acquisition programs experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. These program cost estimates increased by $1.7 billion, and their schedules slipped by an average of 11 months. Given the enormous threats that are facing our homeland, it is unacceptable to make our frontline operators wait for the tools that they need to secure the homeland.  My bill will require much-needed oversight of DHS' acquisition programs to safeguard tax dollars and hold program managers accountable. When programs incur significant cost, schedule, or requirement problems, my bill requires that DHS leadership be informed. These programs will be required to put a remediation plan in place that corrects the problem and also analyzes the root causes of why the problems occurred in the first place.  The Homeland Security Committee in Congress must also be informed of such significant problems. No longer will the people's representatives in Congress be kept in the dark. These requirements are similar to those used in the Department of Defense and will help DHS better safeguard tax dollars and more effectively secure our homeland.  Mr.Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Miss RICE of New Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1294, the Reducing DHS Acquisition Cost Growth Since the Department began its operations in 2002, it has spent tens of billions of dollars to procure goods, services, and supplies in support of DHS' national security efforts. The agency's major acquisitions investments, those that cost at least $300 million, represent a significant portion of such purchasing.  The Department has worked to improve its acquisition programs in recent years, but DHS still struggles when it comes to major acquisitions. Take, for example, the SBInet--a southwest border infrastructure project--that ballooned in cost to about $1 billion before it was canceled in 2011, after GAO found that it was ineffective.  More recently, there is the case of the Electronic Immigration System, an automated immigration benefits processing system. According to the Department's inspector general, this U.citizenship immigration services program is now on course to be completed 4 years later than originally estimated and at a cost of $1 billion more than estimated.  The importance and complexity of DHS' mission demands effective oversight of the Department's investments, particularly its major acquisitions. H.1294 seeks to ensure greater congressional oversight of such acquisition programs by requiring the Department to report to Congress when cost, schedule, and performance requirements are not met. Additionally, when such requirements are not met, this bill requires DHS to provide Congress with an analysis explaining the root cause of the failures as well as a remediation plan to mitigate the problems.  The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure earlier this month, and similar language was approved by the House in October 2015 as a part of comprehensive DHS acquisition legislation.[[Page H2215]]  I commend my colleague from Florida for his work on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, effective oversight of the Department's acquisitions programs is essential to ensuring optimal program performance. Given DHS' limited budgetary resources and the gravity of its mission, it is critically important that DHS get its major acquisitions right.

1190,topic-id,664,"Mr.Speaker, it was 7 years ago today that the Affordable Care Act passed and changed the lives of so many millions of Americans who previously couldn't get health care. But I think we knew even at the time that a big bill like this, a transformative piece of legislation like this, over time would require some changes, just as Social Security and Medicare have done.  The truth of the matter is, for 7 years, as we heard Republicans complaining about what was happening, we said: Let's sit down together, as Members of Congress, representatives of the people, and fix what we have got and build on the things that have made it possible for all these millions of people to have not only health care, but better health care.  Instead, what we heard over and over again is: Repeal ObamaCare; repeal And I kind of feel like today what we have is, because they said that, then they feel like they have to fulfill a promise. But if you look at what they are offering, it really hurts so many  What I hope the American people will understand is that the so-called repeal-and-replace bill raises the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket costs. People are going to pay more and get less.  Twenty-four million people--that is just a start; it ends up being some 50 million people after some years--will lose their coverage altogether.  It represents the single largest transfer of wealth to the top richest Americans and corporations. We are talking about $600 billion in tax relief. There is not a lot of talk about that. In many ways, this is a tax cut for the richest being masked as a healthcare bill.  Finally, I want to really focus in on what we call the age tax. Well, before I was a senior citizen myself, I have worked with older Americans in the State of Illinois, where I am from, and here in Congress as well.  So what is this age tax? This bill says that people who are between the age of 50--not very old--and 64, in other words, pre-Medicare, will be allowed to be charged five times more than young people for their health care. Actually, it allows the States even to go more than five times more for their health care. It will lower the subsidies.  As has been said many times, here is just an example. If you are 64 years old with an income of around $26,500--which, by the way, is the median income for people that age, certainly not a wealthy person--you would pay, under this bill, the Republican bill, $14,600 for premiums--think of that--as compared to $1,700 today, an increase of $12,900. So it is not surprising that the Congressional Budget Office predicts that many of those people will simply have to give up their health care.  The reason they want to charge them more is to entice younger people, who will then pay lower premiums, to actually get on the program. We are all for that. We want to make sure that young people get on. But people who are 50 to 64 are very likely, or more likely than young people, to have healthcare issues.  It is absolutely no wonder that so many organizations and forces are lining up in the United States to oppose this bill:  The American Medical Association, the doctors, and all the different subgroups of doctors, have written letters saying no to this repeal-and-replace.  The American Hospital Association, not only urban hospitals and hospitals in medically underserved areas, rural hospitals could go under.  The AARP, 35 million members strong, is absolutely dead set--they are running ads; some people may have seen them on television--against this legislation.  The American Nurses Association, conservative think tanks are against it, and many Members of Congress are against it--and for good reason. One of our Republican Senators said to House Republicans: Don't walk the plank.  I would suggest they take that advice and vote ``no.''                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2298-2.txt,1588,THE IMPACT OF TRUMPCARE,2017.0,22.0,March
1489,topic-id,955,"Thank you, Mr. It is really a simple proposition and it is a scary one. As soon as this legislation is enacted, internet service providers can collect your browsing data and sell it without your permission. Right now there is a lot of conversation about who has jurisdiction, the FTC or the FCC, and who is more appropriate to govern internet privacy, whether this should be public sector or private sector, but the basic question is this for the pending legislation, Should ISPs, your internet service provider, be allowed to collect your browsing data without your permission and sell it? I think the answer for 98 percent of the public is a resounding no.  Right now there is a single Federal agency that has the authority to protect consumers and their privacy when it comes to data collected by ISPs, and that is the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, but the Republicans are proposing that the Congress strip the FCC's ability to protect your privacy, and when they succeed, the American people will lose the very few Federal protections they have when it comes to online privacy.  Think about how much of your life is on line today--banking, health, your interactions with your kids, your kids' interactions with other kids. It is incredibly personal, and it is not just confidential information in a traditional sense or in a legal sense, it is really a complete picture of everything you are. That is why this is worth fighting about. It is worth protecting. That is why the FCC made these rules--to recognize that we live so much of our lives online and that in a lot of instances we don't really feel like we have a choice about whether we are going to engage in a contract to get broadband service. That is a necessity for many of us. Consumers deserve some basic protections, not only do the Republicans want to get rid of the FCC rule that basically says an ISP cannot collect your data and sell it for commercial purposes, but they want to do it in a way that will ensure that no Federal agency, not a single one, will have jurisdiction over privacy for consumers using broadband. They are trying to take the referee off the playing field and for good.  The problem is very simple. There are actually two agencies that could have jurisdiction over privacy online, but there was a Ninth Circuit Court decision that made a ruling that removes the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission over online privacy in the broadband space. So of the two agencies, the FTC and FCC, the FTC, according to this Federal court, no longer has jurisdiction. Now it is on the FCC's[[Page S1936]]side of the house, but if we repeal the FCC rule, the way the Congressional Review Act runs is that it will prevent us from ever addressing something ``substantially similar'' again. This isn't about agreeing or disagreeing with this rule. This isn't about whether you think the FCC or FTC ought to appropriately deal with this. This isn't a question about whether you think we should exercise our prerogatives in the public or private sectors. This is about whether you think nobody should have jurisdiction over your privacy online.  So what is the solution here?  Well, we should work with private sector leaders, the FCC, and the FTC to find a comprehensive approach to privacy online. That is what this legislative body should be doing. Instead of aggressively digging into this issue on behalf of consumers, we are actually blowing up the only thing we have, which is this FCC rule. To repeat, by using the Congressional Review Act, Republicans are forever preventing the FCC from protecting your privacy if you use broadband.  I want to end by noting that 55 years ago this month, President Kennedy gave a seminal speech about consumer rights. He spoke about the march of technology, how it had outpaced old laws and regulations, and how fast that progress had occurred. He noted that in just a few decades supermarkets went from carrying 1,500 products to more than 6,000, doctors wrote 90 percent of their prescriptions for drugs that no one had even heard of 20 years before, but let's fast forward to the present day, and we have blown those numbers out of the water. The average supermarket carries 40,000 products; in 2015 alone, the FDA approved 51 new drugs; and of course we now have the internet, which in the United States grew from 148 million users to nearly 240 million in just 15 years. The next nonincremental change in technology in our lives will be the internet of things, in which we will have tens of billions of devices connected to each other and interacting with us whether we like it or not. So the march of technology goes on, but what stays the same is the bedrock principle that President Kennedy outlined; that consumers have the right to be safe, they have the right to be informed, they have the right to choose, and they have the right to be heard. Those rights are in jeopardy. The FCC took a small but important step, and now the Republicans are blowing that up.  Let me be clear. This is the single biggest step backward for online privacy in many years, and we have failed the American people when it comes to their privacy. We should be staring this problem in the face, but what we are doing tonight and tomorrow is making it worse. That is why I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution.

1628,topic-id,525,"Madam President, today, we will vote on a resolution that will take away privacy protections from the American people. By voting for this resolution, Congress is ignoring the fact that people want more protections online, not fewer.  In 2016, Pew did a study to determine the state of privacy in the United States, and the center found ``Americans express a consistent lack of confidence about the security of everyday communication channels and the organizations that control them.''  Pew found that this is especially true when it comes to the internet. People no longer trust organizations--public or private--to protect the data they collect.  Today, we are going to make that worse. That is because broadband providers know our complete browsing history. Think about that for a second. They know everything we do online, everything we search for on a daily basis. Think about how personal that information is, how it paints a picture of who we are. It is totally reasonable for broadband providers to have to ask customers for their consent before they take that information--our browsing history, what we do online--and sell it to a third party.  That will no longer be the case after the Republicans vote for this bill and it is enacted into law. Broadband providers will be able to take your browsing history and sell it without your permission. The FCC spent months on this rule, and by using the CRA to get rid of it, Congress is taking away the FCC's authority to do anything like it ever again. That will mean there is no Federal agency--not the FTC, not the FCC--that will even have jurisdiction over the issue of privacy for broadband providers.  What is the solution here? We should work with the private sector, the FCC, and the FTC to find a comprehensive solution together.  At a time when data collection and use is increasing exponentially, Republicans should not be rolling back protections for consumers. This is yet another repeal without replace.  Fifty-five years ago this month, President Kennedy gave a seminal speech about consumer rights. He spoke about the march of technology--how it had outpaced old laws and regulations and how fast that progress had occurred. That progress is only getting faster.

Mr.Friedman has said that the State Department is anti-He has said that President Obama is an anti-He has said that the two-state solution solves a ``nonexistent problem.'' Mr.Friedman has called for Israeli citizens who are Arabs to be stripped of their civil rights. He has lobbed one of the worst words in Jewish history at large parts of the American Jewish community, calling them ``kapos,'' which is a term for the Jews who worked for the Nazis in concentration camps. These are more than just provocative statements by Mr.Friedman; they are lies.  For decades, the United States has stood firm as an honest broker of peace. We have said to both sides that they can trust us to help end this conflict, and that is based on the principle that the United States is passionate about peace in Israel but dispassionate about how we get there. Mr.Friedman is not objective about how we get there. On the contrary, he is very passionately for settlements, and he is very passionately against the two-state solution, which means he is basically against decades of bipartisan U.foreign policy.  Just a few months ago, the organization he led advertised that they have a new program that will train students to ``successfully delegitimize the notion of a two-state solution.'' This group is actively working to take the two-state solution off the table.  I understand that the Senate is not fully aligned on U.foreign policy when it comes to I understand we have our disagreements. We may disagree on whether a two-state solution is best, on where our Embassy should be located, and on how to approach the peace process, but there are some things we ought to be able to agree upon: that our Ambassador to Israel should not be more involved in Israel's politics than our own, that our Ambassador to Israel should not be so provocative that they wouldn't even be welcome at the negotiating table, and that our Ambassador should not be the kind of person who uses language to fuel violence, hate, and instability.

Judge Gorsuch may act like a studied, neutral judge, but his record suggests he actually has a rightwing, pro-corporate, special interest agenda. In today's New York Times, this morning we learned that Judge Gorsuch's career[[Page S1811]]has been nurtured by a far-right billionaire and corporate titan, Philip Anschutz, who has gone out of his way to fund hard-right judicial causes, including the Federalist Society and the Heritage President Trump outsourced his choice of a Supreme Court nominee to these organizations, and they recommended Judge  Neil Gorsuch represented Mr.Anschutz's firm as a young lawyer. He has earned his favor and patronage ever since. It was Anschutz's top lawyer, someone who represented Anschutz here on the Hill, who lobbied for Gorsuch to get the spot on the Federal appeals court. Judge Gorsuch has been partners in an LLC with two of Anschutz's top advisers, building a vacation home together. Of course, there is no problem with that. Anyone can be partners. But it goes to show the longstanding intertwined ties between one of the leading advocates for a hard-right pro-corporate agenda, Mr.Anschutz, and Judge The long history of ties between Judge Gorsuch and Mr.Anschutz suggests a judge whose fundamental economic and judicial philosophy is favorable to the wealthy and the powerful and the far right.  Judge Gorsuch may sometimes express sympathy for the less powerful verbally, but when it comes time to rule, when the chips are down, he has far too often sided with the powerful few over everyday Americans trying get a fair shake. He has repeatedly sided with insurance companies that want to deny disability benefits to employees. In employment discrimination cases, Bloomberg found he sided with employers 66 percent of the time. In one of the few cases where he sided with an employee, it was a Republican woman who alleged she was fired for being a conservative.  On money in politics, the scourge, the poison of our political system--undisclosed dark money--Judge Gorsuch seems to be in the same company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense contribution limits.  Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates he prefers CEOs over citizens, executives over employees, corporations over consumers.  Later this morning, I will be meeting with people who have personally experienced the real-life implications of Judge Gorsuch's decisions: Alphonso Maddin from Michigan, a truckdriver who was fired because he left his vehicle when freezing; Patricia Caplinger from Missouri, who sued Medtronic after being injured by a medical device implanted in a non-FDA-approved manner; David Hwang and Katherine Hwang, whose late mother, Proffer Grace Hwang, sued Kansas State University after being fired following a 6-month leave for cancer and requesting to work at home because of a flu epidemic.

1036,topic-id,684,"Mr.President, yesterday, President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was introduced in the Judiciary Committee for opening statements. We all look forward to today's round of questioning, during which I hope the nominee will be more forthcoming than he was with me. I am very sympathetic to the fact that judges should not offer opinions on cases that could come before the Court lest they bias themselves. Every Senator is aware of that. We know to ask general questions or questions about cases previously decided to get a sense of a judge's philosophy.  In our meeting, Judge Gorsuch refused to even answer those questions. For instance, I asked him a very simple question. I said forget about the case that was then pending in the Ninth Circuit on the Executive order. I said: Let's say Congress passed a law: No Muslim could enter the United Would that be unconstitutional?  He even refused to answer that question. So I hope he will be more willing to answer questions in the Judiciary Committee today, particularly about his views of important Supreme Court cases of the past and his own ideology. This idea that judges judge regardless of ideology is totally belied by the fact that there is a coalition right now--four judges on one side, four judges on the other. Four appointed by Democratic Presidents who generally rule one way, four appointed by Republican Presidents who generally rule the other.  If it was just interpreting the law without any input from a person's life and thoughts and ideology, we would not have that stark breakdown, but we do. In my view, the hard right, in trying to populate the bench with people way over, has adopted this philosophy, starting with Miguel Estrada: Don't answer the questions because if the American people knew how you really felt, they would not want you on the bench.  Let's take the case of President Of course President Trump considered ideology when he selected Judge Gorsuch off a list culled by the far-right Heritage Foundation and Federalist He did not pick the judges himself. He went to these extreme groups and said: You make a list. I promise I will pick people from that list.  Do you think organizations--these organizations--dedicated to a certain ideological viewpoint, did not consider ideology when building their list of possible Supreme Court picks? Of course they did.  President Trump said himself, he wanted to appoint a Justice who would overturn Roe v. The idea that he selected a judicious, neutral judge is belied by the selection process, totally and amazingly. That is how the President considered these judges. So it is not unreasonable for Senators to consider and question the ideology of a nominee in committee. President Trump sure did when he came up with a list. The only way for the Judiciary Committee to do that is if the nominee is willing to answer specific questions. If he is not willing to answer specific questions, what is the purpose of even holding a 4-day hearing?  Before I move on to another topic, I would like to point out that it is the height of irony that Republicans held this Supreme Court seat open for nearly a calendar year while President Obama was in office but are now rushing to fill the seat for a President whose campaign is under investigation by the  Even Representative Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the investigation, confirmed yesterday by FBI Director Comey, puts a ``big gray cloud'' over this administration. You can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic President was under investigation by the FBI, the Republicans would be howling at the Moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances.  After all, they stopped the President who was not under investigation from filling a seat with nearly a year left in his It is unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment while this ``big gray cloud'' of an FBI investigation hangs over the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1859-2.txt,1036,THE IMPACT OF TRUMPCARE,2017.0,21.0,March
1038,topic-id,1235,"Mr.President, the Republicans plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Their bill is such a mess and is proving so deeply unpopular that Republicans are playing a game of hot potato with it. Speaker Ryan does not want to call it The administration does not want to call it They are pointing at each other and hoping the other one takes responsibility and blame.  President Trump, who has tried to put his name on nearly everything in his career--ties, steaks, water--does not want his name on this bill. Well, the President himself is here on the Hill today to sell the bill to House Make no mistake, this is TrumpCare, the President's bill. Every American should know that if Republicans ultimately pass this bill, President Trump is behind it, and Republicans will have helped him every step of the way.  So voters, particularly Trump supporters, who would be hurt most by this TrumpCare should remember that when your premiums start going up, President Trump did that. When your insurance does not cover all the things it used to, President Trump did that. If you are older and insurance companies are now charging you exorbitant premiums, several times what you used to pay, President Trump did that. When 24 million fewer Americans have health insurance while the wealthiest Americans get a huge tax break, you can be sure President Trump did that too.  Even now, the changes House Republicans are making to buy off different factions of their caucus are making the bill more harsh. Some of these changes will further weaken Medicaid and result in even fewer Americans with healthcare coverage. Though Republicans claim they are fixing the bill's unfair tax on older Americans, they are not. The truth is, the Republican age tax is still in the bill. People in their fifties and sixties still stand to lose big time.  The larger truth is, Republicans are not trying to make this bill better. They are just trying to make it pass with all their various factions pulling them in different directions. There is no better evidence of that than the new ``Senate slush fund,'' a $75 billion earmark the House is giving the Senate to buy off Republican Senators who don't want to vote for this bill.  What happened to our fiscal conservative friends in the House--no unnecessary expenditures. A $75 billion slush fund. It doesn't even say what it does. Many Republican Senators don't want to vote on the House bill because it is going to crush older Americans with a new age tax, but make no mistake about it, the Senate slush fund is not going to fix that problem at all.  Here is the biggest problem. The consequences of TrumpCare are so bad for working Americans and older Americans that my friend the majority leader may rush it through the Chamber after we get it from the He has already said TrumpCare is going to bypass committees and go right to the floor. There is even talk that Republican Senators, under his leadership, are negotiating a substitute bill behind closed doors that would take its place and also go straight to the floor.  That is not how we should do business here on something as important as healthcare. That is not just my view, that is the majority leader's view. Listen to what the distinguished majority leader--then-minority leader--said[[Page S1860]]about healthcare reform in 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being debated. He said--these are Mitch McConnell's words:       We shouldn't try to do it in the dark. And whatever final      bill is produced should be available to the American public      and to Members of the Senate for enough time to come to grips      with it. There should be and must be a CBO score.  Let me repeat that. ``There should be and must be a CBO score.'' I would ask our leader, are we going to have one before he rushes this bill to the floor? I hope so. ``We are going to insist,'' he said, ``that it be done in a transparent and fair and open way.''  Well, the majority leader delights in pointing out instances when Democrats seemed to go back on something they said. So I certainly hope he follows his own advice from 2009 now that he is majority leader. We hope to see a published bill, with Senators given time to review, and a CBO score before anything moves forward--a fair, open, and transparent process, as he said.  I know why he wants to move so quickly. The majority leader knows how bad the bill actually is. In fact, the consequences of TrumpCare are so bad that Republicans are talking about other phases of the plan, promising a second and third prong that will somehow make this bill better for American people down the road. They say to their colleagues: Well, this bill is bad, but we will change it in the second and third prongs.  Well, that is a diversion. If Republicans can't live with this bill, they should shelve it because those other prongs are either not going to happen or will make it worse.  I can speak with some authority on the third prong. It is going to require 60 votes. That is what will be needed for the Republican legislation to make more changes to our healthcare system--60 votes, which means at least 8 Democratic votes.  I warn my Republican colleagues: Once you repeal ACA in this fashion--just ripping it out, having nothing good to put in its place--our healthcare system is going to be too messed up to resuscitate it with piecemeal legislation down the road. Even my Republican friends, Senators on the other side of the aisle, said as much. My friend, the junior Senator from Texas, Senator Cruz, said: ``Anything placed in so-called bucket three won't pass.'' You are right, If we want to pass real reforms, we have to do it now and on budget reconciliation. Senator Cruz is right again.  My friend, the junior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Cotton, freely admits that ``there is no three-phase process. There is no three-phase plan. That is just political talk. It's just politicians engaging in spin.'' Senator Cotton, I couldn't have said it better myself.  All Republicans in the House and Senate should hear this: Democrats will not help Republicans repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act--in one phase, two phases, or three phases. This TrumpCare bill would cause such immense damage to our country, its citizens, average working families who are going to be paying more and getting less, we are not going to be complicit. But we will work with our Republican colleagues to improve the existing law.  If the President and the majority leader say ``All right, we are not going to repeal; let's work on some changes,'' we will do it with them. Of course we will listen. But they have to drop repeal first.  Again, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to drop their repeal efforts, drop TrumpCare--non-negotiated, not a drop of bipartisanship in it--and come negotiate with Democrats on improvements to the Affordable Care Turn back before it is too late--too late for the American people who will be hurt and too late for all of you who will also be hurt as you try to defend TrumpCare in the next few years.

1417,topic-id,1671,"Mr.President, yesterday Judge Neil Gorsuch went through over 11 hours of questioning in the Judiciary As expected, he used the opportunity to speak at length about his knowledge of case law, hiding behind precedents rather than giving an impression of his actual views. As expected, his supporters are saying that Judge Gorsuch was erudite, polished, homespun. But none of this matters compared to the real purpose of hearings: to find out a nominee's views and what kind of judge he will be, not how his repartee from the bench will sound.  For 11 hours, Judge Gorsuch looked like he was playing dodgeball with the Senate Judiciary Committee, bending over backward to avoid revealing anything that might constitute a judicial philosophy or give hints about his approach to the legal issues of our day. Those, to me, are far more important than any superficial impressions he may have left. He dodged questions on previous cases like Citizens United, Rowe v. Wade, and Brown v. He dodged general questions on dark money in politics, LGBTQ rights, and the constitutionality of a Muslim ban.  He did manage to wax poetic on the significance of a judge's robe and the humility it brings. He said it reminds us that ``ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.'' Well, if he were truly humbled, he would realize the augustness of this position and answer questions directly. Judge Gorsuch's testimony yesterday was replete with humble kinds of metaphors and homespun stories but pitifully short on substance, which is what really matters.  The hearings this week are starting to have the element of farce. The Republicans ask softball questions, while we Democrats endeavor to get the judge to offer a meaningful response on one--any legal issue but are met with constant refrains of ``That is settled law'' and ``I can't prejudge'' and ``Gee, Senator, my personal views have no place here.'' Let me repeat. There is no legal precedent, rule, or logic for failing to answer questions that don't involve immediate and specific cases before the Is Judge Gorsuch hiding behind this rhetoric because he does not want people to know his views?  After 4 days of this Kabuki theatre, the press will write that Judge Gorsuch was smooth and well-spoken, but I doubt that even at the end of the hearing process we will have any greater views of his jurisprudence. Will we know any better than we do today what kind of Justice he will be on our Nation's highest Court?  You know, we have seen this before. It was not all that long ago that another charming, polished, erudite judge named John Roberts came before the committee, impressing lawmakers while playing the role of a model jurist. He displayed a similar reluctance to answer specific questions, but he assured us all that he was a judge who was free from the biases of politics and ideology, that, in his words, he simply ``called balls and strikes.'' We were duped. Judge Roberts showed his true activist colors as soon as he got to the bench and dragged the Court sharply to the right, ruling consistently in favor of wealthy special interests and powerful corporations. The whole episode with Judge Gorsuch feels like a Roberts' rerun. If his voting record is any indication, according to the New York Times survey, he will be even more conservative than Justice  This is not how the hearing process is supposed to work. Although it has become practice for Supreme Court Justices to elude specific questions, it is not in the best interests of our country to elevate a cipher to the Supreme We don't want the qualifications for Senate confirmation to be an ability of skillful evasion. The hearing process cannot accomplish what it is designed to if the nominee refuses to engage on matters of legal substance.  If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch does not have strong views, that he is not simply a caller of balls and strikes, a tabula rasa, just look at the way he was chosen. He was supported and pushed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Do they just call balls and strikes, or do those two groups have an avowed interest in moving the judiciary far to the right? He was supported by billionaires like Mr.Anschutz who have a similar desire. Does anyone think the Federalist Society would choose someone who just called balls and strikes when they have been dedicated for a generation to moving the courts to the right? They have not endorsed a moderate judge in their history. Again, they are dedicated to moving the court far away from the mainstream.  If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch would be an activist judge with strong conservative views eschewing the interests of average people, just look at how he was selected--by the Federalist Society, by the Heritage foundation, not by average American jurists.                               TrumpCare  Mr.President, on another matter, TrumpCare, as we speak, the House Republican leadership is desperately trying to whip enough votes to pass their bill tomorrow, making sweetheart deals to sway recalcitrant  It is funny that all the changes House Republicans have made this past week don't even attempt to address the real problems with the bill: that 24 million fewer Americans will have coverage and that premiums will go up. In fact, the changes they are making to TrumpCare are even more cruel than their existing bill in an attempt to win conservative votes. Still, many of them don't think it is cruel enough yet. In their rush, they included language in their managers' amendment that would exclude 7 million or so veterans from the eligibility for tax credits in the bill--7 million veterans. That is what happens when you try to rush a complicated bill like this through.  When Democrats were in the majority and working through healthcare, we debated the bill over the course of a whole year. We had one of the longest committee hearings and amendment processes in recent memory. Still, even then, Republicans criticized us for trying to jam it through. ``Read the bill,'' they would chant.  Now Republicans are trying to do in 2 weeks what we spent 1 year on because the time was required. My friend the distinguished majority leader says he hopes to have TrumpCare brought up and passed through the Senate by the end of next week--no committee process, potentially no CBO score.  I guess Senate Republicans are negotiating a substitute bill behind closed doors right now to meet that accelerated, speedy, and reckless timeline. When you are talking about a drastic reformation of our healthcare system, one-sixth of our economy, that is breathtakingly irresponsible and rankly hypocritical. When will Democrats get to view the substitute bill? Will there be a CBO score before both Republicans and Democrats have to vote on it in the Senate? We don't know. But rushing it through in this fashion, as the majority leader promised, is unwise and unfair to Democratic Senators and, far more importantly, to the American people. It is also a direct contradiction to how then-Minority Leader McConnell spoke about health reform in 2009. Here is what he said: ``We shouldn't try to do it in the dark, and whatever final bill is produced should be available to the American public and to members of the Senate for enough time to come to grips with it, and there should be and must be a CBO score.''  Well, Leader McConnell, what was good enough for us back in 2009 should be good enough for you today.  I certainly hope Leader McConnell follows his own advice from 2009 now that he is majority leader.[[Page S1903]]  My Republican friends like to claim this bill isn't the end of the story on healthcare. They claim they can pass a third prong later on down the road. Republicans in the Senate and the House should know this: There is no third prong. It is a fantasy.  Any legislation outside of reconciliation requires 60 votes, and Democrats will not help Republicans repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act today, tomorrow, or 6 months from now. This bill, TrumpCare, Republicans, is your one shot.  I think that is why House Republicans have tried to jam some extra policy changes onto their bill--like the Medicaid work requirement and the restrictions on abortion--because they know they won't be able to later on, and they need more conservative votes to pass this bill tomorrow.  This approach has a serious problem. There is a serious question as to whether these changes are budgetary changes or policy changes. If they are policy changes, they will not meet the Senate's standards of reconciliation, known as the Byrd rule, and can be stricken from the bill.  Of particular vulnerability, my Republican colleagues, are provisions like the Medicaid work requirement and the restrictions on abortion. House Republicans should hear this before they vote: Those provisions that you might think help you vote yes on the bill may not survive. Factor that into your vote.  Ahead of the vote tomorrow, I just want to say to my Republican colleagues--and I have sympathy, although I don't agree. I vehemently disagree. I know you feel caught between a rock and a hard place, between the prospect of failing to fulfill a shrill and unthought-through campaign pledge and a bill that would badly hurt millions of Americans, particularly your voters.  I say to them: There is a way out. Drop your efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Democrats will work with you on serious proposals to improve the existing law. Drop Come to us with some ideas on how to improve the ACA, and we will sit down with you and try to figure out what is best for our country. You can avoid this disaster of a bill called TrumpCare, which will result in higher costs, less care, and 24 million fewer Americans with health coverage. Turn back before it is too late.

Our hearts go out to those who were lost.

I would particularly like to recognize the outstanding work done by every Democratic member of the Judiciary They were outstanding in questioning Judge Gorsuch despite his lack of candor and desire to answer. I would like to particularly call out our exceptional ranking member, Senator Feinstein, who has done a wonderful job leading that committee.  I have thought long and hard about his nomination and what it means for the future of the Supreme Court and for the future of our country. What is at stake is considerable. The decisions we make here in the Senate over the next few weeks about Judge Gorsuch, as on any Supreme Court nominee, will echo through the lifetime tenure of that judge, through a generation of  Discussions of the Supreme Court can get wonky and technical, with invocations of precedent and canons of interpretation. What is at stake, however, is not at all abstract; it is real and it is concrete for Americans, whose lives, health, happiness, and freedoms are on the line at the Supreme Closely divided decisions recently have meant the difference between the ability to marry the person you love or not, the ability to have your right to vote protected or not, the ability to make personal choices about your own healthcare or not. The Supreme Court matters a great deal. It matters for workers who want to protect both their lives and their jobs, for employees who need to be able to seek redress for discrimination, and for parents who want their kids to get a fair shake in the education system.  It is with all this in mind that I have come to a decision about the current nominee. After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme His nomination will face a cloture vote. He will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation. My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  To my Republican friends who think that if Judge Gorsuch fails to reach 60 votes, we ought to change the rules, I say: If this nominee cannot earn 60 votes--a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees and George Bush's last two nominees--the answer isn't to change the rules, it is to change the nominee.  This morning, I would like to lay out the reasons I will be voting no on this nomination.  First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he would be an independent check on a President who has shown almost no restraint from Executive overreach.  Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream Justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology. His career and judicial record suggest not a neutral legal mind but someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology. He was groomed by the Federalist Society and has not shown 1 inch of difference between his views and theirs.  Finally, he is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak, corporations over working There could not be a worse time for someone with those instincts.  Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to disabuse us of all these objections was in the hearing process, but he declined to answer question after question after question with any substance. Absent a real description of judicial philosophy, all we have to judge the judge on is his record.  First, I want to address the first issue I raised, that of judicial independence. It is so clear that at this moment in our history, our democracy requires a judge who is willing to rule against this This administration seems to have little regard for the rule of law and is likely to test the Constitution in ways it hasn't been challenged in decades. It is absolutely the case that this Supreme Court will be tried in ways that few courts have been tested since the earliest days of the Republic when constitutional questions abounded.  The President himself has attacked individual judges and the credibility of the judiciary at large. The President has attacked a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit and said if they didn't decide with him, they would be responsible for the next terrorist act. I have never heard any President in my lifetime or read about any President in previous history who dared do that. We are in uncharted territory with this President and with judicial independence. It requires a strong independent backbone. Judge Gorsuch has shown none. Senators on the Judiciary Committee rightly asked Judge Gorsuch direct questions about this issue. I did so myself in my meeting with the judge. While the judge repeatedly asserted his independence, he could not point to anything in his record to guarantee it. Judge Gorsuch offered the Judiciary myriad platitudes on this point. ``No man is above the law,'' he said. He said he was ``disheartened'' by the President's attacks on the judiciary. The President, for his sake, said that Judge Gorsuch didn't mean him, and everyone left it at that.  If Judge Gorsuch had an ounce of courage, had shown a scintilla of an ability to be independent, he would have said: No, Mr.No, President Trump, I did mean you. Instead, he just tells us in general that he is demoralized, disheartened. Telling us is not the same as showing us. He is asking us to take him at his word, but his record suggests that he has long been someone who has advocated extreme deference to assertions of broad Presidential power.  That leads me to my second point; that Judge Gorsuch was unable to convince me that he would be a neutral judge, free of ideology and bias. The hearings this week were an opportunity for Judge Gorsuch to explain his record, to tell us how he thinks and how his judicial philosophy does not fundamentally advantage the powerful. Instead, we got banalities and platitudes. We didn't get any real answers to any real questions about what he thinks about the law and why. He refused to answer general questions on dark money in politics, LGBTQ rights, the constitutionality of the Muslim ban. I couldn't believe it, when I asked him: Is a law that bans Muslims, a law that just said all Muslims are banned from the U.unconstitutional, he couldn't even answer that. He refused to say whether he agreed with Supreme Court decisions in seminal cases like Brown v. Board, Roe v. Wade, Griswold v. Connecticut, despite the fact that his predecessors, Justices Roberts and Alito, said they agreed with those cases.  He refused to answer questions about the emoluments clause, a section of the[[Page S1946]]Constitution that prohibits foreign corruption of U.officials. Instead of an umpire calling balls and strikes in baseball, what we really saw was a well-trained expert in dodgeball.  My friend, the ranking member of the committee, said it best. ``What worries me,'' she told the nominee, ``is that you have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have ever seen before.''  Let me repeat. There is no legal standard, rule, or even logic for failing to answer questions that don't involve immediate and specific cases that are or could come before the It is evasion, just evasion, plain and simple, and it belies a deeper truth about this nominee.  If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have strong views, that thinks he would be a neutral judge calling balls and strikes as Judge Roberts once put it, just look at the way he was chosen. He was supported and pushed forward by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, and groomed by billionaire conservatives like Mr.President Trump simply picked someone from off their list.  President Trump sought the advice and consent from the Federalist Society instead of from the U.Does anyone think the Federalist Society would choose someone who just called balls and strikes? Does anyone think they would put on their list a neutral, moderate judge when they haven't ever supported anyone but judicial conservatives, almost all hard-right judicial conservatives in their history? The Federalist Society has been dedicated for a generation to influence the courts to favor corporations and special interests. If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch could be an activist judge with views eschewing the interests of average people, look at how he was selected--by a group that is not neutral, a group that has been dedicated to changing the judiciary and placing activist, hard-right judges on the bench. Now that he is nominated, look at how much money, dark, secret, undisclosed money--it is a good bet from the very corporations Judge Gorsuch has been defending his whole career. If he were so neutral, would they be spending this money? I doubt it.  Anyone groomed by the Federalist Society will not call balls and strikes. Their views are best foretold by the ideology of the people who groomed them. To say Judge Gorsuch has no ideology whatsoever is absurd. He just will not admit it to the American people. To say he is just neutral in his views is belied by his history since his college days and by his own judicial record. He even tried to deny it. In the hearings, Judge Gorsuch repeated the hollow assertion that judges don't have parties or politics. He said there are no Democratic judges or Republican judges, but if that were true, we wouldn't be here, would we? If that were true, if the Senate were merely evaluating a nominee based on his or her qualifications, Merrick Garland would be seated on the Supreme Court right now.

The Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for a year under a Democratic President who was under no investigation but now are rushing to fill the seat for a President whose campaign is under investigation. It is unseemly and wrong to be moving so fast on a lifetime appointment in such circumstances.  Finally, Judge Gorsuch came into this hearing with a record that raises deep concerns about whether he would consider fairly the plight of the average citizen before the interests of powerful special interests. I examined his record. I saw a judge who repeatedly decided with insurance companies that wanted to deny disability benefits to employees. I saw a judge who, in unemployment discrimination, sided with employers the great majority of the time. I saw a judge who, on the issue of money and politics, seems to be in the same company as Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense contribution limits.  In the hearings, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to explain his philosophy, did nothing to assuage those concerns. We will just have to go by his record, a record that shows time and time again his rulings favor the already powerful over ordinary  Judge Gorsuch ruled against a teacher, Grace Hwang, who, having been through two bouts of cancer, was advised by her doctors not to return to the college campus during a flu epidemic lest she put her life at risk. She was fired for taking sick leave. Judge Gorsuch, true to form, voted to uphold that dismissal. Her daughter Katherine told us last week:       This decision to protect her health cost my mom her job.      When Judge Gorsuch issued his ruling, he didn't think about      the impact that this had on our family. The law calls for      ``reasonable accommodation for those who are disabled.''  Judge Gorsuch ignored the human cost.  Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truckdriver, Alfonse Maddin, who had to make a similar choice between his employer and his life. I met with him. He told me a harrowing story of being stuck in the cab of a tractor-trailer with frozen brakes, no heat, temperatures outside dipping to 27 below zero. He had a choice, leave the trailer with broken brakes and drive the cab to safety or stay in the trailer and freeze to death. He radioed his company to explain his predicament. They told him that the cargo was the most important thing; he couldn't leave it. Rather than risk the lives of other motorists on a freezing highway by driving a trailer with frozen brakes, Mr.Maddin struggled to unhitch his trailer and drive his cab to safety--returning later for it once he was not at risk of dying from the cold. For that, his company fired him. He sued. Seven judges heard this case as it went through appeal. Only one, Judge Gorsuch, in dissent, ruled against him. Judge Gorsuch used an exceptionally technical and illogical reading of the statute to reach the absurd conclusion that Mr.Maddin was obligated to risk his life to protect his cargo.  Mr.Maddin said that Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court gives him ``pause for concern'' because he ``demonstrated a willingness to artfully diminish the humane element that encompassed the issue.''  Judge Gorsuch also ruled against a parent of a severely autistic child, Luke, who sought what the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act guarantees him--the right to an education that met his needs. Jeff Perkins, Luke's father, is testifying before the Judiciary Committee today. Their story is powerful. Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke was not entitled to attend a specialized school because he was able to make more than de minimis progress in the normal educational system.  Just yesterday, the Supreme Court unanimously--including Justice Alito and so many others who are so conservative--rejected Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of the The Court held that ``when all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing `merely more than a de minimis progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.' '' That puts Judge Gorsuch's interpretation of the IDEA law to the right of even Justice Thomas--a very difficult feat.  Whom we put on the bench, their basic judgment, matters. While I do not think that the personal views and experiences should bear on the decisions of day-to-day cases, there is a reason we don't program computers to decide cases. We do not want judges with ice water in their veins. What we want and need are judges who understand the litigants before them and bring a modicum--at least a modicum--of human judgment into the courtroom. You can call this trait empathy or mercy. I think it falls in the category of common sense. It is common sense that necessarily comes from each person's own, unique life experience. Even Judge Gorsuch acknowledged this when he told the committee ``I am not an algorithm.'' Yet he wouldn't tell us how, as a human--a nonalgorithm--he would uniquely approach a case.  When it comes to the application of the law, that empathy, that mercy,[[Page S1947]]that ``humane element'' of common sense--as Alphonse Maddin, the truckdriver, put it--is the most important judicial trait of them all because ultimately the law is abstract, but the people and situations are real. The task of the judge is to apply those abstract legal doctrines to very humane and sometimes very messy situations. It is a hard thing to do to bring fairness and justice to a world that is too short on both.  I am reminded of the words spoken by Portia, the great lawyer in ``The Merchant of Venice,'' who spoke of the blessings and necessity of mercy in applying the law.  He said:     The quality of mercy is not strain'd,     It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven     Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:     It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.     'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes     The thron-ed monarch better than his crown;     His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,     The attribute to awe and majesty,     Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;     But mercy is above this sceptred sway,     It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,     It is an attribute to God himself.  Judge Gorsuch told us he is not God, and that is true, but his humanity does not excuse him from the attribute of mercy. Instead, his humanity should require it.  Alphonse Maddin sought the mercy of the law. The Hwang family sought the mercy of the law. Luke, the autistic child whose school was failing him, sought the mercy of the law. The man who had the power to see plain sense in their cases, who could rule in their favor and right the wrongs that had been done to them as other judges had done in each of those cases--Judge Neil Gorsuch--said no.  I am voting no on Gorsuch for Alphonse Maddin and workers across the country, for the Hwang family and others who do not want to choose between their health and providing for their children, and for the Perkins family, who loves their children just as they are and wants for them no fewer than the opportunities afforded to every other child in  The American people deserve someone who sees average litigants as more than incidental consequences of precedent, when that precedent produces an absurd result, whose view of the law is not so cold and so arid so as to wring out every last drop of humanity and common sense. It requires only the bare minimum of judicial decency to rule the right way in the cases I have mentioned, and Judge Gorsuch did not.  That is all the evidence my colleagues should need to vote no, and I urge them and will urge them in the days ahead to do so.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1525,topic-id,421,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have at least two different sides up here, and people are entitled to believe whatever they want to believe. I am entitled to the same opinion of myself, also.  There are also a set of answers and facts that need to be given, evidently, and that is, in fact, we do make changes in the bill to We do.  Mr.Speaker, the law, the way it was written, we have virtually few 30-year-olds to 45-year-olds that actually pay for ObamaCare, the people we were told who needed it the most. The reason why is because it was dictated from Washington how to rate the coverage. In rating that coverage, it became so illogically expensive for a young person to pay an astronomical amount for their insurance, and even many times a higher value for their deductible, to where 30-year-olds, 35-year-olds, 36-year-olds, 37-year-olds chose simply not to take the policy offered.  So what do Republicans do? It is real simple. Here is what Republicans do: They allow the States the flexibility to determine what might be called a rating.  And it is true that, now, people will be rated based upon their own actuarial experience of where they are in life, their age. Mr.Speaker, it is true that a 25-year-old, 30-year-old, 35-year-old needs less necessary intricate and expensive health care. And it is actuarially true that the older that we get--I celebrated my birthday yesterday. I get it. I am getting older, and I probably am a little more expensive at the doctor in things that I need, especially into my future.  So what we did is we said where you have that rating system, we will allow more money through the tax credit system to adjust that so that a 50- to 64-year-old will not be at a disadvantage because those, too, are the people we want in the healthcare plan.  So we are actually going to add, by making it actuarially sound and attractive, a whole bunch of younger people; and we are going to recognize this balance, and we are going to provide more of an incentive to balance out for those who are older. That makes sense.  It is also reality based, Mr.But to say that someone is going to be paying more without us recognizing that and doing something about it would not be a fair argument.

What a shame the gentleman was not here to vote for the Affordable Care Act when it took hold several years ago, and he would have known this is a bad deal.  Mr.Speaker, even the American people cannot be fooled. The American people saw ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, waste billions of dollars simply to try and put together a computer system.  Mr.Speaker, the American people understand it was a tax bill. It is about using the IRS, and they were going to add 17,000 employees, literally, to beat the brains out of the American people to force them into having health care from  Mr.Speaker, no wonder Republicans won the majority several years ago. No wonder Republicans have saved the American people not only from the IRS, but from the massive taxes that were embedded within this huge government takeover of our healthcare system.  The bottom line is that my colleagues have not yet met a tax they wouldn't be for. They have not yet built and grown these massive government organizations to the tune that they want to force the American people to do things. And they are having a difficult time understanding today why the American people--if given a choice and an opportunity and an advantage that would be fair for all Americans to have a tax credit, why that is something that people really want to see.

Mr.Mr.Speaker, since the ACA was enacted, California's uninsured rate has dropped by 54 percent. Over 263,000 people have gained coverage in the three counties in my district. But now my Republican colleagues want us to pass a replacement bill that will strip away health care for 24 million  TrumpCare guts the Medicare program and creates a new, pre-broken system that rations health care for more than 76 million In my district alone, more than 64,000 people will lose coverage because of the provisions of the Republican replacement bill. It will take money away from our hospitals and eliminate 4,000 jobs in San Joaquin County alone. Working and middle class families will be forced to pay more for less. This will increase healthcare costs and decrease the quality of coverage available. Americans deserve access to quality healthcare coverage and health care that they can afford.  I ask my Republican colleagues to withdraw this terrible bill and work across the aisle, for once, to improve the ACA that benefits all I strongly oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

200,topic-id,2011,"Mr.President, I am happy to join my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Cardin, in urging the Senate to approve Montenegro's accession into It is long overdue, as they have both said. This is something that has been approved by the Foreign Relations Committee not once but twice--last year in the last Congress and again in January of this year. We have heard expert testimony from a whole bipartisan group of diplomats, national security experts, and former administration officials, urging quick action on Montenegro's accession. There is no reason for any further delay.  My colleagues here who have been such great leaders on the importance of responding to Russia's actions, of addressing their interference in our elections here in America, but also of addressing what they are doing in Europe, have said it very eloquently. We need to get this done; and 25 of the 28 member states have already ratified the protocol, according to their own procedures. The Senate must act.  One of the priorities of the NATO summit last year in Warsaw was bolstering NATO's resilience and its capacity to deter Russian aggression against NATO's eastern flank. At that summit, NATO invited Montenegro to become its 29th member.  As Senators McCain and Cardin have already said, Russia is opposed to Montenegro's accession into It has warned Montenegro of retaliation if it pursues NATO membership. Furthermore, we have seen what that retaliation looked like.  During Montenegro's general election last October, 20 people were arrested on suspicion of plotting, with support from Russia, to overthrow the government and assassinate the Prime Minister--all because he has supported NATO accession.  When we were in Munich for the security conference a couple of weeks ago, Senator McCain and I and the congressional delegation that was there heard from Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanovic, who talked about what he experienced from the Russians and about the Russian effort to overthrow his government, a duly elected democracy.  Just last month, their chief special prosecutor announced that his government had evidence that Russia's Federal Security Service was involved in a failed coup.  Mr.President, I have two news articles about this story that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record so that everybody understands that it is very clear what is going on.

Katnic said the plot was an attempt to stop Montenegro from      joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or      ``Behind these events are nationalist structures from Russia,      but we now know that certain Russian state authorities were      involved also on a certain level,'' Katnic said.

According to Katnic, Sismakov is also known as Eduard      Shirokov, and was issued a passport with the different name      by Russian authorities.       ``The passport was given to him by certain Russian state      bodies under another name, and he is a member of the Russian      military structures,'' Katnic said. ``And his name is Eduard      Sismakov, that is his personal identity and we will charge      him under that personal identity.''       Katnic added: ``It is clear that the passport could not      have been issued under another name as well as everything      else--sending to Serbia, organizing everything--without the      involvement of certain structures.''

Ristic is wanted by Montenegro for attempted      terrorism, according to Interpol's Red       The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday dismissed      Katnic's accusations.       ``Day after day, we are faced with absurd accusations about      Day after day we[[Page S1829]]     deny these accusations.

Montenegro is in accession talks to join the alliance after      NATO formally invited the southeastern European county in      December 2015. The move spurred threats from Russian      officials, who are at odds with NATO over a multitude of      issues, including Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane in      December 2015.       At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the      incident ``an enemy act.''       Becoming an official member of NATO would be significant      for Montenegro because, under the alliance's charter, any      attack on Montenegro would be seen as an attack on all NATO      members.       The ratification process for Montenegro to join NATO is in      its final stages, according to                                  ____                   [From the Guardian, 11, 2016]     Serbia Deports Russians Suspected of Plotting Montenegro Coup       Serbia has deported a group of Russians suspected of      involvement in a coup plot in neighbouring Montenegro, the      Guardian has learned, in the latest twist in a murky sequence      of events that apparently threatened the lives of two      European prime ministers.       The plotters were allegedly going to dress in police      uniforms to storm the Montenegrin parliament in Podgorica,      shoot the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, and install a pro-     Moscow party.       The Russian fingerprints on the October plot have      heightened intrigue about Moscow's ambitions in a part of      Europe hitherto thought to be gravitating towards the EU's      orbit.       A group of 20 Serbians and Montenegrins, some of whom had      fought with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine,      were arrested in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital. In      Serbia, meanwhile, several Russian nationals suspected of      coordinating the plot were caught with =120,000 and special      forces uniforms.       According to a Belgrade daily, the Russians also had      encryption equipment and were able to keep track of      Djukanovic's whereabouts.       Diplomatic sources told the Guardian the Belgrade      government quietly deported the Russians after the      intervention of the head of the Russian security council,      Nikolai Patrushev, who flew to Belgrade on 26 October in an      apparent effort to contain the scandal. The country's      interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic denied the government      carried out any deportations connected to the plot.       A source close to the Belgrade government said Patrushev, a      former FSB (federal security service) chief, apologised for      what he characterised as a rogue operation that did not have      the Kremlin's sanction. In Moscow, a Security Council      official told Tass that Patrushev ``didn't apologise to      anyone, because there is nothing to apologise for''.       The Serbian government was further rattled three days after      Patrushev's visit when a cache of arms was found near the      home of the prime minister, Aleksandar The weapons      were discovered at a junction where Vucic's car would      normally slow down on his way to the house.       Stefanovic said there were ``strong suspicions'' that an      organised crime gang had been hired to kill Vucic for =10m,      but he would not specify who was behind the alleged plot,      saying further investigation would show whether people      ``outside the region'' were involved.       ``You know the people who don't like a strong Vucic or a      strong government of Serbia and who could contribute some      money, =10m or so, to see this kind of thing done,''      Stefanovic told the       ``We know that the people who were potentially hired to do      this kind of thing were from the region, but not from Serbia,      and that there were crime groups that are operating in the      region that were involved. But these were just the trigger      persons,'' the minister added.       ``We believe that criminal gangs are just being used to do      the job, but the motives are not linked to the gangs. The      assassination of the prime minister is not something that      even they would do lightly, we believe they are being used.''       Since the discovery of the weapons, Vucic has announced      plans to shake up the intelligence service, saying the      security situation was ``even more serious than we      expected.''       ``There will be changes in the secret service,'' he told      the public broadcaster, ``I believed in the skills of      people who didn't show that they have these capacities, but      I'll take responsibility for this.''       It is unclear whether there is a connection between the      alleged assassination plots against Vucic and But      the intrigue of the past month comes against a backdrop of      fierce east-west competition.       Djukanovic has been instrumental in pulling his country to      the verge of NATO membership--an accession protocol was      signed in May--which has dashed Russian hopes of securing a      naval foothold on the According to the Montenegrin      press, Moscow lobbied hard in recent years for transit and      maintenance facilities at the ports of Bar and       The importance of such facilities was demonstrated late      last month when a Russian carrier and its battle group was      denied refueling in European ports along the way to support      the Russian military effort in       In Serbia, Vucic has been seeking a delicate balance      between NATO and Russia, and the country's armed forces have      conducted military exercises with both, although far more      frequently in recent years with Vucic has also refused      to grant diplomatic status to Russian officials staffing a      Serbian-Russian humanitarian center established in the city      of Nis in 2012, infuriating       Western officials suspect the center of being a Trojan      horse, which could expanded as a hub for intelligence and      paramilitary operations in the region. Diplomatic status,      they point out, would have allowed equipment to be brought in      without oversight by Serbian customs.       Some analysts have suggested the operation could have been      mounted as a ``semi-freelance'' one, giving enough distance      from Moscow to be plausibly deniable if was uncovered.       ``Both sides have an interest in playing this as a      freelance, vigilante-type thing, it allows them both to save      face. Whether that's actually true is unclear. There's simply      not enough evidence either to support or disprove it,'' said      Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based analyst.       ``Judging from the amount of logistical and financial      support they got, it looks likely they acted with at least a      tacit understanding that this was sanctioned.''       A few days after the would-be coup, a former intelligence      officer, Leonid Reshetnikov, who ran a hawkish research      institute in Moscow, was relieved of his duties by The      Russian Institute for Strategic Studies has a branch office      in Belgrade, and Reshetnikov had given strong backing to the      anti-Nato opposition party in       A regional analyst who did not want to be named said his      understanding from intelligence sources was that the      incidents in the Balkans were probably linked to Russian      attempts to gain influence and leverage in the Balkans in the      run-up to an anticipated Hillary Clinton US presidency, which      was expected to take a harder line on Russian activity in the      region.       In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry took a dim view of      this Guardian report on the Balkan events. Maria Zakharova,      spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry wrote: ``The      publication in the Guardian with a link to `sources' saying      that Patrushev apologised for `Russian nationalists' who had      planned to kill the prime minister of Montenegro is a classic      provocation aimed at spreading knowingly false information.''

When are people in the Senate going to stop holding hostage things that are totally unrelated to the work on the floor of the Senate and start acting like adults and doing what we ought to be doing in this body? It is so hard to understand why somebody is here doing that, and, you know, I am disappointed that he is not willing to come to the floor and say why he is holding this up. If he has a good reason, he should be here talking about that reason, and let's see if we can find a compromise. But if he is not willing to come to the floor and talk about it, what does that mean?

241,topic-id,1476,"Mr.President, I come to the floor again today to speak about a program I have been working on that has had bipartisan support for a number of years; that is, the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa This program allows Afghans, including interpreters, who have supported the U.mission in Afghanistan and who face threats as a result of their service to apply for refuge in the United As I said, this has had strong bipartisan support. I have worked with Senators McCain, Tillis, Leahy, Graham, and so many others here in the Chamber to try to make sure we provide enough visas for those Afghans who are being threatened and who want to come to the United  I wish to point out that the Trump administration, even as it has sharply restricted immigration and refugee programs, has made exceptions for those who served alongside our soldiers and diplomats. In fact, when the administration's original Executive order on immigration was released, there was bipartisan anger that Iraqi interpreters were not protected because this program has served not just those in Afghanistan who have helped us but also those in So the administration recognized its mistake and has made an exception for Iraqi SIV recipients, and now they have exempted Iraq from their Executive order.  It is really past time that we rally renewed support for the Afghan SIV Last week, we learned that the State Department has stopped interviewing applicants for the Afghan program because there are more applicants in the final stages of the process than there are visas. Unless Congress acts, the final visas will be exhausted by the end of It is estimated that more than 10,000 applicants are still in some step of the process of obtaining these visas.  For these Afghans, it really is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death. Interpreters who served the U.mission are being systematically hunted down by the Taliban, and unless Congress acts, this program will lapse and we will abandon these Afghans to a harsh fate.  The United States promised to protect those Afghans who served our mission with great loyalty and at enormous risk, and it would be a stain on our national honor to break this promise. It would also carry profound strategic costs. U.forces and diplomats have always relied on local people to help us accomplish our missions. We continue to require this assistance in Afghanistan, and we will need this support in other places in the future where we face conflict. So we have to ask, if we don't keep our promise, why would anyone agree to help the United States if we abandon those who assist us? This is exactly why the former commander of U.forces in Afghanistan, GEN David Petraeus, and his predecessor, GEN Stanley McChrystal, have pleaded with Congress to extend the Afghan SIV In a letter to Congress last year, more than 30 additional prominent generals, including John Allen, the former commander in Afghanistan, GEN George Casey, the former commander in Iraq, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also urged Congress to extend the program.  In addition, our soldiers and marines are keenly interested in protecting the interpreters who served with them in Many of them owe their lives to the interpreters who went into combat with them. In recent years, I have gotten to know one of those servicemen, a former Army captain, Michael Breen, who is a Granite He served with the infantry in Iraq and led paratroopers in He speaks with admiration about one interpreter in particular who was an Iraqi--part of the Iraqi program--a woman in her early twenties who was named  On one occasion, Captain Breen and his soldiers were at a small forward operating base in He said that a man approached, frantically pointing to his watch and indicating an explosion with his hands. The Americans didn't speak Arabic, so they couldn't tell if the man was trying to warn them or threaten them. Wissam hurried over toward Captain Breen to assist. Wissam was beloved by her American comrades, always cheerful and eager to help. She listened to the man and said that he was actually there warning of an improvised explosive device on the main road.  As Captain Breen later told me, ``A trusted interpreter can be the difference between a successful patrol and a body bag.'' He noted that every night, he and his fellow soldiers would hunker down in their heavily guarded perimeter, but Wissam would leave the compound and go home. One evening after she left the American compound, three gunmen ambushed her car. She was killed--one more interpreter who paid[[Page S1843]]the ultimate price for serving the American mission. As Captain Breen later said, one day there will be a granite monument with the names of all of the American servicemembers who died in Iraq and Wissam deserves to have her name on that monument, too, because she took great risks and she gave her life while serving the United  To be eligible for a visa through the Afghan SIV Program, new applicants must demonstrate at least 2 years of faithful and valuable service to the U.mission. To receive a visa, they must also clear a rigorous screening process that includes an independent verification of their service and then an intensive interagency review.  We know that the service of these individuals has been critical to our successes in  Last month in Keene, NH, I met with a remarkable recent immigrant from Afghanistan named Patmana Rafiq Patmana had worked closely with the U.Agency for International Development in She went door to door, encouraging women to take out microloans to start their own businesses. Patmana eventually became vice president for operations at the USAID-sponsored Microloan  In fact, just today I talked to a woman reporter from Afghanistan who wanted to know what message of hope I could provide to the women of Well, I told her about Patmana, and I told her that one of the things that keep us in Afghanistan supporting our soldiers is concern about what is happening to the women in  For Patmana, going door to door and working closely with Americans--this was dangerous work. She drew unwelcome attention wherever she went, and she became a high-profile target for the Taliban and others. And then one day in 2013, she got a call at her USAID office. It was from the distraught wife of one of her USAID colleagues, another The caller's husband had just been murdered, apparently in retaliation for his work with the  Realizing that her life was in danger, too, Patmana applied for a special immigrant visa. For 2 years, she and her husband were subjected to repeated interviews at the U.Embassy in Her background was checked and rechecked before visas were finally granted. She told me that they would move frequently. They couldn't stay in one place very long because the Taliban would find them. And she said occasionally there was a knock on her relatives' door, saying ``We know where Patmana is,'' and that would be a signal to move.  She and her husband now live happily in Keene, I am pleased to say her husband has found work as an auditor with a local financial company, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. They are welcomed as valued members of the Keene community and of our larger Granite State family.  The many contributions of these Afghans--both in Afghanistan and now as residents or citizens of the United States--those contributions help explain why senior U.commanders and diplomats have urged Congress to extend the Afghan SIV Our Secretary of Defense, GEN James Mattis, during the confirmation process, said: ``Most of our units could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance, often at the risk of their lives, of these courageous men and women.''  We would never leave an American warrior behind on the battlefield. Likewise, we must not leave behind the Afghan interpreters who served side by side with our warriors and diplomats.  We made a solemn promise to these brave people, and I am going to do everything I can to ensure that we keep this promise. I know there is a lot of bipartisan support in this body to do that. So today I am introducing the Keep Our Promise to Our Afghan Allies Act with Senators McCain, Reed, and This legislation would authorize additional special immigrant visas and would help ensure that the program does not lapse and leave behind thousands of Afghans who helped us with the threat by the  In addition, I intend to work closely with Senators who are negotiating legislation to fund the Federal Government in order to ensure that additional visas are included.

1520,topic-id,793,"Mr.Speaker, this is an important day, and I have great friends on the other side of the aisle. We debated aggressively, and, in fact, I see one of my colleagues from We spent 27\1/2\ hours dealing with our committee of jurisdiction's markup of the bill.  It has been a long time since ObamaCare was passed, 7 years, and those of us on our side said: Well, we didn't keep the insurance plan they said we were able to keep, we didn't get to keep the doctor that they promised we could have, we didn't save the $2,500 a month that was promised would be the savings if we passed  So I would argue, we have been very patient--7 years--and I think the public has been very patient. The public has judged ObamaCare through a couple of election cycles and has claimed failure. So we are on, as we call it, a rescue mission, because right now premiums have increased 25 percent, on average, across the country; one-third of U.counties have only one insurer; 4.7 million Americans were kicked off their health plan; and $1 trillion in new taxes.  Out of the 23 ObamaCare CO-OPs--I love co-ops. I am from rural We believe in co-ops. They are not-for-profits. Out of the 23 ObamaCare CO-OPs, 18 failed. It shows you it is not working: $53 billion in new regulation costs; 176 million hours of paperwork.  So what do we do? Republicans believe in transparency. We believe in markets. We believe in competition. We believe in what we are calling cooperative federalism: returning power to the  We are seeing that in part of the Medicaid proposals, allowing the engines of our country, the States--some have been very, very successful in reforming the Medicaid programs, providing first-dollar coverage, and some[[Page H2356]]have not. Hopefully, they will learn from the other  We also want to empower the individuals in the individual markets. One-size-fits-all, mandatory--you have to have one of only four plans--has destroyed the individual market.  So 7 years is too long to wait. I appreciate us moving aggressively. Time is of the essence. We are on a rescue mission, and this is just another path in the process of repealing and replacing  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I have a lot of respect for my colleague from Illinois, but let me just say to him that the Republican plan is not a rescue mission. It is a full-fledged attack on the middle class--a rescue plan for the rich, maybe, slamming the middle class with a tax hike.  Ripping away coverage and undermining Medicare is not a rescue mission, I assure you. I have seen the townhalls around the country. They want nothing to do with your rescue plan.  Rescuing something you sabotaged, offering Americans a plan that costs more and covers less, going after essential services--please, that is not what the American people want.  To my colleague from Texas, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, he is assuring us that Republicans are huddled somewhere. Well, I have got news for him. I have been reading press reports that Republicans have canceled their 9 a.m. Conference meeting. As I understand it, one Republican Member told the reporter that that move ``tells me it's panic time.''                              {time}  0945  Another Republican source is quoted as saying: This is such a disaster. Representative Massie said: Frankly, it is not very well thought out.  So I don't think people are huddling. I think people are dispersed, and so it makes me even more wary about what we are going to see later today.  By the way, all we are asking is that we actually see the bill. We had a Rules Committee hearing yesterday on a bill that, quite frankly, will not be the bill we are going to consider later today or tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday or  We are talking about health care that affects millions and millions of people, and nobody in this Chamber has seen what we are going to vote on. This is ludicrous. How can this be? What are you thinking? Do this right. There is no rush. You don't get extra points for being fast.  When we read about some of the compromises that are being talked about--going after essential services that basically help the most vulnerable in this country, services like mental health treatment, treatments for opiate addiction, maternity care--essential benefits are being compromised or being taken away. So what will end up happening is you will get up and say: Yeah, we will sell you insurance. It will be cheap, but you get no coverage. Nothing is covered.  That is not what the American people want.

And it is fundamental that, when they return, they have a world-class hospital system.  Now, today we begin consideration of H.1367, which is exciting because it is a bipartisan bill to improve the VA's authority to hire, train, and retain physicians and other critical staff in the Veterans Health  Over the last 5 years, we have seen more than 2 million veterans enroll in the VA healthcare system, and we believe--both parties believe that nothing should stand in the way of any veteran having confidence in and access to care and benefits they earned and deserve.

I was also honored to be able to have an office right across the street from the VA hospital that we just opened up last week, to be in proximity and to help our veterans.  But I can tell you, having met with some of our veterans already, we are looking at 3- to 6-month waits, even in a new facility.  A gentleman, who I will refer to as Mr.Smith so that I don't divulge his personal information, came to me yesterday, and he had issues with a podiatrist.

It is beautiful. Flanked by the towering Tongass National Forest, it is a place full of life and spirit, mountains, forests, lots of rain, lots of salmon, and lots of jaw-dropping scenery.  Yet, like most places across our country, it has its challenges, and it has a challenge with homelessness, like many communities in America and Luckily, for all of us, Ketchikan is also home to a very caring community that has set its sights on helping its fellow One of these people is Pastor Evelyn Erbele, our Alaskan of the Week, who has dedicated her life to helping others.

First City Homeless Services--Day Shelter gives people a place to go during the day. Pastor Evelyn oversees that day shelter. According to the manager of the shelter, Chris Alvarado, who himself has been homeless, she does so with commitment and with kindness and with compassion.  ``She has a heart of gold and gives 100 percent,'' said one resident of Ketchikan about  Evelyn met her husband Terry in Seward, AK, where she was a nurse in 1976.

She didn't know when she accepted the job at the Methodist Church in Ketchikan as copastor that she would be overseeing the day shelter. At first, according to her, the work was a bit unsettling. ``I never intentionally walked side by side with people who are homeless,'' she said. She continued: ``Initially, I may have been biased. I was using the word `them' when I would describe the people I was working with. One day, the Lord said to me, Evelyn, you are them. You are my child no less or no more than they are.'' She said that after hearing that voice, she realized she wasn't working with ``them'' anymore. ``I was working with men and women who were in a place that I easily could have been.''  In her years working to help the homeless in her community in Ketchikan, she realized that not everybody who is homeless fits neatly into ``one basket.''

1059,topic-id,3378,"Mr.President, I rise to encourage my colleagues to rescind a recently promulgated regulation by the Obama administration and to support the corresponding resolution of disapproval that the majority leader just brought up and that we unanimously moved forward to debate, H.69.  There are few, if any, people in the world who love their lands and wildlife more than In Alaska, our land is the lifeblood that sustains us, that feeds our bodies, our families, and our souls. It is a deep and enduring part of our culture.  Our hunting traditions are very much alive in Alaskans hunt for food for cultural reasons and even for survival. There are people in my State whose families have called our beautiful and rugged lands home for thousands of years, living side-by-side with more recent arrivals. Alaska has also the well-earned reputation of having one of the best managed, most sustainable fish and game populations anywhere in America or anywhere in the world, for that matter. We have an abundance of wildlife that most States and most countries can only dream of. We do this year after year, generation after generation, through rigorous scientific processes that allow and encourage public participation through our Board of Game, Board of Fisheries, and our Fish and Game Department to make sure we manage our fish and game for sustainability, as required by the Alaska constitution, and that we take into account the needs of our citizens--the needs of It is not an easy process. It can be contentious, but all Alaskans take this very seriously.  In Alaska, we respect the land and everything in it. That special connection and our ability to manage our own lands and resources was explicitly recognized in Federal law when Alaska became a The Alaska Statehood Act passed in this body in 1958, specifically granting Alaska the authority to manage fish and wildlife on not only State lands but on Federal lands, unless Congress passes a law to the contrary. By the way, that is the same authority granted to all It is granted to Ohio, New Mexico--all States in America have this authority.  Further, in 1980, this body, the Congress of the United States, passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, designating 100 million acres of land, in my great State, as Federal conservation units, including over 70 million acres--I believe larger than the State of New Mexico--as wildlife refuges in one  Many Alaskans didn't like this bill. Several saw this as a massive Federal usurpation of our land, but our congressional delegation fought to include explicit provisions in this Federal law that made it abundantly clear that the State of Alaska still had primacy in managing fish and game throughout the entire State--State lands and Federal lands.  When that act was passed, it explicitly stated: ``Nothing in this act is intended to enlarge or diminish the responsibility and authority of the State of Alaska for the management of fish and wildlife on public lands. . . .''  That is pretty clear language, and it is very important language to ANILCA is the statute we are talking about, and that is what we call it in That Federal law that passed in 1980 made numerous other commitments to Alaskans about how the Federal Government would not usurp the power of the State or our citizens to live the life we have in How quickly the Feds forget. How quickly the Feds forget what this law requires.  On August 5, 2016, the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule that, 1, restricted certain State-approved fish and game management practices; 2, limited public input in the wildlife management process; and, 3, expanded closure procedures on refuges in Alaska, making it easier to keep people shut out of these Federal lands in our  This rule is not based on sound science. Thousands of Alaskans and other Americans opposed it, tried to work with the Feds to get them to moderate it or rescind it, to no avail. It is not based on established wildlife management principles, and it is certainly not based on Federal law. The Fish and Wildlife Service didn't take this action because Alaska's sustainable and abundant populations of fish and game or their habitats were being threatened; it took this action because it wanted to control Alaska's fish and wildlife and because it subjectively disapproved of the way Alaska's game was being managed by our Department of Fish and Game and by the Alaska Board of Game, but the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service does not have this authority.  To make this clear, we are proceeding today with this resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, H.69, to rescind that August 5 Obama Fish and Wildlife Service rule.  The House has already passed this measure under Congressman Don Young's leadership. So I want to encourage all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to vote in favor of this resolution. It is backed by the force of law, the principles of federalism, and respect for the Alaskan Native people who have been hunting and fishing, subsisting off the land in Alaska for generations. It is also supported by millions of Americans across the country and wildlife professionals in every State in the Union who are committed to the conservation of the abundant species of wildlife in my home State and in theirs.  Why should my colleagues support rescinding this Fish and Wildlife Service regulation? Well, first and foremost, as I have already mentioned, it clearly usurps power from the States[[Page S1865]]and it ignores Federal law. Unfortunately, faced with a Federal law it disagreed with, the Fish and Wildlife Service took the route other Federal agencies have been taking over the years by simply writing a reg to bypass the will of Congress and the American people, by simply moving forward with their preferred policy preference via regulation and ignoring the law. That is an issue every Member of this body, whether you are a Democrat or Republican, should be concerned about and vigilant to reverse.  It is not a partisan issue. It is a federalism issue. It is a States' rights issue. That is why my State of Alaska, led by a Governor who is an Independent and a Lieutenant Governor who is a Democrat, sued to overturn the Obama administration's litigation. This litigation that my State brought against the Federal Government cites Federal laws like ANILCA, which declares that the State of Alaska ``has jurisdiction over the management of fish and wildlife on public lands throughout the State.'' That is the Federal law.  The law is clear, and of course it makes sense from a management perspective. Alaska is a patch of many different ownerships of our land--State, Federal, and Native lands. The moose and bear in our great State don't know these borders. One agency needs to be in charge, and that is the State agency.  While it might be true that this Obama administration regulation, as written, only applies and impacts Alaska, it is a precedent that should trouble every Member of this body and every State in the Union because if it can be done in Alaska, it can be done anywhere. That is why the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, State agencies charged with managing wildlife in all 50 States and territories from California, New Mexico, to New Jersey all support this resolution. They all support overturning the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife reg. All 50 States, the people who know these issues, support what we are doing on the Senate floor right now.  A second and related reason for the broad bipartisan support not only in Alaska but across the country for rescinding this Fish and Wildlife regulation is because it significantly reduces the public participation in managing lands and wildlife in Before this rule came out, the harvest of fish and wildlife on Alaska refuges was governed by Alaska's Board of Game and Board of Fish, and the process was highly sensible. I have been to Board of Game meetings. It is open to the public and responsive to the public, but this new regulation gives the Federal Government a veto over State regulations issued by the boards, with no public process and no public input.  The rule also makes closures of Federal lands subject more to the whims of Federal officials than to the input of the people they serve. It shuts down the public process, which is critical to the successful stable management of fish and game in my  This Federal regulation also undermines subsistence. In Alaska, ``subsistence'' isn't just a word, a catch phrase, or a slogan. It is not what people do for the benefit of tourism. It is critical. The public participation element is critical to the healthy management of fish and game, and it also enables the professionals to learn from the people--particularly the Native people in my State--what we call traditional knowledge in As I mentioned, ``subsistence'' in my State isn't just a catch phrase or a slogan. Subsistence encompasses the customary and traditional use of fish, wildlife, plant resources, preserving cultural traditions, supplying basic necessities such as food, firewood, and clothing. It provides for barter, trade, and income for subsistence in the cash-based rural economy. It is serious business in my Subsistence in Alaska is life, literally, and it has been so for thousands of years. In so many of my State's villages, there is no grocery store, there is no Costco, there is no Whole Foods market. If one doesn't get a moose in the fall or have enough salmon in the summer that someone catches, they might have trouble surviving in the winter. This is serious business.  In other places in Alaska, where we do have small grocery stores, the costs are often more than twice to four times the national average for basic necessities. President Obama, when he visited Alaska in 2015, went out to the rural communities, and once he saw it, he understood this. When he came to Alaska, he said, ``You're looking at prices that are double, in some cases, or even higher for basic necessities like milk, like orange juice, like other produce. . . . That's part of the reason why the subsistence economy [in Alaska] is so important.''  This is the former President of the United States making this comment.  One wonders why this Fish and Wildlife Service then issued a reg that attacked subsistence. But to be honest, most Americans and certainly most Senators do not fully understand this. Again, due to the tenacity of Alaska's congressional delegation--former Senators, such as Ted Stevens, and current Members, such as Don Young in the House--Federal law recognizes the importance of subsistence in  The protection of subsistence rights in ANILCA and other Federal legislation is listed throughout our Federal laws. Specifically, ANILCA states:       The opportunity for rural residents engaged in a      subsistence way of life must continue to be so.  It further goes on to state that the Federal Government's actions in Alaska should have ``the least adverse impact possible on rural residents who depend on subsistence uses of the resources of such lands.''  This issue of subsistence is important to thousands of my constituents. It is not a theoretical issue, it is critical, but it is now more important to the Alaska Native populations in my State, which is close to 20 percent of my  In 2014, the Alaska Federation of Natives ratified a resolution that criticized a proposal from the Federal Government that was similar to the one we are debating today, and they stated the following in their resolution:       Alaska Natives have served as the stewards of their      traditional lands and resources, maintaining healthy and      productive ecosystems for thousands of years, and maintain      the belief that human beings are an integral part of      naturally functioning ecosystems, not separate from them.  That is what all Alaskans believe. Yet, despite Federal laws that emphasize the importance of subsistence to all Alaskans and pleas and letters from hundreds of Alaska Natives who ask the Federal Government not to negatively impact their subsistence way of life and opportunities with this new Fish and Wildlife Service regulation, the Fish and Wildlife Service persisted. They promulgated this regulation in the face of opposing voices in Alaska and Federal law that says they do not have the authority to do this.  You know it is targeted for subsistence because in the Fish and Wildlife Service's initial rule, that rule stated that the law and the policy had to ``take into consideration the fact that humans are dependent on wildlife refuge subsistence resources.'' That was the original draft rule. Subsistence matters. That was in there, a nod to Federal law. Guess what happened with the final rule? That entire section on subsistence was removed by the Federal Government, which showed that this law is an anti-subsistence law, which violates Federal law. They did not want Alaskans to subsist off their lands as required by Federal law.  Alaska's attorney general, Jahna Lindemuth, who was appointed by an Independent Governor from my State, said:       These federal regulations are not about . . . protecting      the State's wildlife numbers. These regulations are about the      federal government trying to control Alaskans' way of life.  Hunting is a way of life in The Presiding Officer is a hunter and understands that it is cultural and that it provides subsistence and even protection for our citizens.  Let's be clear. The Fish and Wildlife regulation at issue today, which we are debating, is an anti-hunting rule, pure and simple. That this is the case became very clear when the former Fish and Wildlife Service Director, Dan Ashe, who promulgated this regulation, questioned the ethics of our hunters in Alaska in a Huffington Post column. He said that some of Alaska's practices are ``wholly at odds with America's long tradition of ethical, sportsmanlike, fair-chase hunting.'' That is from the former Fish and Wildlife Service One knows where he is coming from on this.  Along these lines, I anticipate some of my colleagues on the other side of[[Page S1866]]the aisle--I see one of them down here already--are going to come down and start touting this parade of horribles, spurred on by anti-hunting groups to convince our colleagues to vote against this resolution of disapproval--what we want to have passed. You might hear phrases from them like Alaska's practices constitute a ``war on wolves'' or a ``black eye for ethical hunters,'' with the implication that my constituents are not ethical hunters. One might even see my colleagues repeat the false and misleading claims that have been run on TV by certain groups about alleged unethical hunting and game management practices in I would like to make a suggestion or two to my colleagues who are coming down here to speak against this resolution of disapproval.  First, please let them try to do so with a sense of humility and a sense of history. Yes, one or two of them may have been accomplished hunters in their own right or are still accomplished hunters in their own right. I respect that. I love to hunt. But that does not mean one has as much or any knowledge or understanding of my State's long history and distinguished record of fish and game management. One might prefer his meat wrapped in cellophane at the grocery store. That is fine, but I ask that one doesn't criticize the thousands of Alaskans who have to hunt for their food and who value hunting as a deep part of their culture.  I would also caution one from making claims that Alaska's wildlife officials allow for unethical hunting and management practices that require the Federal Government to intervene in my State's long history of distinguished fish and game management. Such an argument would be at odds with the consistent and numerous awards the State of Alaska has received for its outstanding management of fish and game year after year after year--American Fishery Society awards, awards from the Department of the Interior, the Wildlife Society, and the Association of Fish and Wildlife Those who manage wildlife in Alaska are the best in their field. It is not just Alaskans who take issue or who will take issue with such statements that I am sure we are going to hear on the floor.  Let me read a list of hunting and conservation groups that support this resolution of disapproval, groups that, in other words, support the overturning of the Fish and Wildlife rule at issue today. It is a very long list, and it is actually longer than this: Ducks Unlimited, National Wild Turkey Federation, Pheasants Forever, Quail Forever, Boone and Crockett Club, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, Delta Waterfowl Foundation, Alaska Outdoor Council, Alaska Professional Hunters Association, American Outfitter and Guide Association, Territorial Sportsmen, National Rifle Association, Safari Club The list goes on and on.  These groups represent millions of hunters, conservationists, wildlife enthusiasts, and wildlife scientists who represent millions of Americans who are focused on the model of conservation that we all are supportive of, and they are the backbone of habitat and species conservation in our country. These groups--every one of them--are supportive of what we are trying to do on the Senate floor today. These groups certainly do not consider themselves unethical hunters. To the contrary, they care deeply about conservation and abundant wildlife populations not only for themselves but for the generations of Americans to come, and they have dedicated their lives to this. They represent Americans from across the 50 States--Montana, West Virginia, New Mexico, New Their values, like the values held by Alaskans with regard to conservation and hunting, should not be doubted and I certainly hope are not going to be attacked on the Senate floor.  In closing, I believe in respectful and informed debate. Sometimes it certainly requires reaching beyond one's own experience to listen to others with opposing views. I took the opportunity to do that just the other day. I had a conversation with the president and CEO of the Humane Society about the issue and resolutions we are discussing today. I know that he and others are leading the opposition to this, but we had a very respectful conversation. We heard each other's views, and although we likely will not agree on this issue, I hope he felt that I talked to him with respect and listened to him because that is what I did.  Perhaps my colleagues who are going to speak against this resolution today should do the same. I would hope that those who come down to the floor to oppose overturning this rule would have picked up the phone and maybe called Alaska's Department of Fish and Game, or talked to a biologist there, or maybe talked to the chairman of the Board of Game and asked if he is an ethical hunter, or maybe called a store in remote Alaska to ask about food prices, or made some inquiries about the lack of stores in dozens of villages that rely on subsistence, or called an Alaska Native leader to see how important subsistence is to his life and his culture.  Maybe my colleagues would have called one of my constituents who wrote in opposing this rule. He is an Alaska Native who lives in rural Alaska and whose grandfather taught him to hunt and fish. Here is what he wrote to us:       Please do not pass these types of regulations that will      change my future. These lands are dear to Alaska Natives, and      I feel that some of the Fish and Wildlife workers are biased      as well as listening to the wrong people. By the ``wrong      people,'' I mean Fish and Wildlife officials who do not      understand my subsistence rights, who do not work in the      villages, who want to take away my right to hunt.  This is about the rule of law, primacy, federalism, and it is about much more than that; it is about real people--people like my constituents.  I urge my colleagues to support our resolution of disapproval and rescind this regulation that violates the law, undermines subsistence in Alaska, and will do harm to my State and other  I yield the floor.

1095,topic-id,474,"Mr.President, in spite of what my good friend from New Mexico has been saying about this resolution, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution.  I came down here predicting that he was going to come down with a parade of horribles, none of which have happened in Alaska--that is a fact--none of which happened in  The resolution we have before us is backed by the force of law. The Fish and Wildlife Service did not have the authority to do what they did by passing this regulation, and not one of my colleagues tried to defend this on the basis of legal authority by the Feds because it doesn't exist. So I think that is the starting point.  The principle of federalism. We have had a lot of discussion here by colleagues from New Jersey and New Mexico telling Alaskans, who have a tremendous record on the management of fish and game--they are going to tell Alaskans how to do that, Senators from States that don't know anything about my That is the whole principle of federalism, and that is another reason we need to support this resolution.  This rule is about subsistence. Thousands of Alaskans, particularly Alaskan Natives, rely on subsistence. Again, my colleagues on the other side come down here and say that it is not about subsistence. Come up to Ask the people who have to live off the land, who need the food to survive in the winter. Tell them it is not about subsistence.  Finally, it is important to recognize just how many other Americans care about what we are doing right now. As I mentioned, literally millions of Americans from every State of the country, represented by groups as diverse as Ducks Unlimited, Boone and[[Page S1884]]Crockett, and the National Rifle Association, are all supportive of this resolution, as are every Fish and Wildlife Service State agency, including from New Mexico, including from New They are all supportive of our resolution.  To have our colleagues come down here and say ``Those Alaskans don't know what they are doing'' when we have the record of well-managed fish and game, awards every year from the Department of the Interior and others--to have them come down here with very little knowledge of my State is not the humility that I think is needed in this body.

1657,topic-id,587,"Mr.President, as my colleagues know, I have been coming to the floor week after week to recognize an Alaskan who has made a difference in his or her community. As I have said repeatedly--I am a little biased, of course--I have the honor of living in the most beautiful State in the country, but it is our people who truly make it special. They are resilient, kind, and giving. And it is the next generation that is going to continue to make my State the best place in the world to live.  This week I would like to introduce my colleagues to 18-year-old Ivory Gerhardt Cyrus, this week's Alaskan of the Ivory lives in Kiana, a beautiful, close-knit Inupiat village of less than 400 people on the banks of the Kobuk River in Northwest Like many villages in Alaska, there are no roads in and out. People travel to Kotzebue, which is the closest hub city--it is not very much of a city but a big village--about 40 miles away by plane or snow machine, boat, or sometimes dog team. That is where Ivory was raised--in Kiana--and where, against many odds, she has strived.  Ivory was born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, which made getting through school a challenge. She was at times misunderstood, at times bullied, and many didn't know how to deal with her properly.  About 120 kids each year are diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in When she was in middle school, Ivory began committing herself to helping them by speaking out about her own experiences and by advocating the way students with behavioral issues are treated in school. She was an advocate for them.  Now she is an honor roll high school senior, graduating this spring, and along the way, she has become a State of Alaska trainer for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. She gave a presentation at an international conference recently on disability and diversity, and she was named one of five recipients of the 27th annual Women of Achievement and Youth Awards in  This is what I find most impressive about Ivory: She is passing a message of hope and service on to her peers. She started a group, encouraging the members of the group to do one positive thing each day. The name of the group is appropriately entitled ``One Positive Thing,'' or ``OPT.'' That message has spread throughout her community, and now villages in Kiana are remembering to do one positive thing each day for themselves, their families, and their community. Last year, she held her first OPT conference in Kiana for youth all across the region. This year, that conference--the next OPT conference, One Positive Thing--will be held on April 7 and 8.  Ivory is an exceptional young woman. She is going to go on to do exceptional things. Next fall, she plans on attending the University of Alaska Anchorage where she plans to continue to do one positive thing each day and will bring that positive attitude to the students at She is going to continue to encourage others to do that as well.  I congratulate her for all of her accomplishments, for being our Alaskan of the Week, and congratulations to her parents, Jean and Tom, for the wonderful job they have done in raising this exceptional young lady.

I do acknowledge the concern of the gentleman from Florida that people with PTSD on this list may have been inappropriately flagged to be on this list, and we could have discussed a streamlined process. We could conduct a study of the VA's existing practices for submitting records of veterans to the background check system.  But rather than subject that whole list to being dismantled and freeing people that should not be free to have weapons--crazy people from having weapons--at the very least, we should understand the impact this change would have on veteran suicide, as ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2094-3.txt,2110,NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF,2017.0,16.0,March
377,topic-id,277,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.1181.  The epidemic--actually, rather the tragedy--of veterans' suicide has affected families across the country, including my own. I recall walking home after school at the age of 10 or 11 in the month of November--as you know, Veterans Day is in the month of November--and hearing the news that my uncle, who lived across the street from us, had taken his own life with a firearm. He was a Vietnam veteran, and his memory serves as a personal reminder about the tragedy of veterans' suicide. To this day, it continues to plague our communities with our recent conflicts in Iraq and  Of the 20 veterans who die from suicide every day, two-thirds of those occur by firearm. Part of stopping this crisis is keeping guns out of the hands of our most vulnerable veterans. Removing all individuals determined by the VA to be mentally incompetent from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System will make it easier for a veteran in crisis to obtain a firearm.  To be clear, there are veterans currently flagged in the background check system who should not be there, and we need to create a fair and streamlined process for veterans to appeal their status.  But there is a balance between protecting veterans' Second Amendment rights and protecting veterans who are a danger to themselves or others. Immediately removing restrictions on every individual does not strike the right balance. Instead, it rolls back the bipartisan work we have done through the 21st Century Cures Act, and it endangers the lives of veterans who need our help the most.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.  ",CREC-2017-03-16-pt1-PgH2102-2.txt,2110,NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF,2017.0,16.0,March
400,topic-id,1843,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman, Sergeant Major Walz from the State of Minnesota, for yielding me time.  I also would like to say to the chairman, we had a wonderful time traveling to Afghanistan to pay respect to our troops during I don't have to travel across the country with him, but I did travel halfway around the world with him.  Mr.Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.1259.  Every Member of Congress supports accountability for employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs--everybody. Building a culture of excellence at the VA is critical to providing veterans the care and support they deserve.  However, H.1259 does not further this goal, or improve outcomes at the We are not going to be able to fire our way to better outcomes at the  The question posed by the VA Accountability First Act is whether accountability or workers' rights are mutually exclusive. I, along with many of my colleagues, believe we can respect VA employees--a third of whom are veterans themselves--while also ensuring that poor-performing employees are held accountable.  This legislation violates workers' rights in two very specific ways:  First, it would erode due process protections by giving employees too little time--just 10 days--to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, and then just 7 days to file an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection  Second, it goes much further than past accountability bills by eliminating the use of collectively bargained grievance procedures for frontline VA employees. Not only do collectively bargained procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, but they also give added protection to potential whistleblowers by acting as a check against managers who may retaliate against an employee who raises an issue.  Mr.Chairman, there is no question that we have workforce challenges at the VA, but this bill does not solve them. Instead, it eschews the Senate's bipartisan accountability legislation in favor of a much more one-sided bill.  To my colleagues who voted on VA accountability legislation in the past: This is not the same bill. It goes much further. And I ask you to join me in opposing it.  This is the first time the majority has targeted collective bargaining at the VA in this way. Your vote against this bill today will show that you oppose this very tactic.  If we are serious about providing veterans the best care possible, we should focus on removing the Federal hiring freeze, advancing the appeals modernization bill, and other bipartisan efforts that will immediately improve veterans' access to high-quality care and support.  Mr.Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in opposition to this bill, a letter from the American Federation of Government Employees, as well as a letter from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial                                                       AFSCME,                                                   March 15, 2017.     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members      of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal      Employees (AFSCME), I'm writing to urge you to oppose H.     1259, which would eliminate collective bargaining rights and      fundamental due process rights of employees at the Department      of Veterans Affairs (VA).       The bill makes it easier to fire people for a good reason      or a bad reason. By eliminating merit-based principles for      workers facing a removal, demotion or suspension, the bill      makes it easier for management or political appointees to      scapegoat employees that advocate strongly for the veteran      patients they serve. Basic civil service due process rights      are necessary to block corruption, patronage, discrimination,      and political pressure to cover up problems in the delivery      of services to veterans.       The bill destroys the right of registered nurses and other      front-line VA employees to use a union grievance procedure to      efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse employment      actions. This is union busting.       This bill will not help improve the care to veterans from      the VA but rather make such care politicized and subject to      corrupting and corrosive influences unrelated to quality.      Moreover, this bill sets a dangerous precedent that could      subsequently harm more than one million additional federal      workers in other agencies and occupations, and the public      they serve. We urge you to vote against H.1259.           Sincerely,                                                       Scott Frey,     Director of Federal Government                                  ____                                                         AFGE,                                                    March 7, 2017.     Re AFGE Opposition to H.1259.     Phil Roe,     Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington,     Tim Walz,     Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: I am writing on      behalf of nearly 700,000 federal employees represented by the      American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE),      including 230,000 employees of the Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) to urge you to oppose H.1259, a bill      introduced by Representative Phil Roe (R-TN) to eliminate      collective bargaining rights and significantly cut the due      process rights of employees facing a proposed removal,      demotion, or suspension (adverse action).       H.1259 is a direct assault on the union rights of every      VA employee, including more than 120,000 veterans within the      VA workforce. This bill will hurt, not fix, the It will      reverse the significant improvements made over the past two      years, and will make it harder for veterans to get the      veteran-centric medical care and benefits on which they rely.       In addition to punitive, counterproductive due process      attacks recycled from earlier bills, H.1259 breaks new      ground by union-busting. The bill destroys the right of every      VA front line employee to use union grievance procedures to      efficiently and fairly address proposed adverse actions. The      grievance procedure is not only part of the law but also part      of the contract negotiated between labor and management. The      only avenue that VA front line employees will have left is a      rushed management-run appeals process that does not allow      good employees enough time to gather the evidence they[[Page H2119]]     need to defend their jobs. For medical professionals facing      proposed adverse actions related to professional conduct or      competence, the reductions in the timeframe for the agency      review process are more severe, even though their cases      typically involve complex medical issues.       In addition, all front-line employees and managers will      have weaker rights to appeal to the Merit System Protection      Board (MSPB), their first chance at an independent review.      They will only have seven days to appeal to the MSPB after      they are fired (and off the payroll), and the bill ties the      hands of the MSPB Administrative Judge (AJ) with the recycled      ``one-size-fits-all'' prohibition against mitigating the      penalty, regardless of the facts of the individual case.       When the employee loses at the MSPB (which happens in 80%      of cases now), he would have only seven days to prepare an      appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal            How does this impact the life of a veteran working in a VA?      What if a veteran working in a regional office processing      claims is trying to do his job in the face of unfair      allegations of poor performance by a manager who did not want      to hire a veteran and did not train him properly before      rushing him onto the job? It means that he only has ten days      to gather all the evidence he needs to respond to a proposed      removal and his manager only has five days to decide whether      to go ahead and fire him. Therefore, 15 days after learning      that he may be fired, he has no job and no paycheck. Then he      has one week to get his appeal to the MSPB, during which he      must hire an attorney if he can afford one, where the AJ      cannot give him a suspension or demotion even if the judge      believes that the facts dictate a less severe punishment than      removal. When the MSPB upholds the decision to fire him, he      has just one week to prepare his appeal to a federal appeals      court (and again, hire an attorney if he can afford one),      while he is without a job and without a paycheck.       Just last month, Chairman Roe stated that ``the men and      women who have fought for our great nation should never have      to struggle to find a job,'' but his bill attacks every      option that veterans in the VA workforce have to save their      jobs in the face of unjustified firings.       Chairman Roe has also expressed his intentions to reduce      mismanagement at the VA, but his bill weakens the critical      protections that VA employees need to speak up against      mismanagement and patient harm. Every day, employees      throughout the VA report concerns to management that directly      impact patient safety, health care access, processing of      disability claims, and many other functions essential to the      agency mission.       Chairman Roe opposes the hiring freeze because he      understands how critical it is for veterans who depend on the      VA to have a ``robust clinical workforce.'' Yet his bill      singles out VA employees, including every clinician caring      for veterans, for worse treatment than other federal      employees through recoupment of compensation already earned,      including pensions, relocation bonuses, and performance      bonuses. These provisions are unnecessary and violate due      process. There are already ample safeguards in the law      against retention of improper relocation and performance      bonuses, and the VA has already dismantled the relocation      bonus program that was the subject of abuse allegations. In      addition, this bill directly contradicts private sector law      that forbids the recoupment of pensions.       Thank you for considering the views of If you need      more information, please contact Marilyn Park of my staff.           Sincerely,                                                David Cox, Sr.,     National                                  ____                                                      AFL-CIO,                                                    March 8, 2017.     Phil Roe,     Chair, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington,     Tim Walz,     Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,          Washington,       Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: On behalf of the      AFL-CIO, I urge you to reject the VA Accountability First Act      (H.1259), introduced by Chairman David H.1259 is a      thinly veiled effort to destroy union rights and shift the      blame for management failures at the VA onto the backs of      front line employees.       The bill severely truncates the appeals process in current      law and destroys grievance procedures that have been      successfully used throughout the federal government to      provide stability and protection against arbitrary treatment,      and with it any guarantee that employees will feel safe      speaking out against mismanagement or to protect patient      safety.       Rather than building a culture of trust at the VA, H.     1259 would turn back the clock to an era when employees could      be fired with the slightest justification and almost no      opportunity to mount an effective defense. Worse, the bill      would single out VA employees for harsher treatment than      other federal workers, including the recoupment of      compensation already earned without adequate due process,      including pension benefits, and relocation and performance      bonuses.       The Roe bill reflects the Chairman's opposition to      collective bargaining and the crucial role labor      organizations play in giving federal workers a voice on the      job. For the 120,000 veterans who work at the VA, this bill      is not only a slap in the face but a betrayal of the promise      that they would be guaranteed fair treatment if they came to      work for the federal government.       We urge you to reject H.1259.

434,topic-id,422,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, my amendment in the nature of a substitute would strike the text of H.1259 and insert a new provision allowing the Secretary to suspend, without pay, any VA employee whose performance or misconduct threatens public health or safety, including the health and safety of veterans. It would give the Secretary the authority to remove a suspended employee after an investigation and review if the Secretary determines removal is in the interests of public health and safety.  Both parties share the desire to protect veterans from mistreatment or harm, especially when they are seeking medical care at a VA facility, but the language in my amendment would be more likely to achieve the majority's stated outcome of removing VA employees whose misconduct harms veterans.  We have voted on similar accountability bills before, but I want to point out that this bill goes much further in the wrong direction. While in the past we have had disagreements on procedure and the amount of time an employee is given to file an appeal, for the very first time, this version of the accountability bill is attempting to undermine VA employees' collective bargaining rights.  Buried in this bill is a new provision that would take away the rights of frontline VA employees to use collectively bargained agreements for settling grievances. This has not been a part of past negotiations, and the vote that Members take on the underlying bill should not be based solely on their votes on previous accountability bills.  Collectively bargained grievance settlement procedures often lead to quicker and simpler solutions, and they give added protection to potential whistleblowers. When these basic protections are undermined, we give too much power to managers whose goal may be to retaliate against someone who called out a mistake.  The bill, as it is currently being offered, does not provide enough time for an employee to get their case together to file an appeal. It undermines collective bargaining agreements negotiated in good faith between management and employees. It doesn't do enough to protect whistleblowers.  My amendment addresses our shared goal to create accountability at the It would ensure that the Secretary has the authority to immediately suspend any VA employee whose behavior threatens the health and safety of veterans, and that the suspended employee does not accrue pay while the investigation is being carried out.

I am honored to serve in the district that has the largest population of Active Duty and veterans in the country.  Our own VA center, where I personally receive care, was previously rated as a one-star facility, the lowest rating available; this, by the VA's own rating system. Now, I am pleased to say the center has made strides and progress in many areas. However, the director in charge during the time of poor performance was simply moved to another facility to be a director there. We have to do better. We will do better. The VA Accountability First Act of 2017 is a wonderful and great start.  This amendment will contribute to more transparency, accountability, and oversight. We must continually and consistently hold the VA accountable for underperformance. Our veterans are sacred and deserve the same commitment to high standards they upheld as servicemembers.

99,topic-id,897,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.Ferguson), my esteemed colleague.  I rise today to recognize the New Yorkers who have been hit especially hard by the policies of the previous administration and ObamaCare's so-called reforms to our healthcare system. Patients have been hurt, doctors have been burdened, and families and taxpayers are being crushed by this terrible law, and its thousands of pages of onerous regulations.  Our most vulnerable citizens--seniors, the hardworking middle class, and veterans--are in worse shape now in upstate New York than they were before. In New York State and across the 22nd District, patients are being denied high-quality care that they deserve and need.  With higher costs, less accessible and affordable care, and mountains of red tape, this law has proven to be everything but a Patient Protection and Affordable Care Now, some deductibles are higher than a house payment, and premiums across the Nation have increased on average by 25 percent. Our families didn't sign up for this.  Patients have had their plans canceled and their doctors are deemed out of network. They have fewer and worse choices than before. All the while, costs have skyrocketed with premiums and deductibles jumping by double digits and triple digits in some cases.  This failed law has hurt our economy, small-business owners, and family farms while driving hundreds of thousands of jobs out of our communities. Small businesses are being crushed by ObamaCare and have either stopped hiring or dropped insurance coverage for their employees. The CBO estimated that ObamaCare will result in the loss of at least 2 million jobs. In fact, the number one complaint of small-business owners in my district throughout the last 6 years has been ObamaCare, and 70 percent of the new jobs are created by the small businesses in our community.  One small-business owner, in fact, told me that she had to lay off nearly a dozen employees just to keep up with the cost of Just think of looking at 12 families and saying: You have now lost the primary caregiver in your family just to keep up with ObamaCare mandates.  Another family that I met with told me they had their insurance lost after being canceled three times, and now their options are either limited or unaffordable.  Another independent, self-insured man with three children told me that he had an insurance plan, but he had no[[Page H2077]]health care, with a $12,000 annual deductible.  This is unfair and it is unsustainable for small-business owners, particularly those in the independent market.  Hardworking middle class families in New York are being burdened with nearly the highest taxes in the New York is one of only four States that passes the State 50 percent share Medicaid burden onto the local taxpayers. Twenty-five percent of the State's obligation to cover Medicaid costs are forced onto struggling local governments already suffocating under unfunded mandates from the This has caused property and sales taxes to increase year after year, crushing the pocketbooks of even the most vulnerable taxpayers.  In New York State, local taxpayers throughout our 63 counties will be forced to pay over $7.5 billion annually in this local share to support New York's Medicaid program. New York's Medicaid program is the largest in the In fiscal year 2018, the cost will be over $65 billion--over 42 percent of New York's $152 billion proposed State budget. That is nearly the cost of the entire State of Florida's State budget.  Already, taxpayers in upstate and central New York are burdened with some of the highest combined property and sales tax in the country. Every penny that goes for this failing scheme is a penny less for our schools, our roads, care for our seniors, care for people with special needs, and actually the truly needy in our communities.  There is a better way that won't leave anyone behind. It is vitally important that we begin to repeal ObamaCare so we can provide relief for people across the country and the  I am currently reviewing the American Health Care Act, a reform initiative proposed to alleviate the pressures ObamaCare has put on patients, providers, and taxpayers. The proposals in the American Health Care Act will lower premiums by 10 percent, reduce taxes by $883 billion, and reduce the Federal deficit dollars by $337 billion. All are a significant step in the right direction.  However, I will continue to listen to constituents in the 22nd District as the House carefully considers this legislation before we vote on it and any future bills to improve and restore our healthcare system for all.  Current and future taxpayers must not be saddled with further debt and taxes to pay for lower quality and less access to care. Any new initiative must enshrine the freedom to choose a plan tailored to each person and each family. Any new initiative must include a competitive marketplace which provides better and broader options for families across all economic sectors. Any new initiative must protect seniors and the truly needy in our society, because we do have an obligation and a desire to help them.  But the status quo is unacceptable. ObamaCare is inefficient, ineffective, and tramples our precious liberties. We, as their duly elected representatives, should do all in our power to patient-centered, cost-conscious, high-quality system of health care in this country. I will continue to fight for everyone in our communities.  ",CREC-2017-03-15-pt1-PgH2074-2.txt,99999999999999,1300,2017.0,15.0,March

428,topic-id,356,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.1259, which would require the VA to submit a report to Congress at the end of each fiscal year listing the bonuses that were awarded to senior-level executives.  In 2015, VA employees received more than $177 million in bonuses, which was 24 percent more than they received in 2014. The average bonus for a senior executive was $10,000.  I have no doubt that the men and women of the VA serve our veterans admirably each day. In my own district, I have spoken with veterans who are grateful for the compassionate care that they receive from local VA clinics throughout upstate New VA employees should be fairly compensated for their work and awarded for their achievement.  It is also clear to me that there is more work to be done. Just this month, an audit of several VA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia revealed that wait times continue to be misrepresented and that nearly 14,000 veterans were denied access to timely care. The audit also found that veterans were waiting an average of 26 days to see mental health specialists, while the VA falsely reported average wait times of 6 days. In light of this information, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year.  My amendment adds a simple reporting requirement to the bill that will streamline oversight of bonuses at the VA by requiring the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment. Given the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, the American people deserve to know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency. This bill increases transparency over the bonus process without placing any undue burdens on the agency.  I would encourage my colleagues to support it, and I thank the committee for the opportunity to offer this amendment.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

1457,topic-id,1062,"Mr.President, the internet has grown at an unbounded rate in the years since its inception, a phenomenon no one can argue with. Much of that growth can be attributed to the light-touch regulatory approach that the government adopted in the early days of the web.  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the internet, I have worked hard to promote policies that encourage the private sector to invest in and grow the internet ecosystem as a whole. All of that is jeopardized, however, if government bureaucrats have the ability to overregulate the digital world. When it comes to overregulating the internet, one need look no further than the Democratic-controlled Federal Communications Commission under President  In a world that was turning away--it was literally turning away from the legacy telecommunication services and, instead, toward dynamic internet applications, the FCC found its role gradually diminishing. This is an inevitable and good byproduct, I might add, of a more competitive environment brought about by technological innovation and successful light-touch policies.  Yet the Obama FCC fought hard against this technological progress and, instead, pursued an aggressively activist and partisan agenda that put government edicts ahead of real consumer desires. Over the last 2 years, the FCC has made a stunning bureaucratic power grab. First, the FCC stripped away the Federal Trade Commission's authority to police internet providers and seized that for itself by recharacterizing such services as monopoly-era telecommunications.  Then in 2016, the FCC, which has little experience regulating internet privacy, decided to turn our country's privacy laws on their head by abandoning the time-tested enforcement approach of the FTC, the Federal Trade These actions by the FCC ignored both common sense and real world data and, instead, focused on hypothetical harms of the future.  Ignoring years of internet ecosystem precedent, where everyone was treated the same, the FCC's 2016 broadband privacy regulations would apply only to certain parts of the internet. This is a source of significant concern because at any particular time, consumers will not have reasonable certainty of what the rules are and how their privacy decisions will be applied.  Are you at home on Wi-Fi? At home on a smartphone? Using your smartphone on a friend's Wi-Fi? Using the Internet at a library? Each of these could have very different privacy implications for a consumer because of the FCC's piecemeal approach to privacy, leading to more confusion and uncertainty, not increased privacy protections, as promised.  In enacting these lopsided rules, the FCC seems to have gone out of its way to disregard established FTC practice by creating new regulations that differ significantly from the FTC's tried-and-true framework. The FTC's privacy regime is clear, easy to understand, and applies evenly throughout the marketplace. By contrast, the FCC's rules are complex, confusing, and often lead to the same data being treated inconsistently online.  The FCC's action would harm consumers in other ways as well. Even though no consumer wants to be in the dark about newer and cheaper services, the FCC's rules actually make it more difficult for customers to hear about new, innovative offerings from their broadband providers. And because the FCC imposed heavy-handed data requirements on these internet companies, they will have less ability to offer services that are tailored to their customers' needs and interests. Furthermore, the FCC unfairly distorted the marketplace when it imposed unnecessarily onerous privacy restrictions on broadband providers while leaving the rest of the internet under the strong and successful regime at the  When speaking about the economic opportunities the internet now affords us, President Obama's last FCC chairman declared that ``government is where we will work this out.''  ``Government is where we will work this out.''  Well, I couldn't disagree more. I believe the marketplace should be the center of the debate over how our digital networks would function, not the I believe consumers and job creators should be the ones deciding about new technologies, not the government.  The resolution before us today is the first step toward restoring regulatory balance to the internet ecosystem. The best way for that balance to be achieved is for there to be a single, uniform set of privacy rules for the internet--the entire internet--rules that appropriately weigh the need to protect consumers with the need to foster economic growth and continued online innovation.  The FCC is simply the wrong venue for that effort. Its statutory scope is too narrow, and it lacks institutional expertise on privacy. The current chairmen of the FCC and the FTC both recognize this, having jointly called for returning jurisdiction over broadband providers' privacy and data security practices to the FTC ``so that all entities in the online space can be subject to the same rules.''  For those reasons, I support the resolution before us that would provide congressional disapproval of the Obama administration's misguided and unfair attempts to regulate the internet, and I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution as well.  To those people who have heard that this resolution somehow results in the elimination of all online protections for consumers, I can assure you those[[Page S1929]]claims are simply unfounded scaremongering. If this resolution is enacted, it will repeal only a specific rulemaking at the FCC that has yet to be implemented. What we are talking about here hasn't even been implemented yet. It will not touch the FCC's underlying statutory authority. Indeed, the FCC will still be obligated to police the privacy practices of broadband providers, as provided for in the Communications The new chairman of the FCC confirmed this when he appeared before the Commerce Committee earlier this month. No matter what happens with this resolution, the FTC will continue to have its authority to police the rest of the online world.  It is my hope that once the Senate passes this resolution, the House will move quickly to take it up and send it to the President for his signature because, before our country can get back on the right track, we must first move past the damaging regulations adopted in the waning days of the Obama administration.  I thank Senator Flake for his leadership on this issue. Without his tireless efforts, we would not be here today, standing ready to move decisively toward a better future for the internet.  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow at noon.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgS1925-2.txt,1534,0915,2017.0,22.0,March

Mr.Speaker, H.267, introduced by Congressman John Lewis, redesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, National Historical It also authorizes the National Park Service to include the Prince Hall Masonic Temple in the historical park's boundaries.  The Prince Hall Masonic Temple long served as the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership This well-known civil rights organization was cofounded by King, who also served as its first president. Including the Prince Hall Masonic Temple within the unit's boundaries will allow the National Park Service to provide technical assistance to the building's owners with regard to repairs, renovations, and maintenance that will preserve its historic integrity.  Our Nation's historic sites and historical parks provide us with the unique opportunity to share the very spaces in which the generations before us lived and worked. At these sites, Americans are able to metaphorically walk in the footsteps of our Nation's Founders and of those who followed them and perfected their vision for our country. At this time of division in our country, it is important to be able to look back at leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who promoted unity and the dignity of the human person.

175,topic-id,1913,"Mr.President, this week is Sunshine Week, a week when we applaud open government and when we celebrate the institutions that hold government accountable. Throughout our Nation's history, one of the most important has been the press, the free press. Donald Trump, as candidate and President, has repeatedly attacked the press. He has called it the ``enemy of the people,'' he has labeled the national media outlets as ``fake news,'' and he has criticized respected reporters who have reported for years.  He has singled out mainstream newspapers like the New York Times, Politico, and the Los Angeles Times, and television outlets like ABC, NBC, CBS, That is how this President operates. He acts like a bully, and not just with the media. He attacks the courts when article III judges disagree with him, and when they find he is breaking the law. He attacks sitting judges for deciding against him, even those appointed by Republican  Without basis, he attacks our intelligence agencies, and he even demeans career public servants who risk their lives to keep our Nation safe. The President's goal is obvious, to undermine the institutions in our country who threaten him, who criticize him. Authoritarians have used this strategy for centuries and continue to do so today in countries where democracy is weak or nonexistent and where autocracy or kleptocracy is strong.  But this is the United We are an example to the world of democratic principles and action. The President's repeated attacks on our democratic institutions need to stop and they need to stop now. A free and robust press is critical for democracy to work, period, end of story. Our Nation's history of a free press dates back to our founding. Free press in the colonial United States developed in reaction to severe restrictions on free speech in  During the latter half of the 17th century, all books and articles were required to be licensed by the government to be published. Then, ``seditious libel''--bringing ``hatred or contempt'' upon the Crown or the Parliament by written word--was a criminal offense. So to speak against the Crown was a criminal offense. Truth was not a defense.  No publication could criticize the Crown or the government, even if it was accurate. The first newspapers in the Colonies operated under licenses from the colonial But by 1721, James Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's older brother, was publishing one of the first colonial independent newspapers, the New England Courant, in  Ben Franklin was his apprentice, typesetter, and sometimes contributed under pen names. Several years later, Ben Franklin began publishing his own independent newspaper, the Pennsylvania His newspaper became the most popular in the Colonies and was published until 1800.  By 1735, the tenets of seditious libel were coming undone. John Peter Zenger, the publisher of the New York Weekly Journal, ran articles harshly critical of the colonial government. Zenger was arrested and tried for libel. While he admitted he published the articles, his lawyer argued truth was a defense. The press, the lawyer argued, has ``a liberty both of exposing and opposing tyrannical power by speaking and writing the truth.''  The judge, however, instructed the jury as to the law at the time, that Zenger must be found guilty if he published the articles, whether truthful or not, but after 10 minutes of deliberation, the jury acquitted These were some of the beginnings of a free press in our  The first rights in the Bill of Rights are freedom of religion, the press, speech, petition, and assembly. The press, as an institution, is expressly protected by the In 1789, the drafters of the Bill of Rights understood that a free press was essential to the growth and success of our new democracy. They understood that debate, disagreement, the free flow of ideas, make an informed public, that the press helps educate voters.  They understood all too well that government power needed to be checked and that the press holds the powerful in check by investigating and exposing arbitrary conduct, abuse, and corruption. A democracy cannot exist without a free press. It is as simple as that, but our President does not seem to understand this or he does not care. According to him, the press is ``dishonest,'' ``not good people,'' ``sleazy,'' and, ``among the worst human beings.'' Those are all quotes by our  Established press organizations are the ``fake news,'' and a few weeks ago he declared the press ``an enemy of the people.'' We have not heard attacks like this since Watergate, and even then, it wasn't so much so fast. The President's subordinates are now given license to accuse and to limit press access.  Chief Strategist Steve Bannon said the press should ``keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.'' This quote from Mr.Bannon has extra significance today because he is no longer the head of a rightwing media company. In a controversial move, President Trump issued an Executive order to add him to the National Security Council's Principal's  Today, we are going to vote on the nomination of General McMaster to retain his three-star general status while serving as the head of the National Security I do not believe a political extremist like Mr.Bannon should serve on the At a minimum, General McMaster should direct Mr.Bannon to stop attacking the free press while serving on the  Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway called for media organizations to fire reporters who criticized Candidate Press Secretary Shawn Spicer barred the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed, and Politico from a press conference, and the Secretary of State will now travel without the press corps, disregarding a decades-old practice.  Now, don't get me wrong. The press does not always get it right. They make mistakes. News organizations have their biases. Mistakes should be corrected and bias should be tempered by using accepted journalistic methods and professional judgment and following journalism's ethics code.  Mistakes and the exercise of professional judgment are not the same thing as reporting ``fake news.'' The President's Republican colleagues have been too silent in the face of attacks. Few in Congress have stood up against the President's hostility to the press. Government officials are afraid to disagree. Just last week, at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing, I asked the FCC Chair, Mr.Pai, a yes or no question, does he agree with the President that the press is the enemy of the people.  He did not engage. He would not answer. He let stand the President's remarks. The President's characterization of the press as the enemy is reminiscent of President Nixon, when Nixon said: ``Never forget. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy,'' as recorded on his secret tapes.  The press was Nixon's enemy because the press exposed his criminal conduct which led to his resignation. The press is Trump's enemy because the press exposes his and his associates' ties to[[Page S1820]]Russia, the President's myriad Trump organization conflicts of interest, his constant barrage of misrepresentations of fact.  Nixon's Press Secretary called the Washington Post investigative reporting shoddy and shabby journalism. Like President Trump's accusation of fake news, that same Post reporting won the paper a Pulitzer  Watergate was a break-in of the Democratic National Committee during the Presidential campaign. Nixon ordered his Chief of Staff to have the CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for the Watergate burglary. During this last Presidential election, we had a cyber break-in of the Even after 17 U.intelligence agencies concluded Russia hacked the DNC to sway the election, Candidate Trump refused to accept their analysis.  The President's Chief of Staff pressured the FBI to publicly deny that Trump associates had contact with the Russians, while his Chief Counsel reportedly breached the firewall seeking information from the FBI about an investigation into the President and his associates. Since the press began to look hard at the ties between President Trump and the Trump organization, his associates and Russia, the President has not let up on his criticism. Just last week, the President threatened by tweet as follows:       It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard      working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!  The job of the press is not to be nice. It is to gather the facts and report them. Now that the President of the United States has called the reputable U.news organizations fake news, others are doing the same. Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman recently accused a CNN reporter of spreading ``fake news'' because the reporter asked about accusations from U.officials that the Russian Ambassador is a spy.  This is a dangerous path. Putin has throttled an independent press in the Russian Federation, imposing restriction after restriction on the news media. Reporters have been harassed, threatened, and jailed. The numbers of truly independent media organizations in Russia have been reduced to a very few, and they have been replaced by state-owned, state-run news media, like RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a propaganda bullhorn for Putin, according to Secretary John  The President admires Putin as a--and I will quote the President here--``strong leader.'' Putin has used his strength to silence an independent press. We do not want our press silenced.  Justice Brandeis, in a famous defense of free speech in a 1927 First Amendment case, said: ``[T]hose who won our independence by revolution were not cowards. They did not fear political liberty.''  Does President Trump fear political liberty?  The irony of the President's accusations of ``fake news'' is that he himself has spread misinformation and fanned the flames of internet-driven lies, from questioning President Obama's citizenship, to his frivolous claim that millions of people committed voter fraud and that he really won the popular vote--that is the President's claim, that he really won the popular vote--to President Trump's unsubstantiated accusation that President Obama wiretapped Trump  We have entered into an era in U.politics never seen before in my lifetime. We cannot allow this to be sanitized or explained away. The phrase ``alternative facts'' has become a national joke because it sounds like something from George Orwell's ``1984.''  It is not acceptable for a President to falsify, misrepresent, or flatout lie. The President's party in Congress should not allow this. They should not look the other way and continue to profess that the emperor's clothes are grand.  Reacting to Mr.Trump's attacks on the press, President George Bush responded:       I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. We      need an independent media to hold people accountable. Power      can be very addictive and corrosive . . . and it's important      for the media to hold to account people who abuse their      power--whether it be here or elsewhere.  That was President George Bush's recent comment.  President Bush's prescription for democracy in 2017 is the same as the drafters of the First Amendment in 1789: A free and independent and robust media is essential to democracy, and any broad-based attack on the press is an attack directly on our democracy.  There is one thing President Trump must understand: The press won't go away. They won't stop reporting on the actions he takes and on the decisions he makes. He can spend the next 4 years attacking the press, but they will still be there--just as they were after Nixon resigned.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

1085,topic-id,1544,"Mr.President, we are here to consider another joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review This one, H.69, repeals the U.Fish and Wildlife Service's regulation and would allow extreme and inhumane hunting practices on National Wildlife Refuges in  My first concern about this measure is that it is a distraction. It benefits special interests to the detriment of the American people at a time when Congress should be focused on much more pressing issues.  Mr.President, 24 million Americans are at risk of losing their healthcare. Clean air and clean water protections are threatened. The President is proposing to cut Meals on Wheels, Head Start, the arts and humanities, and the National Institutes of Each day we learn more details about the President and his team's connections to Russia and about Russia's involvement in our elections.  The American people want Congress to work together to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure and boost our economy. Instead, Congress is wasting time and energy using the Congressional Review Act to repeal commonsense rules that protect people, places, and iconic species. These rules have been vetted over months and years through a thorough public process, but if we repeal them using the CRA, these measures will be permanently blocked unless Congress passes a new law directing the government to act.  My second concern is just as serious. I support responsible hunting practices. Many New Mexicans hunt for sport and for food, but the vast majority of hunters also recognize that some practices are counterproductive, unsportsmanlike, cruel, and they can even wipe out species and the diversity of wildlife in certain regions. The Fish and Wildlife's rule deals with that issue, and it carries Congress's express direction that the Service protect natural diversity at national wildlife refuges in  We are talking about national wildlife refuges. These are the country's refuges. The Service bars a few extreme practices for hunting bears, wolves, and coyotes that are totally inappropriate on national wildlife refuge land. These extreme practices include targeting and killing black bears and brown bears and their cubs, and wolves and coyotes and their pups during denning season; baiting Grizzly bears with food so they are easier to kill at point-blank range; trapping brown and black bears with steel-jawed traps that shut on the animal's leg, leaving them to suffer indefinitely; and shooting bears from aircraft or killing them same-day from spotting them with aircraft. Many of these practices violate ``fair chase'' ethical standards established and used by sportsmen across the country. Alaska voters actually oppose these practices.  We are not talking about private hunting land. This is Federal refuge land. Fish and Wildlife's rule is based on sound science and appropriate wildlife management standards. The rule doesn't change or restrict the taking of fish or wildlife for subsistence purposes, which some Alaskans count on to feed their families, and it doesn't restrict sport hunting. Fish and Wildlife's rule is not an anti-hunting rule. It is a commonsense guideline that ensures bear and wolf populations, as well as caribou, elk, and moose, are sustained for generations to come.  Let me reiterate that. Like the vast majority of New Mexicans, I support hunting and sportsmen's access to public lands consistent with State and Federal law and sound wildlife management practices. Fish and Wildlife's rule[[Page S1881]]doesn't affect these uses at all in any way. Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out Congress's intent in three longstanding pieces of legislation that are now law: the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, or ANILCA; the 1966 National Wildlife Administration Act; and the 1964 Wilderness Importantly, none of these laws prevents reasonable hunting. Together, those acts establish national wildlife refuges and provide for their management, and they establish the 76 million acres of national refuges in Alaska accounts for over 85 percent of our National Wildlife Refuge System, so this is not a State or parochial issue. The rule governs the vast majority of refuge lands designated for protection by  Again, none of these laws prevents reasonable hunting on national refuges. National wildlife refuges are established for the benefit of ``present and future generations of Americans'' and for the whole nation. Every American has an ownership stake in and a right to enjoy public lands and the astounding scenic, cultural, and natural qualities that make these places so special.  The first listed purpose of ANILCA is to ``conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their natural diversity.'' The words ``natural diversity'' are important to this discussion. My uncle, Congressman Mo Udall, was the floor manager for the House when ANILCA passed in 1980. On the House floor, he said the term natural diversity meant ``protecting and managing all fish and wildlife populations within a particular wildlife refuge system unit in the natural `mix,' not to emphasize management activities favoring one species to the detriment of another.''  He also said that in managing for natural diversity, Congress's intent was to ``direct the U.Fish and Wildlife Service to the best of its ability . . . to manage wildlife refuges to assure that habitat diversity is maintained through natural means, avoiding artificial developments and habitat manipulation programs; to assure that wildlife refuge management fully considers the fact that humans reside permanently within the boundaries of some areas and are dependent . . . on wildlife refuge subsistence resources; and to allow management flexibility in developing new and innovative management programs different from the lower 48 standards, but in the context of maintaining natural diversity of fish and wildlife populations and their dependent habitats for the long-term benefit of all citizens.''  Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out congressional intent by managing the national refuges in Alaska for natural diversity through natural, not artificial means, by continuing to allow for subsistence hunting, and by managing the law for the benefit of all--exactly what Representative Mo Udall said the act was intended to accomplish.  Maintaining natural diversity means promoting the health of all fish, wildlife, and plants in the ecosystem, not favoring certain species and harming others, and not interfering with natural ecosystems. Protecting bears and wolves and other apex predators is essential. It helps maintain predator-prey relationships and the health of Alaska's Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems.  Federal and State laws overlay management of public lands, including national wildlife refuges. State law on fish and wildlife management applies on national refuge land as long as it is consistent with Federal law. The Fish and Wildlife Service in the State of Alaska worked together for years to manage fish and wildlife on Alaskan refuges, and Federal requirements ensured that hunting was balanced with conservation of wildlife and their habitat.  Alaska law did not conflict with Federal law until an Alaskan administrative agency, the Alaska Board of Game, adopted rules allowing for extreme hunting practices on national wildlife refuges within Alaska's borders. The Board of Game said it targeted reduction of wolf, black bear, and brown bear to increase the moose, caribou, and deer populations for harvesting. But the indiscriminate killing of bears and wolves to provide more game hunting is contrary to That law directs the preservation of the ``natural diversity'' or ``natural mix'' of wildlife. The Board of Game regulation allowing extreme hunting practices is not consistent with the law.  As I said earlier, while the Fish and Wildlife's rule does not allow extreme hunting practices, it does not change the rules for subsistence hunting or sports hunting. It even authorizes a process for predator control to benefit prey species and to meet refuge purposes. The process is based on sound science, an evaluation of alternatives, and an assessment of impacts to subsistence uses and needs. Again, Alaskans don't support overturning the Service's rule to allow indiscriminate killing of apex predators. A February 2016 Remington poll found that Alaska voters oppose the extreme hunting practices banned under the Fish and Wildlife's rule by wide margins. Alaska voters don't want to see unsporting and cruel practices used to kill bears, wolves, and coyotes on National Wildlife Refuges in their  Wildlife watching is an important part of Alaska's economy. Each year, thousands of tourists visit Alaska's national wildlife refuges to see iconic wildlife. According to a Fish and Wildlife report, wildlife watching on the National Wildlife Refuge System contributed over $2 billion to Alaska's economy in 2011. That same year, hunting contributed approximately $425 million.  Congress's repeated use of the Congressional Review Act with no public hearing, no record or evidence, no use of science, and no stakeholder involvement is a bad way to legislate. It makes government opaque and inaccessible, and what people want to see is transparency and openness, which we didn't have here. It caters to special interests behind the scenes and outside of public view. It makes the swamp murkier than ever.  Fish and Wildlife's rule carries out what Congress wanted when it established the wildlife refuges--to conserve our wild American land and wildlife for generations to come. The rule prohibits the most extreme of hunting practices--against grizzlies and black bears and their cubs and against wolves and coyotes and their pups--and protects the natural diversity. We should not rush to undermine this important, national, long-term goal for short-term political gain--to benefit select special interests.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

She stopped to give birth, outside in the cold, and then went back to herding. He came from strong stock.  This is the second time I have had the privilege to honor Mr.The first was on November 20, 2012, at the Pueblo Indian Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mr.Wilson was a World War II hero, but had not received the recognition he deserved. Almost 60 years after the war, his family worked to make sure he received the acknowledgment and medals he earned for his bravery and service.  Mr.Halona was part of the D-Day invasion. Serving in the Army, he and his fellow soldiers landed in Normandy, on Utah Beach, in July 1944. They were part of the third wave of American soldiers to land, and there were already many casualties scattered on the beach.  Mr.Halona was a gunner. As he and his battalion started moving inland, they encountered heavy gunfire from Germans who were dug into mountaintops along the beach in cement bunkers. The American troops returned the gunfire and fought for over 3 hours before they destroyed two German bunkers. Mr.Halona's battalion stopped further casualties and took control of the beachfront.  They headed to Brussels and then on to Bonn and Luxembourg, where the U.had established a military base. Winter came upon them, and they were snowed in for 4 months. After the snow cleared, the battalion moved to take over Munich, where they saw firsthand the death and destruction of the In Stuttgart, they drove out the Germans, captured Hitler's top generals, transferred them to jail in Nuremburg, and kept guard. Mr.Halona himself guarded Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering for several hours. Mr.Halona credited his Navajo traditions and prayers for helping him during and after the war.  When Mr.Halona was finally given the honors owed in 2012, he received the Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one Silver Service Star, World War II Victory Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII, and the Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle Bar I was deeply honored that he asked me to present his medals.  Mr.Halona served the Navajo Nation with distinction as well. He was a member of the Navajo Nation Council for four terms and president of the Tohatchi chapter for eight terms. He was first appointed to the advisory board for the Navajo Housing Authority and then served as its first chair. He was instrumental in developing the housing authority--The Navajo Housing Authority was one of the first tribal housing authorities to be funded by the U.Department of Housing and Urban Development--and making sure that Navajo people had better living conditions. He worked to develop the Indian Health Service within the Navajo Nation and to build schools on the reservation. He even helped create the Navajo rodeo association. Mr.Halona's service to his tribe stretched far and deep.  Mr.Halona was married to his wife, Ruby Arviso, from 1942 until her passing in 2013. He had 7 children, and is survived by 5, along with 16 grandchildren and 29 great-grandchildren.  Wilson Miles Halona lived a life of service to family, tribe, and I honor his life and his work.[[Page S1932]]                            ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgS1931-2.txt,1567,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,22.0,March
1469,topic-id,420,"Mr.President, Ta-Nez-Bah means in Navajo ``one who completes a circle.'' Ta-Nez-Bah was an apt middle name for Pablita Abeyta whose life encircled art, advocacy, and dedication to Native peoples.  Pablita Ta-Nez-Bah Abeyta was born in Gallup, NM, in 1953, to Narciso Ha-So-De Abeyta and Sylvia Ann (Shipley) Her father was Navajo and an internationally recognized painter and silversmith. Her mother was Anglo and a Quaker and an accomplished ceramist and weaver in her own right.  Pablita and her six siblings were raised in and around the arts and the traditions of the Navajo people. Each had an artistic talent. Her sister Elizabeth was a masterful sculptor and ceramic artist; her brother Tony is a highly acclaimed painter and jeweler; and her sister Alice Seely is a nationally recognized sculptor, painter, and jeweler.  Pablita attended the Institute for American Indian Arts in Santa Fe and received a masters in public affairs from the University of New Mexico in 1983.  She then headed off to Washington, DC, where she would combine advocacy and art the rest of her life and where she would play a key role in founding the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian,  Pablita had a full career on Capitol Hill for many years until her retirement, always advocating for Native causes. She lobbied for the Navajo Nation; worked as a legislative aide to U.Representative Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado; staffed the U.House Interior Committee's Office of Indian Affairs under my uncle, U.Representative Mo Udall; held a legislative liaison position at the Smithsonian Institute; and served as special assistant with the  Pablita attended the first congressional hearing on NMAI in 1987, worked for its establishment through congressional legislation, and worked on its highly successful private fundraising drive. Her work was instrumental to starting and building the museum.  Pablita was also an accomplished sculptor. Inspired by the strength, beauty, and serenity of Native women, her sculptures have been described as ``smooth, round and sensuous.'' Her artwork won many awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, was included in a Smithsonian National Museum of American History exhibition, and is held in the permanent collection of the Pablita commented of her sculptures that ``. . . the female figurines sing, talk, and reflect the seasons and Navajo spiritual ceremony. I am making a statement with my art about the importance of family, community and my heritage.''  Pablita passed away January 31, 2017, at age 63.

1634,topic-id,1217,"Mr.President, the Middle East poses some of the most difficult diplomatic challenges faced by our The region is troubled, unstable, sometimes dangerous. Conflicts span over centuries. Peace throughout the region seems distant and far away. And the problematic powers, like Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, and Russia, promote their own interests in the area, sometimes violently, and those interests are often contrary to ours.  The United States is deeply involved throughout the region. Israel is America's staunchest ally in the Middle East and one of our closest friends on the world stage. The United States has had and will continue to have a special relationship with Israel, and our country will continue to protect and aid Israel to help secure her survival.  I am a strong supporter of I believe that a qualitative military edge is necessary for the safety of Israel, and I have always voted to support military aid. I have also been a strong supporter of the two-state solution. A peaceful resolution between Israel and the Palestinian people would help heal the source of many of the insecurities facing Israel, but peace has eluded Israel and the Palestinians for decades. Mutual distrust runs deep. Tensions are high between Israel and many of its neighbors.  For all these reasons, the ambassadorship to Israel is one of the State Department's most important diplomatic posts and one of the most sensitive. Since Israel became a nation, the post has been held by 18 of some of our most experienced, skilled, and knowledgeable diplomats. The vast majority were career Foreign Service officers. Many served in both Republican and Democratic administrations. All had significant international and government experience prior to their appointment.  The Ambassador to Israel must be able to thread the needle between Israel and its neighbors. He or she needs to have the confidence, respect, and trust of powers throughout the region. He or she must be seen as an honest broker and have the temperament and finesse to defuse conflict while able to stand one's ground and have the capacity to find common interests and common ground.  However, with David Friedman, the President has put forth a nominee who has no diplomatic experience whatsoever, no government or international experience, who is known for his offensive statements toward Jewish groups and others with whom he disagrees, and who has repeatedly expressed extreme policy views--views antagonistic to any realistic peace process with the Mr.Friedman is not a seasoned diplomat; he is the President's bankruptcy lawyer. President Trump and Mr.Friedman clearly have a lot of experience with bankruptcy, but it is hard to think of a pair of personalities less suited to diplomacy in a volatile region.  Mr.Friedman has vocally opposed a two-state solution--a cornerstone of U.foreign policy for peace in the region since President Ronald He not only supports but has generously funded Israeli settlements--settlements long considered as an obstacle to peace by the United States and deemed illegal by much of the international community.  Mr.Friedman's intemperate remarks have been widely reported. He lashed out that liberal Jews ``suffer a cognitive disconnect in identifying good and evil.'' He said that the State Department has ``[a] hundred-year history of anti-Semitism'' and that President Obama is ``an anti-Semite.'' Most horrific, he said:       J-Street supporters . . . are far worse than kapos--Jews      who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps. . .      . They are just smug advocates of Israel's destruction      delivered from the comfort of their secure American sofas--     it's hard to imagine anyone worse.  Five former U.Ambassadors to Israel, serving under both Democratic and Republican administrations, called Mr.Friedman ``unqualified'' to assume the role of chief diplomat to  Twenty-nine Holocaust scholars objected to his ``kapo'' remarks. The historical record shows, they said, ``that kapos were Jews whom the Nazis forced, at the pain of death, to serve them in the concentration and extermination camps. . . . These Jews faced terrible dilemmas, but ultimately were made into unwilling tools of Nazi brutality. . . . To brand one's political opponents, members of one's own community, as kapos, merely for engaging in legitimate debate, is historically indefensible and is a deeply disturbing example of the abuse of the Holocaust and its victims for present political gain.''  A group of Holocaust survivors called his use of ``kapo''--and I quote a group of Holocaust survivors--``slanderous, insulting, irresponsible, cynical and immensely damaging to our people.''  More than 600 rabbis wrote that his remarks were ``the very antithesis of the diplomatic behavior Americans expect from their ambassadors.''  While Mr.Friedman apologized during his confirmation hearing for his abusive language, I don't believe it erases his past behavior and suddenly qualifies him for the job.  This post should be earned over time, through actions and words that demonstrate without question that the nominee has the right judgment, temperament, and skills. Mr.Friedman has not come close to demonstrating that. We should not risk confirming him to this important post. We have seen how distracting and destructive hotheadedness is at the seat of power.  During his confirmation hearing, Mr.Friedman also walked back his positions on a two-state solution and Israeli settlements, which prompted the committee chair to wryly ask him why he even wants the Ambassador position if he has to ``recant every single strong belief you've had.''  I am a strong supporter of I want to see the State of Israel prosperous and secure forever into the future. I believe in the right of the Palestinians to self-determination, to chart their own course and their destiny. I want to see peace between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel and her neighbors. That is what the vast majority of Americans want. The United States has a strong national interest in securing this peace. The last thing we need is another active military conflict in the Middle East, which could draw in U.forces. That is why over 40 years U.policy has held that the only realistic path to peace is through a two-state solution. The Palestinians are entitled to a homeland. A two-state solution is the only viable path forward for  As Secretary Kerry said, ``If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic. It cannot be both.''  Given Mr.Friedman's past staunch support for a one-state solution and expansion of Israeli settlements, is he really ready and able to embrace and put forward opposing policy positions? Can he ever be viewed by the Palestinians and the international community as an honest broker?  I am under no illusion about how difficult it will be to achieve peace between Israel and the Many Presidents and able diplomats have tried and failed to achieve settlement. But the United States must continue to do its best to reach an accord. Above all, we should not make the current situation worse. We need a steady hand in the Middle  I am not convinced that Mr.Friedman is qualified for this job, with no diplomatic experience and a history of extreme positions and intemperate language. His contrition is too little, too late. I am worried that by ignoring these huge red flags with his nomination, we run the risk of a diplomatic incident that could needlessly increase risk of conflict in the region. Therefore, I must vote no on this nomination.  I yield the floor.

784,topic-id,1795,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin And I always enjoy hearing from the gentlewoman from the Chicago area, and I appreciate everything that she is doing as well.  It is interesting the President posed that question: What do you have to lose?  What he was referencing to was the African-American community. Instead of offering anything of substance, he just put out that very simple question.  I have got to tell you that it is pretty evident what we have to lose now. It is not only a lot of the gains that were made under the Obama Administration, but something that is near and dear to all of us, and that is health care.  I think about the district that I represent, and 40,000 people or more have actually been covered because of the Affordable Care They will probably lose that insurance if TrumpCare were to become law. And if you represent low-income families and workers out there, that is a scary prospect.  It is already bad enough that the State of Texas made probably what is considered one of the biggest policy blunders in Texas State legislative history when they decided not to expand Medicaid, which left so many others statewide, including in the district I represent, again, off of the insurance rolls.  What do you have to lose?  God, there are so many ways and so many areas that I can sort of describe what you would have to lose. The first thing I think about is, in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, if you lose your insurance, of course, that means that the burden is going to fall back on John Peter Smith Hospital, which is one of our county hospitals in the north Texas area, and Parkland Hospital in  So instead of people having insurance that they pay into, that they have where they can go and see a doctor, they will end up back in the county hospital rolls and, of course, that will end up costing the taxpayers more money.  During President Trump's first 50 days, the Republicans introduced this legislation that, again, will just decimate the progress that so many people around the country have seen under the Affordable Care  This Thursday, as we actually mark the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, the House is set to vote on the Republicans' healthcare replacement. Ironically, on a day that we should be celebrating the tremendous progress our country has made since this landmark law's passage, we will be defending the merits in our continued battle to fight its repeal.  So what does the Black community have to lose?  Again, we pose that question. The Congressional Budget Office--and there is a Republican appointee that runs that office, by the way--says that 24 million people are going to lose their healthcare insurance. Of those 24 million who are set to be kicked off of their healthcare plan and sent out to nowhere, African Americans are going to be hit the hardest.  The ACA boosted the African-American insured rate from 79 percent to 88 percent, just slightly below the 91 percent national figure. Some of those gains stem from Medicaid expansion under the ACA, where nearly 15 million of the nearly 40 million African Americans gained coverage.  That is what I was talking about a little bit earlier, Representative In Texas, we did not get to benefit from that. That would have been a huge benefit to us. Again, it is really considered one of the biggest policy blunders in the country.  As you see, Republican governors are actually afraid right now that the Medicaid expansion that has benefited their States that they are going to lose out on that because of this repeal that is going to take place. They are pushing back. They are saying this whole TrumpCare and RyanCare plan is a hot mess and that they absolutely want nothing to do with it.  It is also important to remember, under the Republican plan, the decision to cut $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years will translate into millions of African Americans potentially losing health care. While these numbers are alarming, it is the human impact that cannot be lost on GOP colleagues.[[Page H2229]]  I have heard directly from constituents that I serve how the ACA has improved or saved their lives, and I would like to actually share some of those stories with you today.  One of the constituents that I serve worked for the same company for 35 years but was forced to retire because of declining health before he was eligible for He faces drug costs of over $500 per day and requires a lifesaving procedure four times a year that costs $14,000 per treatment. You can imagine what $14,000 per treatment would do, and that is four times a year. Overall, his medical costs per month is $15,000.  With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, he had access to quality care that helped ease his financial burden. Under the Republican plan, this hardworking man, this taxpayer, this person that has worked hard, that worked for one company for 35 years--that used to mean so much in this country when people would give 35 years to one company and expected to be treated right--under the Republican plan, this hardworking man would pay thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket medical expenses for lifesaving care that would not be covered by this disastrous plan that we are actually going to have to take a vote on on  It is stories like that that I think are really sad and why we need to tap the brakes and see what we can do to help make the current healthcare plan that we have, the ACA, stronger and better, to help out people like this gentleman who are going to be left out in the cold.  You have to really be wondering what our Republican colleagues are thinking, because it is not just the constituents that I represent. It is many of the constituents that they represent, too. I can tell you that out in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex, while I do represent largely urban areas--Dallas, Fort Worth, Irving, Grand Prairie, Arlington--I know that there are a lot of people that live out in these rural areas, that live outside of Dallas and Fort Worth, that live outside of Dallas County and Tarrant They consider themselves conservatives, and I can tell you that they cannot afford $14,000 per treatment; but if the Republicans pass their plan, that is what they are going to be left with and they are not going to be able to afford it. They are not going to get the care that they need, and that is what they need to understand tonight and that is what the Republicans need to understand tonight.  The only thing that they can guarantee individuals, like I just talked about, is that they are going to be paying a whole lot more for a lot less coverage. I think that is really a shame.  Another constituent was forced to pay $100 per month for medically necessary birth control pills after her husband lost his job in 2010. Luckily, the Affordable Care Act provided access to health care, and now her birth control that she needs is covered in full. And that is important, too.  We have actually seen teen pregnancy rates in this country drop all over the country, which is good. Because when people can afford to start a family when they are ready, when they are financially ready to start a family, those kids are more likely to do better in school. They are more likely to be in a stable household. They are more likely to get the education that they need to be able to achieve the things they want to achieve when they leave the house. So there are a lot of these initiatives around the country where we have really seen teen pregnancy rates drop 20, 30 percent or more. It has been great.  I can tell you that in Dallas County, while the teen pregnancy rate is dropping all over the country, we have actually seen it rise at an alarming rate.  So what does that tell me?  That tells me that if you see the teen pregnancy rate going up and that you are going to kick all these people off their health care, that is going to be more of a strain on the social service system.  Republicans used to pretend like they were for people to have an opportunity to get off the system. But once you take people's birth control away and not give them the options that they need for family planning, you are increasing the social services. The Republican CBO report actually points that out, and they are still going ahead with this. So I think that that is really what is sad.  I think overall what we want to get at tonight is that the Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for African Americans and African-American families. The full repeal will snatch the safety net out from under the Black community.  Despite the lies that our colleagues across the aisle and in the White House want to spread about the ACA, my colleagues and I will continue to defend it to the very end because it turns out that the Black community has a lot to lose under the Republican healthcare plan.  I am so glad that so many of our colleagues came out tonight. I am glad that you are here helping lead this hour because we need to get the word out. We can stop something really devastating from happening here. The thing about it is that we really need to try to stop something devastating from happening on a bipartisan basis, such as people losing their health care, getting left out in the cold, being kicked off of their health insurance; trying to figure out, if they have a preexisting condition, how they are going to afford being pushed back into a high-risk pool.  What is this going to do to so many Americans? We are here focusing on the African-American community tonight with the Congressional Black Caucus, but what is this going to do to all Americans?  It is going to hurt them. It is going to hurt their bottom line. It is going to hurt their families. It is going to leave them in financial disrepair. I think it is going to be a sad day for our country.  Instead of trying to destroy something, we need to be trying to work together to try to strengthen the current system and make sure that all Americans have the opportunity to be covered.

788,topic-id,520,"Absolutely, Representative And one of our colleagues, who also happens to be my neighbor, Eddie Bernice Johnson, you can easily make the argument that she knows something about health care, considering that she worked in the healthcare arena before she came to And not only did she work in the healthcare arena, she has a lot of people that were uninsured that live in her district that are now insured because of the Affordable Care  So, again, not only does she have that healthcare experience, she has been out in the community and has met with people for many years now on health care, even before she came to the Congress, when she was in the State Senate; so she has sat down and she has talked to people. She understands why it is important for people to have health care. She understands why it can be financially hard on people when they are hit by a catastrophic illness.  She gave a speech on the House floor--or she has a speech that she is going to submit--where she talks about the fact that the district that she represents, the uninsured rate dropped 27.3, all the way down to 20.8 percent; and that was a huge benefit for the constituents that she serves on a daily basis.  I mentioned Parkland Hospital a little bit earlier. Parkland Hospital is a Dallas County public hospital. Parkland Hospital provided $1 billion in uncompensated care in 2015--$1 billion. And if this RyanCare-TrumpCare bill were to become law, you can imagine what a large system like Parkland, that already provides so much in uncompensated care, what they are going to be hit with. It is going to be absolutely devastating.  I already talked about the fact also that Texas--and Representative Johnson mentions Medicaid in her letter. I have already talked about the fact that Texas made a big public policy blunder and decided not to take the money that the Federal Government was going to give them to help expand Medicaid coverage. They just prefer to just leave all those people uninsured.  So now one of the things that will happen under this GOP bill that the Congresswoman points out is that the money will be sent to people in a block grant; and you can imagine the shortfalls that that would create, particularly in a large State like Texas, because there are going to be shortcomings. So hospital systems like Parkland, like John Peter Smith, they are really going to be hit with a hammer were this ever to pass and become law just because they are already being pushed so much.  Again, what just doesn't make any sense is that the Republicans so prided themselves for so many years about being the party that was about self-empowerment and helping people out, so[[Page H2231]]now they want to kick people off of their insurance and leave them out in the cold and have them start going back to Parkland, start going back to John Peter Smith because they are not going to be able to afford their insurance anymore under this. It doesn't make any sense.  ",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2226-3.txt,2166,0915,2017.0,20.0,March
790,topic-id,1247,"All of those are absolutely good points, and I was talking about the uncompensated costs there for public hospitals. The one thing that I did not mention--and everybody knows this--is that if you don't have insurance and you do find yourself having to depend on the county hospital system or the public hospital system in your area, and those lines get longer and longer, which is what would happen if this bill were repealed--people have to remember that if someone is having an emergency and they know that the lines at the county hospital are just out of control and long, they are going to go to the private hospital.                              {time}  2015  They are going to go to the nonprofit hospital like in Dallas County that could be Baylor, that could be Huguley, and those hospitals are going to take on uncompensated costs. That is what is going to end up happening. They can't get a regular appointment there without insurance, but if they go to the hospital emergency room, they can't be turned away. Not only is it going to be a burden on our county hospital system, it is going to be a burden on our nonpublic providers as well.  Again, one thing to remember is that, before the Affordable Care Act, we had over 1 million people in Dallas-Fort Worth that did not have insurance. Just in the congressional district, alone, that I represent, I have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional district in the entire country. That surprises a lot of people just because of the growth and the opportunities that the Dallas-Fort Worth area have been blessed with. But I actually have the largest uninsured rate out of any congressional Member in the country.  So when you think about the district that I represent and then you expand that across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, you are talking about 1 million people in a very prosperous area that still find themselves without insurance. That is scary.  I mentioned a little bit earlier the district I represent, the uninsured rate has gone from 37.9 percent to 31.4 percent since ACA was implemented; 2,003 individuals in the district now have health insurance that covers preventive services like cancer screenings and flu shots.  When you start talking about kidney dialysis, for instance, I visited a kidney dialysis center in Dallas County shortly after I was first sworn in. I was taking a tour of the kidney dialysis center, and I asked the doctor who was in charge of the center, I said: Wow, there are a lot of younger people in here.  About 60 percent of the patients were African About 40 percent were There was one White patient that was in there.  The lady said: It doesn't matter where you go. If you go to visit any of our clinics or any of our kidney dialysis centers, this is what a typical day looks like.  I asked her: Is it hereditary? What is going on? I don't understand what the problem is here.  She said: A lot of it is because they weren't receiving the care that they needed.  The sad part about that, she went on to explain to me, is sometimes it can be a person who has high blood pressure issues, and if they had just gotten those high blood pressure issues addressed, it could have been the difference between them taking some high blood pressure medicine instead of them basically having to give up their careers and go and sit in a chair to receive dialysis treatment 3, 4 days a week, 2 to 3 hours each time. That is sad.  She also talked about diabetes and how some people have diabetes, and they don't get that diabetes treated in time. Maybe they didn't even know they had diabetes. Again, type 2 diabetes is something very treatable. You can imagine the difference between treating somebody, giving them a prescription to treat their type 2 diabetes or their high blood pressure versus your earning capacity being greatly diminished by you having to go sit in a chair 2, 3, or more times 3 or 4 days a week versus if they had just been able to go see a primary care physician.  That is the type of thing that the Affordable Care Act is doing, giving people the opportunity to go and get those things treated before they become more costly to the system. That is something that is being missed.  The other thing that I think scares everybody--and it doesn't matter if you, again, live in my district or you live in the one of many districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, when you start talking about people who have preexisting conditions and you start talking about the fact that people are going to lose consumer protections that have been put in place under the Affordable Care Act and that they are going to see those consumer protections killed--like the prohibition on annual and lifetime limits, protection against unfair policy rescissions and coverage of preexisting conditions--again, if you see the ACA repealed, it is people like that who, for the first time, didn't have to worry about those limits, and they are going to see that snatched away from them. That is just really one of the tragedies.  Mr.Speaker, 27,000 people in the district that I represent, again, received financial assistance to purchase marketplace coverage in 2016. Now they are going to risk being uninsured again, and the insurance is going to be unaffordable under the Republican plan. There are just so many stories like that.  One of the things that I didn't point out about some of the people that are going to lose some of these consumer protections is that some of those people have worked really hard on their jobs, they are still working on their jobs, and they are going to be hit with those lifetime limits. It is going to be completely unfair to them while they are out there working hard every day. It was something they didn't have to worry about before, or at least when the ACA was put in place. If the ACA is repealed, they are going to be subject to that, too.  I think the narrative that has been put out there by the Republicans is that, no, it is just people that are taking advantage of the system. But understand, there are people that fall into these categories that we are talking about right now that get up and they[[Page H2232]]go and work hard every day--every single day--and they have health insurance on their jobs, and they are going to be greatly impacted by this.  Speaking of people who go and work hard on their job every day, one of the things that I know that a lot of Democrats would like to see put in place--and even some Republicans have said they would like to see put in place--is they want to see the Cadillac tax repealed. That is not happening under this Republican plan. That is completely out of it.  So, again, there are a lot of problems with this and a lot of unfairness about this, about the people that are going to be harmed and affected. I hope that we can work in a bipartisan manner to really stop this from happening. And again, like we are here talking about tonight, the African-American community, in particular, will really be hit very, very hard.  ",CREC-2017-03-20-pt1-PgH2226-3.txt,2166,0915,2017.0,20.0,March
1339,topic-id,190,"Mr.Speaker, 7 years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since then, the ACA has helped millions of Americans gain access to affordable healthcare insurance.  We all know what is at stake in this Republican bill. It is a bill that actually has a big old tax in it called the age tax that makes our seniors pay more.  In addition to that, it prohibits Medicaid reimbursement for Planned Parenthood, and Republicans are actively working hard to make access to reproductive care even tougher for low-income women.  Let me tell you this about Texas: In 2014, Planned Parenthood had 34 centers that served over 120,000 women. Additionally, these centers in my home State of Texas provided birth control to over 93,000 women, conducted over 134,000 STD tests, 16,000 pap smears, and 16,000 mammograms.  These crucial services allow women across Texas to take control of their own health care and help them plan for a family when they are ready.  Republicans claim that their replacement plan puts patients first, but limiting a woman's ability to seek care when she seems fit directly contradicts that goal.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-22-pt1-PgH2333.txt,2166,0915,2017.0,22.0,March

1277,topic-id,370,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of H.1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act, a bill that will help people in Michigan and across the country by expanding affordable coverage for workers and their families.  I thank our colleague, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, for introducing this legislation. I really enjoyed hearing the gentleman from Texas and his comments about this being common sense. Representative Sam Johnson of Texas defines common sense and patriotism. He has tirelessly championed this bill for years, and it is a pleasure to join him in pushing for these positive reforms.  Mr.Speaker, health care in this country has become simply unaffordable for far too many small businesses and working families. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has proved to be an utter failure for most people in the United It is snowballing out of control and rolling over working families and small businesses.  Ninety-five percent of small businesses have reported increased health insurance costs over the past 5 years. A 2015 study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses found that the cost of health insurance is the principal reason that small businesses do not offer coverage.  As a result, since 2008, 36 percent of small businesses with fewer than 10 employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage to their employees. It is not that they don't want to offer healthcare benefits. The truth of the matter is that small businesses have been hit especially hard by the government takeover of health care. Under ObamaCare, the working families I speak to in my district are paying more for less and finding they have fewer options for coverage.  H.1101 is a key part of the third phase of our efforts to reform our healthcare system so it works for all It aims to increase the negotiating power of small businesses so they can bring down health insurance costs for their employees.  Right now, small businesses are often on an unequal playing field with larger companies and unions. Because they have few employees, small businesses have limited bargaining power when it comes to negotiating for lower insurance costs for their workers.

395,topic-id,2087,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to H.1259. Let me be clear that I rise in opposition not after serving this Nation in uniform for 24 years; not after serving on this committee longer than anyone else on the committee; and not with serving honorably with my friend, the chairman, who--I want to be clear, first of all, where the commonality lies around this issue, about 95 percent of it, you are not going to find daylight between us.  The idea that anyone would put a special interest ahead of the care of a veteran is not only distasteful, it is wrong to assume that. There are legitimate differences on how to get accountability in the VA, and we have come to some conclusions that get us pretty close. This piece of legislation--and I do not condemn the committee because this is truly a bipartisan committee, but, for whatever reason, for the first time in the decade-plus that I have served on this committee, we have brought a bill to the floor without a hearing.  We held a markup and brought it to the floor. The majority has the right to do as they please. What that deprives us of is the ability to build consensus around issues we know we share. I know the chairman's heart is providing absolute best care to every single veteran. I also know the chairman's heart is to make sure that every employee who is doing their job is respected the way they are supposed to be. There is not disagreement on that.  This piece of legislation, and framing it as a false choice between veterans and the employees, the majority of whom are veterans, in many cases, serving other veterans, is a false choice. The chart that was put up, I belong to half those organizations. There is also an organization that is on there that differs from the others because it is a 501(c)(4) with the sole purpose of political attack ads on Members of the opposing party. Leave them off the sheet. The other ones I agree with. The others are 501(c)(3)s advocating for veterans, but for us to pretend this isn't a[[Page H2116]]proxy fight for outside groups on something bigger is disingenuous and moves us away from the place we should have gotten.  To show you the comity, my friend from Tennessee gave an impassioned, logical, and, in my opinion, correct assessment on the Veterans 2nd Amendment, H.1181. I agree with the chairman on this. I believe we could have built consensus by bringing that through the committee, but it doesn't change the fact that I think the chairman eloquently got to the heart of that. I know what the heart of that was because the majority side used the term over two dozen times, ``due process.'' It matters. These are veterans working in the VA who should have due process to their Second Amendment rights and to their employment rights. It ensures that the working environment attracts and retains the best and brightest.  So let's go through a little bit of what is here. One of the things is, we talk about going back and breaking a sacred pledge. You can disagree what is in the collective bargaining that was done between the administrations, Republican and Democrat, and those employees who work there, but to go in and arbitrarily change that from Congress, how is that due process? How about in the next bargaining agreement you make the case that those things need to be there. I will stand there with you and tell you this: The public sector unions need to give more, because you know what happens if they don't? They get painted with those examples.  I hear some people say there are 350,000 employees in the VA, and they gave five examples of five bad people. You should give those examples. That is unacceptable, horrid, and should never be agreed to. This is a zero sum proposition. If one bad employee gives substandard care, Mr.Chairman, to one veteran, that is a failure, and the majority and the minority are in absolute agreement on that.  But here is what I fear. We have had legislation--and I will offer up an amendment to do this--that has bipartisan support, that has Senate support. We will see if I am right or wrong on this, but I am almost certain--and it is our responsibility in this House not to message things for those outside groups to run attack ads, it is to get things that actually get through.  I am saying today--and I will be the first to come back and tell you I was wrong on this--the process of getting legislation into law to be enacted by the agencies means compromise must be there. I think we come back here in October, this isn't done yet. Why don't we give on the 5 percent that is not agreed upon and get the 95 percent right so we can act to enact it? This is going to be the perfect getting in the way of the good, and I would argue the zeal to get it done in the way of due process.  I do not question the heart of any of my colleagues to get this right. I do not question--I hope it would not come back to me--the outrage I feel when I hear the story--and I know when the chairman tells me it, it is true--of someone showing up intoxicated trying to provide care to a veteran. How in goodness name is that person not done, not removed, and not moved forward? I will have to tell you this: I have been there on this. I am a public schoolteacher. Do you know who hates a bad public schoolteacher the most? A good public schoolteacher. What really angers me is when management doesn't do their dang job, follow the law and remove those people, and give the due process to them.  The same thing happens in the Management needs to do their job. We have issued subpoenas for Phoenix, we have issued subpoenas for Philadelphia, we have issued subpoenas for Paul of people doing egregious things, not caring for veterans. They should come here, and they should lose their jobs. In some cases, they did. Do you know what they all did have in common? None of them were part of a collective bargaining agreement. They were the management. My fear on this is you have bad managers making bad decisions, and if someone speaks up, Mr.Chairman, who is a lower ranking member, their only protection to improve the system is by collectively bargained grievance processes to make sure their due process is heard. That is all we are asking for.  I do not deny there are going to be proxy fights on this. I will not deny that I believe the public sector unions need to be in a partnership with this. I believe we should have had them in a hearing and set those union members down there and asked them: How in God's name can you justify this? Ask them and say: What would help so that we can do this?  I have witnessed this as a public schoolteacher. Beating up on public schoolteachers all the time is not the best way to entice good people to go into public school teaching. I ask people, whether it be teachers or the veterans--go ask your veterans, how many have received quality care at the VA? How many really appreciate that floor nurse who did what he or she was supposed to do? How many are grateful that their cardiac surgeon is one of the best in the world and is choosing to make less money to serve there?  But I won't deny this. We have managers who are unaccountable. This piece of legislation does not get at the heart of it because the teeth are saved for the rank-and-file members. I agree. I think the gentleman is exactly right.  I want to read something. You tell me if this is okay. We had a VA employee who was written up and subsequently fired because they were practicing medicine without a license. That is outrageous. Outrageous that you would go there and you don't have the license, and you are practicing medicine. That person was fired. If we pass this piece of legislation, they are done and they are not coming back.  But there is a little bit different story to this. This was a Navy veteran in Arkansas, and you know what they got it for? Not picking up a scalpel and doing something that a doctor should do, not writing a prescription for an opioid and trying to steal medicine, which does happen. What they did was, they entered the wrong code on a chart, and that got them for practicing medicine without a license.  When they went through the approved negotiated grievance process, not only did they find out that this was wrong to this combat Navy veteran trying to serve other veterans who was discharged by a manager, it turns up the lack of management oversight. It was the entire system was flawed and the chart was wrong. So the grievance process not only returned the employee back to their rightful job, it fixed the system guaranteeing better care for veterans going forward.  So I don't disagree. When we try and make it, the big scary thing is, oh, we have unions that don't care about veterans, don't care about what the care is, and what we need to do is fire those people immediately. Well, you know what? Some of them do need to be fired. But if there is not a process in place--this Navy veteran caring for other veterans was released without due process--we don't find out about a broken system putting veterans' care at risk. That is what is at stake here.  My point is not to disagree. The chairman has insights into veterans that I think are second to none. The committee works together on this. Once again, when you gain the most votes, you get the majority, and I respect that. But I would also say that if we want to build consensus around this, I am going to offer up a piece of legislation that was written by a Republican Senator that has the ability to pass, be signed into law, and will get at the heart of this by going after the managers.  Mr.Chairman, it is important to me, and I know it is important to my chairman, a Vietnam veteran himself, it is important to the staff sitting behind, veterans ourselves, that we not allow what has happened in this country to get into the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to divide us over talking points when our goals are exactly the same.  When we have legitimate differences, again, I don't think it is fair to me, as a veteran and a union member, to put something up that says you are choosing sides. I am not choosing sides. We are all in this together. What I disagree with is it is my opinion--and I wish I would have had experts testify to this, employment law people, bring the union folks in there, have us have this debate so that we can say: you know what, these changes are good, these won't make a difference.  I respectfully oppose the way this legislation is written. I respectfully totally associate myself with the chairman on why he wants to do it and why he believes that this is best. I only ask,[[Page H2117]]take a look at some of the improving amendments that can get us all to the same point, and give us the benefit of the doubt that we are not assuming the worst. And I don't--as some have said, this is an attempt to bust unions or bust the civil service system. That is the farthest thing from the chairman's mind. I know that because never, in my experience, has he done anything to disprove that veterans' care comes first, quality of care at the VA comes first, and accountability must go with that. My concern is, this doesn't get us there nor does it have a chance to become into law. With those things, let's come back at it, let's approach it a little differently, and let's find the common ground that is there.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

403,topic-id,922,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chair, you are hearing it here, and these are folks, we work together. This idea of accountability matters deeply to all of us. We know when you are in any business, this business--we have had colleagues of ours in here be arrested for buying cocaine from undercover police officers in Washington, D. Well, that brings great discredit to every single one of us, but I certainly don't think it requires all of us, then, to go through the same thing that person is going through or deprive us our rights of where we are at. This idea of due process, and what we are asking about, is not something meant to protect a bad employee. In fact, it is just the opposite. It is meant to improve the workforce.  My plea on this is--much of this bill, there is agreement on, Mr.Takano was right--it went a step further. Having been a rank-and-file person in a collectively bargained unit, my goal was to provide the best quality education so our students could learn--an environment, quality teachers, and all of those things.  I am at a loss for the desire to come here and decide that, and again, we say it in passing: Well, I don't want to deride all of those really good employees who are there. I just want to take away their collectively bargained right that was there.  Even though we can give example after example, like He was a[[Page H2120]]service-connected disabled Navy veteran with over a decade of experience at the Veterans Benefits He was demoted after consistently, every single year, receiving highly satisfactory or top-rated performance reviews. Robert volunteered to be part of a quality review team to get rid of the backlog, and he had the audacity to tell his manager that there were better ways we could do this. Perhaps all of this overtime pay and consolidating all of these claims to one place was not in the best interest of that. That manager, on the way out the door, demoted and tried to remove Robert from that position.  Now, keep in mind, that same manager, all of those years before, had rated him well. Well, maybe something happened. Maybe Robert started doing something wrong. Maybe Robert wasn't that good an employee.  But again, under this piece of legislation, Robert's collectively bargained right--which he used and grieved it and got back his job, and subsequently, the manager had problems on their performance reviews, where it came from.  So again, don't set this up as if everything is wrong.  And I would make note of this: We are doing our best to attract the best and brightest to the Nobody is defending the bad. But when I hear folks come to the floor and it is nothing but what a horrific place this is, I leave this for you, Mr. I also have the privilege of representing America's premier medical institution in the Mayo Clinic, and I look at what they do. Folks at Mayo Clinic will tell me some of the finest cardiac surgeons in the world are at the Minneapolis  I will also tell you this. If you, in America, go to any hospital--Roe can attest to this--the thing that you should probably be most worried about and the thing that kills most people--over 90,000 a year--is hospital-acquired infections.  Do you know who does it better and has the lowest rate, better than Mayo Clinic, better than Johns Hopkins? The So somebody among those rank-and-file members who is cleaning the operating rooms and cleaning the equipment is doing so in a manner that is better than any other.  What message are we sending them today? If a manager doesn't do their job and decides they want to fire you, we are going to lump everybody together. I just ask, once again, to my colleagues, to this body, these are things that should have been debated in a hearing. We should have brought in the experts.  Here is what I think. I think you would build a broader coalition--because I have to be very honest with you. I think our public sector unions could help us and step up and say: What was the real situation here? How do you respond to this egregious breach of trust? And what do you think would be a better way?  I am not saying they would give us a suggestion. I want to be very honest and not disingenuous. They may not answer us. We should have at least asked them: What would you do to make this better? What could speed it up, and what could protect them?  We didn't do that because we didn't have a hearing, and I think that stops building the consensus. I think it makes it harder to get this.  I will tell you this. The bill I keep referencing that was over in the Senate had 45 Senate cosponsors. Good luck getting 45 of them to agree today. It is Thursday, and we did it on an accountability plea that also had the support of every single one of those groups on there, except one, to support that piece of legislation.  So we went a step further. We didn't have a hearing. We tried to let outside groups frame this as a veterans versus public sector union folks, who were also veterans. That is not what it is. We just need to get it right.  Mr.Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

405,topic-id,573,"Mr.Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, we are not going to find a lot of disagreement.  I will tell you what a good first step would be: hire some surgeons. There are openings there. This is our first salvo at trying to fix the We have an appeals bill that every single veterans service organization agrees: appeals modernization. We have worked that thing through. We have had the language. It is not here.  We have a Choice bill that is expiring August 7. We have had a hearing with the VA Secretary, and that is the way it should have been. It is not here today.  What we have is a bill that did not go through regular order, a bill that obviously didn't build a consensus, and this is very unusual to have a bill from the VA I bet you 90 to 95 percent of the time when one hits this floor, it gets 300 to 400 votes up on that board, but this one is not.  So, again, if the contention is that Members of this House don't care if there is a bad employee working there, that is disingenuous and wrong. But if we do believe, putting it in place--and again, the example I gave, the chairman is right. It took Robert 6 weeks to get all of the information gathered together because the manager who left was holding on to it and had to get the union to force the release of that information. His 14 days would have come and gone, and that is it.  This is why, sometimes, I am not going to defend 400 days. That is ridiculous. I am not going to spend--if they are dragging their feet. But this guy got fired by a manager, got demoted down, wanted to get the information. The outgoing manager said, ``It isn't my problem.'' The union had to go--and had to go, in this case, almost to court--to get the information back to them so he could present a case that said exactly what was ruled upon: You got fired illegally by a bad manager.  I am telling people, if you are angry when things go wrong at the VA, you have got 330 million Americans who are with you. We have subpoenaed them. None of them were collectively bargained. The problem is in management and middle management not doing their job.  Do your work.  You know what would be great is if the management actually did what they are supposed to do and improved bad performance before it gets to a point where it causes problems and you actually improve that employee, which saves us money from having to go out and hire someone else and you have the system working better. But to watch something go wrong, not do your due diligence, not follow the law, then fire someone and then complain that it takes too long to fix it, how about we figure out what really gets, keeps, retains, and makes the VA better?  There are other places that we could work on. Ninety percent of it, you have got my agreement. I think you are going to see that 10 percent is going to ensure this does not get into law; and that, in itself, is simply wrong because[[Page H2121]]no one disagrees.

417,topic-id,479,"Mr.Chairman, I thank Chairman Roe of Tennessee and Chairman Sessions of the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order. I have voiced my concern with the regular order. I think it is important to note that we are given the opportunity here to offer amendments in good faith, and I am grateful for that.  This amendment to H.1259 would replace sections 3 and 9 of the underlying bill with bipartisan legislation from the Veterans First Act that was first introduced by Senator Isakson last This is a piece of legislation I have been talking about.  It is supported from both sides of the aisle, as well as those veterans service organizations, with the exception of one, that was shown earlier.  If we hope to reach any compromise with the Senate on accountability, I believe this amendment could be made in order, be voted on, debated, and passed into it.  The amendment specifically targets senior executives. It has been the senior executives, not the frontline employees, who we have subpoenaed before our committee, and who the VA has failed to hold accountable.  Like H.1259, it provides an expedited process for the VA Secretary to hold senior executives and VA employees accountable.  For a senior executive employee, the employee would get 10 business days' notice. The employee subject to an adverse action would be able to grieve the action through an internal grievance process that would take no longer than 21 days. The employee would also be permitted to appeal an adverse action to court. It would also require the VA Secretary to develop a performance management system for SES employees. Do your job. Have the management do their job.  For VA employees, the employee would be removed from misconduct or poor performance that took place within the previous 2 years before the proposed removal. The employee would get 10 business days' notice. The employee would get 10 business days to respond to the charges. The VA Secretary would be required to provide the employee a decision in a reasonable period of time, and the employee would have 10 days to appeal the decision to the Merit Systems Protection This takes a little time.  The Merit Systems Protection Board would have 90 days to issue a decision. During that time, the employee would receive no pay and no benefits.  My amendment would also leave in place sections 4 through 8 of H.1259 because I agree employees convicted of felonies connected to their jobs should not receive pensions, and poor-performing employees should not receive bonuses. No disagreement.  Most importantly, my amendment provides a fair process that protects whistleblowers. By allowing our frontline employees to use arbitration and grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements, these frontline employees remain protected from bad managers who want to retaliate against them for speaking out when something is wrong.

Do you want to stand with Robert, the good employee who was fired by a bad manager who used the process to get their job back, or do we want to just hurry it?  It is better to get it right than get it done. And I will point out, AFGE, the union you keep hearing about, Mr.Chairman, does not endorse my amendment. They do not endorse my amendment, nor do I care about that.  What I do believe is that this amendment has the opportunity to improve upon on a bill that we 90 percent agree upon, taking out the piece that is going to make it difficult and not improve care for our veterans. And I guess the thing that I would hope matters, I believe--and we will come back here and see. We will see. That is the good part about this place. If this piece of legislation is passed by October, by Halloween, we should have this bill through and it should be done, and we should be seeing changes.  If we don't, perhaps we do this exercise again, through regular order, taking some of these suggestions that make it possible to get it done.  I encourage my colleagues to support this change that makes sure we can get accountability. Let's agree where we know we agree. It is not picking one over the other. It is deciding how you give due process, encouraging good employees to have the rights that they have earned to improve that care and workplace while at the same time removing those that don't.

424,topic-id,277,"Mr.Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing this forward. This amendment addresses an issue that we dealt with in our committee last Congress, where senior executives are transferred to different positions around the country, receive pay increases and relocation incentives.  We subpoenaed two senior executives. In fact, the first subpoenas ever issued out of the VA Committee, I asked for them to get there; and they were backed by Mr.Roe, backed by our chairman and ranking member. And to refresh people's minds, these were folks that took positions of lesser power, used their positions to negotiate to get there, and then, in some cases, took $129,000 moving expenses.  You cannot find anyone more outraged than me. And I will tell you, because it was not done correctly, and we didn't focus on this, I still work with some of those very same people. They have their jobs back.  Now, the debate that the gentleman may have heard earlier is we don't disagree at all that we should get rid of these people. This amendment will focus on the right things, that is what we have been making the case of.  So I applaud the gentleman. I am glad he is here. His military service is greatly appreciated.

I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio, first of all, as an incredibly important Member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, a doctor himself and, as important, a colonel in the United States Army and the United States Army An incredible insight into the very issues we are addressing and, I think, bringing this bill right now, we had a very good debate on fixing the VA, moving them in the right direction. And this piece of legislation is incredibly spot-on about another piece of that accountability.  Wenstrup's bill will help the VA better understand its staffing shortages, and I think this is important. We all say 45,000 openings or whatever; it is important for us to know, do we need to hire all 45,000 of those; which ones are critical; which ones can be done faster. So that piece is common sense.  It develops an executive management fellowship program that will allow the VA to send its leaders to the private sector to learn best practices and vice versa; again, incredibly smart, welcome change.  It will allow the VA to develop technical advancements, so employees who are in a specific field can advance in title and salary, without moving to a management role.  Quality hiring, training, and retention starts with a good HR department. This legislation will provide critical research into best HR practice and then provide the training to VA HR managers. These provisions, along with other hiring authorities, will help the VA get the right people in the door.  Currently, as the gentleman said, the process is slow, cumbersome, and, quite honestly, I think it just burns people out before they get there. And these are really dedicated folks who want to serve.  I have a gentleman I have become acquainted with who is a nationally renowned cardiac surgeon who left a very lucrative private practice to go to the VA after his son was wounded in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and chose to do his part by going back into the VA system.  He mentioned how cumbersome it was. He mentioned some of the bureaucratic troubles that he had, and all he wanted to do was bring an incredible skill set to serve those who served us; and Mr.Wenstrup's bill does exactly that.

596,topic-id,343,"Mr.Chair, every Member of Congress has heard directly from their constituents who receive health care from the VA that it is understaffed. This is true at all levels, but it is vital to both the workforce and the veterans served that each medical center have permanent leadership.  I think all of us know--and there is an old saying--if you have been to one VA facility, you have been to one VA facility. Again, it may seem like the easiest thing to say that leadership matters at these facilities. Nothing matters more.  When a VA facility is moving in the right direction, it can always be traced to strong, directed leadership. In almost every case each one of us has worked on, whether it is weak leadership or lack of leadership, those situations go awry.  I have a situation in Minnesota where we have been waiting for leadership for a year. We were notified, I believe, a week or so ago that we are finally getting that.  I enthusiastically endorse Mr.Bost's amendment, which would require the Department to get these things done, develop and implement a plan within 120 days of enactment to hire a permanent director for each medical center which does not have one.  As the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.Bost) says in his amendment, a new director may well be identified from senior executives already within the Department, or he or she may be someone from outside the agency who meets the qualifications and wants to work at the  What is necessary is that filling these open directorships be made a priority.

163,topic-id,1012,"Mr.President, first of all, I thank my friend the Senator from Texas for giving me the courtesy of letting me get in my comments about the nomination of former Senator Dan Coats to serve as the fifth Director of National Intelligence, a position recommended by the 9/11 Commission and established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  Dan Coats is a friend of mine and many in this body. He represented Indiana in both the U.House and for separate terms in the U.He was also U.Ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2005. As mentioned, for 6 years I served with the nominee on the Senate Select Committee on I have always found Dan to be fairminded and know him to be an advocate for strong oversight of the intelligence community. He believes in the need for intelligence that is timely, relevant, and free of political interference.  During my private meeting with him, as well as during his confirmation hearing, Senator Coats committed to find and follow the truth, regardless of where it leads, agreeing that his primary job will be ``to speak truth to power,'' to the President, to policy and military leaders, and to Members of I know these are traits he will continue to employ if confirmed as the next Director of National  During James Clapper's most recent tenure as the DNI, in 6 years he put in place some fundamental changes in how the Intelligence community operates. He reoriented the Office of the DNI to focus on intelligence integration with an emphasis on mission. He often was willing to roll up his sleeves and take on the hard challenges of trying to get the intel community to operate on the same IT backbone systems. If confirmed, I have encouraged Senator Coats to build upon former Director Clapper's efforts, which are critical to ensuring that policymakers, warfighters, law enforcement, and national security officers receive intelligence products that are timely, relevant, and objective.  Of course, if confirmed, Director Coats will take on the job as the Nation's chief intelligence officer, leading the intelligence community during a very difficult time because unfortunately this President, along with his closest advisers, has repeatedly and unfairly disparaged the professionalism and actions of the Nation's intelligence professionals. These are men and women who maintain the highest standards of professionalism and integrity. They anonymously sacrifice for the country, often in the face of grave personal danger.  As DNI, Senator Coats is committed to defending the values and integrity of the men and women of the intelligence community, even when the White House may not like to hear it.  Another challenge Senator Coats will face on his first day on the job is to effectively support the Senate Intelligence Committee's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election. Last week, I went to CIA headquarters in Langley, along with a number of other Members of the committee, to review the beginnings of the raw intelligence that led the community to conclude that Russia massively interfered in our last Presidential election. Both in public and in private, Senator Coats has promised he will support the committee's investigation to the fullest. We will hold him to that commitment.  On this topic, I want to reiterate on the Senate floor what I have already said numerous times. This investigation is not about being a Democrat or Republican nor about relitigating the 2016 election. The investigation is about upholding the core values and sanctity of democracy that all Americans hold dear. It is also about holding Russia accountable for their improper interference in our elections and arming our allies--one of which has an election today--with information about the means employed by Russia in our elections so they can use that information to protect the integrity of their own electoral process.  We will work to ensure that this critical investigation is done right, done in a bipartisan manner, free of any political interference, and as the chairman and I have both reiterated, that it follows the facts wherever they may lead.  I have every reason to believe Senator Coats will be forthcoming in supporting this investigation. If at any point it becomes clear to me that the Senate Intelligence Committee is unable to keep up these commitments, I am prepared to support another process.  Finally, let me acknowledge two other things.  During Senator Coats' confirmation hearing, he was asked about his role on the National Security Council, including the Principals He assured us that he will be attending these meetings and participating in them despite the confusion created by an Executive order that appeared to disinvite the DNI from these meetings. If he is not included in these meetings, I will expect to know about it and the reason why.  Senator Coats has also committed to me personally and to the committee that he will not support the return of waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation practices, nor will he support reestablishing secret detention sites into the activities of the intelligence community. He reassured the committee that he will follow the law as it now stands and that he will not advocate for changes to the law or recommend a reinterpretation of the law based on any personal beliefs. The law is clear: No interrogation techniques outside the Army Field Manual are allowed.  Finally, Senator Coats has also reassured me and all of the members of the committee that if confirmed, he will always present to the President, to his Cabinet advisers, and to those of us in Congress the unvarnished facts as represented by the best judgments of the intelligence community whether or not that analysis is in agreement with the views of the President, with ours in Congress, or with anyone else's who might receive them.[[Page S1813]]  For these reasons, I support the movement. I was glad to see 88 Members of this body support Dan's movement forward. I believe he will be a great fifth Director of National  I thank my friend the Senator from Texas for giving me time.

210,topic-id,1036,"Mr.President, last week Republicans in the House released a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut Medicaid to the bone. On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office--those are the independent budget experts who analyze policies under consideration here in Congress--estimated that the plan would rip health insurance coverage away from 24 million Americans and cut $880 billion in the Medicaid program. And as a bonus, the plan provides hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the rich. Who comes up with a plan like this? What kind of healthcare bill has, as its central feature, ripping away health insurance from tens of millions of American citizens?  What kind of politician thinks they were sent to Congress to destroy the financial stability of millions of middle-class families and give wealthy donors a tax break that they certainly don't need? Who thinks that the central problem in America is that middle-class families have too much healthcare coverage and that the richest people in America need government to hand them more money? There is no other way to say it: This bill is just part of a Republican plan to help the rich get richer and kick dirt in everyone else's face.  This bill is an economic disaster, and at its center, it is cruel--cancer survivors losing coverage, seniors facing premium increases of $12,000 a year, people with disabilities forced into nursing homes. And one of the cruelest things is what this bill will do to individuals, to families, and to communities struggling with the opioid crisis.  Last year in Massachusetts, nearly 2,000 people died from opioid use. That is more than double the number who died in 2013. That is right, double. Between 2014 and 2015, Massachusetts had a bigger jump in its death rate from drug overdoses than any other State except North  Last week, I was on the front lines in Lynn Community Health Center, where dedicated staffers are trying to meet this opioid epidemic head on. This week, I went to Manet Community Health Center, where a coordinated team in Quincy is battling the opioid crisis. While I was there, I not only met with the professionals, I saw the mamas and the babies, the people who are in recovery, and people who reach out to those who are still in the grip of drugs. The opioid crisis isn't happening to someone else's family or in someone else's community. It is happening to our families in our communities, and we need to do more to stop this plague before it takes another of our loved ones.  We need to do more; what we absolutely cannot do is less. We cannot take away the resources already committed to fighting the opioid crisis so that some millionaire can get a tax break. Current law, the ACA, requires all insurance plans to cover substance use disorder treatment and prevention as an essential health benefit. That means that your insurance company can't turn off the access to treatment just when you need it most by saying: Sorry, we just don't cover that. Current law, the ACA, gave people the chance to get that insurance through health exchanges and subsidies. Millions more people got private insurance. And through Medicaid expansion, millions more were covered by So there it is, our first line of defense in the war on opioid addiction.  The ACA currently means that more people are covered, and that coverage includes substance abuse treatment. What does the Republican plan do? It[[Page S1833]]takes away coverage for 24 million people. That is 24 million people who no longer have any access to substance use disorder treatment and prevention services. And then they want to let insurance companies jack up the out-of-pocket costs for substance abuse programs and mental health programs. In fact, some Medicaid plans would be able to drop this coverage altogether. So millions more people would lose their one lifeline if someone in their family is taken by drugs.  Don't get me wrong. What we are doing right now is not enough. Even now, only 10 percent of those who need treatment for substance use disorder receive it and 90 percent can't get help, but that means we need more, not less help.  Repealing the protections for mental health and substance use disorders in the ACA would yank more than $5 billion in actual funding that is currently going to mental health and treatment services. That is the Republican plan to deal with the opioid crisis. Ask any family trying to get treatment for a loved one who is addicted to drugs. We already have an opioid treatment gap. Gutting the ACA is like shoving a stick of dynamite into the treatment gap and then lighting the fuse. And if the Republicans get their way, people will lose health coverage. People will lose access to recovery services. People will die.  Now is the time to stop this cruel bill in its tracks before it hurts real people. Now is the time to speak out about the importance of the ACA and Medicaid to you and to your family.  If you or someone you know has been touched by the opioid epidemic, you know how much this matters. Maybe you have a sister, a child, a church member, or a high school friend who has struggled with substance use disorder. Maybe you know someone who has fought on the frontlines of this crisis as a healthcare provider, community advocate, as a first responder.  If you do, then you know the stakes in this debate over the ACA and Now is the time to act. Don't wait. If the Republicans end up destroying help for millions of people, don't wake up the next morning and wonder if you could have said more or if you could have raised your voice back when it mattered. No, the Republicans are trying to pass this terrible healthcare bill now, now is the time to speak out. It is time to stand up and to tell Republicans to end their cruel healthcare plan.

1423,topic-id,885,"Madam President, during his campaign, President Trump talked a big game about standing up for workers and creating good, high-paying jobs, but so far, the Republicans haven't voted on a single piece of legislation to create jobs, to grow our economy, or to increase wages for middle-class families--not one single piece, no votes to create jobs, grow the economy, or increase wages for middle-class families--but they have been voting.  Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans voted along party lines, 49 to 48, to make it easier for companies that get big-time, taxpayer-funded government contracts to steal wages from their employees. They also made it easier for those companies to injure their workers without admitting liability. Today, we are voting to make it easier for employers in the most dangerous industries to hide the most serious injuries and illnesses their workers suffer on the job.  This isn't some burdensome new regulation. Large employers in the most dangerous industries have been required to record serious illnesses and injuries their employees suffer on the job since 1972, a few years after the Occupational Health and Safety Act was first passed in 1970.  The rule Republicans are trying to overturn today simply clarifies an employer's obligation to maintain accurate, up-to-date records on workplace illnesses and injuries for 5 years. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration--or OSHA, as most of us call it--at the Labor Department has been enforcing this requirement in every administration since 1972, Democratic and OSHA uses these data to determine how best to prioritize workplace inspections. Since OSHA resources are so scarce, they have only enough money to inspect each workplace once every 140 years. So they kind of pick and choose where to focus these days to make sure they are targeting their inspections at industries and in occupations where workers are at the highest risk of injury. The Department also uses these reports to publish yearly statistics on the workplace hazards that kill 4,800 people and injure another 3 million people--American workers hurt and killed every year.  Data show employers already vastly underreport workplace injuries and illnesses, and without this rule, underreporting will skyrocket. It will get harder for OSHA to hold employers accountable when they cut corners and endanger worker safety.  Today's vote is great news for the Republicans who will rake in campaign contributions from their buddies at the Chamber of It is great news for giant corporations that are lobbying hard against this rule, but it is not great news for hard-working The people did not send us to Washington to work for companies that plump up their profits by skirting safety regulations.  The problem? This is just the beginning. Last week, President Trump proposed cutting the Department of Labor's budget by more than 20 percent. These cuts will take cops off the beat and send a clear signal to employers that they can cut corners on safety with impunity.  President Trump also proposed eliminating a 1970 program at OSHA that gives grants to nonprofits and community organizations that provide free training for workers on how to identify and prevent job hazards that could injure or kill them. These programs work, and now President Trump wants to cut them. That would mean the end of successful worker training programs like the Brazilian Worker Center's program in Allston, MA, that provides residential construction workers with lifesaving fall protection training. It also would cut funding for a Massachusetts Coalition on Occupational Health and Safety program in Dorchester that gives teens working in the retail sector training on how to prevent workplace violence, including sexual assault. Please note how important this is--200,000 young workers are the victims of workplace sexual assault every single year. This is a training program that was so successful that since it has been implemented, it has been replicated now nationwide. Yet the Trump administration wants to defund it.  Just yesterday, the Trump administration finalized a 60-day delay of a rule to protect 60,000 workers who are exposed to lethal, cancer-causing beryllium at work. This regulation saves about 100 lives every single year. Because the beryllium standards haven't been updated in 40 years, tens of thousands of workers are putting their lives at risk every single day. Americans who are exposed to beryllium on the job shouldn't have to wait another 60 days before they can get some protection so their jobs will not cause them lung cancer.  The pattern emerging is pretty clear. Republicans have no plans to improve the lives of American workers. Quite the opposite. Republicans are increasing the odds that workers will be injured or even killed.  When I came to the Senate floor 2 weeks ago to speak out against the repeal of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Act, I said the debate on this vote was about whom Congress works for. Today's debate is no different. The Republicans are working for giant employers that don't want to follow the basic rules to keep their employees safe. This is shameful. This Congress should be working for the Americans who work for a living and just want to be able to do that without putting their lives at risk.  I yield the floor.

First, the underlying bill requires the GAO to conduct a study on succession planning at the That is intended to try to better understand the problem the agency has to have a pipeline of qualified candidates to assume critical roles that are open.  My amendment would require the GAO to study and analyze succession planning and hiring in rural areas. The vast majority of our country is rural, so we have got to put an emphasis on that. The challenges in rural America are different than in the urban areas.  Second, the underlying bill also requires the VA to collect information on[[Page H2163]]hiring effectiveness: the time it takes to fill a vacant position, the attrition rate, the reason staff leaves, investment in training and development, and other barriers to recruitment and training. My amendment would require that study to focus on the rural challenges that are different, significantly, than in the urban areas.  The lack of qualified candidates that the VA can recruit and, ultimately, fill open positions with is a real problem. But we have to recognize that that is even more difficult in rural  In Vermont, we have 50,000 veterans living in the State and only nine VA facilities to help them. These are some of the satellite facilities that are quite small. Our largest facility is White River Junction, the VA Medical Center there that we are very proud of. It provided medical care for over 26,000 of those veterans in 2016. The director there has indicated to me that it is a real struggle to find qualified candidates to fill mission-critical positions.  We had, at that facility, a wonderful neuropsychologist--desperately needed--but that person was married, had children, and due to the inability of her husband to find a job within his field of work, they have left the VA there to go to an urban area. This is one variation of the problem we face--to recruit, to hire, and to retain critical personnel--that needs to be addressed in rural areas.  My amendment will help us better understand the unique challenges rural America faces dealing with the critical staff shortages at our veterans facilities and sets the stage for us to fix the problem.

445,topic-id,1823,"Mr.Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Chairman, I rise today in support of my bill, H.1367, to improve the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain employees.  VA's mission of honoring and serving our Nation's veterans is second to none in the Federal Government, and a high-quality, high-performing workforce is key to VA's ability to successfully execute on that mission.  H.1367 contains a number of provisions that would strengthen VA's ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit employees to fill vacant positions, quickly onboard new hires, and retain high-performing workers across the country. It also contains provisions that would improve leadership and accountability throughout VA and increase the number of veterans in the Federal workforce.  To assist VA in identifying and addressing local staffing deficiencies, this bill would modify the annual determination of staffing shortages to include five clinical occupations and five nonclinical occupations for each VA medical center. Staffing needs can vary significantly from facility to facility, even within the same State, and create a variety of delays, backlogs, and other challenges for veterans.  This provision would allow VA to use this existing reporting tool, which dates back to the 2014 Choice Act, to target a total of 10 occupations at each VA medical center and use VA's existing direct hire authority to expeditiously address shortages for those occupations.  To increase leadership development opportunities for emerging leaders and encourage the dissemination of best practices between and among VA and private sector, the bill would establish an executive management program to allow eligible VA and private sector employees the opportunity to take 1-year fellowship positions in either comparable private sector entities or VA, respectively. This idea was brought to us by a veteran participating in the joint Veterans of Foreign Wars-Student Veterans of America legislative fellowship program and would mirror a successful fellowship model used by the White House and the State  To increase accountability for senior VA decisionmakers, the bill would require annual performance plans for VA political appointees, similar to the annual performance plans that are required for Senior Executive Service employees.                              {time}  1815  Like SES employees, political appointees perform at the very highest levels and play critical roles in setting and achieving high profile policies and priorities. It is only appropriate that they too be held accountable for their performance.  To incentivize the hiring of veterans across the Federal Government, the bill would change the service requirement for reservists and guardsmen to be eligible for veterans' preference from 180 days of consecutive Active-Duty service to 180 days of cumulative Active-Duty service, and expand those considered preference eligible to include all retired servicemembers.  Veterans gain a variety of skills during their time in uniform and are often[[Page H2137]]uniquely suited to Federal employment. In recognition of this, some form of veterans' preference has been in place since the Civil By modernizing this important benefit today, we can bring needed skill sets to the Federal workforce and promote employment opportunities for veterans, a win-win if there ever was one.  To encourage former VA employees who left VA service to gain relevant education or experience and then return to the VA, the bill would allow the VA to noncompetitively reappoint a former employee to a position not more than 1 grade higher than their former position.  I believe we must do everything possible to encourage former employees to come back and work at the VA and reward them for furthering themselves and using their new skills to benefit veterans.  In order to be eligible for reappointment under this authority, the former employee must have voluntarily, within the prior 2 years, maintained a satisfactory performance record while at the VA, and retained any necessary licensures or credentials.  To assist the VA in identifying and prioritizing vacancies, the bill would require the VA to establish a recruiting database listing each vacant position that the VA determines is critical to the VA's mission, is difficult to fill, or both.  Also, the bill would authorize and encourage the VA to track qualified applicants for vacant positions and use the recruiting database and the qualified applicant pool to quickly fill vacancies that have gone unfilled for a prolonged time.  To ensure the VA human resources professionals have a thorough understanding of the VA's unique hiring authorities, the bill would require Veterans Health Administration HR employees to receive regular, ongoing training.  The VA healthcare system benefits from direct hiring authorities for clinical personnel under title 38, United States However, these hiring authorities are unique to the VA and can be complex and difficult for HR employees to understand and work with, which increases the likelihood that those authorities go underused and HR professionals experience burnout.  This provision would support those professionals in their important work while ensuring that veterans benefit as much as possible from the special hiring authorities that Congress has granted the VA in statute.  To encourage highly skilled employees wishing to advance in their career at the VA without taking on a management role, this bill would require the VA to establish a promotional track for technical experts that does not require transition to a managerial position. This is a commonsense provision that would increase the VA's ability to retain employees in highly technical positions who want to remain at the VA and continue moving forward in their careers, but are either uninterested in or ill-suited to becoming a manager.  To increase the understanding of the VA's succession planning efforts, the bill would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on succession planning at each VA medical facility, as well as within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the National Cemetery  Earlier this week, the VA confirmed that 80 percent of current Veterans Integrated Service Network directors and 25 percent of current VA Medical Center directors are eligible to retire. Last year, the VA testified that it can take more than 6 months and multiple reannouncements to fill these important positions in both rural and major metropolitan areas.  Effective succession planning is critical to ensuring stable leadership and to identifying and developing emerging leaders who are ready, willing, and able to step up when existing directors or other managers retire or depart. I look forward to reviewing the results of GAO's work to see what further improvements can be made in this area.  To improve recruitment and retention of younger employees, the bill would require the VA to allow for excepted service appointments leading to conversion to career or career-conditional employment for students and recent graduates.  VA's existing workforce is aging and, as I mentioned just a moment ago, increasingly retirement-eligible. Unfortunately, the VA has historically performed poorly in comparison to other Federal agencies when it comes to hiring younger employees, which could put the VA's future at risk. I am hopeful that this provision will increase the VA's ability to build a pipeline of young talent.  Finally, to increase the VA's understanding of why departing employees choose to leave the VA and, in turn, how the VA could improve in order to retain other employees, this bill would require the VA to develop and deploy a standardized, anonymous exit survey process. The VA has an existing survey process but it is underutilized, with just 30 percent of all clinical employees completing it prior to their departure over the last 5 years, according to a GAO report issued last year.  Factors that contribute to employees voluntarily leaving VA service cannot be addressed unless they are identified, and this provision would help us do that.  In conclusion, Mr.Chairman, the future of the VA, our Nation's second largest bureaucracy, depends on the VA's ability to effectively and efficiently recruit and retain highly qualified and motivated employees in towns and cities across this country. In an increasingly competitive market with an increasingly retirement-eligible workforce, the stakes are simply too high for the VA to continue to struggle to hire the employees it needs.  While more remains to be done to simplify and shorten the VA's hiring process and strengthen the VA's ability to bring the very best professionals onboard to serve our veterans, H.1367 is the first step to ensuring a sufficient VA workforce is available to veterans for generations to come.  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.  Mr.Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

546,topic-id,387,"Mr.Chair, my manager's amendment makes a number of minor technical changes to the reported version of the bill and would significantly reduce discretionary costs while maintaining the overall intent of the bill.  The biggest change that would be made in the manager's amendment is the removal of section 11 of the bill, which would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to track a number of hiring effectiveness metrics.  That section alone scored at $6 million because the Congressional Budget Office expected that the VA would have to hire an additional employee in each Veterans Integrated Service Network in order to gather that information. I disagree with that assertion and I intend to continue working on that provision to, hopefully, include it in future legislation in some form.  In addition, the manager's amendment would authorize but not require the VA to track and match qualified job applicants for vacant positions using the recruiting database that the bill would establish. The CBO estimated that the VA would have to hire up to 40 additional employees with an average compensation of $100,000 per year to accomplish that task, meaning that provision in total would cost $19 million. Again, I disagree with the assertion that such a task could not be accomplished using existing staff.  The Subcommittee on Health, which I am proud to chair, is holding an oversight hearing next week where I intend[[Page H2159]]to ask the VA how the Department would utilize the recruiting database and whether it would entail additional employees. Should it appear that the VA would not use the recruiting database to identify qualified candidates for open positions in a timely manner and to promptly fill prolonged vacancies, I will certainly reconsider mandating that in future legislation.  The manager's amendment would also stipulate that the additional human resources training that the bill would require be done virtually. Finally, it would extend the timeline to implement the executive management fellowship program from 90 days to 1 year, which would provide the VA additional time to set up this important new leadership development program and would extend the GAO reporting deadline from 1 to 2 years, which would provide the GAO additional time to complete their investigation into the VA succession planning.

1443,topic-id,1851,"Mr.President, on the day of the news reporting the World Meteorological Organization is[[Page S1922]]declaring that 2016 was the hottest year ever recorded, and further declaring that the planet is now in what they call, ``truly uncharted territory,'' I rise for my 161st ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, in this case to update my colleagues on the state of our oceans.  I am from the Ocean In January, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report with the U.Geologic Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, researchers at Rutgers University, Columbia University, and the South Florida Water Management  The report updates global sea level rise estimates--perhaps not a big issue for Colorado but a big issue for Rhode It made region-specific assessments for our American coastline. Based on updated peer-reviewed scientific literature, the report raised the previous upper range, or extreme, scenario for average global sea level in the year 2100 by an additional half a meter.  NOAA and its partners then tailored their findings to the U.coastline based on regional variations in ocean circulation and gravitational pull and local land conditions like erosion, subsidence, and groundwater depletion, all of which affect the local impacts of global sea level rise. They found that under the higher scenarios, all regions in the United States, except Alaska, can expect sea level rise higher than the global mean average. The news was particularly harsh for the western Gulf of Mexico and for the northeast Atlantic coast--Virginia through Maine, including my home State of Rhode  Our coastal managers, like Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council--the CRMC, we call them--are taking these new estimates seriously and incorporating the high scenario into their planning. Under the new scenario, the Northeast is expected to see 9 vertical feet of sea level rise by the end of the century. That means that a child born today in Providence, RI, at Women & Infants Hospital is likely to live long enough to see this 9-foot vertical sea level rise take place along our shores.  By the way, when you go up 9 feet, the shore goes back many, many hundreds of feet in many places. In Rhode Island, what CRMC is now planning for is between 9 and 12 vertical feet of sea level rise for our That is going to hit Rhode Island communities pretty hard.  Rhode Island's CRMC and our University of Rhode Island have developed together something called It is an online research tool that projects the effects of this sea level rise and additional storm surge onto the State's coastal properties.  The tool actually now needs to be updated because it currently maxes out at 7 feet of sea level rise, which was the previous high scenario. Now that we have raised it to 9 to 12 feet, they are going to have to go back and redo it.  This is what it looks like based on the 7-foot max. Here is 7 feet of sea level rise in Newport, This is the harbor. This is downtown America's Cup Avenue, which runs right through there, will be taken out. Through this area are a lot of very successful businesses that appeal to the people who come to visit historic Newport,  Through here, we have some of the most significant working wharves still in the Newport area. Then this area here, called The Point, is a historic section that goes back into the 18th and in some cases 17th centuries. These buildings, of course, will be flooded. There is the downtown Newport fire station in the middle of that as well, so it affects our safety infrastructure.  This is further up the bay in Rhode This is Barrington here. This is the town of As you can see in the blue, there are a lot of places where homes and businesses go underwater just under the 7-foot scenario. Some of the stuff that goes underwater is pretty critical.  Here in this bluish part is the Warren wastewater treatment plant. You can't have a wastewater treatment plant that is under water, so that is a very significant investment for Warren to have to face.  I went to the Warren Town Hall not too long ago to meet with the manager and the folks who work there to hear from them about what they needed in order to accommodate this new risk.  Remember that the sea level rise that we are looking at here is just the floor that high tides and storms ride in on. In this simplified illustration, we can see a coastal city with sea level rise encroaching on its infrastructure. Then we add to that the king tides. When celestial bodies line up so the tides are stronger than usual and, therefore, higher than usual, they are called king tides. That is not a scientific term, but it is the lay term for them.  These king tides already push water into the streets of Miami and over the tops of the wharves of Boston on clear, sunny days--just from the tide. If you add on top of that a strong coastal storm, our city here does not stand a chance. Homes are destroyed, businesses are ruined, damages reach the billions, and lives perhaps are lost.  America's coastal communities are not prepared for the future. Part of that is because so many people are denying the prospect of this future, but also we haven't caught up.  Federal Emergency Management Agency flood maps are the things that guide flood insurance for most coastal property owners. FEMA's estimates, however, fall alarmingly short, we have discovered, for coastal communities like those in Rhode Island, as the FEMA studies rely on outdated data and incomplete models. This means that people along America's coast who rely on these models can be lulled into a false sense of comfort if their home falls outside one of FEMA's high risk zones but, in actuality, is in harm's way. So Rhode Island officials are out right now trying to educate everyone living and working along our State's coast about the flooding dangers that are fueled by climate change.  It is not just State officials. Insurance and mortgage companies are starting to take these changes into account. Even the government-backed mortgage giant, Freddie Mac, is girding for broad housing losses from climate-driven flooding. Let me quote them: ``The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually,'' Freddie Mac says on its website, ``but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and great recession.''  Think about that. That is pretty serious business, if you are saying that the housing damage and the consequent financial harm is going to be greater than the housing crisis and great recession that we just lived through.  Some effects of climate change may not even be insurable, Freddie Mac says, and unlike the 2008 housing crash, owners of homes that are literally under water--not just financially under water--would have little expectation of their homes' values ever recovering and, therefore, little incentive to keep making mortgage payments which would, in turn, add to steeper losses for lenders and for insurers. This is deadly serious economic business.  Shoreline counties are just 18 percent of the United States in land area, but they account for around 38 percent of the country's employment and 43 percent of our Each year, the sea and storms will take a higher toll on the roads, the bridges, the seawalls, the power and wastewater treatment plants, and the military facilities that serve that economically productive shore.  Despite all this, President Trump's proposed ``America First'' budget blueprint zeros out the Global Climate Change Initiative, ends U.contributions to international climate change programs, eliminates EPA programs that conduct climate change research and implement the Clean Power Plan, ends NOAA's coastal and marine management, research, and education grants and programs, including the sea grant cooperative research program, shifts NASA's Earth science budget, which includes climate research, out to deep space exploration, and cuts funding for the Department of Energy's Office of  Obviously they don't like science very much.  The President's proposal--if enacted--would accelerate the grim future laid out in NOAA's sea level rise report and in Rhode Island's STORMTOOLS projections. As that grim future accelerates, it is actually science that gives us the headlights to perceive the oncoming threats. Cuts to CRMC of as much as 60 percent would cripple the STORMTOOLS project that provides Rhode Island our headlights.[[Page S1923]]  The laws of thermodynamics will still govern the rise of our warming ocean waters. That is not going away. The laws of chemistry will still cause carbon dioxide to acidify seawater. That will not stop. The laws of biology will still affect vital coastal ecosystems and valuable ocean species and transmit the harms of climate change into those areas.  The laws of economics mean that this will all have a pretty bleak effect on the prosperity of All that it gains is that we will just be blinder to what is coming at us.  If the President were to forgo just one weekend at Mar-a-Lago, which POLITICO and the Washington Post estimate costs U.taxpayers $2 to $3 million each weekend, that money from one weekend could fund Rhode Island's entire sea grant program for a year, helping us guide offshore energy and commercial ocean development, protecting important fishing grounds and the State's vital fishing industry. That is economic effect in Rhode  When the ocean starts lapping on the stairs of Mar-a-Lago, President Trump may be hard-pressed to continue denying what all of our scientific agencies are reporting and predicting. This graphic from the Boston Globe shows at 7 feet of sea level rise what is in store for the President's posh resort. The NOAA high scenario for that area actually projects for Florida's Atlantic coast sea level rise just over 8 feet by the end of the century--though this image understates the flooding that is going to take place at Mar-a-Lago in this century. That just shows 7 feet of sea level rise. An added foot of water not shown, plus that king tide problem I discussed, and storm surge--when you have a good wind kicking up, and it blows the surface of the ocean and raises the tide further--will all amplify these effects. Bye-bye, Mar-a- It is time that we in Congress put fossil fuel interests aside. They have had their way with us quite long enough. It is time for us to start doing what is right by all of the Americans who live and work near the coast and will be facing this predicament in the real world.  If the President and this Congress remain beholden to this shameless, polluting industry, we will lose our chance to protect ourselves. It is time that we wake up to the reality of climate change, wake up to the reality of sea level rise, wake up to the reality of ocean acidification, and start to do something about it.  We can't say we weren't warned. We are just rotten with fossil fuel money and will not listen.  Mr.President, I yield the floor.

1562,topic-id,5284,"Mr.Speaker, I appreciate your agreeing to be down here with me tonight. I came down to talk about health care, but I actually have a personal story I want to tell before that begins, right there in the middle of the realm of health care, a friend of mine back home in His name is Jon  Mr.Speaker, you have folks like Jon Richards in your district, people who just believe that, if only they work hard enough and long enough, they can make things better for their entire community. Jon is one of those folks. And what I love most about Jon is he looks for those things that other folks aren't doing.  You know, there are those folks back home. Everybody wants that glamorous job. Everybody wants to do that thing that comes with the perks or the fringe benefits. Jon Richards was attracted to those jobs that he knew would matter, that he knew needed to get done but other folks weren't filling those shoes.  Mr.Speaker, I tell you this about Jon because Jon was diagnosed with liver cancer; and as is always true when you have a friend get diagnosed with cancer, you believe that they are going to be better. I learned this week that Jon has been moved to hospice and isn't getting better.  Mr.Speaker, Jon was one of the first folks to give me even the time of day when I thought about seeking this opportunity to serve. Jon was the first person there every Saturday morning when breakfast was getting started for the Gwinnett County Republican Party, and he was the last one to leave when the Young Republicans down at the University of Georgia were finishing up.  It was young people that were his passion, Mr.Jon saw a Republican Party that he worried was going to become more closed. He worked to open it up. Jon saw a Republican Party that was getting grayer. He was working with young people who were our future. Jon saw a Republican Party that had an opportunity to make a difference, and he seized that opportunity every single day.  In 2014, Mr.Speaker, the entire State of Georgia, Georgia Republican Party, named Jon Richards the Volunteer of the Truth be told, he would have won that honor every single year, you just can't give it to somebody over and over again. I think Jon appreciated that.  If you go back and try to look for pictures of Jon so you can put a name with a face, Mr.Speaker, you are likely not to see too many. He was also the guy who had the camera around his neck taking pictures of everybody else, making sure that everybody else had something to remember the day by, making sure that everybody else was involved and appreciated, making sure everybody else was served.                              {time}  2115  I have known Jon Richards for a long time. I have never known him to do a single thing to benefit himself. Time and time and time again, he did the things that others wouldn't do. Time and time and time again, he would pull me aside and say: Rob, I know how we can be better together.  There is no replacement for Jon Richards--not in our county, not in our State, not in my life.  Mr.Speaker, I haven't had much experience saying good-bye to folks over the years. I have been extremely blessed in that way. But I hope that you will join me as you say your prayers tonight in praying for my friend in hospice, Jon Richards, and for his family as he enters what will be a very long weekend for him.  Mr.Speaker, Jon would be the first one to be standing outside these doors pushing us forward on healthcare reform, and he would be doing it because he sees the human condition that is affected by health care. He sees the families that have expectations, families to whom promises have been made, families to whom promises have been broken. And he knows that we can do better.  Mr.Speaker, what he and I would often sit and talk about is that there are challenges in this country that absolutely, positively have to be addressed. I have friends on the right, I have friends on the left, and I often believe that if we could just sit down in a room together, we would solve them if we could agree on what the problem was.  Mr.Speaker, I have a chart here. You can't see it from where you sit, but it shows you where America gets its healthcare coverage. I bring this up because that is the crux of the healthcare debate that we are having here. About 46 percent of Americans, Mr.Speaker, get their coverage from their employer. When the President was pushing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, he was talking about the uninsured Americans, and surely we can do more for those families who don't have access to health care. But 46 percent of Americans had access to health care, had it through their employer, were not seeking help or improvement, but in an effort to make a difference for the small percentage of Americans who are uninsured, the President and my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle chose to reregulate all health care across the country.  It wasn't just the lie of the year, as the newspaper PolitiFact called it, Pinocchios--if you like your doctor, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can keep it. It wasn't just that that promise was broken; it is that folks who weren't seeking any help at all got caught up in this net of a new Federal regulatory scheme.  Mr.Speaker, about 46 percent of Americans get their health insurance from their employer. About 17 percent of Americans are on We have got another 17 percent of Americans that are on Medicaid or CHIP or those safety net programs. Even here today, after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 8 percent of Americans are uninsured. Now, we have folks who are in the exchanges--they are represented here--that is about 12.4 percent of the population. We have folks who are on Medicaid represented here; that is about 11.3 percent of the population. And we have folks who don't have any insurance at all.  Mr.Speaker, if we would come together to solve the problem for folks[[Page H2365]]who didn't have access to health care, I believe we could have found a solution together. Instead, what we tried to do was reregulate the entire healthcare system, even for all of the Americans who were perfectly happy with their care. And it didn't work.  You don't have to take my word for it, Mr.I can quote from my big newspaper back home in my district, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: ``Aetna to pull out of Georgia's ObamaCare insurance marketplace.''  Many counties in Georgia now, Mr.Speaker, only have one insurer to choose from. Humana has announced it is pulling out.  Union Leader in New Hampshire: ``Another ACA failure Bad idea keeps getting worse.''  Over in Kaiser Health News in Arkansas: ``Largest U.Health Insurer Pulls Out of Health Exchanges in Georgia, Arkansas.''  From The Washington Post: ``Aetna chief executive says ObamaCare is in a `death spiral.' ''  And from the Courier-Tribune in North Carolina: ``Blue Cross projects $400 million loss in NC on ACA in just two years.''  Mr.Speaker, while we can argue about whether we correctly identified the problem to begin with, while we can argue about whether or not we crafted the right solution to begin with, what is undisputed is that the Affordable Care Act is failing, and it is taking American families down with it. That is not just the newspapers talking, Mr. I will quote from former President Barack In August of last year, he says: ``Despite this progress''--he is talking about the progress of the ACA--``too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles, or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system; and remain uninsured.''  Twenty million Americans remain uninsured. After all of the President's efforts, he still recognized in August of last year there was much more to be done because the efforts that he tried failed.  Governor Mark Dayton, a Democrat from Minnesota, in October of last year, he says: ``The reality is the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. . . . ''  The aspiration was that premiums would come down by $2,500, but the reality is that premiums were going up by double digits, and in some cases triple digits. The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.  And former President Bill Clinton, in October of last year, Mr.Speaker, he said: ``So you've got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. It's the craziest thing in the world.''  There is a group of people, mostly small-business owners and employees, who make just a little too much money to qualify for Medicaid expansion or for the tax incentives who can't get affordable health insurance premiums in a lot of places.  Mr.Speaker, I don't believe health care is a partisan issue. Regulation and how we use it may be a partisan issue. Federal control of whether we should use it may be a partisan issue, but providing Americans access to health care is an American issue, and every one of these Democrats I have just cited recognize the failures of the current system. I don't say that, Mr.Speaker, to try to point the finger of blame. I say it because either we believe that everything is working just great and we should all pack our bags and head back home to the district, or we believe that there are American families in crisis that are calling on us to serve them.  You can't see this map, Mr.Speaker, but it shows some of that crisis. In just 1 year, from 2016 to 2017, Mr.Speaker, the number of counties in America that only have one insurer to choose from quintupled. I will say that again. In just 1 year, from 2016 to 2017, so severe is the death spiral of the exchanges across the country, the number of American counties that no longer have choices and are limited to a single insurer has increased 500 percent.  Mr.Speaker, the number of counties that only have one insurer is represented here in the color of orange. You see it in 2016, you see it in 2017. Five entire States, Mr.Speaker, in a healthcare system that was designed to provide consumers with choices, have no choice of insurer whatsoever. I say that because we have gotten wrapped around the political axle here, Mr.Speaker, as if somehow if you are on the Republican side of the aisle, you cannot recognize that the Affordable Care Act achieved any successes whatsoever, and if you are on the Democratic side of the aisle, you can't recognize that the Affordable Care Act has failed anyone in any way whatsoever. Both of those positions are nonsense.  I tell you that if you have spent a trillion dollars on this program--and you have--I hope a family has been helped. I know some families that have been helped. But I also know families that have been crushed. We need to repeal the Affordable Care Act for those families that have been crushed, and we need to replace the Affordable Care Act for those families that have been helped because that help is rapidly eroding.  Mr.Speaker, I want you to think about the thought, the idea that is the Affordable Care The idea is we are going to provide these choices, and then we are going to provide these government subsidies, and folks are going to have access to health care for the very first time. It is a wonderful idea: provide choice, provide support, provide access. The reality is, though, Mr.Speaker, with those choices, with those subsidies, with that offer of access, almost 20 million Americans said: Forget it, I am out.  Now, you remember this whole plan was put together where the IRS comes and fines you if you are out. So what began as an idea that said, ``We are going to provide you with choice, we are going to provide you with support, and that is going to get you your access,'' 20 million Americans have decided that plan has so failed them, they would rather pay the IRS a penalty to the tune of $4 billion last year--rather, pay the IRS a penalty than access the Affordable Care That is a failure. It is a failure.  Who is it failing most, Mr.Speaker?  If you look at those folks who are in this almost 20 million pool, 45 percent of them are age 35 or younger. I don't fall under the age category of 35 and under, Mr.Speaker, but I can tell you that folks who are 35 and under cost less to take care of than folks who are my age bracket and older. So if you are going to try to craft a national insurance system, you need these people who are 35 and under to be involved--enthusiastically involved. Rather than getting involved with the choices and with the subsidies to get the access, 20 million Americans have said: It is not for me. I will pay the fine instead.  Most of them young people. If we can't agree that that is a failure, Mr.Speaker, if we can't agree that the system can't stand in that way, we are going to have a tough time finding a solution.  What you heard so often today about the solution that is being proposed in this body is that older Americans are getting the toughest end of the deal. There is a little truth to that, Mr. What the Affordable Care Act did is it said you have young, healthy people; you have older people who are likely to be sicker. The law of the land at the time was that the cost spread between the youngest and the oldest could be 500 percent, 5 times more for the oldest, highest risk people than the youngest, lowest risk people.  Sure, it is insurance, right?  Older cars, different pricing than newer cars. Houses with sprinkler systems, different prices than houses without sprinkler systems. It is just actuarial experience.  But the Affordable Care Act says we are going to compress that from one to five, a 500 percent spread, down to one to three, a 300 percent spread. What that did was lower rates below the actuarial experience for older Americans--that was great for older Americans--and, at the same time, raise rates for younger Americans, which forced all the younger Americans out of the marketplace, which then raised rates for all  I will quote from Grace-Marie She is the president of the Galen She testified in front of the Committee on the Budget this year on[[Page H2366]]this issue. She said this, Mr.Speaker: `` . . . young people purchasing individual policies in or out of the exchanges are required to pay much more for their policies than their actuarially-expected costs because of the law's required 3:1 age rating band. Forcing the young to pay more drives costs up for everyone.  ``The average 64-year-old consumes six times as much health care, in dollar value, as the average 21-year-old.''                              {time}  2130  Insurance is about experience. There is a 1 in 100 chance of something bad happening to you, you pay 1 one-hundredth of the price of that bad episode, 100 of you get in the pool together, you share the risk.  Actuarially, a 64-year-old consumes six times more health care than a young person. But we compressed that to three times in terms of the billing.  Turner goes on to say this: ``Under the ACA's age-rating requirements, insurers cannot charge their oldest policyholders more than three times the price they charge their youngest customers.''  If every customer were to remain in the insurance market, this would have the net effect of increasing premiums for 21-year-olds by 75 percent, and reducing them for 64-year-olds by 13 percent. Now, think about this. This is the system that we have created.  If you can get the young people to stay in the system--which you cannot--the young people are paying rates 75 percent higher than they should so that older Americans can pay premiums 13 percent lower than they should. But we are losing all the young people because 77 percent is forcing these folks out. They are not dumb folks. They are making good choices about their own self-interests. If their insurance prices are too high, they reject the insurance.  An individual in my district, Mr.Speaker, from Buford, Georgia, wrote to me and said: Rob, I am a full-time student with a part-time job that doesn't offer health or dental insurance. I can't get health insurance through my parents because they are on I shop for health plans, but most are out of my budget. I shouldn't have to pay a fine if a healthcare plan is not in my budget. There should be alternatives to this plan. Please help.  Say young people don't want insurance. I don't believe that is true. I do think young people believe they are going to live forever and they are never going to get sick. But they do worry about that rainy day, forbid the thought, should something bad happen. But you can't buy a policy you can't afford, and we have priced these young people out of the marketplace.  When we price young people out of the marketplace, rates go up for everybody. When rates go up for everybody, more young people drop out of the marketplace. And that death spiral that Aetna's CEO recognized, grows faster and faster. Which brings us to the solution that we are working on here together.  I don't know what you thought of President Trump when you first met him, Mr.I don't know what you thought of the campaign and how things were going to transpire in these first 60 days of a new administration. But I think a lot of folks in my district imagined the President as a take-it-or-leave-it kind of guy, my-way-or-the-highway kind of guy. I think you would agree with me that nothing could be further from the truth in our experience.  This is what he tweeted out. As you know, that is our new method of communication here in Washington, D.This is what he tweeted out when this House dropped its healthcare bill. He said: ``Our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation. ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster--is imploding fast.''  It is out for review and negotiation. And those weren't just words, Mr.You have seen it. You have seen it going on this week. You have seen it going on even to the eleventh hour. The President has never said: My way or the highway. He has brought people in from every end of the political spectrum to work with them on their ideas, to work to see what we could do more for children, more for the near elderly, more for families, how do we get the incentives in the right place. Day in and day out, 16, 17, 20 hours a day, the President has been working to make this better.  I could not feel better about the process. I don't believe any particular party has a monopoly on good ideas. I don't believe any particular Member has a monopoly on good ideas. I believe we work best when we work collaboratively. And I am so proud of our President for embracing exactly that--the art of a deal.  Mr.Speaker, there are four main parts of our replacement plan, four main parts.  Number one, Medicaid reforms to allow States the freedom to run their own Medicaid programs.  I serve on the Rules Committee with Liz Cheney from I promise you, the rural nature in the low-population area of Wyoming means she needs a very different Medicaid program than the high-density, high-population area of metro Atlanta that I serve.  So often, the State programs dictated by the Federal Government lock States in to a one-size-fits-all solution. Or the States can come begging to Washington, D.C., for an exception or an exemption or a waiver. You shouldn't have to come beg Washington, D.C., to best serve your constituents, Mr.We give folks the flexibility to run these State-based programs to serve the most vulnerable of State populations.  Number two, a patient and State stability fund.  Mr.Speaker, the challenge at any insurance pool is what do you do with the sickest of the individuals in that pool. If I buy insurance today and I am not yet sick, well, now I am in the insurance pool and I am paying for whatever my actuarial risk is. But forbid the thought if somebody has already gotten sick, they have been fighting illness their entire life, they are trying to run their small business, and they show up to buy a new insurance policy, they have struggled mightily throughout my lifetime to get access to coverage.  Now, in 1996, President Bill Clinton and Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, right here on this very floor of the House, passed a bill that abolished preexisting conditions for every federally regulated plan. Those are the plans that the big companies use, like Coca-Cola, Home Depot, or All of those plans, those big employer-based plans, the Federal Government abolished preexisting conditions in those plans decades ago.  But States have moved a little bit slower. And the mechanism that many States are trying to use as high-risk pools to say that when folks find themselves ailing and trying to find insurance for the first time, perhaps they need a different kind of medical home, perhaps they need a different incentivize to get into the insurance pool. These high-risk pools are funded in order to make insurance available, accessible, and affordable for folks who have preexisting conditions and are outside the insurance pool today. We have got to get them on the inside. We provide money to do that.  Personal tax credits, Mr.Refundable, advanceable personal tax credits. What we say in this bill is, you don't have to pick a plan off of an ObamaCare exchange that isn't right for you and your family. You don't have to wait for the government to approve what your choices are. You can pick any plan, anywhere that serves your needs that you believe is best for your family. And if you are a middle-income or low-income American, we will help you defray the cost of that insurance policy.  Now, everybody has got skin in the game. There is no free lunch here, Mr.Everybody has to have skin in the game. We are putting people in charge of their own choices. But if you are a 63-year-old couple and your kids have left the house, we ask: Do you need to buy a policy that covers maternity care? Is it important to you that you have a policy that covers pediatric care? Or, because you are in that older American status, you are in that age bracket where the actuaries say you are likely to consume six times more health care dollarwise than young people do should you be able to pick and choose those benefits so that you get the policy that provides the best value for you and your family. These personal tax credits go to the individual, so the individual can make choices about what is best for them.[[Page H2367]]  And it creates health savings accounts. Oh, Mr.Speaker, I did not understand the economics of health care until I got my first medical savings account. I thought health care costs $50 a visit, because that is what my copay was.  When I got my first medical savings account, my insurer sent me a list. And they said: Rob, if you want to go to the doctor for a CT scan, you can go to this one down the road that charges $200, or you can go to this one down the road that charges $2,000. You just do whatever you think is best.  I went and looked last night, Mr.If you want to go in for a CT scan in Washington, D.C.--we have fabulous hospitals here--you can go to George Washington University right down the street here in Foggy Bottom, and if you have a United plan, the cost is going to be $1,500 for your CT scan. If instead of driving west to George Washington University, you drive north to Howard University, you can go to Howard University hospital and get the same CT scan for $200.  Mr.Speaker, I can't bring down health insurance costs unless I bring down healthcare costs. And I can't bring down healthcare costs unless we have transparency in healthcare pricing so that you and I and 300 million Americans become more active consumers of these products. Health savings accounts give us that opportunity.  But I can't solve all of our healthcare problems in one bill. And shame on this Congress for having created the expectations across a decade of stuffing giant bills through this body at one time, that we have come to set expectations that we can do everything for everybody in a single bill. We can't. And even if we could, we shouldn't. Taking issues one at a time leads to better legislating.  So we have a three-phase approach here, Mr. First, we are going to pass the American Health Care Act, which repeals the Affordable Care Act taxes and penalties, it replaces the mandates with policies that will stabilize markets and increase individual choices. We are going to do that tomorrow morning.  Then comes the administrative action: What can we do through the White House?  You will remember when they passed the Affordable Care Act, they delegated much of that authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Today, that Secretary is my good friend from across the river in Georgia, Tom So the second phase is for Tom Price to grab ahold of those dials that he has at Health and Human Services and make those changes that will encourage choice and lower prices, stabilize markets.  And then third, we are going to come back to this body, back to this floor, back to the United States Senate and pass stand-alone legislation that authorizes association health plans, that promotes competition in insurance, that deals with the IPAB repeal, and on and on. In fact, we have begun that this week, Mr. There are two legislative processes. There is the process where you can pass something in the Senate with 51 votes. That is called reconciliation. And there is the process where you have to deal with the filibuster in the That is for everything else.  Mr.Speaker, right now, we are still getting the rust out of the gears here in this body. There are lots of new Members here. We have got a chance to pass a bill tomorrow morning that can move through the Senate with 51 votes. But then we are going to be back.  Like I say, we have started this week. We have already passed, in a bipartisan way, legislation to increase competition in the insurance market and legislation to allow small businesses to band together so that they can provide better plans at lower costs to their constituents.  Mr.Speaker, there is some suggestion that fixing a failing ObamaCare, an ObamaCare that is in a death spiral, is somehow a partisan issue. Again, as I began, I said there are folks on the Republican side who sometimes say nothing good ever happened in ObamaCare and folks on the Democratic side who sometimes say nothing bad ever happened.  But the truth is, 20 different times, this Republican-controlled House passed bills that President Obama signed into law to fix problems in the Affordable Care Act--20 different times. One of the first bills I voted on when I came to Congress was one of those bills. The President signed it into law.  The Affordable Care Act--I don't need to go through the whole history with you, Mr.You remember. It was jammed through the Senate on Christmas It moved through the House on a Sunday night at midnight with no amendments and no changes. It was not ready for prime time. It needed these fixes. And even with these fixes, the death spiral continues.  But we needn't say to one another that collaborating to solve a failing ObamaCare system is anathema to what anyone believes. We have done it not once, not twice, but 20 times during the Obama Presidency alone.  Mr.Speaker, I will close with this tonight. It is a Kaiser Family Foundation study. They went to folks who have policies in the Affordable Care Act exchange system, and they said: Are you better off today than you were before the passage of the Affordable Care Act?  Again, these are folks who have enrolled in the Affordable Care  What they found is it is about 50/50. It is just this small red and green sliver, Mr.Speaker, of the entire healthcare market in this country, just this small sliver that enrolled in the Affordable Care Again, almost twice as many people rejected the Affordable Care Act, are paying penalties to the IRS, and are staying out of the system as got into the system. But of those people who got into the system, about 80 percent of which are receiving Federal subsidies to stay in the system, only about half said that they are better off today than they were before.  That is $1 trillion that we have spent--borrowed from our children and spent--to reform health care for 300 million Americans even though most Americans valued the plan they had, created a system where more Americans opted out and decided to pay a penalty than agreed to take the free health care that was being offered. And of those who agreed to take the health care, more than half of them believe things were better before.                              {time}  2145  Mr.Speaker, I will stipulate, if it is valuable, that folks who passed the Affordable Care Act before you and I got here were trying to do the best they could to serve their constituency the best they know how, but it didn't work. Insurers are leaving the plan. Families are losing their policies. Premiums are skyrocketing double and even triple digits annually.  We can do better. We can do better, and we have an opportunity to start that process tomorrow. I regret that even the word ``ObamaCare'' has become so toxic that it divides people even upon its mention. But families are being caught in that divide. Families are being caught in the political crossfire as we discuss this.  The President has said: Send me a bill because I want to put a stop to that uncertainty. I want to put a stop to that insecurity. I want to put the American healthcare system back on track.  We can do it together tomorrow.  America needs us to do it together tomorrow, and I hope that we will.  Mr.Speaker, thank you so much for agreeing to be here with me during this time tonight, and thank you for agreeing to keep my friend Jon Richards in your prayers as you lay your head down this evening.

So this morning, given the fact that this legislation would be the top priority of Senator Coats, as he said in the Intelligence Committee, I want the Senate and the country to understand why this issue is so important.

171,topic-id,1332,"I thank my colleague.  Now, as we consider the nomination of Senator Coats, and recognize that his top priority, by his admission, would be the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--particularly section 702--I want to begin this discussion by saying that it is because the intelligence community has stonewalled Democrats and Republicans in both this body and in the other body for 6 years on the information that we need to do good oversight that I have come to the floor to outline what I think the central issue is all about.  I am going to begin my remarks by way of saying that, at a time when Americans are demanding policies that give them more security and more liberty, increasingly, we are seeing policies come from both this body and the other body that provide less of both.  A good example would be weakening strong encryption. Weakening strong encryption is bad from a security standpoint, and it is bad from a liberty standpoint. When government creates policies that give the American people less of both--less security and less liberty--obviously, the American people are not going to react well.  My view is that when the government--particularly intelligence agencies--don't level with the American people about large-scale surveillance of law-abiding Americans, our people are justifiably angry. When the government tries to keep this information secret--as I have pointed out on this floor before--in America, the truth always comes out. Leveling with the American people is the only way for agencies to have the credibility and the legitimacy to effectively do their jobs. They have critically important jobs in keeping our people safe from threats.  Now, with respect to Senator Coats, at his confirmation hearing, since he said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be his top priority, I asked our former colleague how many Americans--innocent, law-abiding Americans--have actually been swept up in the surveillance program known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Under section 702, the government conducts warrantless surveillance of foreigners who are reasonably believed to be overseas. It does this work by compelling telecommunications companies and internet service providers to provide the content, phone calls, and emails, and other individual communications.  Now, there are several different ways this happens, and I will get to that in the course of these remarks. What we are talking about--what I want people to understand--is that this goes to the content of communications. This is not about metadata collection. Congress, as the Senate knows, reformed that in the USA FREEDOM This is surveillance without any warrants, and once the FISA Court signs off on the overall program, the details are up to the government.  Now, this was not always the case. For decades, individual warrants were required when the government needed the assistance of the country's telecommunications firms. Then the Bush administration created a secret, but legal, warrantless wiretapping program.  After the program was revealed, the government then went to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court to get approval. But when the government ran into some trouble with the court, the Bush administration argued that the Congress should create the current program. It was first passed in 2007 under the name Protect America That became the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act of 2008.  Now, fortunately, the Congress included a sunset provision, which is why it was up for reauthorization in 2012, and that is why it is up for reauthorization this year. This year it is Senator Coats' top priority, if confirmed. Whoever is the head of the intelligence community will be the point person for this legislation.  I want it understood that the reason that I am going through this background is that I believe the American people deserve a fully informed debate about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization. You cannot have that debate--you cannot ensure that the American people have security and liberty--unless you know the impact of section 702 of that bill on the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.[[Page S1815]]  So for 6 years, in this body, Democrats and Republicans--and in the other body, Democrats and Republicans--have been asking the same question: How many law-abiding Americans are having their communications swept up in all of this collection? Without even an estimate of this number, I don't think it is possible to judge what section 702 means for the core liberties of law-abiding Without this information, the Congress can't make an informed decision about whether to reauthorize section 702 or what kind of reforms might be necessary to ensure the protection of the individual liberties of innocent  At Senator Coats' nomination hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, I asked Senator Coats whether he would commit to providing Congress and the public with this information. I will say, because of my respect for Senator Coats and our longtime cooperation on issues like tax reform and a variety of others, I hoped that Senator Coats would be the one--after 6 years of struggling to get this information--to make a commitment to deliver it to the Senate Intelligence Committee before work on the reauthorization began. Instead, Senator Coats said: ``I will do everything I can to work with Admiral Rogers at the NSA to get you that number.''  If confirmed, I hope that happens. But after asking for the number of law-abiding Americans who get swept up in these searches for years, and getting stonewalled by the executive branch, hoping to get the information we need to do real oversight is just not good enough.  The problem--the lack of information on the impact of this law on the privacy of Americans--goes all the way back to the origins of the authority. In December of 2007, the Bush administration, in its statement of administration policy on the FISA Amendments Act, stated that it would likely be impossible to count the number of people located in the United States as communications were reviewed by the government. In April of 2011, our former colleague Senator Mark Udall and I then asked the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, for an estimate. In July of that year, the Director wrote back and said: ``It is not reasonably possible to identify the number of people located in the United States whose communications may have been reviewed under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.''  He suggested reviewing the classified number of disseminated intelligence reports containing a reference to a U.person, but that is very different than the number of Americans whose communications have been collected in the first place. And that is what this is all about: How many law-abiding Americans--innocent, law-abiding Americans--are getting swept up in these searches? It will be an increasingly important issue as the nature of telecommunications companies continues to change, because it is now a field that is globally interconnected. We don't have telecommunications systems just stopping at national borders. So getting the number of Americans whose communications have been collected in the first place is the prerequisite to doing real oversight on this law and doing our job, at a time when it is being reauthorized and the American people want both security and liberty and understand that the two are not mutually exclusive.  So Director Clapper then suggested reviewing the classified number of targets that were later determined to be located in the United But the question has never been about the targets of 702, although the mistaken targeting of Americans and the people in our country is another serious question. The question that Democrats and Republicans have been asking is about how many Americans are being swept up by a program that, according to the law, is supposed to only target foreigners overseas.  So let me repeat that. That is what the law says. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act says that the targets are supposed to be foreigners overseas, and Democrats and Republicans want to know how many law-abiding Americans, who might reside in Alaska or Oregon or anywhere else, are getting swept up in these searches.

1121,topic-id,409,"Mr.President, today I wish to congratulate the National Historic Oregon Trail Interpretive Center in Baker, OR, on its 25th anniversary and to recognize the cultural and historical importance of this special place. Twenty-five years ago, volunteers, philanthropists, and community leaders came together with the Bureau of Land Management to make this dream a reality, and today I want to honor them for their dedication to their community and the State of Oregon.[[Page S1889]]  Since 1992, the Interpretive Center has brought to life the story of the Oregon Through life-size displays, historical artifacts, and live performances by historical interpreters, visitors to the center are transported back in time to the first days of Baker What started as a small goldmining town grew through the years as more emigrants arrived. These pioneers had fought through challenging conditions and traveled thousands of miles to reach Oregon, but had they not persevered, the growth of this State could never have taken place. We owe it to those who blazed the trail before us to listen to their story, and we owe it to ourselves to take their lessons of perseverance, innovation, and community spirit to heart.  It is no coincidence that the community that came together to make the Interpretive Center possible, shares the characteristics of their ancestors. In the 1970s, Baker City was struggling to keep up with a changing economy. It took the innovative vision of modern-day pioneers, who recognized the cultural importance of this place, to bring its rich history back to life. Joining forces with the Bureau of Land Management, community leaders worked together to create the Interpretive Center and jumpstarted Baker City's growing tourism industry.  Over 25 years, this community has continued to contribute to the sustained success of the Interpretive From the hard-working caretakers of the center's 4 miles of interpretive trails, to the philanthropy of individuals like the late Leo Adler who help sustain the center financially, the people of Baker City demonstrate every day the same spirit as the pioneers they honor. In this way, the story of the Interpretive Center mirrors the very story it tells.  It stands today as a living testament to the value of learning from our past. Therefore, I wish today to not only celebrate this milestone, but to encourage us all to reflect on the example set by both the pioneers of the Oregon Trail and those who continue to blaze new trails for their communities every day.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-03-21-pt1-PgS1888-3.txt,1247,DISAPPROVING A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR,2017.0,21.0,March
1617,topic-id,1603,"Mr.President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to commend my colleague from Massachusetts for an excellent presentation. He has really outlined A to Z with respect to what this issue is all about. I commend him, and I also commend the ranking member of the committee, Senator Nelson, our colleague from Florida, for his excellent job.  Before he leaves the floor, picking up on the remarks of our colleague from Massachusetts, I am particularly struck by the fact that I have always thought that it is a classic conservative principle to empower the individual--to empower the individual to make fundamental choices about what would be important to them and their family and their wallets and all of the activities that are central to the life of a working class family.  What we have been touching on--very eloquently by my colleague from Massachusetts--is we are going to be voting in a little bit to strip rights from individuals, to retreat from that classic conservative principle of empowering individuals and families to make decisions.  I think, for all of the reasons that my colleague from Massachusetts has talked about and that Senator Nelson has been talking about, this idea of stripping from individuals the right to make these fundamental decisions and allowing the gatekeepers of the internet to collect, share, and profit from personal information of consumers without their consent is an extraordinary mistake for our country at this time.  I serve on the Senate Select Committee on I think, for many people, these issues have, in effect, converged with respect to privacy policy as it relates to the private marketplace, which is what this ill-advised proposal that we are going to vote on today is all about.  We are constantly offered up ideas that suggest that you really are faced with what amounts to a flawed set of choices. In the intelligence area, we are consistently told: Well, you just have to give up a little bit of liberty to have security. And the reality is that liberty and security are not mutually exclusive. Smart policies give us both. They give us security and liberty. Unfortunately, around here, we are coming up with policies, like weakening strong encryption, that are reducing both--reducing security and reducing liberty. I think what we are dealing with here on this ill-advised resolution in the Senate, with respect to the FCC rule, is yet another set of false choices--that you can either have internet access or privacy. They are not mutually exclusive. Just as we can have security and liberty, we can have internet access and privacy for all of the reasons that my friend from Massachusetts has been outlining.  Now, the FCC acted on the responsibility given to them by the Congress to protect browsing history--arguably the most intimate, personal information imaginable. Browsing history makes what the Senate did in the past with metadata look like small potatoes. Browsing history is really a picture into your personal life. I have appreciated the support of my colleagues for making sure that in the intelligence field, without court oversight, you couldn't get access to people's browsing history.  The Congress, in effect, told the Federal Communications Commission to protect browsing history, favorite applications, and even locations of American broadband users, and the FCC acted on it. Before that time, there were no rules in place outlining how an internet service provider--those are the ISPs that we always hear Senators talking about--may use, share, or even sell their customers' private information. So, just as the FCC has done for wireline phone customers, the FCC said it was going to keep up with the evolution of telecommunications networks by ensuring privacy protections would apply to broadband internet use. This struck a lot of us as just common sense. Again, building on the conservative principle of empowering the individual, the judgment was that by creating what are called ``opt-in'' consent agreements, where the consumer makes an affirmative decision about what they want--it is not what government wants, it is not what big companies want, it is what the consumer wants. The judgment was that by creating this opt-in consent agreement, the consumer would get a clear understanding of what the broadband provider knows about them from, for example, their computer or from their smartphone.[[Page S1949]]  The big internet service providers are in a unique position to see where information flows over the networks and can see more of Americans' data than probably anybody else in what we might call the internet ecosystem. The websites we visit, what we look for, what time we are online--all of this, even our location--would be considered highly personal and highly sensitive information.  The responsibility of the internet service provider is to protect consumer privacy. It is compounded by the fact that the majority of broadband consumers have only one option for fast internet service to their home. There is only one company offering them service. So it seems to me what we are talking about--what Senator Markey has outlined--really looks like bad news for folks in rural areas where they are only going to have one provider, and, frankly, I think in a lot of metropolitan areas, particularly where there are modest-income individuals.  Without these protections in place, most consumers are left with the choice of giving up their browsing history for an internet service provider to sell to the highest bidder or to have no internet at all. So think about what that means for, say, an older person.  By the way, under what is being considered in the other body on healthcare, people between 50 and 64 aren't going to have a lot of extra money laying around. Those are people who are going to get clobbered--clobbered--by the healthcare bill that is being considered in the House today.  What is being considered in the House today--talking about the wallets of people between 50 and 64--would allow the insurance companies to charge people who are pre-Medicare five times as much as younger people. So they are already going to be paying thousands of dollars more out-of-pocket. Now, given what may happen in this body, we would have consumers left with the choice of giving up their browsing history for an internet service provider to sell to the highest bidder or have no internet at all. So we are socking it to them in terms of their healthcare premiums, and then we are socking it to them in terms of essential communications as well.  I just think this is unacceptable and certainly contrary to the whole notion of classic conservatism, empowering the individual. And it is certainly taking away these rights from folks in rural America--most of my towns in Oregon have populations of under 10,000 people. This proposal that is being discussed here is going to strip consumers of basic rights that are practically a requirement for economic success in the 21st century.  I am going to close by picking up on another point that I think Senator Markey said very well, and I believe I heard Senator Nelson, our ranking member, touch on as well. It looks to me like a subject that should not be in controversy: basic transparency and accountability for the individual, and individual empowerment. It shouldn't be controversial. It shouldn't be a contentious matter. My colleague and I served in the other body for a number of years, and we built coalitions of people all across the political spectrum around the principles we are advocating today. Providing transparency and empowering the individual shouldn't be a contentious issue.  Under these regulations, internet service providers can still collect and use their subscribers' information. The rules simply ensure that internet service providers receive consent--receive permission from an empowered consumer--that it is OK to reuse or sell their information, and the companies would provide the consumers an explanation of how their data is collected and where it is shared. These rules are about transparency, plain and simple. Customers, especially those, as I have indicated, who are captive to one internet service provider, deserve to know how their internet service provider is using their data.  The broadband privacy rules are not some kind of attack on monetizing consumer data, but simply a recognition of the importance of consumer consent.  I will close by saying that more and more in this area, the American people are getting presented false choices. They are being told, as I see on the Intelligence Committee, that you have to give up some of your liberty to have your security. Those are false choices. They are not mutually exclusive. Everyone in America, everyone paying attention to this debate ought to know that they have a right to both. Don't ever, ever let a politician tell you that you have to give up some of your liberty to have your security. You have a right to vote, and it is our job, colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to come up with policies that do both.  Today, we ought to make sure that people aren't presented with another false choice--that to have Internet access you have to give up your privacy rights. You can have both, and the Federal Communications Commission has sought to come up with a sensible policy to do that.  So I join my colleagues, particularly my friend from Massachusetts, who knows so much about this field, and our terrific ranking minority member, Senator Nelson, in urging colleagues to oppose a harmful resolution that, in my view, turns class conservatism on its head and strips consumers of their rights in a truly ill-advised manner.

895,topic-id,640,"Mr.Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.  The one question I think many Americans who follow this debate would be asking now is: What is the rush? What is the rush?  For 7 years now, our Republican colleagues have consistently said we are going to repeal the Affordable Care More than 60 votes have been taken in this body to repeal the Affordable Care We kept asking: If you are going to repeal it, what are you going to replace it with? You can't just say, do away with it, and leave millions and millions of Americans in the lurch.  So finally, 2 weeks ago yesterday, we have gotten their answer. TrumpCare, RyanCare, the American Health Care Act, call it what you will, we finally got an answer.  What has happened since those 2 weeks? We had no hearings on this bill. We had quick markups. They lasted a long time, but we had--the bill was introduced Monday night--markups in the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee on And this was on just a steamroller to try to get this accomplished before anybody knew what was in it.  Now, the CBO report from last week came out indicating things that I think most Americans would be frightened by. 24 million Americans lose their coverage over 10 years; but, more significantly than that, 21 million lose their coverage within 3 years; 14 million next year.  Consider that. All of the gains in coverage made under the Affordable Care Act done away with in 3 years. Premiums going up for  I can't believe Speaker Ryan tried to put lipstick on a pig. He said he thought the CBO report was really encouraging because, 10 years from now, premiums would be 10 percent lower. The only way they are 10 percent lower is because, under the TrumpCare, older Americans, 50 and older, in the individual market get priced out of the market with huge premium increases.[[Page H2256]]So they are gone. Only younger and healthier people are in there. Yes, premiums would be lower for them. Other people are out of business.  So that report comes out, causing a great deal of consternation on the part of the sponsors and supporters. They bring it, schedule it to come to the floor on Thursday, March 23, because they think that is cute because that is the seventh anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care But, again, no hearings, no real analysis; and what is more important, no CBO revised report on the changes that were introduced late last night.  This is outrageous. And I love to hear my Republican colleagues try to portray the process under which the Affordable Care Act was drafted and considered with some kind of nighttime secretive deal. They weren't here, most of them. I was.  I was on the Ways and Means Committee, one of the drafting committees. Fourteen months we worked on that legislation--14 months. Seventy-nine hearings in the Congress on that legislation. Hours and hours and hours of markups on that legislation. Cost estimates throughout the process. I can't imagine a more exhaustive and public process than we went through for the Affordable Care  And here, 2 weeks from introduction to proposed passage, we have no real public discussion of a piece of legislation that directly affects the lives and probably, unfortunately, the deaths of many, many  So, Mr.Speaker, we don't need to rush to judgment.

We are actually going through regular order, allowing the committees of jurisdiction to do their work in public, and have the text for all to see and debate.
