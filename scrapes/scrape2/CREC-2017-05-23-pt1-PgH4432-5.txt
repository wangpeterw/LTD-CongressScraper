                   HONORING THE LIFE OF YODELL BILLAH

  (Mr. O'HALLERAN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to 
Yodell Billah, who passed away earlier this month at the age of 97. Mr. 
Billah was a Navajo code talker and World War II Army veteran, fighting 
against the Germans in Italy until their surrender in 1945. His heroic 
actions and the work of our code talkers saved the lives of innumerable 
soldiers and civilians.
  For his service, he was awarded the American Defense Service Medal, 
American Campaign Medal, and the European African Middle East Campaign 
Medal.
  We can never repay the debts that we owe Mr. Billah, code talkers 
from all our Tribal Nations, and our veterans, but I am proud and 
humbled to stand before you today to bring attention to his service and 
honor his legacy.
  Mr. Billah will forever be remembered as an active member of his 
community, a loving father, a grandfather, and, above all, a hero.
