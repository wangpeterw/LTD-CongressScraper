     concurrent resolution for a bill or joint resolution, or 
     amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that 
     commercializes the operations of the air traffic control 
     system if such measure reduces the discretionary spending 
     limits in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
     Deficit Control Act of 1985 by the amount that would

     and directors whose fiduciary duty is to the entity; and
       (5) becomes the employer of those employees directly 
     connected to providing air traffic control services and who 
     the Secretary transfers from the Federal Government.

                       TITLE V--POLICY STATEMENTS

     SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON OBAMACARE REPEAL.

       It is the policy of this resolution that the Patient 
     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), and 
     the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 
     (Public Law 111-152) should be repealed.

     SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPLACING OBAMACARE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Obamacare put Washington's priorities before those of 
     patients'. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has failed to reduce 
     health care premiums as promised. Instead, the law mandated 
     benefits and coverage levels, denying patients the 
     opportunity to choose the type of coverage that best suits 
     their health needs and driving up health coverage costs. A 
     typical family's health care premiums were supposed to 
     decline by $2,500; instead, average premiums have increased 
     105 percent. A study conducted by the nonpartisan 
     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated premiums to 
     continue rising over the next decade, projecting an average 
     increase of 8 percent per year between 2016 and 2018, and 
     increasing by nearly 60 percent by 2026.
       (2) President Obama pledged, ``If you like your health care 
     plan, you can keep your health care plan.'' Instead, CBO now 
     estimated 7 million Americans will lose employment-based 
     health coverage due to the health care law, further limiting 
     patient choice.
       (3) Then-Speaker of the House Pelosi stated that the 
     President's health care law

[[Page H7854]]

     would create 4 million jobs over the life of the law and 
     almost 400,000 jobs immediately. Instead, CBO estimated that 
     by 2025 Obamacare will reduce the number of hours worked by 
     approximately 2 million full-time equivalent workers, 
     compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the 
     law. Additionally, a study by the Mercatus Center at George 
     Mason University estimated that Obamacare will reduce 
     employment by up to 3 percent, or about 4 million full-time 
     equivalent workers.
       (4) Since the ACA was signed into law, the Obama 
     administration repeatedly failed to implement it as written. 
     President Obama's unilateral actions resulted in numerous 
     changes, delays, and exemptions. President Obama signed into 
     law another 24 changes made by Congress. The Supreme Court 
     struck down the forced expansion of Medicaid; ruled the 
     individual ``mandate'' could only be characterized as a tax 
     to remain constitutional; and rejected the requirement that 
     closely held companies provide health insurance to their 
     employees even if it violates the companies' religious 
     beliefs. More than 7 years after enactment, the courts 
     continue to evaluate the legality of how President Obama's 
     administration implemented the law. All of these changes 
     prove the folly of the underlying law; health care in the 
     United States cannot be run from a centralized bureaucracy.
       (5) Obamacare is unaffordable, intrusive, overreaching, 
     destructive, and unworkable. Its complex structure of 
     subsidies, mandates, and penalties perversely impact 
     individuals, married couples, and families. Those who 
     previously had insurance along with those who did not have 
     been funneled into a new system that is providing less access 
     to doctors and treatments. Millions of Americans have been 
     added to a broken Medicaid system that is incapable of 
     providing the care promised. Cuts made to Medicare to fund a 
     new entitlement are undermining the health security of 
     seniors. Taxes and mandates are distorting the insurance 
     market and harming the broader economy, resulting in fewer 
     jobs and less opportunity. By design, Obamacare put 
     Washington at the center of our health care system, at the 
     expense of patients, families, physicians, and businesses. 
     The ACA should be fully repealed, allowing for real patient-
     centered health care reform that puts patients first, not 
     Washington.
       (b) Policy on Replacing Obamacare.--It is the policy of 
     this resolution that Obamacare must not only be repealed, but 
     also replaced by enacting the American Health Care Reform 
     Act.

     SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
     their health security.
       (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
     that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed 
     soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of 
     Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in 
     or near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the 
     Medicare Trustees Report--
       (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 
     2028 and unable to pay scheduled benefits;
       (B) Medicare enrollment is expected to increase by over 50 
     percent in the next two decades, as 10,000 baby boomers reach 
     retirement age each day;
       (C) current workers' payroll contributions pay for current 
     beneficiaries; and
       (D) most Medicare beneficiaries receive about three dollars 
     in Medicare benefits for every one dollar paid into the 
     program.
       (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
     American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
     generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending 
     levels that cannot be sustained.
       (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this 
     resolution to protect those in or near retirement from any 
     disruptions to their Medicare benefits due to the program's 
     impending bankruptcy, and instead offer beneficiaries more 
     options, better care, with reduced costs for both 
     benficiaries and the Federal Government, by modernizing 
     Medicare.
       (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the 
     Medicare program such that:
       (1) Medicare is preserved for current and future 
     beneficiaries.
       (2) Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support 
     payment and a selection of guaranteed health coverage options 
     from which recipients can choose a plan that best suits their 
     needs.
       (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as 
     an option.
       (4) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-
     income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.
       (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
     Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.
       (6) The Medicare eligibility age is gradually increased to 
     keep pace with increases in longevity.
       (7) Medicare is simplified by combining parts A and B and 
     reforms to Medigap plans are implemented.

     SEC. 504. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICAID STATE FLEXIBILITY 
                   BLOCK GRANTS.

       It is the policy of this resolution that Medicaid and the 
     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) should be block 
     granted to the States in a manner prescribed by the State 
     Health Flexibility Act.

     SEC. 505. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with 
     disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since 
     enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the 
     ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes 
     employer provided benefits as well as personal savings.
       (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly 
     recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
     challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the 
     financial condition of Social Security becomes more 
     precarious and the threat to seniors and those receiving 
     Social Security disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
       (A) In 2022, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be 
     exhausted and program revenues will be unable to pay 
     scheduled benefits.
       (B) In 2034, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and 
     Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program 
     revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
       (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2034, 
     benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent across the board, 
     devastating those currently in or near retirement and those 
     who rely on Social Security the most.
       (3) The Disability Insurance program provides an income 
     safety net for those with disabilities and their families. 
     However, the program is in serious financial trouble. The 
     number of beneficiaries has skyrocketed from 2.7 million in 
     1970 to 10.6 million in 2016. At the same time, the labor 
     force participation rate has now fallen to the lowest levels 
     since the 1970s. As a result, the Social Security Actuary now 
     projects that the Disability Insurance Trust Fund will be 
     depleted in 2023.
       (4) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on 
     the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face 
     benefit cuts of up to 11 percent in 2023, devastating 
     individuals who need assistance the most.
       (5) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, 
     and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It 
     is critical that action be taken to address the looming 
     insolvency of Social Security.
       (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this 
     resolution that Congress should work to make Social Security 
     sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes these reforms 
     will include the following policies, based upon the Social 
     Security Reform Act:
       (1) Adoption of a more accurate measure for calculating 
     cost of living adjustments.
       (2) Adoption of adjustments to the full retirement age to 
     reflect longevity.
       (3) Makes Social Security benefits more progressive over 
     the long term, providing those most in need with a safety net 
     in retirement.
       (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of 
     this resolution that Congress and the President should enact 
     legislation on a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability 
     Insurance program prior to its insolvency in 2016 and should 
     not raid the Social Security retirement system without 
     reforms to the Disability Insurance system. This resolutions 
     assumes that reforms to the Disability Insurance program will 
     include--
       (1) encouraging work;
       (2) updates of the eligibility rules;
       (3) reducing fraud and abuse;
       (4) enactment of H.R. 2031, the Social Security Disability 
     Insurance and Unemployment Benefits Double Dip Elimination 
     Act, to prohibit individuals from drawing benefits from both 
     programs at the same time; and
       (5) enactment of H.R. 1540, the Social Security Disability 
     Insurance Return to Work Act, to allow the award of time-
     limited benefits for applicants whose medical recovery is 
     anticipated in order to create new opportunities for 
     beneficiaries.

     SEC. 506. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEANS-TESTED WELFARE PROGRAMS.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds that:
       (1) Too many people are trapped at the bottom rungs of the 
     economic ladder, and every citizen should have the 
     opportunity to rise, escape from poverty, and achieve their 
     own potential.
       (2) In 1996, President Bill Clinton and congressional 
     Republicans enacted reforms that have moved families off of 
     Federal programs and enabled them to provide for themselves.
       (3) Today, there are approximately 92 Federal programs on 
     which Government at the Federal and State level spend more 
     than $1 trillion annually that provide benefits specifically 
     to poor and low-income Americans.
       (4) It should be the goal of welfare programs to encourage 
     work and put people on a path to self-reliance.
       (b) Policy on Means-tested Welfare Programs.--It is the 
     policy of this resolution that--
       (1) the welfare system should be reformed to give states 
     flexibility to implement and improve safety net programs and 
     that to be eligible for benefits, able bodied adults without 
     dependents should be required to work or be preparing for 
     work, including enrolling in educational or job training 
     programs, contributing community service, or participating in 
     a supervised job search; and
       (2) the President's budget should disclose, in a clear and 
     transparent manner, the aggregate amount of Federal welfare 
     expenditures, as well as an estimate of State and local 
     spending for this purpose, over the next ten years.

     SEC. 507. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORM OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL 
                   NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

       (a) SNAP.--It is the policy of the resolution that the 
     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program be reformed so 
     that:
       (1) Nutrition assistance funds should be distributed to the 
     states as a block grant with funding subject to the annual 
     discretionary appropriations process.
       (2) Funds from the grant must be used by the states to 
     establish and maintain a work activation program for able-
     bodied adults without dependents.
       (3) It is the goal of this proposal to move those in need 
     off of the assistance rolls and back into the workforce and 
     towards self-sufficiency.
       (b) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes that, pending the 
     enactment of reforms described in (a), the conversion of the 
     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program into a flexible 
     State allotment tailored to meet each State's needs.

     SEC. 508. POLICY STATEMENT ON WORK REQUIREMENTS.

       It is the policy of this resolution that all means-tested 
     welfare programs should include work activation requirements 
     for able-bodied adults.

     SEC. 509. POLICY STATEMENT ON A CARBON TAX.

       It is the policy of this resolution that a carbon tax would 
     be detrimental to American families and businesses, and is 
     not in the best interest of the United States.

     SEC. 510. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB 
                   CREATION.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Across the Nation, too many Americans are struggling to 
     make ends meet. The slowly falling unemployment rate has 
     masked an underlying crisis as millions of Americans have 
     abandoned the work force and wages have stagnated. The labor 
     force participation rate has plummeted to levels not seen 
     since the Carter presidency.
       (2) Looking ahead, CBO expects the economy to grow by an 
     average of just 1.9 percent over the next 10 years. That 
     level of economic growth is simply unacceptable and 
     insufficient to expand opportunities and the incomes of 
     millions of middle-income Americans.
       (3) Sluggish economic growth has also contributed to the 
     country's fiscal woes. Subpar growth means that revenue 
     levels are lower than they would otherwise be while 
     government spending (e.g. welfare and income-support 
     programs) is higher.
       (4) The unsustainable fiscal trajectory has cast a shadow 
     on the country's economic outlook. investors and businesses 
     make decisions on a forward-looking basis. they know that 
     today's large debt levels are simply tomorrow's tax hikes, 
     interest rate increases, or inflation and they act 
     accordingly. This debt overhang, and the uncertainty it 
     generates, can weigh on growth, investment, and job creation.
       (5) Nearly all economists, including those at the CBO, 
     conclude that reducing budget deficits (thereby bending the 
     curve on debt levels) is a net positive for economic growth 
     over time.
       (6) If the Government remains on the current fiscal path, 
     future generations will face ever-higher debt service costs, 
     a decline in national savings, and a ``crowding out'' of 
     private investment. This dynamic will eventually lead to a 
     decline in economic output and a diminution in our country's 
     standard of living.
       (7) The key economic challenge is determining how to expand 
     the economic pie, not how best to divide up and re-distribute 
     a shrinking pie.
       (8) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels 
     and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if 
     annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher 
     over the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $273 
     billion.
       (9) This budget resolution therefore embraces pro-growth 
     policies, such as fundamental tax reform, that will help 
     foster a stronger economy, greater opportunities and more job 
     creation.
       (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--It is the 
     policy of this resolution to promote faster economic growth 
     and job creation. By putting the budget on a sustainable 
     path, this resolution ends the debt-fueled uncertainty 
     holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax code will put 
     American businesses and workers in a better position to 
     compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This 
     resolution targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that 
     stack the deck in favor of special interests. All of the 
     reforms in this resolution serve as means to the larger end 
     of helping the economy grow and expanding opportunity for all 
     Americans.

     SEC. 511. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) A reformed tax code should be simple, fair, and promote 
     (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States tax 
     code fails on all 3 counts: it is complex, unfair, and 
     inefficient. The tax code's complexity distorts decisions to 
     work, save, and invest, which leads to slower economic 
     growth, lower wages, and less job creation.
       (2) High marginal tax rates lessen the incentives to work, 
     save, and invest, which reduces economic output and job 
     creation.
       (3) The United States corporate income tax rate is the 
     highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax rates this high 
     suppress wages, discourage investment and job creation, 
     distort business activity, and put American businesses at a 
     competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors.
       (4) The ``world-wide'' structure of United States 
     international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United 
     States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive 
     disadvantage with competitors that have more competitive 
     international tax systems.
       (5) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through 
     lower wages, consumers in higher prices, and investors in 
     diminished returns.
       (6) Closing tax loopholes to finance higher spending does 
     not constitute fundamental tax reform.
       (7) Tax reform should curb or eliminate loopholes and use 
     those savings to lower tax rates across the board, not to 
     fund more wasteful Government spending. Washington has a 
     spending problem, not a revenue problem.
       (8) Many economists believe that fundamental tax reform, 
     including a broader tax base and lower tax rates, would lead 
     to greater labor supply and increased investment, which would 
     have a positive impact on total national output.
       (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this 
     resolution that Congress should enact legislation that 
     provides for a comprehensive reform of the United States tax 
     code to promote economic growth, create American jobs, 
     increase wages, and benefit American consumers, investors, 
     and workers through fundamental tax reform that is revenue-
     neutral on a dynamic basis that provides for the following:
       (1) Targets revenue neutrality based on a dynamic score 
     that takes into account the macroeconomic effects of reform.
       (2) Collapses the current seven brackets for individuals 
     into just three, with a top rate of no more than 33 percent.
       (3) Simplifies the tax code to ensure that fewer Americans 
     will be required to itemize deductions.
       (4) Gives equal tax treatment to individual and employer 
     healthcare expenditures modeled on the American Health Care 
     Reform Act.
       (5) Encourages charitable giving.
       (6) Repeals the Death Tax.
       (7) Eliminates marriage penalties.
       (8) Provides tax-free universal savings accounts to reward 
     saving.
       (9) Repeals the alternative minimum tax.
       (10) Reduces double taxation by lowering the top corporate 
     rate to no more than 20 percent.
       (11) Reduces the rate for capital gains and dividends.
       (12) Encourages net investment, savings, and 
     entrepreneurial activity, including full expensing.
       (13) Moves to a competitive territorial system of 
     international taxation.
       (14) Ends distortionary special interest giveaways, such as 
     the Wind Production Tax Credit.

     SEC. 512. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to 
     the United States economy and beneficial to American workers 
     and consumers.
       (2) The United States can increase economic opportunities 
     for American workers and businesses through the elimination 
     of foreign trade barriers to United States goods and 
     services.
       (3) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a 
     level playing field, they can excel and surpass international 
     competition.
       (b) Policy on Trade.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
     resolution--
       (1) to pursue international trade, global commerce, and a 
     modern and competitive tax system to promote domestic job 
     creation;
       (2) that the United States should continue to seek 
     increased economic opportunities for American workers and 
     businesses through high-standard trade agreements that 
     satisfy negotiating objectives, including--
       (A) the expansion of trade opportunities;
       (B) adherence to trade agreements and rules by the United 
     States and its trading partners, and
       (C) the elimination of foreign trade barriers to United 
     States goods and services by opening new markets and 
     enforcing United States rights; and
       (3) that any trade agreement entered into on behalf of the 
     United States should reflect the negotiating objectives and 
     adhere to the provisions requiring improved consultation with 
     Congress.

     SEC. 513. POLICY STATEMENT ON ENERGY PRODUCTION.

       It is the policy of this resolution that the Arctic 
     National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and currently unavailable 
     areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) should be open for 
     energy exploration and production.

     SEC. 514. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY BUDGETING 
                   AND REFORM.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Excessive Federal regulation--
       (A) has hurt job creation, investment, wages, competition, 
     and economic growth, slowing the Nation's recovery from the 
     economic recession and harming American households;
       (B) operates as a regressive tax on poor and lower-income 
     households;

[[Page H7856]]

       (C) displaces workers into long-term unemployment or lower-
     paying jobs;
       (D) adversely affects small businesses, the primary source 
     of new jobs; and
       (E) impedes economic growth.
       (2) Federal agencies routinely fail to identify and 
     eliminate, minimize, or mitigate excess regulatory costs 
     through post-implementation assessments of their regulations.
       (3) The United States Code of Federal Regulations now 
     contains over 185,000 pages of regulations in 242 volumes.
       (4) Notwithstanding the size and growth of Federal 
     regulations, Congress lacks an effective mechanism to manage 
     the level of new Federal regulatory costs imposed each year. 
     Other nations, meanwhile, have successfully implemented the 
     use of regulatory budgeting to control excess regulation and 
     regulatory costs.
       (5) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act has resulted 
     in more than 177.9 million annual hours of regulatory 
     compliance paperwork, $37.1 billion of regulatory compliance 
     costs on the private sector, and $13 billion in regulatory 
     compliance costs on the States.
       (6) Agencies impose costly regulations without relying on 
     sound science through the use of judicial consent decrees and 
     settlement agreements and the abuse of interim compliance 
     costs imposed on regulated entities that bring legal 
     challenges against newly promulgated regulations.
       (b) Policy on Federal Regulatory Budgeting and Reform.--It 
     is the policy of this concurrent resolution that the House 
     should, in consultation with the public, consider legislation 
     that--
       (1) promotes--
       (A) economic growth, job creation, higher wages, and 
     increased investment by eliminating unnecessary red tape and 
     streamlining, simplifying and lowering the costs of Federal 
     regulations; and
       (B) the adoption of least-cost regulatory alternatives to 
     meet the objectives of Federal regulatory statutes;
       (2) protects--
       (A) the poor and lower-income households from the 
     regressive effects of excessive regulation; and
       (B) workers against the unnecessary elimination of jobs and 
     loss or reduction of wages;
       (3) requires--
       (A) an annual, congressional regulatory budget that 
     establishes annual costs of regulations and allocates these 
     costs amongst Federal regulatory agencies;
       (B) cost-benefit and regulatory impact analysis for new 
     regulations proposed and promulgated by all Federal 
     regulatory agencies;
       (C) advance notice of proposed rulemaking and makes 
     evidentiary hearings available for critical disputed issues 
     in the development of new major regulations; and
       (D) congressional approval of all new major regulations 
     before the regulations can become effective, ensuring that 
     Congress can better prevent the imposition of unsound costly 
     new regulations;
       (4) reduces--
       (A) regulatory barriers to entry into markets and other 
     regulatory impediments to competition and innovation; and
       (B) the imposition of new Federal regulation that 
     duplicates, overlaps or conflicts with State, local, and 
     Tribal regulation or that impose unfunded mandates on State, 
     local, and Tribal governments; and
       (5) eliminates the abuse of guidance to evade legal 
     requirements applicable to the development and promulgation 
     of new regulations.

     SEC. 515. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL FUNDING OF ABORTION.

       It is the policy of this resolution that no taxpayer 
     dollars shall go to any entity that provides abortion 
     services.

     SEC. 516. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRANSPORTATION REFORM.

       It is the policy of this resolution that State and local 
     officials are in a much better position to understand the 
     needs of local commuters, not bureaucrats in Washington. 
     Federal funding for transportation should be phased down and 
     limited to core Federal duties, including the interstate 
     highway system, transportation infrastructure on Federal 
     land, responding to emergencies, and research. As the level 
     of Federal responsibility for transportation is reduced, 
     Congress should also concurrently reduce the Federal gas tax.

     SEC. 517. POLICY STATEMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
                   AFFAIRS.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) For years, there has been serious concern regarding the 
     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) bureaucratic 
     mismanagement and continuous failure to provide veterans 
     timely access to health care.
       (2) In 2015, for the first time, VA health care was added 
     to Government Accountability Office's (GAO) ``high-risk'' 
     list, due to mismanagement and oversight failures, which have 
     resulted in untimely and inefficient health care. According 
     to GAO, ``the absence of care and delays in providing care 
     have harmed veterans.''.
       (3) The VA's failure to provide timely and accessible 
     health care to our veterans is unacceptable. While Congress 
     has done its part for more than a decade by providing 
     sufficient funding for the VA, the administration has 
     mismanaged these resources, resulting in proven adverse 
     effects on veterans and their families.
       (b) Policy on the Department of Veterans Affairs.--It is 
     the policy of this concurrent resolution that--
       (1) the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs continue its 
     oversight efforts to ensure the VA reassesses its core 
     mission, including--
       (A) reducing the number of bureaucratic layers;
       (B) reducing the number of senior and middle managers;
       (C) improving performance measure metrics;
       (D) strengthening the administration and oversight of 
     contractors; and
       (E) supporting opportunities for veterans to pursue other 
     viable options for their health care needs; and
       (2) the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the 
     Committee on the Budget should continue to closely monitor 
     the VA's progress to ensure VA resources are sufficient and 
     efficiently provided to veterans.

     SEC. 518. POLICY STATEMENT ON REDUCING UNNECESSARY, WASTEFUL, 
                   AND UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required 
     by law to identify examples of waste, duplication, and 
     overlap in Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of 
     such examples.
       (2) In its report to Congress on Government Efficiency and 
     Effectiveness, the Comptroller General has stated that 
     addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in 
     Federal programs could ``lead to tens of billions of dollars 
     of additional savings.''
       (3) In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, the 
     GAO issued reports showing excessive duplication and 
     redundancy in Federal programs.
       (4) Federal agencies reported an estimated $137 billion in 
     improper payments in fiscal year 2015.
       (5) Under clause 2 of rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
     Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least 
     one hearing during each 120-day period following its 
     establishment on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in 
     Government programs.
       (6) Clause 2(a)(1) of rule XXI of the House of 
     Representatives prohibits an appropriation for an expenditure 
     not previously authorized by law. Despite this longstanding 
     prohibition, more than $310 billion has been appropriated for 
     unauthorized programs in fiscal year 2016, spanning 256 
     separate laws.
       (7) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of 
     Federal Government programs should result in programmatic 
     changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding 
     levels.
       (b) Policy on Reducing Unnecessary, Wasteful, and 
     Unauthorized Spending.--
       (1) Each authorizing committee annually should include in 
     its Views and Estimates letter required under section 301(d) 
     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 recommendations to 
     the Committee on the Budget of programs within the 
     jurisdiction of such committee whose funding should be 
     reduced or eliminated.
       (2) Committees of jurisdiction should review all 
     unauthorized programs funded through annual appropriations to 
     determine if the programs are operating efficiently and 
     effectively.
       (3) Committees should reauthorize those programs that in 
     the committees' judgment should continue to receive funding.
       (4) For those programs not reauthorized by committees, the 
     House of Representatives should enforce the limitations on 
     funding such unauthorized programs in the House rules.

     SEC. 519. POLICY STATEMENT ON A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Government will collect approximately $3.4 trillion 
     in taxes, but spend nearly $4 trillion to maintain its 
     operations, borrowing 14 cents of every Federal dollar spent.
       (2) As of March 16, 2017, the national debt of the Unites 
     States was nearly $20 trillion.
       (3) A majority of States have petitioned the Government to 
     hold a constitutional convention to adopt a balanced budget 
     amendment to the Constitution.
       (4) Forty nine States have fiscal limitations in their 
     State constitutions, including the requirement to annually 
     balance the budget.
       (5) Five States, including Arizona, Georgia, Alaska, 
     Mississippi, and North Dakota, have agreed to the Compact for 
     a Balanced Budget, which is seeking to amend the Constitution 
     to require a balanced budget through an Article V convention 
     by April 12, 2021.
       (b) Policy on a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment.--
     It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress 
     should propose a balanced budget constitutional amendment for 
     ratification by the States.

     SEC. 520. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
                   CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office 
     of Management and Budget, Federal agencies held $921 billion 
     in unobligated balances at the end of fiscal year 2017.
       (2) These funds comprise both discretionary appropriations 
     and authorizations of mandatory spending that remain 
     available for expenditure.

[[Page H7857]]

       (3) In many cases, agencies are provided appropriations 
     that remain indefinitely available for obligation.
       (4) The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires the 
     Office of Management and Budget to make funds available to 
     agencies for obligation and prohibits the administration from 
     withholding or cancelling unobligated funds unless approved 
     by an Act of Congress.
       (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
     Unobligated Balances.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
     resolution that--
       (1) greater congressional oversight is required to review 
     and identify potential savings from canceling unobligated 
     balances of funds that are no longer needed;
       (2) the appropriate committees in the House should identify 
     and review accounts with unobligated balances and rescind 
     such balances that would not impede or disrupt the 
     fulfillment of important Federal commitments;
       (3) the House, with the assistance of the Government 
     Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and 
     appropriate agencies, should continue to review unobligated 
     balances and identify savings for deficit reduction; and
       (4) unobligated balances in dormant accounts should not be 
     used to finance increases in spending.

     SEC. 521. POLICY STATEMENT ON REFORMING THE CONGRESSIONAL 
                   BUDGET PROCESS.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
     Control Act of 1974 was the first step toward restoring 
     constitutionally endowed legislative responsibility over 
     fundamental budget decision making.
       (2) However, the congressional budget process has neither 
     constrained spending nor inhibited the expansion of 
     Government. The growth of the Government, primarily through a 
     multiplicity of mandatory programs and other forms of direct 
     spending, has largely been financed through borrowing and 
     high tax rates.
       (3) The enforcement of the current budget process, 
     including congressional points of order and statutory 
     spending limits, have been too often waived or circumvented. 
     This contributes to a lack of accountability, which has led 
     to broad agreement that reforming the system is a high 
     necessity.
       (b) Policy on Reforming the Congressional Budget Process.--
     It is the policy of this concurrent resolution that Congress 
     should--
       (1) restructure the fundamental procedures of budget 
     decision making;
       (2) reassert congressional power over spending and revenue, 
     restore the balance of power between Congress and the 
     President as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 intended, 
     and attain the maximum level of accountability for budget 
     decisions through efficient and rigorous enforcement of 
     budget rules;
       (3) improve incentives for lawmakers to budget as intended 
     by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, especially by 
     adopting an annual budget resolution;
       (4) encourage more effective control over spending, 
     especially currently uncontrolled direct spending;
       (5) revise the methodology used in developing the baseline, 
     which is intended to reflect an objective projection of the 
     budgetary effects of current laws and policies for future 
     fiscal years, by removing any tendency toward assuming higher 
     spending levels;
       (6) promote efficient and timely budget actions to ensure 
     lawmakers complete their budget actions before the start of 
     the new fiscal year;
       (7) provide access to the best analysis of economic 
     conditions available and increase awareness of how fiscal 
     policy directly impacts economic growth and job creation; and
       (8) eliminate the complexity of the budget process and the 
     biases that favor higher spending.
       (c) Legislation.--The Committee on the Budget of the House 
     should draft legislation during the 115th Congress that 
     rewrites the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 
     of 1974 to fulfill the goals of making the congressional 
     budget process more effective in ensuring taxpayers' dollars 
     are spent wisely and efficiently. Such legislation shall--
       (1) attain greater simplicity without sacrificing the rigor 
     required to address--
       (A) the complex issues of the domestic and world economy;
       (B) national security responsibilities; and
       (C) the appropriate roles of rulemaking and statutory 
     enforcement mechanisms;
       (2) establish a new structure that assures the 
     congressional role in the budget process is applied 
     consistently without reliance on reactive legislating;
       (3) improve the elements of the current budget process that 
     have fulfilled the original purposes of the Congressional 
     Budget Act of 1974; and
       (4) rebuild the foundation of the budget process to provide 
     a solid basis from which additional reforms may be developed.

     SEC. 522. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL ACCOUNTING.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Current accounting methods fail to capture and present 
     in a compelling manner the full scope of the Government and 
     its fiscal situation.
       (2) Most fiscal analyses produced by the Congressional 
     Budget Office (CBO) are conducted over a 10-year time 
     horizon. The use of generational accounting or a longer time 
     horizon would provide a more complete picture of the 
     Government's fiscal situation.
       (3) The Federal budget currently accounts for most programs 
     on a cash accounting basis, which records revenue and 
     expenses when cash is actually paid or received. However, it 
     accounts for loan and loan guarantee programs on an accrual 
     basis, which records revenue when earned and expenses when 
     incurred.
       (4) The Government Accountability Office has advised that 
     accrual accounting may provide a more accurate estimate of 
     the Government's liabilities than cash accounting for some 
     programs, specifically insurance programs.
       (5) Accrual accounting under the Federal Credit Reform Act 
     of 1990 (FCRA) understates the risk and thus the true cost of 
     some Federal programs, including loans and loan guarantees.
       (6) Fair value accounting better reflects the risk 
     associated with Federal loan and loan guarantee programs by 
     using a market based discount rate. CBO, for example, uses 
     fair value accounting to measure the cost of Fannie Mae and 
     Freddie Mac.
       (7) In comparing fair value accounting to FCRA, CBO has 
     concluded that ``adopting a fair-value approach would provide 
     a more comprehensive way to measure the costs of Federal 
     credit programs and would permit more level comparisons 
     between those costs and the costs of other forms of Federal 
     assistance''.
       (8) This concurrent resolution directs CBO to estimate the 
     costs of credit programs on a fair value basis to fully 
     capture the risk associated with Federal credit programs.
       (b) Policy on Federal Accounting Methodologies.--It is the 
     policy of this concurrent resolution that the House should, 
     in consultation with CBO and other appropriate stakeholders, 
     reform government-wide budget and accounting practices so 
     Members and the public can better understand the fiscal 
     situation of the United States and the options best suited to 
     improving it.

     SEC. 523. POLICY STATEMENT ON AGENCY FEES AND SPENDING.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) A number of Federal agencies and organizations have 
     permanent authority to collect fees and other offsetting 
     collections and to spend these collected funds.
       (2) The total amount of offsetting fees and offsetting 
     collections is estimated by the Office of Management and 
     Budget to be $513 billion in fiscal year 2017.
       (3) Agency budget justifications are, in some cases, not 
     fully transparent about the amount of program activity funded 
     through offsetting collections or fees. This lack of 
     transparency prevents effective and accountable government.
       (b) Policy on Agency Fees and Spending.--It is the policy 
     of this resolution that Congress must reassert its 
     constitutional prerogative to control spending and conduct 
     oversight. To do so, Congress should enact legislation 
     requiring programs that are funded through fees, offsetting 
     receipts, or offsetting collections to be allocated new 
     budget authority annually. Such allocation may arise from--
       (1) legislation originating from the authorizing committee 
     of jurisdiction for the agency or program; or
       (2) fee and account specific allocations included in annual

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. McClintock) and a Member opposed each will control 
15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3\1/2\ minutes.
  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to present the Republican Study 
Committee's 2018 budget, Securing America's Future Economy.
  This proposal combines savings that have been proposed by the 
Congressional Budget Office, many RSC members, and public policy think 
tanks, including The Heritage Foundation, Citizens Against Government 
Waste, and the National Taxpayers Union. It is based on a simple 
principle that government should spend its money as carefully as 
families spend what they have left after they have paid their taxes.
  By restraining the growth of spending and refocusing resources on 
core government responsibilities, adopting commonsense reforms, and 
placing Medicare and Social Security back on sound financial footing, 
we believe there is still time to save this country from financial and 
economic ruin. But time is running out.
  On our current course, the Congressional Budget Office warns that, 
within 4 years, our deficits will balloon to $1 trillion annually, 
adding about $8,000 a year to an average family's debt that they will 
have to pay off in future taxes. Two years after that, interest on

[[Page H7858]]

the national debt will reach $654 billion. That is more than we 
currently spend for the entire defense establishment.
  Let me repeat that so it sinks in. Six years from now, we will spend 
more than our current defense budget accomplishing nothing but renting 
the money that we have already borrowed and spent. Three years later, 
Medicare will collapse. Six years after that--if we get that far--
Social Security runs out of money.
  This approaching crisis can be described with just three numbers: 26, 
35, and 49. Once you understand those three numbers--26, 35, and 49--
you can plainly see the root of our problems.
  Twenty-six percent is the combined population and inflation growth 
over the past 10 years. Thirty-five percent is the growth in Federal 
revenues. Clearly, this is not a revenue problem. The problem is that 
third number. Forty-nine percent is the growth in spending--nearly 
twice the rate of inflation and population combined.
  We are about to hear about the draconian cuts from the opposition. 
Let me emphasize, the RSC budget continues to grow the Federal 
Government every year. I repeat, the RSC budget spends more every year.
  Over the decade, we have provided for more than $1 trillion of 
government growth. Only in Washington can that be described as a cut. 
The RSC budget merely restrains the growth of spending over the next 
decade to give families the time and room to catch up.

                              {time}  0915

  By doing so, we can arrest the ruinous spiral of debt and interest 
costs that now threaten the very solvency of our Nation.
  This budget gores a lot of sacred cows, because we want to point out 
the wide range of savings available to achieve. But I would ask the 
opponents of this budget to consider one thing as we race toward the 
looming fiscal crisis just 4 years down the road: you cannot provide 
for the common defense or general welfare or do all of the other things 
our government is called upon to do if you cannot pay for them. Our 
mountainous debt, driven by out-of-control spending, now threatens our 
ability to do so.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized for 15 
minutes.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I am going to cut to the chase: the Republican Study 
Committee budget is so extreme, it cannot be taken seriously. It cuts 
spending by $10 trillion over 10 years, which is $4 trillion more than 
the already irresponsible spending cuts in Chairman Black's budget.
  To its credit, the RSC tells us where those cuts will come from, 
rather than leaving large amounts unspecified or using matching 
asterisks or phony economic assumptions to reduce spending.
  The RSC budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It cuts 
programs that ensure basic living standards, protect the environment, 
and help families afford college.
  For 2018, the RSC budget matches the President's level for defense, 
including war funding. But for nondefense discretionary spending, the 
RSC budget provides $394 billion, which is $122 billion, or 24 percent, 
below the austerity cap.
  There is no way this House or any House would approve an 
appropriations bill that inflicted a 24 percent cut on all government 
operations. If just two programs--veterans' programs and NIH funding--
were excluded from those cuts, everything else would be cut by more 
than 55 percent.
  So yes, this budget claims to reach balance, but it would achieve it 
by making cuts that would be catastrophic. Not even Congress is that 
self-destructive.
  I contend that the two Republican budgets actually show how 
dismissing the notion that revenues must be a part of any solution to 
restrain deficits and debt, compounded with the flawed notion that 
balance must be achieved in the short term, will inflict intolerable 
hardship on the American people.
  While totally unintentional, they make a pretty compelling case that 
for Congress to responsibly address our debts and deficits, while 
funding the Federal programs and investments that the American people 
want and expect, raising revenues has to be part of the equation.
  One of the things that amuses me, in a very kind of dark way, is that 
I remember so well, in 2010, when Republicans actually rode to victory 
in the House by claiming that we Democrats were going to cut $750 
billion out of Medicare. That wasn't true, but they claimed it.
  Now, in this Republican Study Committee budget, they have doubled 
down on that. It is not exactly double, but they are going to cut it by 
$898 billion. I don't think America's seniors and the disabled 
population would feel very good about that.
  I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing that important issue 
to the debate.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. Walker), the chairman of the Republican Study 
Committee.
  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, $20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more 
than $20.2 trillion.
  Let's put it this way: each American's share of the national debt is 
$62,000. From the retiree in North Carolina who has already done so 
much to serve the country, to the newborn child in New York with so 
much potential, that is $62,000. In fact, it is more than the median 
American family brings home in an entire year.
  Our debt continues to mount, even as Federal reserves reach record 
highs. This leads to an undeniable conclusion, even from Captain 
Obvious: the Federal Government has a spending problem.
  The growing Federal Government has significant negative consequences 
for the country and its people. The large Federal debt reduces 
investment, productivity, and wages, while Federal interventions in the 
economy reduce the incentive to work, resulting in a shrinking labor 
market.
  The debt can have dangerous implications for our national security, 
recently causing a bipartisan group of leading national security 
officials to write that ``our long-term debt is the single greatest 
threat to our national security.''
  Most fundamentally, when the Federal Government is too big and too 
intrusive, it interferes with our unalienable rights to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness.
  Eleven months ago, the American people voted to give Republicans 
unified control of government. Now it is time to follow through and 
implement the policy agenda that Congress and the President were 
elected on.
  As the calendar moves into fall, the grade of the 115th Congress will 
be delivered on whether we can reform our inefficient Tax Code. This 
process starts with the budget. Along with repealing ObamaCare and 
securing our border, the Republican Study Committee budget allows us to 
fulfill these promises, and more.
  This fiscal year 2018 RSC budget ensures a strong national security, 
robust economic growth, equal opportunity for all, a sustainable social 
safety net, and a return to constitutionally limited government, all 
with a goal of securing America's future economy.
  Instead of a future of high debt and low growth, the RSC budget 
proposes a positive blueprint for success and opportunity. Our budget 
focuses on progrowth, profamily policies that will boost America's 
economy and provide a strong fiscal foundation for generations to come.
  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would like to thank my friend, Mr. 
McClintock, for his leadership of the RSC budget task force, as well as 
all the members of the Republican Study Committee who participated in 
this effort.
  With this budget, we have accomplished our goals of detailing the 
variety of bold policy solutions, as well as helping to influence the 
balanced budget offered by my friend, Chairman Black, to include 
meaningful, enforceable, reconciliation targets, as the RSC budget 
does, so that we can begin the essential task of implementing these 
policies into law.
  My fellow Members, when will our debt matter? Next year? The year 
after?

[[Page H7859]]

  In 6 years, we are projected to spend more than $650 billion on 
interest alone on our debt.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from North Carolina.
  Mr. WALKER. What will it take for our friends on the left to stop 
hijacking the American Dream for our children and grandchildren? Is it 
not a moral injustice to leave this level of debt to the next 
generation?
  Mr. Chairman, we have been making this argument in the House for 
years. Today, it is time to make a difference.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, it is fascinating to have this debate and speaking in 
such high-principled ways about the need to reduce deficits and debt. I 
don't think any Democrat would argue that we need to do something to 
reduce deficits and debt. We face a very dire, long-term fiscal future.
  But we also lose sight of the fact that the American people expect 
something from their government. They expect our government to keep 
them safe, but they also expect their government to protect their 
drinking water, protect their air, to make sure that the food they eat 
is not dangerous, to provide law enforcement and help local law 
enforcement to do many things.
  The budget, as well as Chairman Black's committee budget, would 
decimate all of those services that the American people expect from the 
Federal Government.
  I think only about what is going on right now with Houston, Florida, 
Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and the enormous cost that the 
Federal Government is going to have to bear to help restore those 
communities and those territories to some degree of normalcy. That is 
what they expect the American Government to do. These budgets would 
make that all but impossible.
  So we look at it both ways. Later, we will propose a Democratic 
alternative that actually makes those kind of investments and makes 
sure that the notion of American security is not just a huge military, 
but is a foundation of investment in human capital and research and 
infrastructure that will allow this economy to grow. We do it with 
keeping debt at the same percentage of the economy, as it is now, 
because we are willing to raise revenues.
  On the other hand, Republican budgets, both the Republican Study 
Committee budget and the chairman's budget, anticipate enormous tax 
cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations--tax cuts that have 
been proven to do exactly the opposite of what many on the other side 
claim they do, which is to stimulate economic growth.
  We will hear claims that, yes, we can cut taxes by $2 trillion or $3 
trillion over 10 years, and they are going to be paid for by this 
renewal of economic activity. But history tells us that is not what 
happens. Not only history tells us that, but virtually all the 
economists in the country tell us that, too.
  Goldman Sachs, Steve Mnuchin's previous employer, says that the tax 
cuts outlined last week would maybe create an additional 0.2 percent of 
growth in the economy.
  CBO and the Federal Reserve say tax cuts don't pay for themselves. 
Even Bruce Bartlett, the author of ``Reaganomics,'' says this whole 
notion that tax cuts pay for themselves is nonsense. He actually said 
bull, which is half of what he said, but you get the idea.
  This is not easy. We can speak in the darkest terms of how we are 
imposing this debt on our grandchildren and try to use emotional 
arguments. But the fact is, we are dealing with a very realistic, 
pragmatic dilemma, and that is: how to do what the American people 
expect us to do without making the future impossible.
  It is not done by the Republican budgets. We think it is helped along 
by the Democratic alternative, and we look forward to having that 
debate just a little bit later this morning.
  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend from Kentucky that Ronald 
Reagan reduced the Federal income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28 
percent, and income tax revenues doubled.
  He is correct that we expect things from our government. We have seen 
a 49 percent increase in spending in the last decade. Have we seen a 49 
percent increase in the quality of education or a 49 percent increase 
in our infrastructure or our defense capability?
  What we have seen is a 49 percent increase in bureaucracy and 
government.
  I would remind the gentleman that when we squander the people's 
money, we rob them of the means to meet the disasters and unforeseen 
circumstances that confront our country.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Flores), my friend and former chairman of the Republican Study 
Committee.
  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
  Mr. Chairman, I want to go off script for a little bit and echo the 
comments the gentleman was making.
  He talked about the Reagan tax cuts and what they did to stimulate 
the economy and to grow tax revenues and to allow hardworking American 
families to keep more of their paychecks.
  I would also go on to remind the gentleman from Kentucky, to disabuse 
him about his views of tax reform, and remind him that President John 
F. Kennedy, a Democrat, reduced the top marginal rates from 93 percent 
to 73 percent. The economy grew, more jobs were created, and more 
revenue was created for the Federal Government.
  Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government doesn't have a revenue problem. 
It has a spending problem. That is what we tackle with the Republican 
Study Committee budget.
  I thank Mr. McClintock for his incredible and insightful leadership 
in generating the FY 2018 RSC budget that we are now considering.
  The House Budget Committee's budget proposals continue to benefit 
from the framework of the RSC budget by including meaningful, 
enforceable reconciliation targets, as our budget does. The House 
budget will begin the essential task of implementing these policies 
into law.
  Other instances where the RSC-led budget proposals have historically 
wound up being adopted in the larger House budget include the 
following:
  First, balancing the budget within a 10-year budget window.
  Two, including policies to ensure the solvency of entitlement 
programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and also Medicaid.
  Number three, providing the necessary funding and resources for a 
robust national security.
  Number four, fully repealing ObamaCare.
  Number five, establishing a pathway to progrowth tax reform that will 
jump-start our economy and help hardworking American families take home 
more of their paychecks.
  I was humbled to serve as the chairman of the RSC during the 114th 
Congress. At that time, we generated a new budget for fiscal year 2017, 
called the Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0. It was written and 
released in the spring of 2016.
  Like the current RSC budget, it provided a robust agenda of 
conservative policies to show the American people our vision for this 
Nation.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Texas.
  Mr. FLORES. In the tradition of The Heritage Foundation's 1980 
mandate for leadership that provided a policy agenda for the incoming 
Reagan administration, our Blueprint for a Balanced Budget 2.0 for the 
new President and his administration set forth an agenda for governing 
in 2017.

                              {time}  0930

  By all accounts, the RSC budget has proven successful in achieving 
this goal, with President Trump basing many of the policies for his 
fiscal 2018 budget request on the RSC's fiscal 2017 budget.
  I am pleased to see that many RSC-led proposals are included in both 
the President's budget and the House budget that we will consider later 
today.
  In the coming years, I look forward to continuing to see the RSC 
putting forth and leading on many conservative, sound policy ideas for 
our budgetary process.

[[Page H7860]]

  Mr. Chairman, I urge all our colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RSC 
budget and to vote ``yes'' on the House GOP budget.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I feel like I have to be Paul Harvey for a 
second and talk about the rest of the story.
  Because while what Mr. McClintock said was true about the initial 
phases of the Reagan administration, at the end of the Reagan 
administration, the national debt had almost tripled, and he had been 
forced to raise taxes a couple of times in the interim.
  So, again, we can argue about how positive cutting taxes were in the 
Reagan administration, but the end result wasn't particularly good for 
the American economy.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, who wins in the Republican budget?
  Same old same old; millionaires, billionaires, large corporations. 
The Republican budget paves the way for their plan, which gives 80 
percent of its tax cuts to the top 1 percent of Americans, while 30 
percent of middle class households making between $50,000 and $150,000 
a year would actually see a tax increase. This is according to the 
nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
  It slashes $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid, even worse than 
TrumpCare, and it ends the guarantee of Medicare benefits for American 
seniors.
  It attacks women's health by defunding, of course, Planned 
Parenthood, once again. It slashes SNAP--SNAP, the Food Stamp program--
by $154 billion, taking nutrition assistance away from up to 7 million 
households.
  Did you really come to Congress to take food out of the mouths of 
hungry children?
  Now we are considering the Republican Study Committee budget, which 
includes even deeper cuts for children and families and seniors while 
giving tax cuts to the wealthy.
  My Democratic colleagues and I offer A Better Deal for America. The 
United States is the richest country in the world at the richest time 
in history. We can have quality healthcare, affordable childcare, debt-
free college, secure retirement, and world-class infrastructure, but 
not if we give massive tax cuts to the wealthiest individuals and 
corporations.
  So I urge my colleagues to reject the RSC budget, reject the 
Republican budget, and to support the Democratic alternative. Americans 
deserve a budget that grows our middle class and invests in our future.
  I want to read just one paragraph of a letter from Planned Parenthood 
that says: ``The House Budget Resolution proposes cuts that would be 
disastrous for women, men, and young people Planned Parenthood sees 
every day. It sacrifices access to healthcare, repealing the Affordable 
Care Act, gutting Medicaid, and proposing even deeper cuts to low-
income nondefense discretionary spending. It undermines access to 
critical reproductive healthcare, including no copay birth control, for 
millions of women.''
  The women of America are watching. This budget is a particular 
disaster for them, for us.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).
  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, Article I, section 9 of the Constitution 
grants Congress the power of the purse. This assigns to Congress the 
role of final arbiter of the use of public funds.
  Despite this clear declaration of power, the Office of Management and 
Budget estimates that agencies collected over $513 billion in fines, 
fees, penalties, and other offsetting collections and receipts in 
fiscal year 2017. Allowing agencies to have slush funds outside of the 
normal appropriations process is a recipe for bad acting.
  The RSC budget calls for implementing the Agency Accountability Act, 
which directs that all fines, fees, and settlements go to the Treasury, 
making them subject to the normal appropriations process. This would 
end the agencies' ability to operate independently and outside of the 
oversight of Congress. More importantly, it would allow Congress to 
fully account for how much money the government actually collects and 
where that money is coming from.
  I am also pleased that the RSC budget does what is increasingly 
becoming an impossible task: it balances the budget, all while 
prioritizing defense spending to keep this country secure. This budget 
sets forth the bold ideas necessary to put the country back on a path 
of fiscal responsibility.
  The Congressional Budget Office reports that if we stay on the 
current irresponsible fiscal path we are on, by 2047, in 30 years, our 
debt to GDP will be 150 percent. Stated more simply, our debt will be 
50 percent greater than our entire gross domestic product.
  We must put our Nation back on a path of fiscal responsibility, and 
the RSC budget does exactly that. As former chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullin warned, our national debt is the 
greatest threat to our national security. By putting our Nation on a 
sensible fiscal path of balancing the budget, we reduce the extremely 
heavy burden that a bloated Federal Government places on America's 
working families, allowing them to prosper and making the government 
less intrusive in their lives.
  I would also like to add extemporaneously in regard to what we are 
doing on SNAP benefits. What we are doing is imposing work requirements 
on able-bodied adults with no children. I want to repeat: able-bodied 
adults with no children. I think most Americans would agree that if 
they are getting payments from the Federal Government, they ought to at 
least do some work.

  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee.
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I want to state to my colleagues on this 
budget that there are two fundamental assumptions that are being made 
that need to be challenged.
  One, you are saying that we have a spending problem, not a revenue 
problem. This country is spending on domestic priorities and defense at 
a level that existed when the President of the United States was Dwight 
D. Eisenhower, and that was before Medicaid and Medicare.
  We have a significant issue about how we are going to meet the needs 
of the people of this country, both on defense, where we need some 
help, but definitely on the domestic side as well.
  The second assumption that you are making--and it is an assertion 
that is made over and over again--is that tax cuts will pay for 
themselves. That is the theology of your budget: tax cuts pay for 
themselves.
  You know, why not go to zero, and we will all be rich?
  That is essentially what is being said here. But the tax cuts are 
always at the high end of the income spectrum, which is exacerbating 
inequality and creating a problem for us to meet essential needs in 
this country.
  So this question of tax cuts paying for themselves and fiscal 
responsibility, let's have a little bit of history here. This was the 
theology of George Bush when he passed the tax cuts when he became 
President. They did not pay for themselves. We went from the Clinton-
era surpluses to the Bush-era deficits, and in another fiscally, 
grossly irresponsible move, he put the war on the credit card.
  The war was on the credit card. We had unpaid-for tax cuts and we had 
an unpaid-for war. And this is not just fiscal responsibility; this is 
governmental, personal, congressional irresponsibility. You have got to 
pay for things. Whether it is the war or it is food stamps or it is any 
program that you want to pick, you have got to pay for it.
  You don't pay for it by the magic asterisk of saying, ``the tax cuts 
that we propose,'' when we are going to spend by cutting taxes or going 
into a war that we don't pay for, $1 trillion, it doesn't work. And 
that is why we are in this path that is very dangerous with respect to 
the long-term debt.
  I believe in that. We have got to pay our bills. When we had the 
majority, we had a doctrine that said: Pay as you go.
  If any Democrat, the budget chair, or me wanted to propose some 
spending, we either had to come up with the revenue or we had to cut 
somewhere else. I believe in that.
  But I don't believe in unpaid-for tax cuts paying for themselves. I 
don't believe that more spending pays for itself

[[Page H7861]]

and we can just put it on the credit card.
  Now, we have got some problems and challenges in this country. We 
have got an opportunity problem.
  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Vermont.
  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, kids going to school get out with a debt the 
size of a mortgage. We have got an inequality problem. It has never 
been worse. It goes back to the Great Depression, when we had this 
divide between what hardworking people made and what the top 1 percent 
made.
  We have got a healthcare affordability problem, but you don't solve 
that by slashing access to healthcare and throwing 24 million people 
off of healthcare. We have got an infrastructure problem that we are 
totally neglecting. It is not addressed in this budget.
  We have got a DREAMer problem.
  How is it that, in this Congress, we are literally not allowing 
800,000 young people who came here, through no fault of their own, not 
voluntarily, and we are going to give them the hook and deport them?
  It is outrageous?
  We have got a rural America problem. Rural America has been left 
behind. The inequality in this country is really hitting hard on rural 
America, in parts of Vermont, and in all parts of this country. And 
there is nothing in this budget that says: We are going to give hope to 
rural America by investing in them.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the Speaker of the House.
  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge the whole House 
to support this Republican budget, H. Con. Res. 71.

  Let me just say a few things.
  First, this is a budget that reflects our first principles: freedom, 
freedom enterprise, a government accountable to the people it serves.
  It is a budget that will help grow our economy, and it is a budget 
that will help rein in our debt. It strengthens our national defense. 
It supports our men and women in uniform. It eliminate mindless, 
endless spending, and it maximizes American's tax dollars. It reforms 
Medicaid. It strengthens Medicare.
  This is a budget that keeps our responsibilities to our children and 
our grandchildren. Remember, we have a responsibility here, each and 
every generation, each and every Member: leave the country better off 
so your kids and your grandkids can prosper.
  That American legacy is seriously at risk because of our growing 
deteriorating budget situation, because of the coming debt crisis. This 
budget tackles that.
  There is one more thing that this budget does that is so important. 
It paves the way for historic tax reform. It unlocks the reconciliation 
process. We need to pass this budget so that we can deliver real relief 
for middle-income families across this country. We need to pass this 
budget for the people who are living paycheck to paycheck in America, 
who are trying to juggle it all. They are looking to get under a 
hopelessly broken Tax Code.
  We haven't reformed this tax system since 1986. We need to pass this 
budget so that we can help bring more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger 
paychecks for people across this country. The time for this is now, and 
the opportunity is right in front of us.
  I want to especially commend Chairman Black for her commitment to 
this vision. I want to especially commend the members of the Budget 
Committee for their steadfast commitment to this vision. We would not 
be in a position today to pass this budget without her tireless 
leadership and the leadership of her members of the committee.
  It is so encouraging that the Senate has passed their budget out of 
committee. They are on the track, too. That means we look forward to 
working with the Senate to take the next step.
  We have an opportunity to make right by our fellow countrymen. We 
have an opportunity to make right by the people we represent. We have 
an opportunity to actually restore prosperity in this country.

                              {time}  0945

  We haven't seen that kind of economic potential in this country in at 
least a decade. We can fix that this year.
  We know a debt crisis is coming. We know if we do nothing, the next 
generation will be worse off. We can stop that, fix this, and make them 
better off.
  That is what this budget paves the way for, and that is why I urge 
all of my colleagues to support this budget.
  I thank the chair for her steadfast support. I thank the Members for 
getting us to where we are today, and I really look forward to the day 
where we can look at this moment as when we got the country on the 
right track.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just say that we need 
to cut right to the chase.
  It is unlikely that either the Republican Study Committee budget or 
the Republican Budget Committee budget could pass this House. It 
certainly couldn't pass the Congress.
  This is all about moving the ball forward so we can push through a 
massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, with 51 votes in the 
Senate. That is what this day is about, and that is what this process 
is about.
  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject both the Republican 
Study Committee budget and the Republican Budget Committee budget, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of 
support of the Republican Study Committee budget from the Committee for 
a Responsible Federal Budget, the Council for Citizens Against 
Government Waste, FreedomWorks, and Heritage Action for America.

                                       Committee for a Responsible


                                               Federal Budget,

                                                September 8, 2017.
     Hon. Mark Walker,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative Walker: I am writing you to express our 
     appreciation for the fiscally responsible budget released by 
     the Republican Study Committee.
       Your budget would make important progress by putting debt 
     on a downward path as a share of GDP, reducing it from 77 
     percent today to 56 percent by 2027--instead of letting it 
     rise to 89 percent as under current law.
       By calling for spending cuts and entitlement reforms, your 
     budget helps to keep the national debt on a sustainable path.
       We applaud the Republican Study Committee for your serious 
     contribution to the ongoing budget debate.
           Sincerely,

                                              Maya MacGuineas,

                            President, Committee for a Responsible
     Federal Budget.
                                  ____

                                      Council for Citizens Against


                                             Government Waste,

                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.
     House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Representative: You will soon vote on several 
     different budget proposals for fiscal year (FY) 2018. On 
     behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of 
     the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I 
     urge you to support the budget resolution as reported by the 
     House Budget Committee and the Republican Study Committee's 
     (RSC) budget resolution, both of which would put the nation 
     back on the path to fiscal sanity and pave the way for 
     comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform.
       Under the leadership of Chairman Diane Black (R-Tenn.), H. 
     Con. Res. 71, as reported by the House Budget Committee, 
     would reduce spending by $6.5 trillion over 10 years and 
     balance the budget by 2027. H. Con. Res. 71 provides 
     reconciliation instructions for fundamental tax reform that, 
     if enacted, will allow Americans to keep more of their money, 
     simplify the filing of taxes, and allow small businesses to 
     boost wages and create jobs. While H. Con. Res. 71 would 
     increase defense spending above Budget Control Act mandated 
     cap levels, this legislation also calls for $203 billion in 
     spending cuts across various programs and a $700 billion 
     reduction in improper payments.
       The RSC budget enacts many of the same reforms as the House 
     Budget Committee's plan, but it proposes to reduce government 
     spending by $10 trillion over 10 years and achieves balance 
     in six years. The RSC plan creates a pathway for tax reform; 
     repeals and replaces Obamacare; makes Social Security 
     solvent; rescues Medicare and disability insurance; and 
     decreases FY 2018 non-discretionary spending to $394 billion.
       Tax reform presents an historic opportunity to unleash the 
     economic potential of the American people. While Congress is 
     well-positioned to enact tax reform, that cannot occur until 
     a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions is 
     adopted. I urge

[[Page H7862]]

     you to support both the House Budget Committee's FY 2018 
     budget resolution as reported and the RSC's FY 2018 budget 
     resolution. All votes on the FY 2018 budget resolutions will 
     be among those considered in CCAGW's 2017 Congressional 
     Ratings.
           Sincerely,
                                                       Tom Schatz,
     President, CCAGW.

      Key Vote Yes on the McClintock Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71

       On behalf of FreedomWorks' activist community, I urge you 
     to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote YES 
     on the amendment offered by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) to 
     H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY 2018. The 
     amendment, which includes reconciliation instructions for 
     fundamental tax reform, is the Republican Study Committee's 
     FY 2018 budget alternative.
       The Republican Study Committee's (RSC) FY 2018 budget would 
     reduce federal spending by more than $10 trillion over the 
     ten-year budget window, bringing the budget into balance in 
     FY 2023. The RSC's budget would repeal ObamaCare and enact 
     other patient-centered health insurance reforms, make Social 
     Security and Medicare solvent, and reform federal welfare 
     programs. It also promotes free trade, regulatory reform, and 
     other free market, limited government principles.
       The current text of H. Con. Res. 71 and the McClintock 
     amendment include language that allows the House Ways and 
     Means Committee to produce legislation to reform the tax 
     code. Riddled with loopholes and special interest deductions, 
     America's tax code has become far too complex. According to 
     the Tax Foundation, Americans spent 8.9 billion hours and 
     $409 billion complying with the more than 74,000-page tax 
     code.
       It has been more than 30 years since Congress passed 
     fundamental tax reform. Congress has a generational 
     opportunity to reform the tax code by consolidating and 
     lowering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and promoting 
     job creation and international competitiveness for American 
     businesses. This will make the tax code fairer and simplify 
     the filing process, allowing the vast majority of Americans 
     to file their taxes on a postcard.
       FreedomWorks will count the vote on the McClintock 
     amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 on our 2017 Congressional 
     Scorecard. The scorecard is used to determine eligibility for 
     the FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes Members of the 
     House and Senate who consistently vote to support economic 
     freedom and individual liberty.
           Sincerely,
                                                     Adam Brandon,
     President, FreedomWorks.

     ``Yes'' on the RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future Economy

                          (By Andrea Palermo)

       On Thursday, the House will vote on the Fiscal Year 2018 
     (FY18) Budget offered by the Republican Study Committee (RSC) 
     as an amendment to the committee-approved FY18 budget 
     resolution. The RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future 
     Economy, introduced by RSC Budget and Spending Task Force 
     Chairman Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), would balance in 2023, 
     reduce non-defense discretionary spending, reestablish 
     national defense spending to support the military, break the 
     ``firewall'' between defense and nondefense discretionary 
     spending, fully repeal and replace Obamacare, repeal Dodd-
     Frank by implementing the Financial CHOICE Act, reform 
     entitlement programs, and finally, enact pro-growth tax 
     reform. If passed, the RSC's budget would give lawmakers a 
     serious conservative blueprint for reform.
       Pro-Growth Tax Reform. Republicans campaigned and promised 
     to fix America's broken tax code. The current code has become 
     a significant obstacle to economic growth, job creation and 
     higher wages for American workers. The RSC budget would 
     fulfill the Republican campaign promise by enacting tax 
     reform that cuts taxes for families, makes American 
     businesses competitive around the globe, ends double 
     taxation, and simplifies the code.
       Repealing Obamacare. Republicans owe their majorities to 
     their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that is 
     reflected in the RSC's budget. The budget remains committed 
     to fully repealing the law despite recent Republican 
     failures, and sends a signal to the American people that 
     conservatives will continue to push for free-market, patient-
     centered health care reforms.
       Funding Defense. Although the Budget Control Act of 2011 
     has put significant pressure on our military, a conservative 
     budget would align military spending with strategic 
     priorities by breaking the firewall. The RSC's budget does 
     not rely on the much-discussed OCO gimmick, but increases 
     defense spending to a total of $668 billion in FY18, which is 
     $119 billion above the current defense cap. Importantly, that 
     cost is offset by lowering non-defense discretionary spending 
     to $394 billion in FY18, which is $122 billion below the cap.
       Reforming Entitlements. The RSC's budget maintains the 
     Medicare premium support reforms, which are widely 
     established and broadly supported. In addition, the budget 
     lays down bold markers on Social Security, Social Security 
     Disability Insurance and Medicaid. It takes a similarly 
     aggressive approach on mandatory program spending like food 
     stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) 
     and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by 
     building on the success of the 1996 welfare reforms and 
     enacting work requirements as outlined in the Welfare Reform 
     and Upward Mobility Act (H.R. 2832/S. 1290) and the 
     Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Reform Act (H.R. 
     2996).
       Other important items in the budget include: Enacting the 
     Financial CHOICE Act, eliminating the Consumer Financial 
     Protection Bureau (CFPB), holding federal agencies 
     accountable, reducing funding for the Environmental 
     Protection Agency (EPA), separating food stamps and farm 
     programs, ending commodity subsidy programs, reforming crop 
     insurance, ending unconstitutional amnesty for illegal 
     immigrants, enforcing existing immigration laws, securing our 
     borders, delegating elementary and secondary education to 
     states and localities modeled after the Academic Partnership 
     Leads us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, reforming Higher Education 
     by passing the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO) 
     Act, eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, returning 
     transportation and infrastructure policy to the states, 
     reorganizing the executive branch, and protecting the life of 
     the unborn.
       Taken as a whole, the RSC's ``Securing America's Future 
     Economy'' demonstrates a seriousness of purpose when it comes 
     to governing. If passed, this budget would provide a fiscally 
     responsible path forward for our nation, limit the size and 
     scope of our bloated federal government, and unleash economic 
     prosperity for all Americans.

  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, Just a few steps from this Hall, Thomas 
Jefferson addressed his first inaugural address. After listing all of 
the blessings that our country enjoys, he asked what more do we need to 
maintain a happy and prosperous society. He said: ``Still one thing 
more, fellow citizens. A wise and frugal government, which shall 
restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free 
to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall 
not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the 
sum of good government. . . .''
  We have it within our power to restore that wise and frugal 
government and the prosperity and happiness that free societies always 
produce the moment we summon the political will to do so. The 
Republican Study Committee seeks that shining city on a hill and today 
offers this map to get us there.
  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a 
substitute offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).
  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes

     SEC. 307. REINSTATEMENT OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO.

       In the House, and pursuant to section 301(b)(8) of the 
     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for the remainder of the 
     115th Congress, the following shall apply in lieu of 
     ``CUTGO'' rules and principles:
       (1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), it 
     shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution, 
     amendment, or conference report if the provisions of such 
     measure affecting direct spending and revenues have the net 
     effect of increasing the on-budget deficit or reducing the 
     on-budget surplus for the period comprising either--
       (i) the current year, the budget year, and the four years 
     following that budget year; or

[[Page H7869]]

       (ii) the current year, the budget year, and the nine years 
     following that budget year.
       (B) The effect of such measure on the deficit or surplus 
     shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the 
     Committee on the Budget.
       (C) For the purpose of this section, the terms ``budget 
     year'', ``current year'', and ``direct spending'' have the 
     meanings specified in section 250 of the Balanced Budget and 
     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, except that the term 
     ``direct spending'' shall also include provisions in 
     appropriation Acts that make outyear modifications to 
     substantive law as described in section 3(4)(C) of the 
     Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.
       (2) If a bill, joint resolution, or amendment is considered 
     pursuant to a special order of the House directing the Clerk 
     to add as a new matter at the end of such measure the 
     provisions of a separate measure as passed by the House, the 
     provisions of such separate measure as passed by the House 
     shall be included in the evaluation under paragraph (1) of 
     the bill, joint resolution, or amendment.
       (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the 
     evaluation under paragraph (1) shall exclude a provision 
     expressly designated as an emergency for purposes of pay-as-
     you-go principles in the case of a point of order under this 
     clause against consideration of--
       (i) bill or joint resolution;
       (ii) an amendment made in order as original text by a 
     special order of business;

       (iv) an amendment between the Houses.
       (B) In the case of an amendment (other than one specified 
     in subparagraph (A)) to a bill or joint resolution, the 
     evaluation under paragraph (1) shall give no cognizance to 
     any designation of emergency.
       (C) If a bill, a joint resolution, an amendment made in 
     order as original text by a special order of business, a 
     conference report, or an amendment between the Houses

     purposes of pay-as-you-go principles, the Chair shall put the 
     question of consideration with respect thereto.

     SEC. 308. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of 
     Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part 
     of the rules of the House, and these rules shall supersede 
     other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent 
     with other such rules; and
       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
     the House of Representatives to change those rules at any 
     time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
     case of any other rule of the House of Representatives.

                      TITLE IV--POLICY STATEMENTS

     SEC. 401. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE 
                   COVERAGE FOR WORKING FAMILIES.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Making health care coverage affordable and accessible 
     for all American families will improve their health and 
     financial security, which will make the economy stronger.
       (2) Medicaid is the Nation's largest health insurance 
     program, providing quality, comprehensive, and affordable 
     coverage to more than 70 million vulnerable Americans, 
     including more than one in three children.
       (3) Millions of low-income seniors and people with 
     disabilities rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care 
     and home- and community-based services that provide help with 
     activities of daily living.
       (4) Medicaid coverage provides financial stability to 
     families struggling to escape poverty and to parents of 
     children with disabilities and special health care needs.
       (5) The existing financing structure of Medicaid ensures 
     that Federal contributions keep pace with costs and enables 
     States to respond to changing needs, such as increased 
     enrollment in coverage during economic downturns or an aging 
     population that requires extensive long-term care services.
       (6) Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 States and the 
     District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility to 
     low-income adults, including working parents who do not 
     receive coverage through their employers.
       (7) Roughly 20 million previously uninsured people have 
     gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, 
     reducing the Nation's uninsured rate for working-age adults 
     to one of the lowest levels on record.
       (8) The law provides premium tax credits that vary by 
     income and the local cost of coverage and cost-sharing 
     assistance to help low- and middle-income families afford 
     quality insurance and pay their out-of-pocket costs.
       (9) The law prohibits insurers from denying coverage or 
     charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions, 
     requires coverage of essential health benefits like maternity 
     care and prescription drugs, limits out-of-pocket costs, and 
     prohibits lifetime and annual limits on coverage.
       (10) The law put in place significant cost-saving reforms 
     to Federal health programs that have played a part in slowing 
     the rate of healthcare spending growth in recent years, with 
     2011, 2012, and 2013 experiencing the slowest growth rates in 
     real per capita national health expenditures on record.
       (11) On May 4, 2017, the House of Representatives passed 
     H.R.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, legislation 
     that would repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act, make 
     deep cuts in Medicaid, and--
       (A) result in 23 million Americans losing health insurance 
     in 2026, including 14 million people losing Medicaid;
       (B) dramatically increase costs for older adults, low-
     income families, and people with pre-existing conditions;
       (C) reduce Medicaid spending by $834 billion over ten 
     years;
       (D) jeopardize care for seniors in nursing homes, children 
     with disabilities, and families receiving Medicaid benefits 
     as States look to reduce coverage and services;
       (E) severely undermine access to substance abuse treatment 
     during the nationwide opioid epidemic;
       (F) shorten the life of the Medicare Hospital Insurance 
     Trust Fund; and
       (G) provide nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that mostly 
     benefit millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--
       (1) Congress should build upon the progress of the 
     Affordable Care Act to make health care coverage more 
     affordable and accessible to all American families, and 
     reject any measures to repeal or undermine the law;
       (2) the Administration and Congress should fully implement, 
     enforce, and fund the Affordable Care Act, and stop any 
     efforts to sabotage the health insurance marketplaces; and
       (3) Congress should preserve Medicaid and not dismantle it 
     by converting Medicaid into a block grant, per capita cap, or 
     other financing arrangement that would limit Federal 
     contributions and render the program incapable of responding 
     to increased need that may result from trends in demographics 
     or health care costs or from economic conditions.

     SEC. 402. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON TAX REFORM THAT PROVIDES 
                   SUPPORT AND RELIEF TO HARDWORKING AMERICAN 
                   FAMILIES.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Tax plans from House Republicans and President Trump 
     prioritize tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and 
     wealthy corporations, while shifting more of the burden onto 
     everyone else. Their plans fail to close special interest 
     loopholes in the tax code, and even add trillions of dollars 
     of new loopholes for the wealthy. These plans reflect the 
     failed theory of ``trickle-down'' economics, which creates 
     few jobs and instead leads to massive deficits. A return to 
     these policies would--
       (A) fail to create good paying middle-class jobs;
       (B) do nothing to help low-income or middle-class 
     households with the rising costs of health care, education, 
     housing, child care, or retirement; and
       (C) widen the income gap between millionaires and 
     billionaires and the middle class.
       (2) Americans today are working harder than ever, but 
     continue to struggle to find good jobs, get ahead, and stay 
     ahead. This is part of a four-decade trend of stagnant wages 
     for middle-class and low-income households, even as 
     millionaires and billionaires become richer and corporations 
     reap massive profits.
       (3) The Obama Administration ended with 83 consecutive 
     months of private-sector job growth, but challenges still 
     remain to create more good-paying jobs and broadly shared 
     prosperity. The number of long-term unemployed remains 
     elevated, and unemployment for people of color continues to 
     be higher than the rest of the population. Many areas remain 
     in need of well-paying jobs.
       (4) By almost any metric, the middle class has seen little 
     to no improvements in their incomes. Real median household 
     income in 2013 was only $7,000 higher than it was in 1979. 
     Median weekly real earnings for workers increased less than 1 
     percent from 1979 to 2014. Poorer workers have done even 
     worse. For workers in the lower half of the income scale, 
     real annual wages from 1979 to 2014 grew only $76. And the 
     entire lower 50 percent of the United States population holds 
     a mere 1 percent of total national wealth.
       (5) All the while, millionaires and billionaires have seen 
     their incomes and wealth skyrocket. Incomes for the top one 
     percent of households grew five times as fast as for middle-
     income workers, and now average over $1 million a year. CEOs 
     make nearly 300 times what the typical worker does. Ten 
     percent of the population owns 76 percent of the Nation's 
     total wealth, and the average net assets of the top one 
     percent now exceed $10 million per person.
       (6) The top one percent of households receives a 
     disproportionate share--17 percent--of the benefit of major 
     tax expenditures. This uneven distribution of major tax 
     expenditures has exacerbated income and wealth inequality. 
     The tax code treats income from wealth more favorably than 
     income from work by giving preferential tax rates on unearned 
     income, and it contains numerous, wasteful tax breaks for 
     special interests.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House to responsibly 
     reform the tax code to provide support and relief to low- and 
     middle-income families, create good-paying jobs, and drive 
     broadly-shared prosperity, while closing special-interest 
     loopholes and making sure the wealthiest Americans pay their 
     fair share.

     SEC. 403. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE 
                   FUNDING INCREASES.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:

[[Page H7870]]

       (1) The current spending limits set by the Budget Control 
     Act of 2011 are too low, for both defense and nondefense 
     funding. Defense and nondefense investments must be at 
     appropriate levels to protect both national security and 
     economic security. The nondefense discretionary spending 
     limit for 2018 is $2 billion less than it was in 2016, in 
     nominal terms, representing a significant cut to purchasing 
     power. If the inflation rate is what the Congressional Budget 
     Office projects, the 2018 cap represents a reduction of 
     nearly $30 billion compared with 2016. Defense spending faces 
     similar reductions.
       (2) The Budget Control Act of 2011 is based on parity for 
     defense and nondefense spending, setting up separate caps for 
     both and instituting a ``firewall'' to prevent reductions in 
     one category because of increases in the other.
       (3) Bipartisan agreement has provided a solution to the 
     austerity-level caps before, and can be used again to change 
     these arbitrary spending caps to prevent the harsh impact of 
     massive, irresponsible cuts to important Federal programs.
       (4) Congress must begin discussions and negotiations 
     immediately, to raise the caps to appropriate levels, and 
     maintain parity between defense and nondefense.
       (b) Policy on Defense and Nondefense Funding Increases.--It 
     is the policy of the House that Congress should enact 
     increases to the current defense and nondefense spending 
     limits, in equal amounts, without using reductions in one 
     category to pay for increases in the other.

     SEC. 404. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Fixing the country's broken immigration system will 
     mean safer communities, a stronger economy and lower budget 
     deficits.
       (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting 
     the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration 
     Modernization Act, as introduced by House Democrats in the 
     113th Congress, would have reduced the deficit by $900 
     billion over the next 2 decades, boosting the economy by 5.4 
     percent, and increasing productivity by 1.0 percent.
       (3) The Social Security Actuary estimated that immigration 
     reform will reduce the Social Security shortfall by 8 percent 
     and will extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by 
     2 years.
       (4) The United States is a Nation founded, built and 
     sustained by immigrants, and the Congress has a 
     responsibility to harness the power of that tradition by 
     implementing an effective and fair immigration policy.
       (5) The current immigration system is broken because it 
     keeps families of legal immigrants and United States citizens 
     separated for decades, it allows for the exploitation of 
     undocumented workers to the detriment of all workers, it does 
     not meet the needs of our economy and discourages legal 
     immigration, and it keeps millions of hard-working, law-
     abiding families who have lived in our communities for 
     decades hiding in the shadows, including many thousands who 
     came to the United States as infants or young children.
       (6) Overly aggressive immigration enforcement that focuses 
     on individuals with deep ties to the United States hurts 
     State and local law enforcement efforts to establish and 
     maintain trust with immigrant communities. The number of 
     Latinos reporting crimes in big cities across the country is 
     lower than past years, particularly among domestic violence 
     and sexual assault victims.
       (7) The vast majority of individuals in U.S. Immigration 
     and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody have not been convicted 
     of a serious crime. ICE's own statistics demonstrate that 
     arrests of people with no criminal record increased 157 
     percent in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, 
     and only 6.5 percent of those arrested were convicted of 
     violent crimes.
       (8) The number of detained asylum seekers continues to rise 
     dramatically and detaining asylum seekers, other vulnerable 
     populations, and those who do not pose risks to public safety 
     is unnecessary and wasteful.
       (9) Increasing the use of alternatives to detention rather 
     than expanding immigration detention would be more humane and 
     cost-effective.
       (10) It has been nearly four years since the Senate passed, 
     on a bipartisan basis, its comprehensive immigration reform 
     bill.
       (11) Immigration reform is needed to secure the sovereignty 
     of the United States of America and to establish a coherent 
     and just system for integrating those who seek to join 
     American society.
       (12) A successful immigration system cannot rely on border 
     security alone. The country needs a system that promotes the 
     reunification of families, protects workers and is responsive 
     to the needs of employers, and implements an inclusive 
     legalization program for those who are currently here.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress 
     enact comprehensive immigration reform - such as the Border 
     Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization 
     Act, introduced by House Democrats in the 113th Congress - to 
     boost our economy, lower deficits, establish clear and just 
     rules for citizenship, and make our communities safer.

     SEC. 405. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Most of the 61 million Americans who currently receive 
     earned Social Security benefits rely on these benefits for 
     the majority of their income, with nearly a quarter of them 
     relying on Social Security for at least 90 percent of their 
     income.
       (2) In the past, Social Security benefits were part of a 3-
     legged stool where retirees relied on a combination of Social 
     Security, a private pension, and personal savings to finance 
     retirement.
       (3) Social Security benefits will be more important to 
     future retirees as few workers will receive traditional 
     pensions, and many workers cannot afford to adequately fund 
     their retirement through employer-sponsored savings plans or 
     IRAs.
       (4) Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) and Old Age 
     and Survivors Insurance (OASI) systems are intertwined both 
     in their benefit structure and in their revenues - DI 
     recipients who reach retirement age receive OASI benefits and 
     beneficiaries in each category have helped finance the other 
     category even if they will never receive those benefits.
       (5) Social Security benefits are already being cut as 
     Social Security's normal retirement age is increasing from 66 
     years for workers retiring now to 67 years for those born in 
     1960 and later. This cut disproportionately impacts low-
     earners because life expectancy continues to increase among 
     higher-earners but not low-earners. Thus, high-earners will 
     generally receive benefits for a longer time than low-
     earners.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the House 
     of Representatives will not adopt changes to Social Security 
     that involve reductions in earned Social Security benefits.

     SEC. 406. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON PROTECTING THE MEDICARE 
                   GUARANTEE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH 
                   DISABILITIES.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Senior citizens and persons with disabilities highly 
     value the Medicare program and rely on Medicare to guarantee 
     their health and financial security.
       (2) In 2018, 60,000,000 people will rely on Medicare for 
     coverage of hospital stays, physician visits, prescription 
     drugs, and other necessary medical goods and services.
       (3) The Medicare program has lower administrative costs 
     than private insurance, and Medicare costs per enrollee have 
     grown at a slower rate than private insurance for a given 
     level of benefits.
       (4) People with Medicare already have the ability to choose 
     a private insurance plan within Medicare through the Medicare 
     Advantage option, yet two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries 
     chose the traditional fee-for-service program instead of a 
     private plan in 2016.
       (5) Rising health care costs are not unique to Medicare or 
     other Federal health programs, they are endemic to the entire 
     health care system.
       (6) Converting Medicare into a voucher for the purchase of 
     health insurance will merely force seniors and individuals 
     with disabilities to pay much higher premiums if they want to 
     use their voucher to purchase traditional Medicare coverage.
       (7) A voucher system in which the voucher payment fails to 
     keep pace with growth in health costs would expose seniors 
     and persons with disabilities on fixed incomes to 
     unacceptable financial risks.
       (8) Shifting more health care costs onto Medicare 
     beneficiaries would not reduce overall health care costs, 
     instead it would mean beneficiaries would face higher 
     premiums, eroding coverage, or both.
       (9) Versions of voucher policies that do not immediately 
     end the traditional Medicare program will merely set it up 
     for a death spiral as private plans siphon off healthier and 
     less expensive beneficiaries, leaving the sickest 
     beneficiaries in a program that will wither away.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the 
     Medicare guarantee for seniors and persons with disabilities 
     should be preserved and strengthened, and that any 
     legislation to end the Medicare guarantee, financially 
     penalize people for choosing traditional Medicare, or shift 
     rising health care costs onto seniors by replacing Medicare 
     with vouchers or premium support for the purchase of health 
     insurance, should be rejected.

     SEC. 407. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL STABILITY AND 
                   CONSUMER PROTECTION.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
     Protection Act of 2010 is an important component of the 
     country's response to the financial crisis and recession. It 
     took a number of steps to protect consumers of financial 
     products and services as well as protect taxpayers from the 
     costs of another financial crisis.
       (2) These steps included the creation of an orderly 
     liquidation process to allow regulators to close failing 
     institutions that some argue are ``too big to fail,'' as well 
     as a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an 
     Office of Financial Research to monitor the stability of our 
     financial system, and the Consumer Financial Protection 
     Bureau (the Consumer Bureau).
       (3) The Consumer Bureau plays a critical role in protecting 
     older Americans, military service members, student loan 
     borrowers, and other consumers, especially in minority and 
     low-income communities. It has implemented new rules for 
     mortgage markets and prepaid cards, and also successfully 
     recovered nearly $12 billion on behalf of more than 29 
     million consumers and service members.

[[Page H7871]]

       (4) The Consumer Bureau's funding from the Federal 
     Reserve's operations help give it important independence from 
     efforts to interfere with its vital mission and activities, 
     independence on par with every other banking regulator.
       (5) The Consumer Bureau has already faced and overcome 
     efforts to obstruct its operations.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress 
     should continue to support the vital work of the Consumer 
     Financial Protection Bureau as well as its governing and 
     financing structures and other key components of the Dodd-
     Frank legislation such as orderly liquidation authority, 
     FSOC, and the Office of Financial Research.

     SEC. 408. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON WOMEN'S ECONOMIC 
                   EMPOWERMENT.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Women's contributions are critical to the economic 
     success of hard-working families.
       (2) Not only do women play a key role in maintaining 
     healthy families, they also have unique health care needs and 
     face issues that require special focus.
       (3) Every hard-working American deserves to feel safe and 
     supported during retirement. Yet women are more likely to 
     face financial risk during retirement because of their lower 
     lifetime earnings and disproportionate role as family 
     caregivers.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress 
     should economically empower women and protect their health 
     and safety. Congress must enact policies that would 
     accomplish the following:
       (1) Help families attain better jobs, fight pay inequity, 
     raise the minimum wage, and enable women entrepreneurs and 
     small businesses to achieve their goals.
       (2) Give American families control of their own lives, and 
     help them balance the demands of work and family. These 
     policies include paid and expanded family and medical leave, 
     paid sick days, and quality, affordable child care.
       (3) Strengthen the retirement security of women and their 
     families by protecting Social Security, Medicare and 
     Medicaid.
       (4) Support caregivers, many of whom sacrifice their own 
     careers to provide for family members.
       (5) Maintain health insurance protections for women, 
     increase funding for the prevention and treatment of women's 
     health issues such as breast cancer and heart disease, and 
     support access to full reproductive care.
       (6) Prevent and protect women from domestic violence and 
     sexual abuse.

     SEC. 409. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON NATIONAL SECURITY.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The country faces many national security challenges and 
     we must continue to support a strong military that is second 
     to none.
       (2) Those who serve in uniform are our most important 
     security resource and the Administration and Congress shall 
     continue to provide the support they need to successfully 
     carry out the missions the country gives them.
       (3) A growing economy is the foundation of our security and 
     enables the country to provide the resources for a strong 
     military, sound homeland security agencies, and effective 
     diplomacy and international development.
       (4) Austerity-level spending caps threaten adequate 
     investment in activities critical to our economy and national 
     security, which include activities funded by both the defense 
     and nondefense portions of the discretionary budget.
       (5) Diplomacy and foreign aid are essential components of 
     our security and the President's proposal to cut these 
     activities by 32 percent below current levels prompted more 
     than 120 retired admirals and generals who have first-hand 
     knowledge of their effectiveness in securing our Nation to 
     forcefully object.
       (6) The Nation's projected long-term debt could have 
     serious consequences for our economy and security, and that 
     more efficient military spending has to be part of an overall 
     plan that effectively deals with this problem.
       (7) Reining in wasteful spending at the Nation's security 
     agencies, including the Department of Defense--the last 
     department still unable to pass an audit--such as the 
     elimination of duplicative programs and better controlling 
     delays and cost overruns on weapon systems that have been 
     identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
     needs to continue as a priority.
       (8) The Department of Defense should continue to review 
     defense plans and requirements to ensure that weapons 
     developed to counter Cold War-era threats are not redundant, 
     are affordable, and are applicable to 21st century threats; 
     and such review should include, with the participation of the 
     National Nuclear Security Administration, examination of 
     requirements for, and cost of, the nuclear weapons stockpile, 
     nuclear weapons delivery systems, and nuclear weapons and 
     infrastructure modernization.
       (9) Nonwar operation and maintenance costs per active-duty 
     service member have grown at a rate well above inflation for 
     decades--from $59,000 per service member in 1980 to $157,000 
     per service member in 2015 (measured in constant 2017 
     dollars), and it is imperative that unsustainable cost growth 
     be controlled in this area.
       (10) Cooperative threat reduction and other 
     nonproliferation programs (securing ``loose nukes'' and other 
     materials used in weapons of mass destruction), which were 
     highlighted as high priorities by the 9/11 Commission, need 
     to be funded at a level that is commensurate with the 
     evolving threat.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--
       (1) the austerity-level spending caps required by the 
     Budget Control Act of 2011 for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 
     should be rescinded and replaced by a fiscal plan that is 
     balanced and takes into account a comprehensive national 
     security strategy that includes careful consideration of 
     international, defense, homeland security, and law 
     enforcement programs; and
       (2) efficiencies can be achieved in the national defense 
     budget without compromising our security through greater 
     emphasis on eliminating duplicative and wasteful programs, 
     reforming the acquisition process, identifying and 
     constraining unsustainable operating costs, and through 
     careful analysis of our national security needs.

     SEC. 410. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to 
     face challenges meeting the needs of the next generation of 
     returning veterans, including sufficient funding to provide 
     critical services and benefits.
       (2) Access to quality health care and veterans' benefits 
     has been an ongoing challenge for the VA, highlighted most 
     recently in the ongoing claims backlog and veterans waiting 
     months for health care appointments.
       (3) Providing health care where veterans live and ensuring 
     a sufficient number of health care professionals, especially 
     in the area of mental health treatment, have also been 
     challenges.
       (4) The VA has made progress in reducing the number of 
     initial benefit claims, dropping the claims backlog to less 
     than 94,000 from a peak of 611,000 claims just a few years 
     ago, but that statistic leaves out the many veterans who are 
     still waiting many months or even years to have their appeals 
     decided.
       (5) The President's budget includes a 6 percent increase 
     over current-year funding but shifts funding away from 
     critical programs that veterans rely on in favor of expanded 
     funding that pays for certain veterans to get private health 
     care at the expense of care provided at VA hospitals and 
     clinics.
       (6) The President's budget also cuts funding from other 
     Federal agencies that provide lifesaving programs and 
     services for veterans, including deep cuts to Medicaid 
     benefits veterans rely on, the elimination of the Interagency 
     Council on Homelessness, steep cuts at the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development, elimination of the Legal 
     Services Corporation, and severe cuts to entrepreneurship 
     outreach programs targeted to veterans through the Small 
     Business Administration.
       (7) The VA currently has advance appropriations for 
     approximately 85 percent of its discretionary budget. The 
     residual 15 percent, which includes funding for the day-to-
     day operations at the Veterans Benefits Administration, 
     remains vulnerable to a Government shutdown.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--
       (1) Congress should support a funding level no less than 
     the President's request for veterans' discretionary programs 
     so that the VA has the resources it needs to ensure veterans 
     get the health care and benefits they earned in a timely 
     fashion;
       (2) Congress should lift the austerity-level funding cap on 
     nondefense programs for 2018 and beyond to ensure adequate 
     funding for veterans' programs;
       (3) advance appropriations be expanded to cover all of VA's 
     discretionary budget to prevent delays in veterans' benefits 
     and services during a Government shutdown;
       (4) the VA submit along with its annual budget a ``Future-
     Years Veterans Program'' that projects its needs over five 
     years to help facilitate the appropriations and oversight 
     processes;
       (5) Congress should provide sufficient resources for the 
     VA's Office of the Inspector General to guarantee veterans 
     are properly served and that resources are spent efficiently;
       (6) no changes be made to the Individual Unemployability 
     benefit to ensure that disabled veterans, many of them 
     severely disabled, who are deemed unable to engage in 
     substantial work as a result of their service to our country, 
     continue to receive the full disability and social security 
     benefits they earned and were promised; and
       (7) Congress shall provide sufficient funding and staff 
     resources for VA hospitals and clinics, and that any 
     increased funding for private and community care not provided 
     directly by the VA should not come at the expense of 
     necessary resources for VA hospitals and clinics.

     SEC. 411. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DISASTER RESPONSE FUNDING.

       (a) Findings.--The House find the following:
       (1) Natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and 
     Maria require swift congressional action to help storm 
     survivors get their lives back on track, rebuild disaster-
     stricken communities, and prevent further damage to the 
     economy.
       (2) The Budget Control Act of 2001 provides procedural 
     tools specifically to respond to

[[Page H7872]]

     natural disasters, by allowing adjustments to the spending 
     caps for disaster and emergency spending.
       (3) Mitigation and prevention is an important part of 
     disaster recovery and response, providing investments that 
     make future disasters less costly in terms of both dollars 
     and lives.
       (b) Policy on Funding for Disaster Response and Recovery.--
     It is the policy of the House that Congress should act 
     swiftly to assist with recovery from hurricanes and other 
     natural disasters. Such funding should be provided using the 
     budgetary provisions in place for this purpose: providing 
     adjustments to the spending caps for disaster and emergency 
     response, recovery, and mitigation. Congress must also 
     support efforts to address future disaster damage and loss, 
     by appropriately funding mitigation and prevention efforts.

     SEC. 412. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Federal workforce provides vital services to our 
     Nation on a daily basis. It includes those who patrol and 
     secure our borders, protect us from terrorists, take care of 
     our veterans, help run our airports, counter cyber-attacks, 
     find cures for deadly diseases, and keep our food supply 
     safe.
       (2) Veterans make up 31 percent of the Federal workforce.
       (3) Many Federal workers are paid at a rate that is far 
     below their private sector counterparts.
       (4) The Federal workforce is older than in past decades and 
     older than the private sector workforce. Nearly one third of 
     the Federal workforce is eligible to retire.
       (5) Federal employee pay and benefits are not the cause of 
     the country's deficits and debt. The Federal workforce has 
     already contributed more than $180 billion toward reducing 
     the country's deficits in the form of pay freezes, pay raises 
     insufficient to keep pace with inflation, furloughs, and 
     increased retirement contributions. The President's budget 
     for 2018 continues to unfairly target the Federal workforce 
     by proposing an additional $149 billion in compensation and 
     retirement benefit cuts.
       (6) Since 1975, the Federal workforce has declined 35 
     percent relative to the size of the population of the United 
     States.
       (7) Nearly all of the increase in the Federal civilian 
     workforce from 2001 to 2016 is due to increases at security-
     related agencies, including the Department of Defense, 
     Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Veterans 
     Affairs.
       (8) Proposals to reduce the size of the workforce at 
     nonsecurity agencies by 10 percent have excluded an 
     assessment of their impact on government services.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress 
     should not target Federal employees to achieve further 
     reductions in the deficit as they have already contributed 
     more than their fair share, that Federal workers should be 
     compensated with pay and benefits at a level that enables the 
     government to attract high quality people--which is 
     especially important during this period when more workers 
     will be retiring--and that no proposal to reduce the size of 
     the workforce should be considered without an assessment of 
     its impact on government services.

     SEC. 413. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENCE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Global climate change is a threat to national security, 
     public health, and economic growth.
       (2) The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
     Change concluded that the effects of climate change are 
     occurring worldwide, stating: ``The impacts of climate change 
     have already been felt in recent decades on all continents 
     and across the oceans''.
       (3) The United States Government Accountability Office 
     described climate change as, ``a complex, crosscutting issue 
     that poses risks to many environmental and economic systems--
     including agriculture, infrastructure, ecosystems, and human 
     health--and presents a significant financial risk to the 
     Federal Government''.
       (4) In March 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in 
     written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
     stated that ``climate change can be a driver of instability 
     and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential 
     adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon''.
       (5) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and 
     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that 
     2016 was the warmest year on record, setting a new record for 
     global average surface temperatures for the third year in a 
     row. Furthermore, 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have 
     occurred since 2001.
       (6) The United States National Research Council's National 
     Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee found 
     climate change affects ``human health, water supply, 
     agriculture, transportation, energy, coastal areas, and many 
     other sectors of society, with increasingly adverse impacts 
     on the American economy and quality of life''.
       (7) The most vulnerable among us, including children, the 
     elderly, low-income individuals, and those with underlying 
     health conditions, face even greater health risks as a result 
     of climate change.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that climate 
     change presents a significant public health, environmental, 
     and financial risk to the United States. The United States 
     must continue to play a leadership role on climate change 
     policy and should not retreat from global commitments on 
     climate change. Congress must provide robust funding for 
     climate change science, which provides critical information 
     for protecting human health, defending the United States, and 
     preserving economic and environmental systems throughout the 
     world.

     SEC. 414. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND 
                   ELIMINATING WASTE.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') 
     identifies examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in 
     Federal programs, and makes regular recommendations regarding 
     ways to reduce costs and increase revenue.
       (2) The Comptroller General has stated that addressing the 
     identified waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal 
     programs ``could lead to tens of billions of dollars of 
     additional savings, with significant opportunities for 
     improved efficiencies, cost savings, or revenue enhancements 
     in the areas of defense, information technology, education 
     and training, health care, energy, and tax enforcement.''
       (3) The tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and 
     taxes paid, now averages $458 billion annually. Even modest 
     improvements in enforcing existing law could yield a boost in 
     revenue without any changes to the tax code.
       (4) Tax expenditures, or spending through the tax code, 
     total $1.5 trillion per year and represent the largest 
     category of spending in the budget -- exceeding Medicare, 
     Medicaid, and Social Security. However, unlike other types of 
     spending, tax expenditures are not reviewed in any systematic 
     way in the annual budget process.
       (5) Improper payments, payments that should not have been 
     made or that were made in an incorrect amount, totaled $144 
     billion for 2016. While some improper payments are the result 
     of fraud, the vast majority are due to unintentional errors, 
     such as payments to eligible beneficiaries that were not 
     properly verified, or overpayments or underpayments because 
     of a data entry mistake.
       (6) Shutting down the government, arbitrarily cutting 
     agency budgets, and funding large portions of the government 
     through stop-gap appropriations do not lead to efficient and 
     effective government.
       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress 
     must continue to root out wasteful spending, make government 
     operations more efficient, pass appropriations bills on time, 
     and avoid costly government shutdowns. Congress must task 
     agencies with shrinking the error rate in government programs 
     and provide adequate budgetary resources for agencies to 
     develop new processes, review expenditures, and improve 
     information technology systems.

     SEC. 415. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIAN 
                   INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL 
                   ELECTION.

       (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
       (1) Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our 
     democracy, and foreign interference in them undermines the 
     public trust and casts doubt on the legitimacy of our 
     government.
       (2) The country's intelligence agencies all agree that 
     Russia launched a campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S. 
     presidential election, which included cyber-attacks, 
     dissemination of false information, and other intelligence 
     operations to malign Secretary Hillary Clinton and increase 
     the odds of a Donald Trump presidency.
       (3) Members of the Trump campaign had repeated contact with 
     Russian government officials and oligarchs and then failed to 
     report this contact in testimony to Congress and in security 
     clearance applications. One such meeting reportedly included 
     a request for a back-channel line of communications with the 
     Russian government using Russian facilities, which would 
     preclude U.S. Government oversight. Another involved a 
     Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet 
     counterintelligence officer under the assumption that they 
     would provide politically damaging information about 
     Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's 
     effort to support the Trump campaign.
       (4) Under the direction of Federal Bureau of Investigation 
     Director James Comey, the FBI was investigating whether 
     members of President Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to 
     influence the election.
       (5) On May 9, 2017, President Trump fired FBI Director 
     Comey and then made statements suggesting his dismissal was 
     to stop the investigation of collusion.
       (6) On May 17, 2017, the Department of Justice announced 
     the appointment of former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III 
     to serve as Special Counsel to investigate Russian 
     interference into the 2016 presidential election and any 
     coordination between the Russian government and individuals 
     associated with the Trump campaign.
       (b) Policy on the Investigation of Russian Interference in 
     the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.--It is the policy of 
     this concurrent resolution that to restore confidence in our 
     government and to preserve the sanctity of our electoral 
     process, Congress must ensure adequate funding for the

     Special Counsel appointed by the Department of Justice so 
     that he can perform a thorough and nonpartisan investigation 
     of Russia's campaign to affect the 2016 U.S. presidential 
     election and any individuals in the United States that may 
     have colluded in those efforts.

  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) and a Member opposed each will control 15 
minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chairman, Democrats and Republicans are looking at the same 
challenges facing our country and American families. Education, 
healthcare, and housing costs have all increased while wages stay 
stagnant.
  It used to be that the two parties would debate different strategies 
to address the problems facing the American people. Sadly, those times 
are behind us.
  In giving millionaires, including the majority of this Congress, the 
President, and wealthy donors a giant tax cut, the Republican budget 
does not even pretend to address the problems facing the American 
people. Not only does it ignore working families, it increases their 
challenges.
  The Democratic budget alternative, in stark contrast to the 
Republican budget, begins to address the real challenges our country 
faces now and in the long term.

                              {time}  1015

  We are less than a decade removed from the worst economic crisis in 
most of our lifetimes, and we have a chance to rebound in a way that 
builds a foundation for our country to thrive for generations, but we 
have to seize that opportunity.
  Rather than giving resources to people and businesses that already 
have them, we are calling for targeted investments in programs that 
grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for 
working families and real security in retirement.
  Rather than sending thank-you notes to the corporations that bankroll 
campaigns, we have an opportunity to make vital public investments that 
lead to a brighter future rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical 
infrastructure, all of which lead to good jobs now and in the long run.
  Rather than giving the President a multimillion-dollar refund on 
taxes he refuses to disclose, we can invest in retirement security for 
seniors who didn't inherit millions. We can invest in affordable 
education so young people do not have to grow up wealthy to have a shot 
at earning it in their future careers.
  Instead of taking healthcare away from people, straining emergency 
rooms, and making Americans sicker, we have an opportunity to continue 
investing in affordable quality healthcare for all of us, finally 
eliminating a great burden on American families, a burden that no other 
developed nation shares.
  This budget is an opportunity for our country to invest in our 
future, and if we adopt the Republican budget plan, we will have 
squandered it.
  Democrats believe in a government that prioritizes American families, 
and they should be the priorities of this Congress. I, therefore, urge 
my colleagues to oppose the Republican budget and support the 
Democratic alternative.
  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment.
  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Tennessee is recognized for 15 
minutes.
  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this budget substitute, which is, 
put simply, an abdication of our fiscal responsibility as a governing 
body.
  Our country is $20 trillion in debt, with $9 trillion added to the 
national debt during the Obama years. We have the responsibility to our 
children and our grandchildren to stop this Congress' addiction to 
spending. It is a responsibility that I take seriously; it is a 
responsibility that the members of my committee take seriously; and it 
is a responsibility that Republicans in the House take seriously.
  Clearly, it is not a responsibility that our friends across the aisle 
take seriously. Our budget works to end the addiction to spending that 
has dominated Washington for far too long.
  The House budget, passed out of committee with unanimous Republican 
support in July, begins to address our spending addiction by balancing 
the budget over 10 years so that we can start paying down our national 
debt, and it addresses mandatory spending in a significant way for the 
first time since 1997.
  This budget substitute does quite the opposite. The Democrats' budget 
raises taxes by $2.7 trillion, which would be the largest tax increase 
in U.S. history. It increases spending by $6.2 trillion, compared to 
the budget passed by my committee. It never balances, with a deficit in 
2027 of $852 billion.
  What we hear from the other side of the aisle and what we see in this 
budget is simply more of same: more spending, more tax increases, and 
more debt. I don't think that is acceptable, and neither do the 
American people.
  Since we began this budget debate yesterday, my counterparts on the 
other side of the aisle have been throwing out misleading numbers about 
our budget and our tax reform effort in order to hide the fact that 
they offer no new solutions to the most pressing problems our country 
faces.
  Here is a number that they should keep in mind while they discuss 
this fiscally irresponsible substitute. The national debt for every 
person is over $63,000. Every man, woman, and even child in our country 
has a $63,000 weight hanging over their heads. Our budget takes real 
steps to fix this crisis. This budget substitute does not. Honestly, it 
is as simple as that.
  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this Democrat substitute, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.
  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chair, once again, House Republicans are determined 
to visit cruel and unusual punishment on the American people by 
presenting a budget that is reckless, regressive, and reprehensible. It 
is a budget that will hurt working families, middle class folks, senior 
citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans, and rural 
America.
  It is a budget that will eradicate the social safety net, end 
Medicare as we know it, rip away health insurance from 23 million 
Americans, and impose billions and billions of dollars in life-altering 
debt on younger Americans.
  It is outrageous that this is all being done to enact tax cuts for 
the wealthy and the well-off, tax cuts for the privileged few, tax cuts 
for special interests here in Washington, D.C.
  This parade of horribles is being jammed down the throats of this 
country so that everyday Americans can subsidize the lifestyles of the 
rich and shameless.
  We deserve better. The Democratic budget will invest in 
transportation and infrastructure, invest in education and job 
training, invest in the social safety net, invest in research and 
development, invest in affordable housing, and invest in the wellbeing 
of everyday Americans.
  The Republican budget is a raw deal. The Democratic budget is a 
better deal, focused on better jobs, better wages, and a better future. 
It is worthy of our support.
  The Acting CHAIR. The Committee will rise informally.
  The Speaker pro tempore (Mrs. Handel) assumed the chair.
