  REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF JUDGE ROBERT LEE BYRD, JR.

  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life and 
contributions of Judge Robert Lee Byrd, Jr.
  Judge Byrd was born in Birmingham in 1932. He received his bachelor's 
degree from Vanderbilt University in 1954, before attending the 
University of Alabama School of Law.
  He was in private practice in Mobile for over 20 years and was later 
appointed circuit judge in Mobile County. Judge Byrd was a dedicated 
member of the Mobile community. During my time as an attorney in 
Mobile, I had the privilege of practicing in his court where he 
conducted himself with immense dignity and professionalism. Judge Byrd 
recently passed away, but his impact will live on.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Alabama's First Congressional District, 
I want to share my deepest sympathies with his wife, Mary, and his 
three daughters. Judge Byrd will never be forgotten.
