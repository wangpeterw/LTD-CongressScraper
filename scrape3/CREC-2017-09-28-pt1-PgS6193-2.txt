                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  God of grace and glory, lift us with Your might. You are our 
security, our hope for years to come.
  Lord, give our Senators such confidence in Your power that they will 
celebrate the victories that are yet to be. May they never forget the 
inheritance that belongs to all who love and serve Your will on Earth. 
Provide them with the wisdom to know that You are the only sure 
foundation for all their strivings. Remind them that unless You protect 
the Nation, its leaders and citizens labor in vain.
  Eternal Spirit, great and marvelous are Your works, just and true are 
Your ways.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
