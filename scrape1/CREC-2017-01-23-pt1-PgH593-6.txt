                   IF PRESIDENT TRUMP WERE A DEMOCRAT

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, just think what the media would be 
saying about President Trump if he were a Democrat:

       He has tremendous energy. He campaigned for 18 months, puts 
     in 15-hour days, and has the stamina of a bull elephant like 
     Teddy Roosevelt.
       He is courageous, even fearless. Given the amount of hate 
     directed his way, no doubt he constantly receives death 
     threats. But that doesn't curtail his public appearances or 
     seem to worry him in the least.
       He has conviction. He practices what he preaches. He 
     doesn't waffle or waver. And he is obviously not deterred by 
     media criticism.
       He is a great father. Anytime his son or daughter calls, he 
     picks up the phone. He includes them in his activities. 
     Clearly, he has a strong relationship with his children.
       He is off to a fast start. His Cabinet consists of smart, 
     experienced, and successful individuals. He already has taken 
     steps to keep jobs in America, put unnecessary regulations on 
     hold, and improve health care. Consumer confidence is at a 
     16-year high.

  No, the national liberal media won't print that or air it or post it. 
Better to get your news directly from the President. In fact, it might 
be the only way to get the unvarnished truth.
