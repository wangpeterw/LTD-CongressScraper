                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God, our Father, in these turbulent and uncertain times use our 
lawmakers to live to bless others, bringing glory to Your Name with 
their sacrificial service. Lord, give them wisdom to persevere through 
the difficult, to stay calm when facing the irritating, and to 
experience Your peace even when things go wrong. Enable them to be 
helpful to the challenged, kind to the needy, and sympathetic to those 
whose hearts are bruised by life's setbacks. Surround our Senators with 
Your protection and the shield of Your Divine favor, bringing them to 
Your expected end.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
