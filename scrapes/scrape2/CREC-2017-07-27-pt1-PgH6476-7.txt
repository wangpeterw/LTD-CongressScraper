                      WELCOMING DR. GEORGE DILLARD

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
Ferguson) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. George Dillard, 
whose leadership and guidance have made him a valuable member of the 
community in Peachtree City and Georgia's Third District.

  George was born in 1958, in Jacksonville, Florida, while his dad 
served in the Navy. He grew up in the Eastpoint Christian Church where 
he was ordained into ministry in 1982.
  He graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Atlanta Christian 
College in 1983, and answered the call for the First Christian Church 
in Rincon, Georgia, in 1985, where he began his first full-time 
ministry.
  In 1993, George and his family moved to Peachtree City to serve the 
Peachtree City Christian Church, where he continues today.
  George has been married to his wife, Renee, since 1988, and they have 
three children and one grandchild. George and his family live in 
Peachtree City, Georgia.
  I want to commend Dr. Dillard for his commitment to our community. 
There is not a week that goes by where George isn't a visible and 
welcoming part of the Fayette County community.
  The grace and love he has shown his parishioners and neighbors 
throughout his 24 years in Peachtree City is unparalleled.
  I am truly honored to have Dr. George Dillard here with us here 
today.
