                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  God of the universe, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Concerns about budget, taxes, immigration, among others, reveal the 
considerable divisions both in Congress and among the American populace 
as well. Meanwhile, advocacy groups of many persuasions, from the 
National Down Syndrome Society to the Small Arts and Crafts 
Association, visit the offices of Members all over Capitol Hill.
  As opinions and emotions surge loudly and with little indication of 
easy solution, we take this quiet moment to ask Your blessing upon the 
Members of this people's House.
  We thank You again that we have a Nation steadied by the 
Constitution, and that our participative form of government, difficult 
as it is, continues to model for the world the values of freedom rooted 
in a respect for all Your children.
  May all that is done this day be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
