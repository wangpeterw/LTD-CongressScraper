               WHERE ARE THE WOMEN ON THE AHCA COMMITTEE?

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, this is a picture 
of the committee our Republican colleagues in the Senate have put 
together and tasked with crafting a healthcare bill that will affect 
the healthcare of tens of millions of American women.
  And just a quick glance at his poster tells you that there is not one 
person on this committee who will ever bear a child or need maternity 
care. There is no one on this committee that will ever need a 
mammogram. No one on this committee will ever have to worry about 
having their access to affordable contraceptives or prenatal care taken 
away from them.
  Yet, the House bill that was delivered to the Senate callously would 
make healthcare services and insurance coverage either unaffordable or 
unavailable to millions of struggling hardworking women.
  So, once again, we find that our Republican colleagues are making 
life-altering decisions without a single woman at the table, ignoring 
the very real, very cruel effects of the House-passed bill on American 
women and families.
  So, once again, Mr. Speaker, we ask: Where are the women?
