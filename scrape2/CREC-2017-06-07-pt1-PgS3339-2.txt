   SENATE RESOLUTION 187--CONGRATULATING AND HONORING FERMI NATIONAL 
    ACCELERATOR LABORATORY ON 50 YEARS OF GROUNDBREAKING DISCOVERIES

  Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 187

       Whereas, in 2017, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory 
     (referred to in this preamble as ``Fermilab'') celebrates the 
     50th anniversary of the date on which the first employees of 
     Fermilab started work in Illinois, June 15, 1967;
       Whereas Fermilab drives scientific discovery by building 
     and operating world-leading particle accelerator and detector 
     facilities, performing pioneering research with national and 
     global partners, and developing new technologies for science 
     that support the industrial competitiveness of the United 
     States;
       Whereas Fermilab provides research facilities for 4,500 
     scientists from 50 countries;
       Whereas research at Fermilab led to the discovery of the 3 
     building blocks of the universe, the bottom quark in 1977, 
     the top quark in 1995, and the tau neutrino in 2000;
       Whereas superconducting magnets developed at Fermilab led 
     to the advancement of magnetic resonance imaging medical 
     diagnostics;
       Whereas Fermilab contributed critical components, computing 
     capabilities, and scientific expertise to the 2012 discovery 
     of the Higgs boson in Geneva, Switzerland;
       Whereas Fermilab continues to lead scientific discoveries, 
     including planning construction for the Long-Baseline 
     Neutrino Facility to power the Deep Underground Neutrino 
     Experiment; and
       Whereas Fermilab demonstrates its strong commitment to 
     developing a diverse workforce for the future in the fields 
     of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through 
     educational programs that bring more than 15,000 K-12 
     students to visit Fermilab each year: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) congratulates and honors the Fermi National Accelerator 
     Laboratory on the semicentennial of the Laboratory; and
       (2) wishes the Laboratory success in continuing to help the 
     people of the United States understand the mysteries of 
     matter, energy, space, and time.
