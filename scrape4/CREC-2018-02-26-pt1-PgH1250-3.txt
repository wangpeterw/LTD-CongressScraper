                   RECOGNIZING MAJOR SANDRA STOQUERT

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major Sandra 
Stoquert of Camden, New York, an outstanding member of our community. 
Major Stoquert recently took command of the 109th Aircraft Maintenance 
Squadron at the New York Air National Guard's 109th Airlift Wing, based 
out of Stratton Air National Guard Base in Scotia, New York.
  Major Stoquert joined the New York Air National Guard in 1996, after 
serving in both the Army and the Navy Reserves. In 2004, she was 
commissioned as an officer and since then has served in Iraq at Balad 
Air Base and was deployed to New Orleans in 2005, to assist in the 
response to Hurricane Katrina.
  Since returning to upstate New York, Major Stoquert has remained 
active in the community. In 2013, she was named the public affairs 
officer for the 174th Attack Wing based out of Syracuse, New York. She 
served as a school counselor at Adirondack Central School District in 
Boonville, New York, as well as on the board for the Central New York 
Veteran's Outreach Center in Utica.
  I would like to take this time to thank Major Stoquert for her years 
of service to our country and community. She is an inspiration to all 
and a wonderful community leader.
