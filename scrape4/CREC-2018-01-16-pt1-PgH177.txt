                 MEDIA DISDAIN FOR THE AMERICAN FAMILY

  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we already knew, from their daily 
attacks, that the media disdained the President. What we didn't know 
with a certainty, until last week, was that the media also disdained 
the American family.
  How else to explain their front-paging and televising, at all hours, 
a four-letter expletive that would be seen by children across America?
  CNN reportedly used the word 195 times in one day. Sad.
  There was a time when the media would show some respect for family 
values, but no more. Words that might have been omitted or not spelled 
out are now broadcast in their entirety. That is the media's decision 
to make, but it is a poor decision for the American family.
