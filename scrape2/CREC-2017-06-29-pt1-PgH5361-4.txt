            A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today, I will become the first 
House Democrat in Congress to introduce a balanced budget amendment to 
the Constitution. My bill will prohibit the Federal Government from 
spending more than it receives except in the case of war or recession.

[[Page H5362]]

  Democrats and Republicans may not always agree on the best way to 
balance the budget, but we all care about our country and our children, 
and both are at risk unless we rein in our unsustainable deficits and 
debt.
  In 45 of the last 50 years, the Federal Government spent more than it 
received. The Federal debt has ballooned to over $14 trillion. That is 
77 percent of GDP, a figure that is expected to reach 150 percent in 30 
years if we do not change course.
  Just as every family is expected to balance their budget, so, too, 
should the Federal Government. This is about taking responsibility and 
making tough decisions, exactly what our constituents elected us to do.
  A balanced budget amendment will compel Congress to walk the walk, 
not just talk the talk, when it comes to being responsible stewards of 
taxpayer dollars. I hope my colleagues on both sides of aisle will 
support this bill.
