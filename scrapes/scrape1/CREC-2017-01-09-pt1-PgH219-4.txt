                NECESSARY STEPS TO RESTORE OUR DEMOCRACY

  (Mr. KHANNA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I am the son of immigrants, born in 
Philadelphia as the Nation celebrated our bicentennial. I ran for 
Congress because we have lost sight of our founding ideals. In 
Federalist 10, James Madison warned that factions, with their own 
special interests, may undermine the public good.
  Today, Congress is crippled by these factions: powerful PACs and 
lobbyists. This must change. I am proud to be one of six Members who 
refuse all contributions from PACs, and we need a bipartisan caucus to 
eradicate their influence.
  We also cannot let congressional seats become feudal estates. The 
turnover rate here in the people's House is less than European 
monarchies. Congress desperately needs a 12-year term limit like there 
is in the California legislature.
  Mr. Speaker, banning PAC money and instituting term limits are 
necessary steps to restore our democracy.
