                 ROLLINS DEMOCRACY PROJECT IS A SUCCESS

  (Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Speaker, in a nationwide competition, 
Rollins College achieved one of the highest student voter turnout rates 
in the 2016 Presidential election.
  I want to recognize the hardworking students and faculty at the 
Rollins Democracy Project for this accomplishment, which reflects the 
school's commitment to preparing the next generation of engaged 
citizens and global leaders.
  As Justice Brandeis once observed, the only title in our democracy 
superior to that of President is the title of citizen.
  Our democracy withers when our citizens are disengaged from and 
cynical about the political process. However, it is strongest when our 
citizens are engaged and informed. Our democracy works best when our 
citizens use their voice and their vote to hold elected leaders 
accountable. It thrives when our citizens understand that, while the 
right to vote is sacred, it is only powerful if it is exercised.
  Mr. Speaker, that is why what this school accomplished is so 
important and why I am so proud to represent Rollins College in 
Congress.
