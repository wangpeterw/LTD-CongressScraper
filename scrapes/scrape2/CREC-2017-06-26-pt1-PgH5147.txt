     they have in section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental 
     Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601);
       ``(2) `hazardous substance' has the same meaning it has in

     U.S.C. 9622).
       ``(C) The Secretary shall pay a fee or charge imposed by a

     for that agency to assist in carrying out the Secretary's 
     responsibilities under this section. The Secretary may enter

     the contractor's reasonable, potential, long-term liability.
       ``(c) Environmental Compliance and Restoration Account.--

     known as the Coast Guard Environmental Compliance and 
     Restoration Account. All sums appropriated to carry out the

     section, the Secretary shall take such action as may be 
     necessary and appropriate to insure that female individuals 
     shall be eligible for appointment and admission to the Coast

     relating to that section in the analysis for chapter 27 of 
     that title, are repealed.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Hunter) and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Garamendi) each will control 20 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).


                             General Leave

  Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and to 
include any extraneous material on H.R. 1726.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  After 68 years, H.R. 1726, the Coast Guard Improvement and Reform Act 
will reorganize and modernize title 14, Coast Guard, United States 
Code. Title I of the bill reorganizes existing sections of the code 
within the title to provide a more uniformed, logical structure. It 
makes no substantive changes to the reorganized sections.
  Title II includes amendments to title 14. The Coast Guard requested 
uniformity in how its advisory committees operate. Title II transfers 
the advisory committees to title 14 from title 46 and includes changes 
to ensure uniformity in committee operations.
  Title II also transfers sections in title 33 and 50, dealing with 
port safety into title 14, to colocate them with similar authorities. 
In 2002, port security provisions were similarly reorganized, and this 
follows that pattern. No substantive changes were made to those 
sections either. The transfer allows for better organization of the 
code and makes it easier for the public and the Congress to find the 
governing laws of the Coast Guard.
  Lastly, the title also amends the primary duties of the Coast Guard 
to clarify their defense readiness status, and it repeals an unused 
authority.
  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume.
  Madam Speaker, H.R. 1726 is a noncontroversial bill to reorganize the 
Coast Guard's permanent authorities under title 14 of the U.S. Code in 
order to improve the clarity and the coherence of the title.
  I would like to thank my assistant, and counsel, Dave Jansen, and 
John Rayfield, on the other side, for recognizing that there is 
confusion, and so this legislation, while it makes no substantive 
changes to the Coast Guard's existing authorities and policies under 
title 14, does save for some conforming changes to create a new chapter 
for all of the Coast Guard national advisory councils and execute a 
handful of other minor transfers.
  It just simply ends a lot of confusion as people try to figure out 
where it is in the code that they must look.
  Accordingly, I am comfortable with supporting this legislation, 
although I do note that it will impose some additional administrative 
costs on the Coast Guard as they set about implementing it.
  I want to commend the chairman, Mr. Hunter, for the Coast Guard and 
Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, for his initiative and for his 
staff's initiative, in taking on this important little bit of 
housekeeping that is going to make all of our lives easier. I will 
certainly urge all of the Members to support it.
  I also appreciate Chairman Hunter's work with me in an effort to try 
to

[[Page H5164]]

solve another problem. This is only one piece of our effort to try to 
improve the maritime industry. While we are trying to move H.R. 1726 
today, we have more work to do.
  And to that end, I look forward to working with Chairman Hunter on 
bringing H.R. 2593 to the floor before the August recess, together with 
the full committee chairman, Bill Shuster; and ranking Democrat, Peter 
DeFazio. H.R. 2593 deals with the Federal Maritime Commission 
Authorization Act of 2017.
  This legislation would update and strengthen the Shipping Act to 
address the current upheaval in the global shipping markets that affect 
U.S. foreign trade.
  The formation of three large ocean carrier alliances has raised 
legitimate concerns among U.S. port service providers, maritime 
terminal operators, and tug operators. By virtue of the sheer size and 
volume of trade that these alliances carry, they will have a decided 
advantage in determining ports of call, negotiating contracts, and 
shifting costs, all at the expense, possibly, of our domestic port 
service providers.
  I know Chairman Hunter shares my concerns, and neither of us are 
indifferent. We are going to have to deal with this, and that will be 
our next piece of legislation on the floor. The chairman is on top of 
it with his staff, and we look forward to that bill, H.R. 2593, being 
reported out of the Transportation Committee as it clarifies the 
Federal Maritime Commission's authority to oversee and aggressively 
deal with competition.
  So what we have today is one of two pieces of legislation that we 
intend to move forward dealing with the overall well-being of the 
maritime industry.
  I highly recommend H.R. 1726 to the floor. It is noncontroversial and 
should pass. The other piece of legislation will be here shortly, and 
we will take that up at that time.
  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the gentleman's 
remarks and thank him for all of his hard work, and especially Dave 
Jansen and John Rayfield, the two Coast Guard savants of the staff on 
the Transportation Committee. Those are the gentlemen who did this, who 
really understand this code, and who made it better for future Congress 
and future staff, so they can actually see what is going on with the 
Coast Guard, and maybe the Coast Guard might understand what is going 
on with the Coast Guard a little bit better.
  I would like to reiterate that H.R. 1726 is a straightforward bill. 
It reorganizes title 14 and does not make any substantive changes.
  Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support it, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the 
gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 1726.
  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was passed.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
