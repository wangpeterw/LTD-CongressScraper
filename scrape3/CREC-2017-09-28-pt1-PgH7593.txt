                           HEALTHCARE CRISIS

  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, we are here, almost 10 months into this 
congressional session, and what has been accomplished? While TrumpCare 
supporters have gone back and forth on a plan that would take 
healthcare away from millions of Americans, raise out-of-pocket costs 
for people with preexisting conditions, and force too many rural 
hospitals to close their doors, they have completely missed a real 
healthcare crisis that is coming tomorrow. That is when Federal funding 
runs out for thousands of community health clinics and for millions of 
low-income children and for pregnant women across our country.
  For years, community health clinics and the Children's Health 
Insurance Program have enjoyed strong bipartisan support from both 
sides of the aisle here.
  So why aren't we voting to protect these critical programs right now? 
Mr. Speaker, we were sent here to help the hardworking families that we 
serve and offer them a better deal. Now that the TrumpCare package has 
thankfully failed again, I hope we can start doing that.
