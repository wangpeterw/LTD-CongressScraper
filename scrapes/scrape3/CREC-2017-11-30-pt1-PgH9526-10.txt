            RECOGNIZING BILL GIBBS FROM SPRINGPORT, MICHIGAN

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bill Gibbs from 
Springport, Michigan, and congratulate him for being named Jackson 
County Veteran of the Year.
  A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting Bill at VFW Post 6056 
during their Veterans Day ceremony. It was a special evening with a 
room full of heroes, none more so than Bill.
  When our country called during the Vietnam war, Bill answered with 
tremendous bravery. For his heroism in

harm's way, Bill was awarded the Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars with 
valor device, and a number of other service medals.
  Over the years, Bill has done it all at Post 6056, including serving 
as post commander, trustee, post historian, and quartermaster for 33 
years. When called upon, he performs as an honor guard member at 
military funerals in the community.
  Mr. Speaker, for all this and much more, Bill is incredibly deserving 
of the Veteran of the Year award, and our Nation is eternally grateful 
for his service and sacrifice. Thank you, Bill Gibbs, and welcome home.
