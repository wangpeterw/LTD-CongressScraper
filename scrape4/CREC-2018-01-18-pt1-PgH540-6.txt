                  REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN DOUG BARNARD

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a legend 
who represented the great people of Augusta, Georgia, for 16 years, in, 
yes, the United States House of Representatives.
  Last week, former Congressman Doug Barnard, Jr., passed away at the 
age of 95 in his beloved hometown.
  Although Congressman Barnard served at a very different time in our 
Nation's history, many of the issues discussed then are the same that 
we are talking about today, like tax reform, immigration reform, and 
financial regulatory reform.

  A World War II veteran, a lawyer, and a banker, Congressman Barnard 
made his mark as a well-respected leader of the House Banking 
Committee. He was willing to work across the aisle to do what was best 
for the people of Augusta and all Americans.
  I was very pleased that Doug introduced and offered his support to me 
when I made my announcement to run for Congress. Over the years, I have 
sought his advice, and I have always cherished his mentorship.
  Doug Barnard was a great man of faith, a friend, and a statesman. He 
will always be remembered and will be sorely missed--not only by me, 
but the entire Augusta community.
