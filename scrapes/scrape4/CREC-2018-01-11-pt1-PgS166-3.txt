              RECOGNIZING MONTANA YOUTH CHALLENGE ACADEMY

 Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor 
of recognizing the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Academy (MYCA), located in 
Dillon, MT. The MYCA is sponsored by the Montana National Guard and the 
State of Montana and assists at-risk youth in our state to develop the 
skills necessary to become productive citizens. This academy focuses on 
the physical, emotional and educational

needs of the youth using a quasi-military style technique of discipline 
and motivation. To date, they have graduated over two thousand 
students.
  I would like to thank six of the original staff who began work at 
MYCA when it opened in 1999 and who are still employed there today. 
Director Jan Rouse, Deputy Director Trent Gibson, Lead Teacher Carolyn 
Bielser, Lead Counselor Ben Stewart, Counselor Tammy Pittman and Cadre 
Team Leader Cheryl Miskowic have spent years working to help Montana's 
at-risk youth and their work has touched the lives of many. Along with 
the other staff at MYCA, they have helped students become contributing 
members of our Montana communities. Thank you to all those working hard 
at the Montana Youth ChalleNGe Academy in Beaverhead County.
