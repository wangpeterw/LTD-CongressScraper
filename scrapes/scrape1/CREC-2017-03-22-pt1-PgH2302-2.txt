                    ACA AND THE STRONGER GENERATION

  (Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the President and I do agree 
on one thing: designing a healthcare system is complicated.
  But the effects of TrumpCare are as simple as they are devastating: 
24 million hardworking Americans will lose their coverage; your 
healthcare costs and premiums will go up, and your coverage will go 
down; and for those of us between the ages of 50 and 64, we are about 
to be hit with an age tax just when we need coverage the most, just 
when we are trying to help with college tuition and save for our 
retirement. As we face an opiate crisis in this country that takes 120 
American lives a day, TrumpCare will close the door on treatment for 
over 1 million Americans.
  Our President tells us that he is a dealmaker. This is the ultimate 
bad deal for the American people, and we should reject this bill.
