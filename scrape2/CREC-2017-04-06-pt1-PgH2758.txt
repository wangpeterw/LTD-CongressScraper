            CONGRATULATIONS TO MICHAEL HAIN OF NITTANY MEDIA

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Michael Hain, general manager and chief technology officer of Nittany 
Media, for being named Independent Tech Executive of the Year by 
Cablefax magazine.
  Michael was a second-generation executive. Nittany Media is a locally 
owned and operated cable provider that has served rural Pennsylvania 
since 1957. They are credited with bringing the internet to some very 
rural areas as early as 1997.
  His parents, Harry and Anna Hain, founded the business, and Michael 
has been actively involved since he was a child. He climbed his first 
cable tower at age 3 during a neighbor's barbecue. Michael told a news 
outlet: ``When the other kids were going down to the river fishing, my 
dad and I were going up to the mountain with an inch-and-a-quarter mast 
with an antenna. And we were fishing too; fishing for a distant 
signal.''
  A love for cable runs deep for Michael Hain.
  On behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of 
Pennsylvania, I extend my sincere congratulations to Michael Hain of 
Nittany Media for this outstanding achievement.
