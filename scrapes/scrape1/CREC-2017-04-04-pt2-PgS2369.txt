     organization of the 1st Infantry Division;
       Whereas the 1st Infantry Division was established in 1917 
     as the First Division, the first combat division in United 
     States history, and has been on continuous active duty since 
     1917;
       Whereas, from the heroic start of the 1st Infantry 
     Division, the 1st Infantry Division has played an integral

     the Battle of Cantigny, France, was the first United States

     repeated counterattacks, and bolstered the morale of the 
     Allies;
