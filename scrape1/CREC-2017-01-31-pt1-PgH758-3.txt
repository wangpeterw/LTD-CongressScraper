                             INMATE MANNING

  (Mr. ROGERS of Alabama asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, I rise to share my disgust and 
contempt for the former President's decision to commute the sentence of 
inmate Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning. Manning's 
commutation was even opposed by President Obama's Secretary of Defense, 
Ash Carter.
  According to press reports, after Manning released over 450,000 Army 
field reports and intelligence reports, plus over 200,000 diplomatic 
cables, the Taliban went on a killing spree--taking out everyone who 
seemed to fit the description of individuals working with the U.S. It 
was indiscriminate killing.
  Madam Speaker, we are hearing the usual handwringing this morning 
from President Trump's critics about the impacts of his executive order 
on those who helped us in Iraq and Afghanistan. These individual voices 
would be much more credible if they had criticized President Obama for 
his irresponsible commutation of inmate Manning.
  President Obama may be gone, thankfully, but we are still suffering 
from his irresponsible decisions. Change has finally come to America, 
Madam Speaker. Manning and other enemies of our Nation should be on 
notice.
