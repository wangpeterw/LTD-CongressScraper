                MONTANANS DEALING WITH FEDERAL OVERREACH

  (Mr. GIANFORTE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIANFORTE. Mr. Speaker, I met last week with a couple of small 
business owners in Butte, Montana, who have been the target of an out-
of-control Federal bureaucrat in the Food Safety and Inspection 
Service.
  One of the bureaucrat's targets is Riley's Meats. Over a period of 12 
years, Dr. Jeffrey Legg with the FSIS ordered Bart Riley to comply with 
what he told Riley were Federal regulations.
  Mr. Riley spent over $10,000 in compliance costs and suffered years 
of harassment, but these weren't real Federal regulations. They were 
costly measures dreamed up by this bureaucrat.
  I saw the toll that dealing with this government harassment has taken 
on the Riley family over the last decade.
  No one should have to endure such a nightmare. Stories like these are 
why the American people demand that Washington is cleaned up.
  For the Riley family and other Montanans dealing with Federal 
overreach, I will continue to focus on this issue until it is resolved.
