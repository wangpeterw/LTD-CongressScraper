                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Our Father in Heaven, increase our faith until we are no longer awed 
by life's challenging seasons. Direct our Senators in their work, using 
them to fulfill Your Divine purposes. Lord, remind them that all things 
are possible to those who believe in Your prevailing providence. We 
acknowledge this day our great need of Your sustaining power so that we 
can walk without stumbling or slipping along life's pilgrim pathway. 
Help us to remember that faith without works is dead.
  We pray in Your merciful Name. Amen.
