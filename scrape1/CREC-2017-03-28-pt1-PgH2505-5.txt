                    STEMMING THE TIDE OF JOB LOSSES

  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, recently while announcing his manufacturing 
jobs initiative, President Trump said: ``Everything is going to be 
based on bringing our jobs back. The good jobs, the real jobs. They 
have to come back.''
  Well, this month, more than 700 idled U.S. Steel workers in Lorain, 
Ohio, were notified they will permanently lose their jobs come this 
June. Lorain has lost over 1,000 steel jobs since 2015. It is ground 
zero on the trade and jobs front. This stalwart town and its dear 
people have been battered by continuing job washout in steel due to 
unfair trade practices and closed markets abroad, particularly with 
China and Russia.
  Through no fault of their own, workers in too many of America's steel 
towns are hurting because of foreign product dumped on U.S. soil 
undercutting our very way of life.
  Last week, I invited Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to visit Lorain 
to witness firsthand the urgency of stabilizing our manufacturing 
sector and fulfilling President Trump's job promises of only a few 
months ago.
  If our Nation is going to stem the tide of job losses caused by one-
sided trade deals on an uneven global playing field, there is no better 
place to start than Lorain, Ohio. Please, President Trump and Commerce 
Secretary Ross, come to Lorain, Ohio.
