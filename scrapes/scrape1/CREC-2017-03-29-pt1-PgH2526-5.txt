                  WELCOMING REVEREND ROBERT DILLINGHAM

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
Shimkus) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Robert 
Dillingham who led us in the opening prayer. He is a pastor in the 
Illinois Great Rivers Conference of the United Methodist Church where 
he serves Farina, Illinois.
  Reverend Dillingham is both a chaplain and a volunteer firefighter 
with the Farina Fire Department and is also a chaplain with the Mutual 
Aid Box Alarm System, division 54. He serves as a hospice chaplain with 
the Hospital Sisters Health Systems through St. Anthony's Memorial 
Hospital in Effingham, Illinois, where he serves patients from over 20 
counties in the central part of my congressional district.
  In addition to his service as chaplain, Reverend Dillingham is also 
on the board of the Farina food pantry and is a clergy care guide, 
where he is a pastoral presence in the lives of over 70 pastors.
  It is my honor to welcome Reverend Dillingham and his wife, Ashley, 
who is in the gallery today, and personally thank him for offering this 
morning's prayer.
