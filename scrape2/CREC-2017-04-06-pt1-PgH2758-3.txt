                 HONORING THE PERRY TECHNICAL INSTITUTE

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Perry 
Technical Institute, a technical school serving the students of the 
Yakima Valley in Washington's Fourth Congressional District.
  Since its founding, Perry Tech has focused on educating and preparing 
students for real-world employment in fields such as welding, 
instrumentation, carpentry, machining, and manufacturing. These 
programs provide students practical experience as well as skills in 
time management, goal setting, and financial literacy.
  A recent study of economic mobility conducted of nearly 700 technical 
schools from around the Nation ranked Perry Tech number one for having 
graduates move from low income into the top 20 percent of earners. With 
an astoundingly high job placement rate of 93 percent, it is clear that 
Perry Technical Institute is providing its students with the skills 
they need to excel in the workplace.
  Please join me in celebrating Perry Technical Institute's success.
