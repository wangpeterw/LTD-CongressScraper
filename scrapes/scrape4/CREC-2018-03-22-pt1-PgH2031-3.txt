                            MARY'S CUPBOARD

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the 
issue of food insecurity, affecting nearly 1.6 million people in my 
home State of Pennsylvania. In our district, that is 1.6 million too 
many.
  I am proud to recognize the efforts of Mary's Cupboard in Levittown, 
Pennsylvania, a food pantry which has served nearly 86,000 individuals 
since its inception in 1976. Operating in conjunction with Catholic 
Social Services, Mary's Cupboard offers both perishable and 
nonperishable food items. Their standard practice is to provide a 
family with 5 days' worth of food.
  I would like to recognize founder Marion Slack and operations 
coordinators Betty Rommet and Ann Hyjurick, who, along with the 
assistance of partnering parishes St. Ignatius in Yardley, St. Andrew 
in Newton, St. Cyril of Jerusalem in Jamison, and St. Michael the 
Archangel in Levittown, bring hope and peace of mind to their neighbors 
on a daily basis.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of us to follow their lead and work to 
eradicate hunger in all of our communities.
