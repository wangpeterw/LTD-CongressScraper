                       WHAT MY CONSTITUENTS WANT

  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I made a promise to my constituents when 
they sent me back to office this year. They entrusted me to represent 
them on the issues that affect them the most.
  They sent me here to repeal ObamaCare, our health system. Our health 
insurance system is crushing those that it is supposed to help.
  They sent me here to remove Washington bureaucrats from the 
healthcare business and to restore the doctor-patient relationship that 
has broken down. If ObamaCare has shown us anything, it is that 
coverage and affordable care are two very different things.
  They sent me here for sweeping tax reform that benefits every 
American, to create a tax structure that rewards American workers and 
American businesses.
  Lastly, they sent me here to make sure that we secure our borders and 
enforce our border laws because border security is national security.
  Mr. Speaker, these are the issues this House should be tackling.
