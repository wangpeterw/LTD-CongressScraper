                     CONGRATULATING MANNIE JACKSON

  (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mannie Jackson, a legendary basketball player at both the University of 
Illinois and Edwardsville High School, on his induction into the 
Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
  Born in a railroad boxcar in southern Missouri, Mannie excelled at 
Edwardsville High School before attending the University of Illinois. 
He was one of the first African-American letter winners and starters 
for the Illini. After graduating, Mannie played for the Harlem 
Globetrotters.
  While Mannie was a tremendous player, he also purchased the 
Globetrotters and helped revive the franchise, leading the team to 12 
straight years of double-digit growth.
  Mannie also continued his career as a philanthropist. He founded the 
Illinois

Academic Enrichment and Leadership Program at the University of 
Illinois and has partnered with leaders at Lewis and Clark Community 
College to create the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities.
  I have had the privilege of meeting Mannie on multiple occasions and 
have nothing but admiration and respect for what he does to help 
others. It is an honor to congratulate him on his induction to the 
Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, but I am even more proud to recognize 
all of the contributions he has made to this world.
