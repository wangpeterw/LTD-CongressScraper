                     BRING DREAM ACT TO HOUSE FLOOR

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, college students everywhere 
are enjoying the last days of vacation before heading back to school. 
But for thousands of people, this break was spent trying to figure out 
how to stay in the only home they have ever known.
  There have been multiple stories of young DREAMers being detained 
over this holiday break. These are stellar students who attend elite 
schools, like UC San Diego and UC Berkeley. They are now sitting in 
detention facilities, unable to go back to school and continue their 
education.
  Is this the America that our forefathers fought for, one where bright 
students sit in detention facilities instead of classrooms, questioning 
if they can ever make the contribution to our United States of America 
that they dream of?
  Mr. Speaker, I once again plead with you, with all due respect, to 
please bring the Dream Act to the floor. The American people 
overwhelmingly support it.
