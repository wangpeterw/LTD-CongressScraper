                 CONGRATULATING THE EDEN PRAIRIE EAGLES

  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie 
boys football team for winning their 11th

Minnesota State championship this last week.
  The Eagles prevailed 38-17 in the championship matchup. They finished 
their 2017 season with an undefeated 13-0 record.
  Eden Prairie was led by senior running back Solo Falaniko, who rushed 
for 90 yards on 22 carries and scored a touchdown, as well as senior 
all-purpose Antonio Montero, who had 58 yards rushing with three 
touchdowns.
  Mr. Speaker, it takes commitment, perseverance, and hard work to 
become State champions. It is even more impressive, considering that 
these team members and student athletes consistently and successfully 
balance schoolwork and other extracurricular activities with their 
athletics. That is why I commend these athletes.
  Congratulations to the players, the coaches, the parents, and all the 
fans of the Eden Prairie football team on your State title. Our entire 
community is very proud of your accomplishment.
  Go Eagles.
