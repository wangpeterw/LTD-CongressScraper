                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Loving God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  While Members come to the end of a long weekend of constituent 
visits, bless them and those with whom they consult among those they 
represent with wisdom, patience, and generosity as they seek law and 
policy that benefits not only local interests but, where possible, the 
greater common good of our country.
  We again ask You to impel those who possess power here in the Capitol 
to be mindful of those Americans who possess little or no power, most 
especially in these days those recovering in Puerto Rico.
  Finally, we are mindful of yet another natural disaster unfolding in 
California, with massive wildfires. We ask You to protect those who 
combat these fires and comfort those who have or will lose their homes 
and possessions.
  May all that is done today be for Your greater honor and glory.
  Amen.
