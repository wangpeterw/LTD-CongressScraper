       RECOGNIZING JOHN LEWIS AND DENNY BARNEY OF MARICOPA COUNTY

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize two gentlemen in 
my district: John Lewis and Denny Barney.
  Since 2015, John Lewis has served as the president and CEO of the 
East Valley Partnership and previously served as the mayor of Gilbert. 
The East Valley Partnership works with our cities and towns to maximize 
their economic potential and to help create jobs. John has done 
exceptional work, and I wish him the best as he and his wife will be 
leaving this summer to serve a church mission in Cambodia.
  Denny Barney is a wonderful choice to replace Mr. Lewis as president 
and CEO. Mr. Barney's record of service in the private sector and on 
the Maricopa Board of Supervisors gives him a unique perspective as he 
accepts this new responsibility. He is a dynamic, bright, and great 
leader. The East Valley Partnership will benefit from his leadership 
for years to come.
  I am grateful for all of our leaders in the East Valley Partnership 
who work diligently to foster an attractive environment for families to 
live and businesses to grow.
