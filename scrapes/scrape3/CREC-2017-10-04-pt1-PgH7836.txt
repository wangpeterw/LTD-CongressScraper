         RECOGNIZING THE WORK AND ACHIEVEMENT OF STEVE HILDRETH

  (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work 
and the achievement of Steve Hildreth, an exemplary employee and member 
of our community. Steve celebrated his retirement last month after 
working for 30 years at the Georgia Pacific Paper Mill in Camas, 
Washington.
  Steve started at the mill in 1987, as sleeter helper in the print 
department. By the time he retired, he held the position of the shift 
team leader for the shift instrumentation technicians. He was well 
respected by the operators and crews of the machines, and he knew the 
job was to make their job easier.
  He was also a member of the Association of Western Pulp and Paper 
Workers union throughout his career and held office in Local 5 for 
several years.
  Fortunately, Steve has options in retirement. According to his wife, 
Shari, he is a true Renaissance man, in that he can build, 
troubleshoot, and fix just about anything. He is spending his time 
remodeling their Washougal home, setting up his new shop, and making 
his way through Shari's extensive honey-do list.
  Mr. Speaker, southwest Washington has been fortunate to have someone 
like Steve Hildreth as an employee, father, husband, grandfather, and 
resident for the past 30 years. I would like to congratulate Steve on 
his retirement and wish him all the best in the years to come.
