                     INDEPENDENT COMMISSION NEEDED

  (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speaker, today, as a member of the House 
Oversight Committee, I had the opportunity to view classified documents 
related to General Michael Flynn's disturbing foreign financial 
relationships.
  I am very proud that Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings 
worked together in a bipartisan fashion to bring those documents before 
our committee. The issue of Russian interference in our democracy is an 
issue that affects everyone. I hope that all Members will have the 
chance to review these critical materials.
  While the information in these documents is classified, I remain 
profoundly disturbed by the additional questions they raised. 
Unfortunately, I also remain very concerned about how they are being 
portrayed by the White House.
  This growing credibility gap between the administration and the 
American people only underscores the need for an independent commission 
to uncover all the facts. I am heartened, however, that today, Chairman 
Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings came together in a bipartisan 
fashion regarding this issue.
