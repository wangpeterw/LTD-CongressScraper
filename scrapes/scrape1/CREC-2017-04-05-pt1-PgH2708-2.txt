                      MAKE OUR GOVERNMENT SAFE ACT

  (Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, today, President Trump finally saw what I 
recognized and what the American people knew months ago: someone like 
Steve Bannon should not hold a security clearance, no less serve on the 
National Security Council.
  Bannon has made numerous inflammatory statements in support of 
overthrowing the United States Government. During an interview on 
August 22, 2016, Bannon referred to himself as ``Leninist,'' saying:
  ``Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal too. I want 
to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's 
establishment.''
  That is what he said, Mr. Speaker. That is why I introduced the Make 
Our Government Safe Act, which would amend the National Security Act of 
1947 to prevent anyone from serving on the National Security Council 
who has made the statements that Steve Bannon did about taking down the 
system.
  My bill would prevent someone who has threatened to destroy the 
government from participating in or attending National Security Council 
meetings. And today I stand a little bit more reassured that Bannon 
will not be serving on the National Security Council.
  Up next: remove him from the White House.
