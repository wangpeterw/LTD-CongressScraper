                        RESCINDING THE COLE MEMO

  (Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that the 
Department of Justice is ignoring States' rights and encouraging the 
prosecution of small cannabis businesses, many of which are in Oregon.
  Earlier this month, the Department of Justice rescinded the Cole 
memo, which had provided Federal guidance to discourage prosecutors 
from charging individuals and businesses with Federal marijuana-related 
crimes in States where marijuana is legal. Oregon is one of those 
States.
  Today, more than 700 small cannabis businesses operate across the 
State, where, like with alcohol, marijuana businesses are licensed, 
regulated, and taxed. These small businesses follow State law, create 
jobs in their communities, and pay taxes, yet now their livelihood is 
threatened because this administration wants to revive the futile war 
on weed.
  This is absurd, especially when the Department of Justice should be 
putting its efforts and its resources into the extremely dangerous and 
addictive heroin and fentanyl.
  Our small cannabis businesses should not be jeopardized by this 
misguided Federal policy. The voters have spoken. Their will must be 
respected.
