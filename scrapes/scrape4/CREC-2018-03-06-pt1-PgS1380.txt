                                 ______
                                 

 SENATE RESOLUTION 424--HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL 
                     GUARD YOUTH CHALLENGE PROGRAM

  Ms. BALDWIN (for herself and Mr. Perdue) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:

                              S. Res. 424

       Whereas the National Guard Youth Challenge Program 
     (referred to in this preamble as the ``Youth Challenge 
     Program'') is celebrating 25 years of providing successful 
     and free alternative education and structured discipline to 
     at-risk youth between the ages of 16 and 18;
       Whereas the Youth Challenge Program was born from the 
     visionary concept of using a ``whole person'' intervention 
     model to combat the effects of gangs, violence, high rates of 
     school dropout, and drug abuse on a generation of youth;
       Whereas the Youth Challenge Program is a federally and 
     State-funded program that offers a unique opportunity for at-
     risk youth to change course at a critical time in life;
       Whereas the multiphased Youth Challenge Program uses quasi-
     military discipline and training, coupled with educational 
     instruction, learning, and mentorship, to promote the 
     character development and resilience of at-risk youth;
       Whereas one phase of the Youth Challenge Program is a 5-
     month residential program that focuses on the following 8 
     core components: life-coping skills, leadership and 
     followership, service to community, job skills, academic 
     excellence, responsible citizenship, health and hygiene, and 
     physical fitness;
       Whereas another phase of the Youth Challenge Program is a 
     12-month mentoring phase that builds on the 8 core components 
     to help shape youth into productive citizens ready for 
     societal success;
       Whereas the Youth Challenge Program offers more than 10,000 
     cadets annually an opportunity to succeed outside of a 
     traditional high school environment;
       Whereas there are currently 40 Youth Challenge programs 
     operating in 28 States, Puerto Rico, and the District of 
     Columbia;
       Whereas more than 160,000 cadets have graduated from the 
     Youth Challenge Program;
       Whereas more than 110,000 academic credentials have been 
     awarded under the Youth Challenge Program; and
       Whereas graduates of the Youth Challenge Program have 
     improved physically and mentally and are poised to become 
     assets to the communities of the graduates and to the United 
     States: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes that the National Guard Youth Challenge 
     Program has been successfully helping at-risk youth for 25 
     years;
       (2) commends the accomplishments of all of the graduates of 
     the National Guard Youth Challenge Program; and
       (3) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to support--
       (A) the National Guard Youth Challenge Program; and
       (B) the critical mission of the National Guard Youth 
     Challenge Program to help and develop the character of at-
     risk youth in the United States.
