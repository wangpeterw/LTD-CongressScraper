                           PROTECTING THE ACA

  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act is not 
a matter of politics. It is a matter of life or death for the people 
back home. In the San Diego region, repeal of the ACA would mean nearly 
300,000 people could lose access to health care.
  I heard from one constituent just this week who was diagnosed with an 
autoimmune disease where the rheumatoid arthritis is not just attacking 
her joints, but her organs as well. She needs a double lung transplant 
to stay alive. Her 7-year-old son, she writes me, tells her, ``Mommy, 
I'm scared. I hope you get your new balloons soon.'' She lives with the 
anxiety and the fear of how the repeal of the ACA may affect her 
treatment every day because of her preexisting condition.
  I implore my Republican colleagues to remember the people that this 
decision will impact. The effect of this repeal has much more important 
consequences than politics. Let's not be responsible for any child who 
sees a mother suffer or even lose her life without the treatment she 
needs.
