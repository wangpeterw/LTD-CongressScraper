                    PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HEALTH CARE

  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, well, here we are, 100 days into President 
Trump's Presidency, and all we have seen is this President break the 
promises that he made when he campaigned for President.
  He promised, for example, that we would have ``everyone covered with 
health care.'' Everyone. Then as President, he broke that promise.
  Last month we saw him put forth his failed and terrible healthcare 
bill, TrumpCare, which would kick 24 million people off their health 
care. And even for those who would receive health care, they would pay 
more for less coverage: higher deductibles, higher prescription costs, 
no guarantee of hospitalization coverage or other essential benefits.
  He is not looking out for the middle class. TrumpCare 2.0 is even 
worse, taking away a guarantee that a person with a preexisting 
condition can get essential lifesaving health care.
  President Trump, I just have one message: Stop it. Stop. Turn back 
from this terrible path you are taking us on. Ensure that all Americans 
have health care. Work with Democrats and Republicans to fix the 
problems we see in the Affordable Care Act, but stop this terrible path 
that you are taking this country on.
