8250,topic-id,236,"Mr.Speaker, I am honored to introduce this resolution with my good friend, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, one of the greatest patriots I have had the honor to come in contact with and a lifelong defender of our freedoms in  This resolution can be boiled down to one point: no bureaucrat should be able to deny an American his or her constitutional rights just because someone else handles their finances.  In the midnight hour of President Obama's last days in office, the Social Security Administration finalized a rule that would allow it to send the name of any beneficiary to the FBI's criminal background check system if they are assigned a representative payee due to mental impairment.  Allowing bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration to determine whether or not a beneficiary is fit to exercise their Second Amendment rights is a clear violation of due process that every American is afforded.  When this awful rule was proposed in 2015, both Representative Sam Johnson of Texas and I introduced legislation to prevent the Social Security Administration from carrying it out. With the introduction of this joint resolution, I am pleased that Congress and the President will now have the opportunity to review and to reverse this terrible rule.  That is why I strongly urge my colleagues, in both the House and the Senate, to pass this resolution and keep the government bureaucracies from putting themselves before the  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH894-3.txt,2244,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,2.0,January
8260,topic-id,422,"Mr.Speaker, the regulatory state in America is alive and well. I wish I could say as much for our economy and our personal freedoms, but I believe that that is about to change thanks in large part to the recent Presidential election.  Over the last 8 years, we have replaced a free enterprise system with a regulatory bureaucracy that has crushed our economy, stifled our innovation, and quashed the great American spirit.  America has never seen such an onslaught of abusive and burdensome actions from the fourth branch of government. The cumulative cost of regulations on our American economy is almost $2 trillion. It costs almost $60 billion just to enforce all the regulations on the books.  Let me give you, though, an example of a regulation that is far worse in its effects than just simply economic burden or burden on our people.  Today, I stand with my friend and great American hero, Sam Johnson, in strong support of H.40 to strike down the Obama administration's last-ditch effort to infringe upon our Second Amendment rights. In the 11th hour, the Obama administration quietly sneaked in a rule that threatens to deny certain Social Security beneficiaries their right to purchase a firearm. Federal law makes it a crime already to possess a firearm if an individual has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to a mental institution. This midnight rule designates Social Security beneficiaries as having a mental impairment simply because they ask someone to manage their finances.  Just because an elderly or disabled individual chooses to delegate their financial responsibilities to another does not make them mentally incompetent, nor does it waive their right to due process. Many people, even in this Chamber, are designated to manage the finances of their parents on Social Security, and they do so because their parents may prefer not to deal with the complexities of our current financial environment.  Not only would this proposed rule be a continuation of the Obama administration's regulatory fiat, it would be irresponsible and dangerous and a breach of one of our fundamental rights. We cannot allow the Federal Government to haphazardly restrict our freedoms and the freedoms of over 4 million law-abiding Americans who would otherwise be responsible gun owners. In fact, they are some of the most vulnerable Americans who need to be able to protect themselves.  As noted by the Founders and in the plain language of our Constitution, the Federal Government shall not infringe upon our right to keep and bear arms.

On March 1, 1867, Nebraska became the 37th State, and much has happened since then. In a century and half, Nebraska has grown to not only be the leader in agriculture, but also in technology and business.

I look forward to working together to do good work for the American people.  Mr.Speaker, firefighters, police, EMS, and other first responders are critical to our Nation's emergency management system. First responders leave their own families, even during disasters, to protect you and me.

First responders focused on rescuing flood victims, while they knew their own homes were flooded and their own families were homeless.  This legislation would require a report on the State and local programs and policies in place to prepare and protect first responders and their families in times of disaster. Taking care of first responders and their families gives our firefighters, police, and other critical emergency personnel the peace of mind to focus on the task at hand, rather than worrying whether their family is safe and taken care of.

8236,topic-id,630,"Mr.Speaker, today I rise to urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to oppose this bill that repeals the Affordable Care Act, and here is why.  I stand here not as a Member of Congress, but as a doctor. When I took the oath to enter medicine, like thousands of other doctors, there are really three basic ethics in there:  Benevolence: to do good.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does not do anything good. It makes it harder for people to get health care.  The second ethic was non-malfeasance: to do no harm.  Mr.Speaker, this bill is going to harm millions of It is going to pull healthcare coverage away from folks. In fact, I have heard from folks who have come to my townhalls and have talked about how the Affordable Care Act has saved their lives. If you pull health care away from them, people are going to get sicker, and some people may potentially die.  And the third ethic is patient autonomy: the ability of patients to make the choices that impact their lives.  Mr.Speaker, this bill does not empower patients to make their own choices. This bill limits those choices. It takes choice away from them.  This is a bad bill that goes against everything that we in the medical profession swear to when we enter the profession. That is why you see doctors standing up and opposing this bill, hospitals opposing this bill, and health plans opposing this bill. That is why, when patients see what is in this bill, you will see American patients pushing back.  If you thought the townhalls have been boisterous over the last few months, just try to pass this bill and take necessary health care away from folks. You are going to see those patients showing up in your townhalls.  Let's talk about some of the good things that have happened in the Affordable Care The Affordable Care Act expanded and made coverage for birth control much more readily available. That is a good thing. Whether you are anti-choice or pro-choice, like I am, it is a good thing. What we have seen by expanding coverage to birth control is the number of unintended pregnancies are near all-time lows. That is what we ought to be doing.  The Affordable Care Act expanded access to preventive health services. We know if we want to bring down the cost of health care, let's diagnose the cancer early. Let's treat it and let's save that life. Let's better manage disease.  Let's not go back to the old days where the patient showed up with the heart attack and then we went into action. That costs us a lot more. Let's prevent that heart attack. Let's provide better access to care.  Mr.Speaker, let's not make the President have to renege on a promise that he made. On the campaign trail and after being inaugurated, the President has said that any healthcare legislation was going to expand coverage, it was going to be cheaper, and it was going to be more accessible to patients.  We know this bill that is being introduced does none of that. It cuts coverage. It is going to be more costly for people and fewer people are going to get it.  Mr.Speaker, don't make the President have to renege and go against the promise that he made. The American public is going to hold him accountable for that.  Mr.Speaker, do the right thing. Let's put American patients first. That is what we as doctors do every day, and that is why, again, doctors are against it, hospitals are against it, and health plans are against it.  Mr.Speaker, let's reject this bill. I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to stand against this bill.

8213,topic-id,907,"Mr.President, today, I introduced the Protect American Families from Unnecessary Registration and Deportation Act of 2017, or the Protect American Families This critical bill would advance civil and human rights by ensuring we protect American immigrants from being wrongfully targeted by the Federal Government because of who they are or how they worship. I thank Senators Elizabeth Warren, Brian Schatz, Ed Markey, Patty Murray, Bernie Sanders, Patrick Leahy, Jeff Merkley, Mazie Hirono, and Ron Wyden for joining me on this important legislation.  Enshrined in the Constitution are the ideas that all people are free to practice the religion of their choice and that we will not discriminate because of your faith or national origin. Creating a Federal immigration program that requires people to register their status with the Federal Government on the basis of their religion, race, ethnicity, gender, age, nationality, national origin, or citizenship is contrary to those values. Because the United States is the world's beacon of democracy, we must lead by example and live the values we preach.  Yet, in troubling times we have not always stayed true to our values. During World War II, soon after Imperial Japan attacked United States Naval Base Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066. That order authorized the Secretary of War to designate particular areas as military zones, which allowed for the removal of Japanese Americans from certain parts of the United Subsequently, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were relocated to internment camps.  Similarly, in 2002, the year following the tragic terrorist attacks on September 11, the Federal Government created the National Security Entry-Exist Registration System, This Federal program required non-citizen visa holders from certain countries to register with the Federal The registration process included fingerprinting, photographs, and interrogation. Once an individual registered, NSEERS required the person to regularly check in with immigration officials. Finally, NSEERS monitored people who registered with the program to ensure that no one remained in the country longer than the law permitted them.  Inconsistent with the American values of religious freedom and nondiscrimination, the NSEERS program wrongly targeted males over 16 years old from the following countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Eritrea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and North Thus, 24 out of the 25 countries listed in the NSEERS program were Arab and Muslim countries. This was another moment in our nation's history where our leaders succumbed to the politics of[[Page S117]]fear and adopted a program that tore at the very fabric of our country.  Immigration-registry programs do not make the public more safe. The purpose of NSEERS was to identify and capture terrorists. Yet, despite registering over 83,000 people, the program yielded zero terrorism convictions. Without proof of a single terrorist related conviction, the NSEERS program did not do its job of keeping the homeland safe.  But immigration-registry programs do result in discrimination. The fact that NSEERS led to the forced registry, interrogation, and deportations of immigrants from predominantly Muslim or Arab countries is proof that broadly defined enforcement programs often result in racial and religious profiling. That is why the United Nations and major American civil rights groups condemned NSEERS for unfairly singling out By targeting Muslims, NSEERS sent the wrong message that America does not welcome immigrants from certain lands.  While the Obama administration dismantled the NSEERS program, this alone will not prevent the incoming administration from attempting to follow through on its threats to create a registry based on religion or national origin. On the campaign trail President-elect Trump called for a ``total and complete shutdown'' of Muslim immigrants entering the United Additionally, he has called for ``extreme vetting'' of immigrants reminiscent of It is incumbent upon congressional leaders to ensure that the United States does not sacrifice its values in the face of fear.  Today, I introduce the Protect American Families Act to ensure that America protects the rights and liberties of American immigrants from overly broad, ineffective, and discriminatory registry programs. This bill would prohibit the Federal Government from requiring noncitizens to register or check in with the Federal Government simply because of their religion, race, ethnicity, age, gender, national origin, nationality, or citizenship. Banning the creation of a discriminatory registration program is not only consistent with our democratic values, but it allows law enforcement to focus resources on the real threats to our safety.  The bill has commonsense exemptions. Data collection is critical in our fight against terrorists, and the bill allows the government to collect routine data on the entry and exit of noncitizens. The bill would also protect important immigration programs like Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Enforced Departure, the Visa Waiver Program, and Deferred Action for Childhood This provision makes clear that legitimate Federal programs that confer immigration benefits are not prohibited by the ban on enforcement immigration programs that target immigrants and other vulnerable  In his First Inaugural Address, President Roosevelt said that ``the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Unfortunately, he failed to live up to that statement when he issued Executive Order 9066. But we have a chance to fulfill that vision. We have a chance to stand up against fear and stay true to our American values in the face of hardship. I am proud to introduce the Protect American Families Act today, and I urge my colleagues to support its speedy passage through the                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS114.txt,2194,WORKING TOGETHER ON THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT,2017.0,5.0,January

8219,topic-id,7280,"Mr.President, I rise in support of Carson for Secretary of Housing and Urban However, I just can't resist, as I listened to my friend Senator Cornyn--and I do like and respect Senator Cornyn, and I do mean that. It is always said here, but I actually do. I am just amused by the term ``obstructionism.'' This President was 100 yards down the hall speaking last night and still hasn't put any legislative proposals forward--nothing on immigration except Executive orders; nothing on infrastructure even though Democrats have followed the four corners, if you will, of his proposal, $1 trillion over 10 years--put ink to paper and actually written a real plan that includes public transit, that includes highways and bridges and water and sewer and housing and airports and ports and all of the things we do in doing it right on infrastructure, on public works. So we are all still waiting.  The President has made a lot of speeches. Last night he was not as combative as usual. That was welcome. I think we all, as Senator Cornyn said, applauded that. But we are still looking for substance. We are looking for one bill. Repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act--what does that mean? He still hasn't given us anything specific. They have been voting on replacing and repealing the Affordable Care Act for more than a decade, but they still don't have a plan.  If we listen to the Governor from my home State, the State where the Presiding Officer grew up--they should listen to our Republican Governor, who admonishes colleagues here: Don't repeal the Affordable Care Act unless you have a way to take care of 700,000 Ohioans who have lost their insurance under Medicaid; not to mention 100,000 who will lose their insurance who are on their parents' health plan; not to mention 100,000 who are on the exchanges; not to mention 100,000 seniors who are saving $1,100 on their prescription drugs a year; not to mention 1 million Ohio seniors who get free, no copay, no deductible osteoporosis and diabetes screenings and physicals and all the things the Affordable Care Act gives them. They offer no proposals to replace any of those services. They talk about State lines, and they talk about health savings accounts, and they talk about tort reform. That is like this many people compared to this many people. They know that. Yet I still hear this talk of obstructionism. Give us stuff. Give us legislative proposals.  The assistant majority leader started off by talking about I guess a slow-walk of nominees. Now, I am the ranking Democrat, and my friend Senator Crapo is now the chairman of the committee. He was not chairman then, and he is not mostly responsible for this. But I am on the Banking Committee, and last year, with a Democratic President--I don't want to look back and do tit-for-tat. It is not about that. It is about moving the country forward. But last year--what was it--25 to 30 nominees came from the Some were very significant, including the Export-Import Some were Federal Some of them were inspectors general, and most people don't quite know what they do. But all nominees, more than 25, more than two dozen nominees--1 of them was confirmed by the Senate last year, 1 of 28 or so in our committee, and he was confirmed in December, in the 24th month of the 2-year term. So don't lecture us about people slow-walking and obstructionism and all of that. There were more than 25 nominees, and 1 of them was confirmed. SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, didn't move; Federal Reserve, didn't move; the public transit administrator, didn't move--one after another after another. The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial crimes didn't move. Even though he was originally a Bush nominee and then was promoted in the Obama years, he didn't even come to a vote because of whatever reason the Banking Committee gave us. So we don't need that lecture.  But more important, on these nominees, we all know the history. When I look at criticism and hear ``Why aren't these nominees all passed?'' let's look at about 6 or 8 months ago. Every Presidential candidate, until this last election, starts to put together a transition team in August, and President Trump--Candidate Trump began to do that but not with much seriousness. Then the person he had leading his[[Page S1516]]transition team he fired in November, soon after the election, so he had to start again. So he had no people kind of ready to go on these nominations, what, in fact, he was going to do on all of these Cabinet positions.  After that, he didn't really vet, he didn't really analyze, he didn't really look at the backgrounds of these nominees. So if they didn't do it--usually the President's people look at these nominees and analyze and see how corrupt they are, if they have conflicts of interest, all of that. Well, they didn't do that in this administration because apparently they didn't have time. So they nominated these people, and we have never seen this many conflicts of interest, we have never seen this kind of wealth, and we have never seen this many billionaires appointed to the  Just out of the Finance Committee, the Secretary of Health and Human Services bought and sold health care stocks of companies--on the floor of the House of Representatives, he was working on bills and amendments; yet he bought and sold hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of health care stock, and then he didn't tell the committee the full story.  The Secretary of the Treasury had a $100 million investment he forgot to report. Maybe somebody out there would forget if they had a $100 million investment. They might forget they had it, but most Americans wouldn't forget that. He lied to the committee. He lied to the committee about robo-signings. Hundreds of--and this was directly related to this nomination--hundreds of Ohioans, at least, maybe thousands, lost their homes--including in the Presiding Officer's home city where he grew up--because of these robo-signings.  So that is why this has been slowed down--because many of these nominees are unqualified for the jobs, many of them have conflicts of interest, and many of them have very complex financial holdings and portfolios that take a long time to sort through. That is the reason for the delay, and to accuse us of anything else is just playing politics.  As I said, I am here today to argue for the confirmation of  I voted for a number of these nominees when I thought they could offer something to our country. I voted against some of the most corrupt and some of the most out-of-step and some of the most far-right, radical nominees, and that list is, unfortunately, much longer with this President than any President in American history.  Carson had a distinguished career as a pediatric neurosurgeon. We know that about him, and that is good. His remarkable life story is well known to millions of We know that about him, and that is good. But he is not the nominee I would have chosen to lead In fact, he is not the nominee any President in my lifetime would have chosen to lead HUD because he has no direct experience with the housing and community development fields.  He made troubling statements on public policy issues prior to his nomination. My colleagues and I on the Banking Committee asked Carson several very direct questions about his views now that he is the nominee for Secretary of I will give Carson the benefit of the doubt--that is why I will vote for him--because he made commitments to me in person, sitting in my office, across the table, and he made commitments in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in his testimony and in his written responses.  Carson promises to address the scourge of lead hazards that threaten the health and the future of children in Ohio and nationwide.  Under oath, he pledged to uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals. That wasn't what his past has been. He has made comments that I find offensive or worse about gay people in this country, but he made the commitment under oath to our committee that he would fight any discrimination against people because of their sexual orientation.  He has pledged to advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness. He has pledged to push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan.  Those are commitments he made. Those are commitments he made under oath. Those are commitments I will hold him to in spite of perhaps his prior philosophy of government and in spite of perhaps some of his comments he might have made in the past. My job is to hold him accountable for this. The job of everybody in this Senate, of both parties, is to hold him accountable.  Carson's responses to my questions for the record are available as part of the record of the Banking Committee's January 12, 2017, hearing on the nomination of Carson to be Secretary of the U.Department of Housing and Urban I have also made them available online as part of my statement on the Banking Committee's approval of Carson's nomination on January 24, 2017.  My statement and the link to the questions for the record are available on the Banking Committee's website at http://www.banking.senate.gov/public.  Mr.President, as the ranking member of the Banking Committee--and I would emphasize the committee--while the last 2 years, it might only have been called banking, maybe it could have just been called Wall Street for the way it was running, but the full name of the committee is Banking, Housing, and Urban It is important to remember that. We oversee housing policy, and I see how important this Department is for people in Ohio and across our country.  HUD is in charge of enforcing fair housing laws. It has been an essential partner in our national efforts to prevent and end homelessness for veterans--something Senator Crapo talked about--for the chronically homeless, and for youth and families. The Department's primary rental assistance program helped 4.5 million low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities find a place to call home--something that should be a right in this country.  HUD has assisted cities and towns in their efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and invest in communities and promote lead-safe, healthy housing for children. There is still a great challenge in States like mine where there is deteriorating lead paint in old homes that threaten so many children. In my hometown of Cleveland and where I grew up in Mansfield and in Appalachia and in city after city and community after community in my State, there are lots of older homes. In the city of Cleveland, well over half the homes are at least 60 years old.  I asked somebody from the Cleveland health department: What percentage of those homes have toxic levels of lead? And he said 99. Understand that old homes in this country--homes that are 60, 70, 80 years old--many homes fall into that category, and they overwhelmingly have toxic levels of lead.  My support for Carson centers around the fact that he may not know much about housing policy yet--I am hopeful that in the tours he takes, including to my State and the chairman's State of Idaho--I hope and I assume he will learn more about housing, but one thing he does know as a brain surgeon is he knows what lead does to the development of children.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported 70 census tracts in Cuyahoga County where as many as one in three children are poisoned because of the age and the condition of the housing stock. One in three children has her or his physical and emotional and mental development sometimes arrested or slowed because of lead poisoning.  Through the Federal Housing Administration, HUD works with lenders to help creditworthy borrowers access stable mortgage credit so they can purchase a home. FHA played a central countercyclical role in providing mortgage credit following the financial crisis when the private sector largely withdrew from the field, as we remember. It has since receded into its typical share of the housing market. It is still essential, though, for home buyers, including many first-time and minority home buyers. HUD'S role will only become more important as housing communities' development challenges have grown. The need for affordable housing has grown dramatically since the great recession. The demand for units has increased while wages have stagnated.  The market alone is not producing sufficient housing for families and those on fixed incomes. Studies have demonstrated that many people who perform essential work--child care[[Page S1517]]teachers, school bus drivers, retail workers, people working full time, people working just as hard as the staff in front of me, people working just as hard as people who have titles like mine--simply can't afford the rent in the communities they serve. Half of the people who rent pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing.  One-quarter of all renters--25 percent of all renters, 11 million people in this country--pay more than half of their incomes for rent. If you are paying 51, 52, 55 percent of your income in rent, if one bad thing happens--a sick child, your plant lays you off for 2 weeks, your roof leaks, any number of things can happen. When you are living on the edge, when half of your income is for housing, what happens? You lose your home. You get evicted.  These burdens are more severe at the bottom of the income spectrum among extremely low-income renter households--those with incomes at or below 30 percent of median income, and 75 percent may pay more than half of their income in rent.  The National Low Income Housing Coalition identified a shortage of 7 million affordable and available rental units for the Nation's extremely low-income renter households. We are reaching only one out of four of those eligible families. Many end up on years' long waiting lists for lack of funding.  Government extends a hand to some of these families, but not to nearly enough. That needs to change. Despite the growing need for affordable housing, we risk losing the affordable housing resources we have due to physical deterioration or the end of long-term affordability contracts of property owners.  Families burdened by high housing costs have fewer resources available to meet other needs such as transportation for work and food and medicine. They even face eviction and homelessness; 500,000 people were homeless on any given night in January of 2016--550,000, actually.  The Department of Education data, which includes families doubled up for economic reasons, indicates that 1.4 million school children and their families were homeless at some point during the 2013-2014 school year. Think about that. Some of these kids were exposed to lead and have learning disabilities. Others don't get enough to eat, in spite of the family school breakfast and lunch program, because they don't eat so well on weekends and at night and on summer vacations or whenever. In addition, 1.4 million are homeless.  Matthew Desmond wrote a book called ``Evicted.'' He is a gentleman I have gotten to know a little bit. He lived in Milwaukee, a poor White neighborhood, a poor Black neighborhood. He wrote about people he got to meet and got to know, and he spent enough time where he got to know people. When he signed this book, he wrote: Home equals life. If you don't have a decent place to live--and I would imagine that none of us in this Chamber has that challenge. When you don't have a place to call home, your life can be upside down. With all of the challenges and all of the things that can happen, when you get evicted, your kids have to move to a new school district. You don't know where you are going to end up. You lose the few possessions you have when you're evicted. This book is recommended reading for anybody who works on housing issues. It is a book called ``Evicted'' by Matthew  One last point: I look forward to working with colleagues in the administration on the President's proposed $1 trillion investment and infrastructure, including housing. To jump-start the conversation about the President's proposed infrastructure package, my colleagues and I announced a blueprint to rebuild America's infrastructure.  I find it interesting, again, that the assistant majority leader talked about Democrats' intransigence and Democrats' obstruction when the President has put nothing out there on infrastructure, nothing out there on housing, nothing out there about healthcare--repeal and replace--none of those kinds of legislation.  We don't even know what he is talking about, other than saying ``$1 trillion.'' Democrats acted responsibly and put out our $1 trillion 10-year plan, hoping the President's $1 trillion 10-year plan can match up and we can work together. This blueprint talks about ways we invest in American infrastructure to improve the Nation's transportation, water, housing, and community infrastructure and create thousands of good-paying union jobs in construction and manufacturing jobs with strong ``Buy American'' provisions.  Even though the President in his prior life as a businessman wore suits, sold suits, sold tableware, and sold glassware made overseas, and even though this suit I wear is made by union workers 10 miles from my house, the President, now that he is President--the issue is not his own private business or his family's own private business where they outsource jobs to do production so they make more money. I don't like that, but that is no longer our business. What is our business is that the President steps forward with ``Buy American.''  ``Buy American'' means if there is steel in an infrastructure project, it should be made by steelworkers in Youngstown or Lorain, OH, or somewhere in If there is iron in these projects, if there is aluminum in these projects, if there is concrete, if there is any kind of product, if taxpayers are paying for it, it should be made by American workers.  Our blueprint is central to HUD's mission. It includes $100 billion to rebuild Main Street and communities. It includes ideas to address affordable housing challenges, eliminate blighted properties that bring down local property values, and remediate lead hazards that threaten children. We are ready to work on real infrastructure.  As I said, I am going to vote for Ben Carson for Secretary of He is not an inspiring choice, but he is someone who is an accomplished man. I count on him to help us address this terrible lead problem. I count on him to stand with us, as he pledged, to address the scourge of lead. I count on him to uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals. I count on him to advocate for rental assistance and investment and homelessness. I count on him to push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan. I count on him to fight the If the President is going to increase defense by $50 billion and cut a whole host of housing and urban programs, I count on this nominee. He promised our committee. He said it. He said it in private meetings. He said it in public meetings. We will hold him accountable. I plan to vote yes.  To reiterate, I rise today to speak on the pending nomination of Benjamin Carson to be the new Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or  Carson is not the nominee I would have chosen to lead HUD, due to both his lack of direct experience with the housing and community development fields, and his often troubling public statements prior to his nomination.  Despite my reservations, and my disagreements with some of his positions, I will give Carson the benefit of the doubt based on commitments he has made to me in person and to the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in his testimony and written responses.  This includes Carson's promises to:  Address the scourge of lead hazards that threaten the health and futures of children in Ohio and nationwide; Uphold the Fair Housing Act and the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals; Advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness; And push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan. Let me be clear: I will do everything in my power to hold Carson accountable for making good on his promises.  Role of As the ranking member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee responsible for housing policy, I have seen how important the Department is for people in Ohio and across the country.  HUD is charged with enforcing our fair housing laws. It has been an essential partner in our national efforts to prevent and end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, and youth and families.  The Department's primary rental assistance programs help over 4.5 million low-income households of families, the elderly, and people with disabilities find a place to call home.[[Page S1518]]  It assists cities and towns in their efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and invest in communities; and promotes lead-safe, healthy housing for children.  Through the Federal Housing Administration, HUD works with lenders to help creditworthy borrowers access sustainable mortgage credit so they can purchase a home.  The FHA played an essential, countercyclical role in providing mortgage credit following the financial crisis, when the private sector largely withdrew from the field.  It has since receded to its typical share of the housing market, but it is still essential for many homebuyers, including first-time and minority homebuyers.  HUD's role has only become more important as our housing and community development challenges have grown.  The need for affordable housing has grown dramatically since the Great Recession, as demand for rental units has increased and wages have stagnated.  The market alone is not producing sufficient affordable housing for families and those on fixed incomes.  A person with a full-time job would need to earn an hourly wage of $20.30 in order to afford a modest, two-bedroom rental at HUD's national average fair market rent.  This ``housing wage'' is far above the minimum wage, income available to people with disabilities who rely upon Supplemental Security Income, or even the median wage earned by renters.  Studies have demonstrated that people performing essential work--like child care teachers, school bus drivers, and retail workers--are often unable to afford rent in the communities they serve.  Half of all renters--over 21 million households--paid more than 30 percent of their incomes towards housing in 2014. And a quarter of all renters--over 11 million--paid more than half their incomes for rent.  These burdens are more severe at the bottom of the income spectrum. Among extremely low income renter households--those with incomes at or below 30 percent of area median income, 75 percent pay more than half their incomes on rent.  In 2016, the National Low Income Housing Coalition identified a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental units for the nation's ELI renter households.  We are reaching only one out of four eligible families. Many end up on years-long waiting lists for lack of funding.  Despite the growing need for affordable housing, we risk losing the affordable housing resources we have due to physical deterioration or the end of long-term affordability contracts with property owners.  Public housing alone needs an estimated $26 billion in major repairs. HUD estimates that we are losing 10,000 units of public housing every year due to physical obsolescence.  According to Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, nearly 2.2 million units of HUD-assisted and low income housing tax credit-supported housing will reach the end of their affordability periods by 2025. Families burdened by high housing costs have fewer resources available to meet other needs like transportation to work, food, and medicine, and they may even face eviction and homelessness.  Nearly 550,000 people were homeless on a given night in January 2016. Department of Education data, which include families doubled up for economic reasons, indicate that nearly 1.4 million school-age children and their families were homeless at some point during the 2013-2014 school year.  The hardships stemming from evictions and homelessness make it harder for families to climb the economic ladder.  As Matthew Desmond, author of Evicted, points out: ``Eviction is a cause, not just a condition, of poverty.''  Trump Urban Renewal Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump promised to rebuild America's ``inner cities,'' which he labeled ``hell holes.''  Mr.Trump spelled out his views in his, quote, ``New Deal for Black America, With a Plan for Urban Renewal.''  The plan covers issues such as school choice, investing in law enforcement, tax reform, trade, and infrastructure investment.  At a time when more than 11 million families are paying more than half their income toward rent, and half a million people have no place to call home, the President-elect's plan does not mention this housing crisis.  In addition, cities, like Black Americans, are not monolithic.  In recent years, many cities have seen a wave of population growth and investment that have led to greater economic activity, tighter rental housing markets, and rising rental housing costs.  As a result, many lower-income families and businesses who endured challenging decades in their communities are finding themselves priced out of their long-time neighborhoods just when additional economic opportunities are opening up.  Loss of housing in urban neighborhoods can push residents away from access to jobs, transit, and local support networks such as hospitals and child care.  In many of these neighborhoods, federally-assisted housing may be coming to the end of long-term affordability contracts or at risk of loss due to physical deterioration and HUD will be called on to help low-income people access the opportunity that has finally come to their neighborhoods.  HUD will need to respond to a diverse set of challenges across the country.  Ben Carson is a distinguished pediatric neurosurgeon. His remarkable life story is well known to all of us, and to millions of Americans beyond this room. He is an inspiration and a testament to the American dream.  Carson's experience, while impressive, does not automatically qualify him to lead  In reviewing Carson's nomination, I had the opportunity to question him extensively about his plans as His answers were responsive, in contrast to many of President Trump's nominees.  Carson committed to: Address the scourge of lead paint hazards that threaten the future of too many of Ohio's children; Uphold the Fair Housing Act and housing rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) individuals; Advocate for rental assistance and investment to end homelessness; and Push to include housing in the President's infrastructure plan.  Some of Trump's appointees have taken positions antithetical to the agencies for which they would be responsible. In his testimony, Carson did not seem to be in this camp.  At that hearing, Carson stated that he plans to go on a listening tour across the country and at HUD to learn what is working and what is not. And he promised to surround himself with pragmatic, bipartisan, senior advisers.  He said: ``I will surround myself with people who have a passion for improving the agency, not breaking down its programs.''  In many cases, Carson moderated or reversed controversial positions he had taken previously.  I will discuss a few of the commitments Carson made during our committee process.  Lead Paint Carson promised to work to end the scourge of lead poisoning that threatens the health and futures of too many children in Ohio and across the country.  There is a growing realization that safe, affordable housing is a platform for good health.  Whether that is healthy housing that protects kids from lead and asthma-inducing mold, accessible units that help seniors safely age in place and avoid expensive institutional care, or housing that enables people with disabilities to live in the community.  As Carson said in his written statement: ``There is a strong connection between housing and health . . . Housing (and housing discrimination) is a ``social determinant'' of health . . . These problems occur across America--in cities as well as suburbs and rural areas . . . We cannot have social mobility without a strong healthy foundation in the home.''  When Carson and I met privately, we discussed the tragic effects of lead in Ohio and nationwide. He knows--from a medical perspective--the terrible price that children and society pay for the legacy of lead in water, industrial settings, and, all-too-often, deteriorating paint in their homes.  While we have rightly focused on lead in water in Flint, MI, and Sebring, OH,[[Page S1519]]the most prevalent source of childhood lead poisoning is lead-based paint in homes built before the federal government stepped in to prohibit its use in 1978.  Approximately 23 million older homes have significant lead paint hazards, 3.6 million of which house children under six who are most susceptible to the effects of lead paint poisoning. This is a great challenge in states like mine that have a lot of older homes.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that that there are nearly 70 census tracks in Cuyahoga County, where I live, where as many as 1 in 3 children are likely poisoned because of the age and condition of the housing stock.  This is a tragedy not just for these kids and families, but for society. We all absorb the increased costs of medical care, education, criminal justice, and lost economic potential that stem from childhood lead poisoning.  If confirmed, I look forward to working with Carson to address the avoidable tragedy of childhood lead paint poisoning.  Fair Carson pledged to uphold the nation's fair housing laws, which includes the requirement that HUD's grantees affirmatively further fair housing.  At the hearing, Carson was clear about his support for the Fair Housing Act, stating:  I think the Fair Housing [Act] in 1968 was one of the best pieces of legislation we had. It was modified 1988. LBJ said no one could possibly question this, I agree with him.  I asked Carson about a 2015 Washington Times Op-Ed in which he objected to HUD's rule implementing the Fair Housing Act's Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing provision, likening it to a failed socialist experiment.  The rule, which implements a requirement of the Fair Housing Act, was adopted after a two-year public comment period and responds to GAO criticism of HUD's previous guidance in this area.  Carson stated that his op-ed had been ``distorted by many people.'' He went on to say that he has no problem with ``affirmative action or . . . integration'' but that he does have a problem with people dictating policy when they don't know the area when we have ``local HUD officials . . . who can assess what the problems are in their area and, working with local officials, can come up with better solutions.''  The fair housing rule is such a locally driven conversation, because it requires HUD grantees to analyze their own situations and develop locally driven plans to address their fair housing challenges.  Finally, Carson stated in writing that he would enforce the Fair Housing Act and support HUD's 2015 rule.  If Carson were to reverse the fair housing rule, it would violate his commitments at the hearing and in writing.  LGBTQ Housing During the Committee's process, I sought information on Carson's views of the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals.  In the past, Carson has made troubling comments about LGBTQ people that raised questions about whether LGBTQ people should enjoy the same rights as everyone else.  Carson's views in this area are important because the HUD Secretary oversees the housing rights of all Americans, including LGBTQ people. LGBTQ people face housing discrimination, bullying, and an alarmingly high incidence of youth homelessness.  In his written statement, Carson clearly stated that he wants to improve the lives of all families and communities ``no matter their race, creed, color, or orientation.''  In light of his previous statements, my colleague and I asked further questions.  I asked Carson whether he believes that HUD has a duty to take actions that promote equal access to housing opportunities for LGBTQ people. In response, he stated that he believes that ``all Americans . . . should be protected by the law,'' but went on to say that no one gets ``extra rights.''  To clarify his meaning, I asked whether he could think of any instances where protecting equal access to housing opportunities for LGBTQ people would mean providing them ``extra rights.''  His response was ``I cannot.''  I also asked whether he believes that HUD provides ``extra rights'' to LGBTQ people that need to be withdrawn.  His response was ``I do not.''  In other statements, Carson also clearly pledged to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination and to continue to support and enforce HUD's equal access rules.  These rules ensure that all individuals have equal access to the Department's programs ``without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity or marital status'' and in accordance with their gender identity.  If Carson is confirmed, any actions that he or the agency take to discriminate against or limit the housing rights of LGBTQ individuals and families would be contrary to his statements to me and the  Rental Carson promised to be an advocate for HUD rental assistance.  During the hearing, Carson backed away from his previous position calling for 10 percent across-the-board cuts to Federal programs as a budget-cutting measure.  At our hearing, Carson noted that he had revised his position to 1 percent across-the board cuts as a way to achieve budget savings. While I do not subscribe to this policy, it shows moderation of Carson's previous position.  With respect to HUD programs, he recognized the value of HUD rental assistance programs in meeting the needs of the lowest income individuals, stating:       When it comes to deep affordability, though, removing all      regulatory barriers won't get you there. It comes down to      subsidy. . . . I think we can all agree that we will all make      sure housing is a key consideration in every appropriations      bill . . . If confirmed I will be a vocal advocate internally      for funding, but prioritization will continue to occur in      this Administration as it did in the last.  Carson also recognized the value of the important safety net provided by HUD programs, stating that ``the rental assistance program is essential'' and that ``safety net programs are important. I would never . . . advocate abolishing them without having an alternative route for people to follow.''  Ending In 2010, Opening Doors, the Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent and End Homelessness, set out goals to end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, families, children, and youth and all other homelessness.  Through a combination of bipartisan federal investments in appropriate housing solutions particularly permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless and HUD-VASH vouchers for veterans and improved practices at the federal and local levels, we have made real progress toward these goals. Since 2010, such investments have helped reduce chronic homelessness by 27 percent and veterans' homelessness by 47 percent.  Yet, more remains to be done.  According to HUD's ``2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report'' to Congress, approximately 549,928 people were homeless on a given night in January 2016. Nearly 195,000 of the homeless on this night were in families including at least one child.  Stating that ``No one can argue with the goal of ending homelessness,'' Carson said he intends to build on the progress we have made toward ending homelessness. He also said he will ``call for continued investment to end homelessness for veterans, the chronically homeless, and children and families.''  Carson also praised the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which coordinates Federal efforts to efficiently and effectively combat homelessness and helps facilitate local communities' coordinated efforts.  Housing and The President's promised $1 trillion investment in infrastructure is one of the pillars of the President's Plan for Urban This is an area where I have said I would like to work with the new administration.  Our grandparents built an infrastructure for us that was the envy of the world and became the foundation of our economy for years to come. But after decades of neglect, we need to reinvest.  My colleagues in the Democratic caucus and I are taking the President up on his call for a $1 trillion investment in American infrastructure.[[Page S1520]]  To jump-start the conversation about the President's promise, we announced ``A Blueprint to Rebuild America's Infrastructure.''  This blueprint talks about ways we can invest in American infrastructure to improve the Nation's transportation, water, housing, and community infrastructure while creating thousands of construction and manufacturing jobs in Ohio and across the country.  Our blueprint includes $100 billion to rebuild our main streets and communities, which is central to HUD's mission.  This includes ideas to address affordable housing challenges, eliminate the blighted properties that bring down local property values in neighborhoods, and remediate lead hazards that can set children back for life and increase public costs.  We need to invest in the infrastructure of our communities.  I've talked about the need to address lead-based paint to prevent childhood lead poisoning.  In communities across Ohio and the country, blighted properties are holding our neighborhoods back. They reduce neighbors' property values, reduce tax base necessary to support public services, and create crime and safety threats.  A 2015 report from Policy Matters Ohio estimated Ohio alone would need $750 million to address the State's residential demolition needs.  Our public housing alone needs an estimated $26 billion in repairs.  When we met, Carson said that he is supportive of investing in our public housing infrastructure.  In questions following the hearing, I asked Carson whether he would work with the President to ensure that there is a real infrastructure package to address the needs of our urban and rural communities and that it includes funding for preserving and creating affordable housing.  In response, Carson responded by saying, ``I will absolutely commit to advocating for the inclusion of housing in the President Elect's infrastructure package.''  I look forward to working with Carson to ensure that the administration supports these job-creating investments in our housing and other infrastructure.  Support Despite As I stated at the outset, Carson is not the nominee that I would have chosen to lead  I do not agree with all of his positions.  For example, Carson wants to help people increase their incomes so that they can become self-sufficient. I also believe we should do everything we can to help families escape poverty and find good, middle-class jobs that can sustain a family.  However, Carson seems to believe that this can be done without raising the minimum wage and without the Labor Department's overtime rule that would help 100,000 workers in my state get the pay they deserve. He believes incomes will rise just by creating the right ``environment.''  I believe that the Federal Government should stand on the side of workers rather than advancing a billionaire agenda.  But despite my reservations and my disagreements with some of his positions, I am voting to confirm him, based on the commitments he made to the committee that I discussed here today.  The National Low Income Housing Coalition, or NLIHC, is a leading national organization advocating for safe, affordable housing for low-income people, including the residents of HUD-assisted housing.  NLIHC recently circulated a statement that reads:       Despite our initial concerns about Carson's lack of      experience with and knowledge of the HUD programs that he      would oversee, NLIHC does not oppose his nomination:       As demonstrated in his Senate confirmation hearing, Carson      has clearly taken the time to begin to understand and come to      appreciate the importance of HUD's programs.       Once confirmed, NLIHC is committed to working with      Carson to ensure that the lowest income people in America      have decent, affordable and accessible homes.  In the coming years, I will do everything in my power to hold him to his promises and to advocate for HUD's important work.  I Hope the Administration Helps Him Even if Carson and I shared the exact same views, I would be concerned about what the next few years bodes for HUD and our communities.  On January 23, the Trump administration adopted a hiring freeze and called for a reduction in the Federal workforce.  HUD already experienced the greatest percentage drop in career employees across the government from 2005 through 2014, and now HUD faces the highest percentage career employees eligible to retire by 2019.  According to HUD's FY 2017 budget justifications, ``This retirement wave can cause a loss of leadership and institutional knowledge at all levels.''  Such a loss could also cause a failure to ensure that the Department is upholding its duties to taxpayers by ensuring the quality of federally-assisted housing, fair housing enforcement, and overseeing FHA lending programs, for examples.  Carson says he wants to learn from and be on the side of HUD's career staff. Let's hope the administration gives him sufficient staffing to accomplish his mission.  I am also very concerned about HUD's budget going forward.  The Senate recently confirmed Mick Mulvaney, an ideologue who threatened to default on our debt and wants to gut our retirement safety net, to lead the President's Office of Management and  There have been reports that the administration has been considering using Heritage Foundation budget blueprints as the basis for its budget proposals.  Heritage has proposed budget outlines that would literally zero out the HUD rental assistance programs and the Community Development Block Grant  We are also hearing reports that the Trump administration is making plans to cut nondefense discretionary programs by $54 billion in fiscal year 2018--about a 10 percent cut--in order to fund increased defense spending.  This cut would come on top of the sequestration-related cuts to nondefense discretionary, or NDD, programs that will kick in in FY 2018 if we don't do something to stop them.  NDD programs at HUD have already absorbed cuts. Since 2010, funding for public housing has fallen 21 percent, while funding for the HOME program has fallen by more than 50 percent.  Sequestration cuts in FY 2013 reduced the number of housing vouchers by more than 80,000. In recent years, Congress and local agencies have been able to restore many of these lost vouchers, but further cutbacks will reverse this trend.  At a time when our families are facing growing affordable housing needs, the administration may be considering cuts that would devastate our housing safety net and leave families, seniors, formerly homeless veterans, and communities reeling.  All of this is coming at the same time that they are repealing the ACA and working to repeal rules that protect workers, consumers, and retirees.  At our hearing, Carson himself walked away from previous comments he had made in support of 10 percent across-the-board cuts.  At the nomination hearing, Carson stated:       I want to advocate for the HUD budget. . . . In the process      of doing a listening tour and in talking to the people who      were there already I want to put together a world-class plan      on housing in this country and then I want to come to you      with that world-class plan and I want to convince you all      that this is what we need to do.  I hope that the administration and those setting budget priorities here in Congress will give Carson and HUD the tools they need to fulfill their mission.  If not, I hope my colleagues and citizens across the country will work with me to ensure that we have a housing and community development policy that meets the needs of all  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

8304,topic-id,2224,"Madam President, American families, hard-working American families need a Treasury Secretary who will work for them, not for Wall Remember the tenor of the 2016 campaign, when candidate Trump, at every rally, spoke forcefully about draining the swamp. What we thought he meant was that he would drain the swamp, that he would not be hiring a whole bunch of Wall Street executives, Goldman Sachs employees, and other bankers who helped drive the economy into a ditch; that he would actually stay away from them.  In fact, we have seen the opposite. It has become obvious that the Treasury Secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin is not about hard-working American families, but he is about working for Wall The Treasury Secretary has enormous influence over Americans' lives, impacting everything from their taxes to their mortgages to their retirement.  Mr.Mnuchin doesn't have a policy background to give us clues as to what he would do with his power. He was a major Trump fundraiser. Here is what we do know. He made millions as a hedge fund manager. He made millions at Goldman Sachs, where he traded mortgage securities and other products that contributed to the financial crisis. He headed what has been called a foreclosure machine, profiting in kicking hard-working Americans out of their homes.  When presented with tough questions from members of the Finance Committee in front of which he appeared, Mr.Mnuchin expected leniency and understanding from a bunch of Senators, but it is not something that he gave--leniency and understanding for Ohio families trying to keep a roof over their heads. They got the runaround from lenders with claims of lost documents, modifications that weren't honored, dual tracking. When this confirmation process began, we believe that Mr.Mnuchin and his bank, OneWest, had foreclosed on at least 40,000 people in three We understand--not because of information that he was willing, voluntarily at the beginning to provide--we understand now that it is at least eight States, and I expect we will learn more.  Unfortunately, he probably will be Treasury Secretary by the time a lot of this comes out because the Finance Committee didn't do its job, because Mr.Mnuchin wasn't forthcoming enough, because this Senate is trying to rush through ethically challenged candidates to be Secretaries of HHS, the EPA, Education, State, and  OneWest's regulator, the regulator from Mr.Mnuchin's bank when he was CEO--they had shoddy mortgage practices, the regulator said. They foreclosed on more than 10,000 borrowers, including some who were current on their mortgage.  I want to put a picture up on one of the borrowers who was foreclosed on not far from where I live. The ZIP Code I live in, in Cleveland, OH, had the[[Page S1084]]highest in 2007--the first half of that year, had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United To a bunch of U.Senators, that is a little troubling. A lot of foreclosures, terrible thing. But most U.Senators have probably never been foreclosed on, and I am guessing most U.Senators have never spent a lot of time socially with people who are foreclosed on. And I am guessing a whole lot of Senators have probably never even talked in detail about what it means to be foreclosed on.  Think about it. Your family is struggling. Your family lives in a home in Slavic Village, OH, a mile north of my And you have been working hard, you and your spouse. The parents have worked hard. The kids are teenagers--the challenges that all families have. They are making moderate incomes. The wife has her hours cut back. Then they are struggling. They have trouble paying their mortgage. They keep paying it. Then the husband has his plant closed. And in some cases, in this lady's case--I will talk about her in a moment--she was foreclosed on, not even because she lost a job. She was foreclosed on because of what Mr.Mnuchin said.  When we talk about foreclosures, we ought to think about what happens to these families. The wife maybe has hours cut back, the husband loses his job because the plant closes. Then what happens? They go to the kids and say: We have to get rid of our pet because pets cost money going to the vet, buying food, putting them for a weekend or day somewhere. They have to take the animal for somebody else to watch. So they give a pet away, which is heartbreaking to kids and to parents. Then they have to cut back on other things. Then they realize they are about to be foreclosed on or evicted. Then they have to move. They bring their son and daughter, 12 and 14 years old, in and they say: We don't know what school district you are going to be in. We don't know where you are going. We don't know if you will be around your friends because we are moving--all those things where their lives turn upside down. They lose many of their possessions. Their children's lives are so different. Their lives are turned upside down.  That is why what Mr.Mnuchin did on these 40,000 foreclosures is morally repugnant and outrageous. Yet this Senate is only 3 days away from party-line voting for this incredibly ethically challenged Secretary of the Why? I guess listening to my Republican friends here, a number of them suggest they really don't much like this nominee. They didn't much like Secretary Price, a guy who did everything but sell stocks on the floor of the House--bought and sold health care stocks while he was working on health care legislation for those companies. They didn't much like voting for him. And a number of them wanted to vote against the Secretary of Education because she was maybe just the least qualified, as the Presiding Officer knows. She may be the least qualified Secretary of Education who has ever been nominated, but they voted for these people. Why? Because they are fearful. They are fearful of what Donald Trump will try to do to destroy their careers. You know how they know that? Because the Republican conference that meets every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday in this room right behind this door--the Republican conference--there are three Members of the Republican conference, of the 52 Senators, who ran for President against Donald They are Senators Graham, Rubio and All three of them were targets of Donald Trump, of Candidate Donald He insulted them, called them names, turned his supporters on them. The other--52 minus 3--the other 49 Senators know it can happen to them. That is why you are seeing these party-line votes for people as ethically challenged as Steve Mnuchin, for people who have, frankly, betrayed what trust they should have had working for a bank the way they did.  As I said, a OneWest regulator said his bank foreclosed on more than 10,000 borrowers. When I said 40,000, I misspoke. We know it was 40,000 in three A number of them--the OneWest regulator said something different, a smaller number that dealt with shoddy mortgage practices.  But whatever the number is here, it is in the tens of thousands. Think about that. Some of these were not even families who were struggling to keep their homes. These families were doing everything right. They paid their mortgages on time. His bank came and took their houses away because he could make more money. He did not care about these people losing their homes.  If he did not care as a banker about people losing their homes, do you think he is going to care much as Treasury Secretary about people losing their homes? Do you think he will all of a sudden develop an empathy for moderate-income people who lose their homes?  He did not have it when he was a banker making millions of dollars. One of the things that is amazing is that he came in front of our committee. You know, these gazillionaires, billionaires, whatever, who come in front of our committees have to disclose their wealth and tell us who they are and what they are.  When Secretary-designee Mnuchin came in front of the committee--get this. I know I can't talk directly to people in the gallery, but I am guessing this would not have happened to them. He forgot to disclose that he had a $100 million investment somewhere. He forgot about $100 million. I am guessing that nobody in this gallery, probably nobody on the floor, certainly no staff people back here because I know what they are paid--none of them would forget that they had a $100 million investment. Maybe he just did not want to tell us about this $100 million investment any more than he wanted to tell us about those robo-signings that I will talk about in a minute.  The report that I mentioned from the regulators said that Mr.Mnuchin's bank violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by initiating foreclosure on 54 Active Duty military families. So, I mean, maybe that is worse; maybe it is not. I think it is probably even worse to foreclose on people who generally did not do anything wrong, but then he foreclosed on men and women in uniform, and put them out of their homes to pad his own bank's profits.  I would assume some of these people in the military he foreclosed on might have just been stationed overseas, protecting Mr.Mnuchin and his family, protecting me, protecting Erin and my staff, and Graham and Gideon and others; that is what they do in the military. He foreclosed on them. So, again, he had no empathy for these men and women in the service. What? He is going to care about these men and women when he is Treasury Secretary?  We now know this foreclosure was even worse than we initially thought. Around the time of the hearing, the Columbus Dispatch, Ohio's most conservative newspaper, a newspaper that always likes Republicans and rarely likes people like me--the Columbus Dispatch ran a front-page investigative story that found that OneWest used robo-signings in mortgage documents with abandon.  This, despite the fact that Mr.Mnuchin claimed in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that his company had never done so--if you are the CEO making tens of millions of dollars a year, would you not know they did robo-signings? Wouldn't you know that they just had staff that signed, signed, signed without looking at these documents, spending an average of less than 1 minute on each document?  So you are going approve a document which might have to do with a loan to someone, and you did not even spend--as the bank, you did not even spend 60 seconds looking at this. Why? Because all of the profits were generated by volume. Quality did not matter. All the profits for this bank--or much of the profits--were generated by volume.  Ohio reporters found dozens of foreclosure cases in Franklin County alone--Columbus--that had been robo-signed. Yes, Mr.Mnuchin, in this town nobody wants to use the word I am going to use. They want to say that it was a half-truth or it was not quite right or it was fabricated. No, what Mr.Mnuchin did is lie. He said: We did not do robo-signings.  Well, the Columbus Dispatch--this was up there a moment ago--the Columbus Dispatch said he did. He lied. They say it more nicely, perhaps: Mnuchin's denials don't match the record. He lied.[[Page S1085]]  Again, his lying was not just lying. It was what he lied about, and people lost their homes as a result.  Bill Faith, one of Ohio's and America's housing advocates told the Dispatch, ``The guy is just lying. There is no other way to say it.''  The guy is just lying. Since the Dispatch ran the article--this article--they have continued to report additional findings. Other reporters in other cities have uncovered more instances of robo-signings by Mr.Mnuchin's bank.  I am especially concerned about his defensiveness and outright deception when asked about this. His misconduct caused real, serious pain. That is fundamentally the big issue. It is bad that he lied to a bunch of That is maybe not that big a deal. It is, but it isn't. It is bad that he lied to the American public, but he lied about something that resulted in people getting evicted, foreclosed on, thrown out of their homes--people with families, people serving in the Armed That is not enough reason for any Republican--not one Republican--to vote against him? Not one Republican?  I would like some of my colleagues to meet some of these people who were foreclosed on and have them explain to them why they are voting for Mr.Is it because of fear that Donald Trump might call them out and call them a name and try to destroy their career? I can't think of any other reason.  One victim, and I will put her name up, lives, as I said, maybe only 5 miles from where my wife and I live. She is a social worker from Cleveland Her name is Carla She told the Dispatch, ``It got to the point that I was afraid to open my own door.''  Mr.Faith, whom I quoted before, said it has been devastating, not only to people who got caught in this kind of scheme but also to people who happened to live in the neighborhood, people like ",CREC-2017-02-10-pt1-PgS1073-6.txt,2106,TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MATT JONKEY,2017.0,10.0,February

This great loss has cast a shadow of sadness over our close-knit community. This is the first time in the city's history that we have lost an officer in the line of duty.  Detective Walker was a dedicated member of our police force and community. He was a husband, a father, a mentor, and a friend to many. I had the privilege of meeting Detective Walker when he was on duty at one of my townhall meetings in the summer of 2014. His dedication to protecting the residents of Little Elm was evident in all that he did.  Dallas Cowboys' wide receiver Cole Beasley sums up this loss precisely saying: ``We lost a good one.''  Our town of Little Elm continues to mourn the loss of one of our heroes. His service to our community will not be forgotten.

8306,topic-id,3322,"Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon with my colleagues to speak about the nomination of Steve Mnuchin for the Secretary of  We all know this is a very important economic position in our Federal Government, but it is also a position of great importance for the entire world economy. The Secretary of Treasury is a key Presidential adviser on important economic and tax policy, and has an impact on the lives of millions of people across the United But most importantly, the Secretary will be on the front lines protecting and restoring our economy from the unbelievable economic crisis that we faced in 2008.  I like to say that this crisis--which, according to the Dallas Fed, which cost us $14 trillion--is not over. That is, average Americans still have not recovered from the crisis when it comes to their 401(k) or their pension or the opportunity to send their kids to school or perhaps even homeownership. It is very important that we have a Treasury Secretary who not only says that they will protect the United States in the future from another financial crisis, but that they are also on the job making sure we restore economic opportunities for everyday  I would have to say that Mr.Mnuchin certainly has lived the American dream. You would say that he is a man who has achieved financial success. But is he going to fight for the average American who has not achieved that success because of the economic downturn in 2008? Is he going to make sure that our resources and dollars not only grow the economy, but make sure that those who have been impacted the most are restored in some way?  I personally did not support the bailout of the banks. I did not give the keys of the Treasury to those big organizations, and many people in the State of Washington and across America during this last campaign want to know why they did not receive financial help during that downturn, but people were so willing to bail out these[[Page S1088]]large organizations. So it is very important that we look at the nomination today in light of what has transpired and what we are going to do moving forward to help the economic security of so many  This position, which includes chairing the Financial Stability Oversight Council and moderating systemic risk to our entire financial system, is a very big job. It requires someone with both expertise in policy and experience in public service, as well, because you are balancing these issues for the public.  I find it sometimes very difficult to explain in detail those policies to my constituents, particularly about balancing the public interest, when they have seen that all some want to do, as I said, is give the keys to the Treasury to those large financial organizations. There is a lot to talk about that here today.  In my opinion the Treasury Department needs a seasoned and experienced public servant who understands our ship has been sailing through turbulent waters, and will focus on making sure that America returns to economic stability.  I had an opportunity to meet with the Treasury Secretary nominee. He has admitted throughout his confirmation hearing that he was the chief fundraiser for President Trump during his election. In fact, when I asked him why he wanted to be Treasury Secretary, he told me that he had spent many hours campaigning with the President-elect around the United States and he wanted to continue that relationship. This isn't exactly the type of experience that I am looking for. I want somebody who is going to continue to help us dig out of those economic problems that plague so many average Americans--on many issues, whether it is pensions or investing in education or growing our economy at a robust rate, that bring everybody up to a higher economic standard of living.  One issue that plagues me the most in thinking about this particular nominee is the issue of Glass-Steagall, the separation of commercial and investment banking.  Why would that issue be so important?  It is so important because this was the law of the land for more than 60 years in the United States of America after the Great Why? Because people understood we should not be putting individual savings--and taxpayer money--at risk when you have a financial crisis. So we implemented that law of the land.  I have not been shy about trying to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reinstate Glass-Steagall, and, during the financial regulatory reform debate, make sure we were putting strong laws on the books. I always felt that there would be a time when average Americans really could look back on all that Congress had done and say they were satisfied or dissatisfied with the rules that were in place.  Well, I think that time happened during the last election. There was a lot of discussion that while we had passed what was then called Dodd-Frank--the regulatory reform that this Congress passed, I felt like we could do more. A lot of the discussion was that Dodd-Frank didn't go far enough, that somehow we needed to do more. The compromise shaped here in the Senate, was said by some people, was as much as we could do, and that we should put those rules in place and see how they worked for the U.economy. I supported it because it was enough to get on the books, to start getting disclosure, to start making sure that these transactions would have more oversight, but I never thought--never thought--it was the bright line that we needed to separate commercial and investment banking.  So you can imagine that it was to my great delight when I saw last summer the debate between the Republican and Democratic platforms in which the Republican platform actually started to embrace Glass-They had a campaign, they had a Presidential candidate, and they certainly had a Presidential campaign manager who were all embracing it and touting it. I don't know if that was an effort to try to distinguish between some of the candidates on the other side of the aisle, or my colleague from Vermont who has also been a big supporter of Glass-Steagall, but they clearly put in their platform something that was unambiguous. It basically said: ``We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits commercial banks from being engaged in high-risk investment.'' That is what their platform said, and that is what our now-President's then campaign manager also said they were for. That caught my ear because I thought maybe we had finally reached a point with the frustration of the American public about how they had been left behind after the financial crisis, and that they finally were seeing two candidates and several campaigns talking about this issue, putting it in their platform, and moving ahead.  It was the Trump campaign manager who said:       ``We are supporting the small banks and Main We      talk about legislation that affects, you know, some of the      mistakes that were made in repealing Glass-Steagall.''  This was the party platform of the other side of the aisle. In fact I have to say I almost thought it was probably a better platform than we had on the Democratic side, and I wanted to make sure that my colleagues knew and understood that. But now I see that it was nothing more than a cynical ploy to try to convince the American people that somehow the Trump administration was really going to be on the side of Main Street against Wall  In fact, one of my first conversations with Secretary-nominee Mr.Mnuchin was to ask him whether he in fact supported Glass-He said to me: No, that was just a campaign promise in our platform. That is not what we are going to do.  That caught me by surprise because I really had hoped that maybe President Trump, having been in business, having seen the challenges of working with big banks, maybe was really going to be on the side of Main Street, was really going to fight to make sure that we protected the capital that needed to go into small business, that needed to go into investment, that needed to go into new products and manufacturing, and protect us from those kinds of Wall Street shenanigans.  My constituents want to make something in America besides exotic financial instruments. They want those dollars to be invested in small businesses that are creating products and selling them in a worldwide market.  Mr.Mnuchin, instead, came to the Finance Committee and basically said he is not for that version of what was in their party platform. In fact, he and the President now support rolling back the minimal law that we put on the books, known as the Volcker rule, within Dodd-So, the fact is that not only are they not supporting what we were led to believe they did support, but they are now putting someone in the position of the chief economic official on these issues, who is saying: Let's start rolling back the regulations that already exist.  So I am very frustrated by that, and I can say just on that point alone that I would oppose Mr.Mnuchin's nomination to be Treasury I think it is time that we have someone who is not like putting the fox in the hen house, but is instead there to do the job and will protect our investment in the future and hopefully unwind this economic problem from the past.  There are other reasons, though, why I don't support Mr.Mnuchin's nomination to Treasury Secretary, and many of my colleagues here this morning have already talked about that as related to the economic crisis. OneWest Bank, with Mr.Mnuchin as chair, booked billions in profits on the backs of foreclosure victims. According to reports, Mr.Mnuchin's investors pocketed nearly $4 billion in the time they controlled the bank. Mr.Mnuchin reportedly made $100 million when he sold OneWest in 2015 for double what he paid the government.  We saw this in the Northwest, and I can tell you it was a great frustration. These profits were booked on the backs of thousands of struggling Americans, and we don't know exactly how these people suffered because we don't have all the information.  The victims of OneWest are at least 50,000, including 1,600 in the State of OneWest used ethically troubling and actually illegal methods to seize homes from struggling homeowners and not give them a fair process.[[Page S1089]]  Under their agreement with regulators, they were supposed to modify mortgages whenever possible and keep people in their homes. However, according to the California attorney general, OneWest engaged in ``widespread misconduct'' to kick many people out of their homes. Even Mr.Mnuchin admitted this. In 2011 he signed a consent order with the U.Office of Thrift Supervision that found that OneWest had filed or caused to be filed potentially false affidavits ``not based on personal knowledge or review of relevant books and records.''  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record one of these actual agreements.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON FOR THE COUNTY OF KING       CIT BANK, N.A., Plaintiff, vs. YVONNE C CARR, an      individual; MIDLAND FUNDING LLC, a limited liability company;      and all other persons, parties, or occupants unknown claiming      any legal or equitable right, title, estate, lien, or      interest in the real property described in the complaint      herein, adverse to Plaintiff's title, or any cloud on      Plaintiff's title to the Property.--      CASE NUMBER: COMPLAINT FOR JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OF DEED OF      TRUST       Plaintiff alleges as follows:       1.

8307,topic-id,785,"This is an actual foreclosure document from one of my constituents. What is most amazing[[Page S1090]]about this is that they are basically saying that this property should be seized and foreclosed on, saying that there was no one living there. But when one actually sees the service of the document, the service of the document shows that it was served at an address where somebody answered the door and took the document. So even in and of itself, you can see how ludicrous this operation was--just going through a robo-list of names, signing documents, and putting people out of their homes, when in reality, they were there living in them and should not have been foreclosed on.  Many of these behaviors have been described by my colleagues, and I hope that we get to the bottom of this issue. We heard from victims of a foreclosure, where on a 98-year-old woman, being 27 cents short on a payment, and another where they changed the locks on her home in Minnesota in the middle of a blizzard.  Is that what we did for Goldman Sachs? I don't think so. I think we gave them the keys to the  This behavior, the callousness of this issue, is another reason why I cannot support Mr.Mnuchin's nomination for Treasury  Mr.Mnuchin's answers to questions about the administration's tax reform plan are another issue. His tax reform policy and that of the administration just doesn't add up to me. The nonpartisan analysts who have looked at the President's tax reform plan found that it would do just the opposite of what Mr.Mnuchin says, and it would actually increase the deficit by $7.2 trillion over 10 years.  I don't think those are economics that I can support, and I don't think I can support his nomination.  I would just say, in concluding, that there are other issues that also concern me with this nominee and his responsibility to help us solve our economic challenges.  I did have a chance to talk to Mr.Mnuchin about our pension programs. One-third of Americans have zero retirement savings or a pension plan--one-third. Those who do are not saving nearly enough and the median balance for those nearing retirement is only $14,500. This is going to be a crisis for us.  According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, our nation's retirement savings gap is somewhere between $6.8 trillion and $14 trillion. That is the gap that we are looking at in the United  So, yes, when the Dallas Fed says that bailing out Wall Street and the implosion of the Wall Street problems cost our economy $14 trillion, and that just happens to be the same gap in pensions and retirement savings, it makes me furious.  I want to see a Treasury Secretary who has a plan on how we are going to deal with these issues. The Secretary of the Treasury sits on the Board of Directors of the Pension Benefit Guaranty They make important decisions as it relates to the multi-employer pension plans and the Multiemployer Pension Reform The PBGC currently has a deficit of $76 billion.  These issues are so important, not just to mineworkers but to average When Mr.Mnuchin sat on the board of Sears, he oversaw the finances of the company's pension, which was massively underfunded and accumulated $8.3 billion in net losses. We cannot afford to let that happen to the  If that is not enough, I want a Treasury Secretary who is going to be aggressive in protecting the American taxpayer from further cause and effects of the crisis in Puerto I was not a fan of the plan that we crafted here in the Why? Because, again, we gave Wall Street all the opportunity and left the taxpayers of the United States and Puerto Rico with all the cost. That is going to be a challenge for all of us in the future, and I hope that we will have a Treasury Secretary who will be aggressive in recouping our losses as taxpayers from Wall  So while I know that people here and on the other side of the aisle think their minds are made up, I would just ask them to look at his record, to look at what we need to do as a country to move our economy forward to recoup from the financial crises, and to say that Mr.Mnuchin is not the man to lead us where we need to go. He certainly has realized his financial dreams, but we have not heard enough from him that makes me convinced he is going to help Americans realize theirs.

It was March 5th, 1942, when the SeaBees were charged by the Navy with the task of building, maintaining, and supporting base infrastructure in remote locations for the Navy and Marine SeaBees execute this critical mission, while also maintaining the capability to engage in combat operations.  For 75 years, the SeaBees have met challenges in times of war and peace. They have been deployed all over the world, contributing to our national security interests by constructing military bases, building airfields, roads, bridges, and even underwater structures. In every major operation our Nation has carried out, from World War II to present operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Navy SeaBees are there, demonstrating unmatched courage, strength, and professionalism. Their personal sacrifices are a testament to the dedication of the Navy's elite construction force.  As we honor the SeaBees today, let us not forget to acknowledge the many sacrifices their families have made throughout their 75 years. Whether at home or abroad in the more than 30 countries to which they deploy, it is the support of their families that enables the brave men and women of the SeaBees to accomplish their mission with the utmost devotion to duty, honor, and country. I am proud that Gulfport, MS, serves as home to the Naval Construction Battalion Center, where more than 12,500 SeaBees, sailors, airmen, and soldiers have received valuable training this past year alone.  We congratulate the U.Navy SeaBees on their 75th anniversary and reaffirm our commitment to them.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgS1217.txt,213,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,15.0,March
8248,topic-id,830,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in opposition to H.40, a measure that would vacate an important rule issued by the Social Security Administration to help reduce gun violence.  This resolution of disapproval is particularly problematic because, pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, it would not only invalidate this rule but prohibit the agency from adopting substantially the same rule in the future, even an improved version of the rule. How unusual.  As we consider this resolution today, I ask my colleagues to consider, for just a moment, how we arrived at this point and, more precisely, what is at stake.  In 1968, after a decade of assassinations and gun violence, Congress worked to pass the Gun Control That law lists certain categories of individuals who are prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms, including felons, fugitives, those who[[Page H896]]have renounced their citizenship, those who have been dishonorably discharged, and also those ``adjudicated mentally defective.'' Today, we don't commonly use that outdated and unfortunate terminology. Instead, we refer to the ``Federal mental health prohibitor,'' which remains an important--although challenging--feature of our Federal gun laws.  Because it was common sense that we needed a system to help prevent guns from getting into the hands of those who were legally prohibited from possessing them, Congress took bipartisan action to enact the Brady Act in 1993. That statute established a National Instant Criminal Background Check System--some call it NICS--and it requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct checks on prospective purchasers in order to verify that they are not prohibited on the basis of the statutory categories.  Although unwisely limited only to sales conducted by licensed gun dealers, the NICS system is extremely beneficial as far as it goes. Critically, however, this background check system is only as good as the completeness of the records it includes. This fact was tragically underscored in 2007, when a student on the campus of Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 people. The shooter had a mental health record that was serious enough that it should have been reported to the system, but it was not.  As a result, Congress enacted the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendments Act that same year in order to provide incentives for States to do a better job of submitting disqualifying mental health records to the system. The law also requires Federal agencies to submit any such information that they have. While some States have done a great job of complying with the law, others have not, which remains a critical challenge. As we expect States to do more to comply, we must also ensure Federal agencies are doing their part.  The rule under consideration, which was finalized last December after an extensive rulemaking process that considered more than 91,000 comments from the public, is intended to impact only a very narrow range of individuals whom the agency determines should be prohibited from possessing firearms under the statutory mental health prohibitor, which has been the law for decades. The rule applies only to those individuals who have a very severe, long-term mental disorder that makes them unable to do any kind of work in the American economy, including even part time or at very low wages.  These individuals must have been determined through an evaluation of all of the evidence that they are not capable of managing their own benefits and must be assigned a representative payee. This designation is given only after an individual is notified orally and in writing at the outset of the process that the gun eligibility determination would be the result of the assignment of a representative payee. After the determination is made, the affected individuals may appeal the decision to the agency and then, ultimately, to a Federal court.  Of course, we must avoid taking actions that would unfairly stigmatize individuals who suffer from mental illness or a disability. This is true in many respects, but, with regard to issues of public safety, we must recognize that people who suffer from mental illness should not be assumed to be dangerous. In fact, they are much more likely to be victims of crime than to be perpetrators. With those considerations in mind, my colleagues, it can be difficult to apply the mental health prohibitor, but, still, we must apply and enforce the law.  If I were proposing such a rule, I cannot say whether this process would be exactly what I would recommend. We have not held hearings on this issue, and we have not had the chance to examine all appropriate considerations. I can say that the agency has undertaken a commendable effort in accordance with President Obama's directive to ensure that the NICS background check system has the information that it believes, after a thorough rulemaking process, corresponds to a longstanding category of firearms prohibition.  Accordingly, we should not completely disregard the agency's efforts, and I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose H.40.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

8218,topic-id,1794,"Mr.President, the Chamber is too slowly moving forward on the President's Cabinet nominees. So far, this Chamber has confirmed 16 Cabinet nominees since January 20. I would note that the most recent nominee, Secretary Zinke, was confirmed by a vote of 68 to 31 and that Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce, was confirmed by a vote of 72 to 27.  Why have we burned 5 weeks of this new administration and denied the President the staff and the help and the team he needs in order to lead the country? It makes no sense whatsoever.  I, once again, implore our friends on the other side of the aisle to stop the foot-dragging and the delay for delay's sake and to let the President have his                    President's Address to Congress  Mr.President, I want to comment briefly on last night's address by President Trump to a joint session of  I think it is safe to say that the President had an extraordinary night last night. This is not just a view from a partisan, but, I think, on a bipartisan basis, people were enormously impressed by the vision the President laid out.  I have had some private conversations with colleagues on the floor, who have said to me, in essence, that this is an unusual and unconventional President but one who is clearly interested in making progress for the American people. He laid out a broad, welcoming vision of some of the things he wants to accomplish, but he did so in a way that welcomed Democrats and bipartisan support to help make that progress for the American people. I think they were somewhat surprised but gratified to hear the President make those sorts of remarks, and I congratulate President Trump for doing it.  Basically, he articulated an optimistic vision and a new direction for the country. This election, like the election back in 2008, was a change election. We have those every now and then. After one party is in power for 8 years, frequently, people say: We would like to try something different. We would like a change election.  We had a true change election in 2016.  The American people made clear that they wanted to get back in the game when they elected President Trump in November--by that I mean in terms of our American prosperity, our American strength, our American leadership in the world. President Trump talked about a new national pride and of cultivating a surge of economic security across the country. I think, at bottom, his speech was a message about confidence--confidence in the American people, confidence in our economic system, which has lifted more people out of poverty than has any other system the world has ever known, confidence that, unfortunately, had been lost during the Obama years that focused so much on self-doubt and America's role in the world--retreating from that role--unfortunately, leaving a void that has been filled, all too eagerly, by tyrants, dictators, and thugs, like Vladimir Putin, for example.  It is also true that this President was elected because, for too long, many people in this country had felt left out and felt like they just were not a part of the conversation we were having here about the great issues of the day. Many felt sidelined, even alienated, by irrelevant policy debates that had nothing to say to their quality of life in Many believed they truly didn't have a seat at the table.  President Trump's message throughout the campaign and now--about 5 weeks into his new administration--reflects, I think, the frustration and even the angst many Americans had felt and the gratification now, as they feel like they have somebody who believes in what they believe and will not leave them on the sidelines.  I believe what President Trump represents is an antidote to what many people saw as wrong with Washington, While it is true that President Trump has never held public office before--by all accounts, he is an unconventional political leader--last night, we heard he will work with all of us to actually do something about the concerns of hard-working American families. He will usher in a new era of renewed confidence in what the American people can accomplish together as we enter into, as he put it, a time of national rebuilding.  This is about restoring faith in the American dream. My parents were part of the ``greatest generation''--of those who fought in World War II, who preserved America and a great future for their children and grandchildren. It sickens me, when I read public opinion polling, that too many people today say they do not see that better life--more secure, more prosperous--for their children and grandchildren in the future. What they are saying, in essence, is that we are losing faith in the American dream. I think what President Trump talked about last night is a renewed faith and a renewed commitment to the American dream, which means some sacrifice on the part of the present generation, not just in spending money we do not have and in racking up debt we will never repay and that our children and grandchildren will be saddled with.  Just as one example, President Trump talked about taking on this tepid economic recovery he inherited and turning it into a jobs machine that grows our economy for everyone. This is an optimistic message, as many have noted--it is Reaganesque, really, in its tone--in its talking about building the American economy and reestablishing America's leadership role in the world. I know it is just one indicator.  If you want to look at some objective measure of the American people's hopefulness and optimism about the future, all you need to do is to look at the stock market, as it has gone up 10 percent since President Trump was sworn in and closed at a record high for the 12th day in a row--a record that goes back to 1987. To me, that is saying that the markets and the American people are hopeful about what might be accomplished together under this administration.  One of the things we heard last night, as well, is a reflection of what Vice President Pence has told us in private gatherings--I have heard him say it in public gatherings as well--which is that the administration is in the ``promise-keeping business.'' Keeping your promises is important. How are you going to maintain the public's confidence when people say one thing when they are campaigning, and then,[[Page S1515]]once they are sworn into office, they forget about those promises and move on? I am grateful this administration believes in the importance of keeping promises.  We have already seen the President keep his promises to help rein in overreaching regulations; his commitment to reforming the Tax Code, which he talked about last night, so that the economy can grow again and we can all benefit; and his commitment to repealing and replacing the failed experiment of All of these, he reiterated, he has begun to work on, and he has actually committed to seeing them through to completion. These just aren't talking points, these are promises he has already begun delivering on.  I am personally grateful--and I am sure the Presiding Officer is as well--that he has also reprioritized our national security. National security is just not one on a cafeteria plan that we can kind of walk into and say: I will take a little of this and a little of that. National security is the 1 priority for the Federal No one else can do that. At a time when our country faces innumerable threats from all around the world, including terrorism here at home, I appreciate the fact that the President is committed to doing what it takes to restore our national security, to protect our borders, and to restore the rule of law.  I think it is just as simple as this President is committed to getting back to the basics of governing. He is doing what he said he would do, and I find that reassuring, together with the outstanding Cabinet members he has selected to serve with him in his administration.  What America needs and what my constituents in Texas call, write, and ask me about all the time is a way forward that delivers security to our people, encourages prosperity for everyone, and instills confidence in the job creators and investors so we can enjoy a new era of prosperity for all of our people.  I am confident President Trump, in working closely with Congress, can deliver on these and many more promises he has made to the American people. It is obvious to me, from his comments last night, that he is welcoming and inviting our Democratic colleagues to stop the resistance--to stop the obstruction--and to actually come join us in helping to move the country forward. I find that refreshing and welcome, as I hope some of our colleagues will who still haven't quite gotten over the election on November 8 and the constituents they have who feel they are still in a protest mode. There is a time for competing in elections, and then there is a time for governing. That takes all of us, as adults who care deeply about our country, working together on a bipartisan basis to try to find common ground and move the American people's agenda forward.  I look forward to working with the President to make America a stronger, safer, and more economically vibrant nation. That is something we all want and something we should all work together to achieve.  As I said, as we go forward, I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle look at the bigger picture. I have been here long enough to experience when people run for election--like many will do in 2018--and have no record of accomplishment to point to. I believe the Presiding Officer knows what I am talking about. Growing our economy and protecting our homeland should be bipartisan. It should be nonpartisan. And, as the President mentioned, now is the time to come together to unify as Americans to make our country stronger.  I hope all of our colleagues will join together, including our Democratic friends, to let us get to the work of legislating, to let us get off of this extended foot-dragging timetable on confirming the President's nominees for his Cabinet, especially when we are seeing votes like we saw on Mr.Zinke and Mr.Ross--68 to 31, 72 to 27. There is no rationale for delaying those confirmations when our Democratic colleagues are voting to confirm them. We could have done this on January 20.

Hours after this executive order was signed, Emon and her father went to the airport in Djibouti, passed through security, and, when boarding the plane, Emon was told by the airline that she could not board because of the recently signed executive order.                              {time}  1030  The immigrant visa issued to Emon would have given her status as a lawful permanent resident upon entering the U.And since she is 12 years old and both of her parents are U.citizens, Emon would have immediately been eligible to file for U.citizenship.  President Trump's executive order is preventing this legal process from taking place and is putting Emon and her father in harm's way while they wait in  In the past 48 hours, the Trump administration has been defending this executive order, saying it is not a travel ban or a ban on refugees. So I would like to ask the President: How is this executive order not a ban on refugees or individuals who have been legally approved to enter the United States? It certainly is a ban for And how is keeping this 12-year-old girl out of the United States from joining her family making America safer? It is not making Americans safer.  Extreme vetting was in place during both the Bush and Obama administrations. We just didn't call it that by name.  This travel ban is flawed, both in its lack of adherence to American values and its technical execution, which is banning Emon from coming here, and it could possibly be ruled unconstitutional.  A bipartisan group of national security experts agree that the executive order does not make Americans safer and could potentially put our country at greater risk for terrorist attacks. I agree with them.  Since September 11, 2001, we have focused a bipartisan effort to improve[[Page H827]]American security for Americans both at home and abroad, and by and large, it has been very successful.  It is our first constitutional duty to ensure the national defense and the safety of Americans, but I think President Trump's executive order is doing the opposite. The executive order will create a rallying cry for Islamic extremists around the world to say that America is now engaged in a war against the religion of No good can come from that. It is clear that this executive order is putting Emon and her father in harm's way in  So, Mr.President, Secretary Kelly, I appeal to your compassion and to your common sense. This 12-year-old girl, Emon, has been extremely vetted for 6 years or whatever you would like to call it. She is not a threat to our country. Let her join her American family.

Benjamin Carson was unanimously reported out of the Senate Banking Committee on January 24.  To many Americans, Carson needs no introduction; however, his impressive resume bears repeating. Carson was raised by a single mother in an impoverished part of the city of He attended Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School and later became a highly accomplished and respected neurosurgeon. Carson was named director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1984, at the age of 33--the youngest such director in the  He gained national fame in the 1980s by becoming the first doctor to lead an operation that separated twins who were conjoined at the head--one of many high-profile operations led by He also ran for President this past election and spent months traveling the country, listening to the American people about the problems and the issues they face with respect to housing.  During his testimony before our committee, Carson highlighted his commitment to carrying forth the[[Page S1514]]mandate of HUD and to learning more from the people who are directly affected by HUD policies. He has also received bipartisan letters of support from four former HUD Secretaries--Henry Cisneros, former Senator Mel Martinez, Alphonso Jackson, and Steven Preston--who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations.  He has said he plans to continue his conversation with the American people and do a listening tour if confirmed. This is an encouraging sign that Carson wants to hear from stakeholders and, more importantly, from the American people.  There are many HUD issues to be addressed. Once confirmed, we can begin working on several important issues under HUD's jurisdiction. Streamlining requirements for local public housing authorities, revising certain public housing programs, and strengthening financing for small and rural affordable housing developments are areas that should be addressed. Tackling homelessness, especially among our Nation's veterans, is another issue that is important to me and should be addressed.  It is critical that HUD allow local communities to craft solutions that work best for their needs. There has been bipartisan interest in several of these reforms over the years, and I am confident we can make progress once Carson is confirmed.  Carson has consistently demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of his fellow Americans, and his intellect, leadership, and life experiences are unique, valuable assets for leading an agency like  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Carson's nomination so we can continue the great work of improving America's housing system.

8252,topic-id,312,"Mr.Speaker, at a time here in America when mass shootings have become all too frequent, at a time when bullets literally rip apart human bodies and human families and cause so much pain, at a time when effective groups like Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense and Texas Gun Sense and the P.E.A.C.Initiative are asking this Congress to act to reduce gun violence, this Congress has committed itself to doing absolutely nothing about that violence.  If you are on the terrorist watch list and you cannot fly, not to worry about buying a gun. It's ``No fly,'' but you can still buy.  Today we are told the problem isn't that there are too many guns out there causing too much harm to American families. There are not enough. A group is being left out, omitted from access to guns.  There are a group of Americans, who either from birth or by contracting some mental disability later in life, have a mental impairment that is so significant that we ask taxpayers across America to provide them support through the Social Security disability system. They are declared to be disabled.  And within that group that is taxpayer funded, there is a much smaller group whose disability is so severe that they can't handle their own affairs. They can't receive a check. But these folks say don't worry that you can't place a check in their hand and you have to give it to someone else, it is okay to put a gun in their hands. That is what this proposal does.  Now, we have, as they have failed to point out, a system in place at the Veterans' Administration so that if someone is a veteran and they are disabled, there is a process by which they are included within this system.

In short, there is due process to ensure they are not unfairly denied gun access.

8211,topic-id,1560,"Mr.President, today I am proud to introduce the Desert Protection and Recreation Act of 2017.  This bill, a decade in the making, charts a commonsense path forward for the California desert. The goal is simple: to manage California's fragile desert resources in a sustainable and comprehensive manner.  This bill provides something for everyone that appreciates the national treasure that is the California desert. That this bill provides something for everyone is a result of the painstaking effort to build consensus among the array of groups that use the desert, including: environmental groups; Federal, State, and local governments; the off-road community; cattle ranchers; mining interests; and energy companies and California's public utility companies.  As I will further describe later, the bill preserves 230,000 acres of wilderness and another 44,000 acres of national park land, each unrivaled for their unique natural landscapes. The bill also safeguards 77 miles of free-flowing rivers and the abundant life and rich biodiversity these rivers and streams often support.  Importantly, the bill provides certainty to off-road enthusiasts, establishing 142,000 acres of permanent off-highway recreation areas--a first for the I made a commitment to off-roaders to enact the entire bill, not just parts of the bill. I hope to fulfill that promise.  The efforts to protect the desert are a long time coming. This effort first began with the original California Desert Protection Act, signed into law more than twenty years ago.  Picking up where my predecessors left off, I introduced that bill only three months after I was sworn in as a senator. Through hard work and perseverance, we were able to pass that law on the last day of the 103rd Congress, and President Clinton signed the bill into law in October 1994.  The original Desert Protection Act was a crowning achievement for desert conservation, establishing 69 new Wilderness areas, creating the Mojave National Preserve, and converting Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Monuments into National All told, we were able to protect, or increase protections for, about 9.6 million acres.  It continues to attract millions of tourists to southern California, which is a boon for the economy.  It has ensured that these enduring landscapes will be preserved for future generations.  Since we passed the 1994 desert conservation bill, we've tried to build on this legacy of conservation. After years of collaboration with an array of stakeholders, we introduced new legislation in 2009.  The goal of that bill was simple: to help manage California's desert resources through a comprehensive approach that balanced conservation, recreation, energy production, among other needs.  After years of work, including two hearings in the Senate, we reached a major milestone this past February, when President Obama designated three new national monuments in the California desert: Castle Mountains, Mojave Trails, and Sand to  Those monuments, based on the legislation I had introduced, created one of the world's largest desert reserves, encompassing nearly 1.8 million acres of America's public lands.  Those monuments connect vital wildlife corridors and habitats, preserve cultural resources, and establish an important buffer to the inevitable changes climate change will usher in for these fragile desert ecosystems.  While the newly-designated desert monuments formed a cornerstone for future desert protection, our work is not complete. That is why I am introducing this legislation today.  While I supported President Obama's decision to create three national monuments in the Mojave Desert, his authority under the Antiquities Act did not allow him to include the many other valuable provisions in the original legislation.  Our intention has always been to balance the many uses of the desert through legislation, and that remains the case today. That is why I reintroduced that legislation immediately following the President's designation, and that is why I am introducing a bill again today: to make the rest of the provisions a reality.  The legislation I am introducing today therefore includes all of the provisions the President was not able to enact through executive action under the Antiquities  These negotiated provisions--which represent our best attempt to achieve consensus among desert stakeholders--deserve to become law.  That legislation includes many additional conservation areas and provides permanent protection for five Off-Highway Recreation Areas covering approximately 142,000 acres. Off-roaders were a vital part of the coalition we put together, and unfortunately those lands could not be designated under executive action. Off-roaders deserve certainty about their future use of the land, just as there is now certainty for conservation purposes. I gave them my word that I would fight for them, and I intend to do so again in this new  This bill would also expand wilderness areas in the desert, by designating five additional wilderness areas that cover 230,000 acres of land near Fort  The bill would ensure clean and free-flowing rivers, through the designation of 77 miles of rivers as Wild and Scenic Rivers; add to our national parks, by expanding Death Valley National Park Wilderness by 39,000 acres and Joshua Tree National Park by 4,500 acres; expand National Scenic Areas, by adding[[Page S115]]18,610 acres to the Alabama Hills National Scenic Area in Inyo County; and protect 81,000 acres of land in San Bernardino and Imperial County, and requires the Department of the Interior to protect petroglyphs and other cultural resources important to the surrounding tribes and communities.  Lastly, the bill will facilitate renewable energy development in a way that protects delicate habitat.  I want to highlight some of the key provisions of this legislation:  By designating five new wilderness areas, this bill protects fragile desert ecosystems across 230,000 acres of wilderness near Fort This includes 88,000 acres of Avawatz Mountains, 8,000-acre Great Falls Basin Wilderness, the 80,000-acre Soda Mountains Wilderness, and the 32,500-acre Death Valley  The desert's sweeping desert vistas and rugged mountain terrain not only provide for a truly remarkable backcountry experience, but also provide vital refuge for everything from bighorn sheep and desert tortoises to Joshua Trees and Native American artifacts.  This bill is more than just wilderness, however. It also designates four new Wild and Scenic Rivers, totaling 77 miles in length. These beautiful waterways, carved through the heart of the arid desert, are Deep Creek and the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National Forest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near Death Valley National  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing wilderness study area designation in response to requests from local government and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made available for other purposes, including recreational off-highway vehicle use on designated routes.  We must also take into account another use of the desert land: renewable energy. I believe that we can honor our commitment to conservation while fulfilling California's pledge to develop a clean energy portfolio.  Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we just need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of these compromises are already in place.  By April 2009, solar and wind companies had proposed 28 projects to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, including sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent conservation. I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly beautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres of pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, I quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the right place for renewable energy development.  Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. This is due in part to the state and federal governments' efforts to develop and finalize the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan--an ambitious effort to comprehensively manage renewable energy, conservation, and recreation on 22.5 million acres of California desert.  By working with our state to develop this Plan, the federal government has shown it can be an effective partner in the State's efforts to combat climate change, all while protecting the magnificent, yet fragile, California desert landscape.  The bill also makes use of about 370,000 acres of isolated, unusable parcels of State lands spread across the California desert. These small isolated parcels of State land in wilderness, national parks and monuments would be exchanged for Federal lands elsewhere that could potentially provide the State with viable sites for renewable energy development, off-highway vehicle recreation, or other commercial purposes.  This blueprint will help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct energy projects elsewhere.  This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a clear path forward.  I strongly urge my colleagues to take a good look at this legislation. I hope they understand that the many stakeholders involved have made their voices heard.  As you can see, there are many diverse interests in California's desert lands, an it is not easy to bring them all into agreement. But after years of painstaking efforts, they have reached agreement on this bill.  Desert conservation has never been a partisan issue. Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to preserve this great piece of land.  Given our past success, I am hopeful this Congress will take this legislation up and move it forward. Most importantly, I hope this body recognizes the simple fact that desert conservation has never been a partisan issue.  Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to preserve this great piece of land. It's the right thing to do.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS114.txt,1332,FIRST RESPONDER IDENTIFICATION OF EMERGENCY NEEDS IN DISASTER,2017.0,5.0,February

8153,topic-id,647,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today for the very first time in this Chamber as a servant of Pennsylvania's EighthDistrict--the good people of Bucks and Montgomery Counties--serving as their independent voice. The weight of this responsibilityshould not be lost on any of us. It is my sincere hope that each one of us here--regardless of where we come from or what ourpast experiences have been or how long we have been here--will do what the American people are demanding of us at this time: towork together as problem-solvers, not work against each other as ideologues.  Our Founders envisioned citizen legislators chosen from their peers to work on their behalf and to serve honorably with afocus on solutions, and then return home and live under the laws they helped pass, making way for a new generation of leadershipwith new ideas and a fresh perspective. Unfortunately, Mr.Speaker, we as a nation have strayed from that vision.  Today too many Americans feel left out. They see a system that does more to preserve the status quo than it does to solveour most pressing challenges. They see a class of career politicians and elite insiders. I wish I could tell my constituents--mybosses--that this problem is exaggerated and that this mess in Washington doesn't affect them or their families or theirbusinesses.  But as a former anticorruption FBI special agent, I have seen the brokenness in our system, and I know the real-life impactthat it has, which is both soft and hard corruption that tilts the legislative agenda towards special interests, electoralcomplacency that allows lawmakers to focus on accumulating power rather than serving their constituents, and an entrenchedpartisanship that grinds the gears of government to a halt.  Mr.Speaker, this does not have to be the fate of this It does not. The 115th Congress can be remembered as theone that buried party labels for good and focused on fixing the system. To that end, I have introduced legislative proposals tobegin that process: a constitutional amendment enacting term limits for all Members of Congress and a constitutional amendmentpreventing Members of Congress from being paid unless a budget is passed.[[Page H398]]This is not just withholding payment for aperiod of time; this is a complete forfeiture.  I propose a balanced budget amendment so we are forced to stop kicking the can down the road and will create a fiscal paththat will allow the next generation to thrive.

Share your vision with your constituents because they need to know that our Nation isnot resigned to the status quo.  Mr.Speaker, Washington needs fewer politicians and more independent voices focused on serving the American people. That isthe reason we are here. Let's not let them down.

8205,topic-id,4482,"Madam Speaker, I might say it is great seeing you in the chair. You are a natural fit. Maybe we can do something about that at some point.  It is an honor to speak in this hallowed There has been much ado made about contrived misrepresentations about what has gone on with President Trump's executive order regarding seven countries that the Obama administration designated as being problems when it comes to refugees coming from those countries.  It has been absolutely incredible. And I think some of us were talking that it really exemplifies why networks like CNN--that was the one, the only 24-hour cable news network--have lost so much to other networks. MSNBC, CNBC, and even Fox News got caught up in some of the misrepresentations, and I couldn't believe that they were spending the kind of time talking about a contrived issue.  Now, there was a problem in some innocent people being delayed and improperly handled, people who didn't deserve that. I am familiar with how that feels because I deal, like most of us do in this body, with TSA on virtually a weekly or even sometimes more often basis.  There is a great article here by John Hayward from January 29. Mr.Hayward says:  ``The sober and logical reasons for President Donald Trump's executive order on refugees and visitors are rising above the noise after an evening of hysterical over-reactions and emotional meltdowns on the Nation's TV networks.  ``Advocates of sane, secure immigration policy have long noted that it's almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion of the refugee and immigration issues, because it's been sentimentalized and politicized beyond the realm of rational thought.  ``This weekend brings them another superb example of media-magnified shrieking about fascism, bleating about `white nationalists,' howling about `religious persecution,' false invocations of the Constitution, and theatrical sobbing on behalf of the Statue of Liberty.''  We do have that water coming off the Statute of Liberty being analyzed, so that we can determine whether or not it is tears or something else.  ``For readers who want to wallow in the emotion, examples can be found in this handy dossier of hysteria compiled by the Washington But clear-eyed adults prefer to examine plain facts about Trump's executive order:  ``1. It is NOT a `Muslim ban.' ''  I have the executive order here. Unlike those in the Senate and those in the media, who were just excoriating President Trump and anyone involved in this executive order, I actually read it, unlike those people. I read the executive order.                              {time}  1745  And because I read the executive order, I understood there was no ban against Muslims, no ban against It was very straightforward. And Hayward's article points that out.  He said: ``You will search the executive order in vain for mentions of Islam, or any other religion. By Sunday morning, the media began suffering acute attacks of honesty and writing headlines such as `Trump's Latest Executive Order: Banning People From 7 Countries and More.''  And that was from And, Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that CNN finally got around to having a more truthful headline.  ``Granted, CNN still slips in the phrase `Muslim-majority countries' into every article about the order, including the post in which they reprinted its text in full, but CNN used the word `Muslim,' not The order applies to all citizens of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and It does not specify The indefinite hold on Syrian refugees[[Page H804]]will affect Christians and Muslims alike,'' not to mention people of every other religion and people of no religion.  ``As Tim Carney at the Washington Examiner points out, the largest Muslim-majority countries in the world are not named in the Executive  ``More countries may be added to the moratorium in the days to come, as the Secretary of Homeland Security has been instructed to complete a 30-day review of nations that don't provide adequate information for vetting applicants.  ``It is also noteworthy that the ban is not absolute. Exceptions for `foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3 and G-4 visas' are expressly made in the order. The Departments of State and Homeland Security can also grant exceptions on a `case-by-case basis' ''--that is all in the executive order--``and `when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.'  ``There is a provision in the Executive Order that says applications based on religious persecution will be prioritized `provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.' ''  And so it is important to note here, I think from the executive order, that it says applications based on religious persecution. That means that people that have applied for visas or immigration benefits to come into the United States who, themselves, raise their religion as a reason to let them into the United States, those need to be prioritized based on whether or not their religion is actually being persecuted, those holding those religious beliefs are actually being persecuted. And I think that is a rather intelligent way to approach things.  But in those cases, it would be the applicant that would raise the issue of religion, not the Trump administration, not the State Department, not Homeland It would be the foreign applicant trying to come into the United States who would be the one to raise that issue.  Now, the article goes on: ``This has been denounced as a `stealth Muslim ban' by some of the very same people who were conspicuously silent when the Obama administration pushed Christians--who are the most savagely persecuted minority in the Middle East, with only the Yazidis offering real competition--to the back of the migration line.''  So it is important to note that, for years, this administration has been part of the discrimination and persecution against Christians in the world against whom there has been a genocide in progress.  So when the head of the U.was in charge of the refugee program and was asked why is there not a similar percentage of Christians coming in as refugees to other countries to the percentage that Christians make up in that nation they come from, basically, the man who is now head of United Nations said, well, it is important to leave them where they have this historical presence, basically.  So in other words, yes, there is a genocide going on. They want to kill off every Christian in those areas, every Christian in the Middle East, and so the U.now Secretary General says let's leave them in the area where they are being wiped off the map, brutally killed. Let's leave them there until we can say this place where they were historically has now shown there are none there. They have all been brutally murdered as the U.watched and didn't help. It is outrageous how uncivilized this United Nations has become.  I filed a bill, and I still think we should bring it to the floor, that would require a complete defunding by the United States of the United Nations until such time as they withdraw the resolution of the Security Council that condemned  I mean, it is like a teacher of mine in the fifth grade after I got beat up by a bully who had been held back two grades, was about 18 inches taller. She pointed to the class and said: This is what happens when little boys try to play with the big boys.  Well, that is basically what the Obama administration had been doing. It is basically what the U.had been doing. They took the side of the mean bullies that had been devastating the Christians in the area.  Having talked to so many Christians who were living in Syria and who the mainstream press say, oh, yeah, they are big Assad fans--no, they were not big Assad fans. They knew that he could be quite brutal, but their only point that the mainstream media in the United States and most of the world was missing is that Assad prevented Christians from being the victims of a genocide; and as Assad was weakened, the assaults and the murders and the rapes of Christians increased exponentially.  I do think that the United States may still be held to account in the ledger of world history--what I would submit is God's ledger--for having the power and the moral right to stop a genocide of Christians in the Middle East and we participated in leaving them where they were, as did the U.N., so that they could be brutally murdered.  I am going back to Mr.Hayward's article.  ``2. The order''--talking about the executive order of Donald ``The order is based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama's deputies.''  And, Madam Speaker, for those in the mainstream media, I think it is important to repeat that line. President Trump's executive order that didn't ban Muslims but that ordered a temporary pause on people from certain countries from whom we had no information or inadequate information to vet the people that were coming in, it was based on security reviews conducted by President Barack Obama's deputies.  ``As White House counselor Kellyanne Conway pointed out on `Fox News Sunday,' the seven nations named in Trump's executive order are drawn from the Terrorist Prevention Act of 2015. The 2015 `Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015' named Iraq, Iran, Sudan, and Syria, while its 2016 update added Libya, Somalia, and  `` `These are countries that have a history of training, harboring, exporting terrorists. We can't keep pretending and look the other way,' said  ``3. The moratorium is largely temporary. Citizens of the seven countries''--and by the way, in this executive order that President Trump signed, there is no mention of the countries. It refers to what President Obama signed declaring, first, the four countries, and then the three countries.  It just refers to that that President Obama signed. He doesn't single out or name the countries; and I can't help but think, as intelligent as some of the people are that are assisting President Trump, that they showed a massive amount of naivete because it appears that they thought, if in the executive order President Trump refers to documents that President Obama signed designating these countries as countries where we didn't have adequate information, then even the mainstream media would have to go back to President Trump's and look above his signature and see that these are places that President Obama said were threats.  And then they would--having some semblance of a conscience--have to point out that actually Trump is just putting in an executive order of what basically Obama signed off on but didn't go ahead and carry out what needed to be done based on that law.  But, as I say, these folks were rather naive. And as the saying goes in Washington, no matter how cynical you get, it is never enough to catch up in this town. And so the Trump administration, the Trump advisers have a lot of growing to do to understand just how unfair the media can be. It is a valid presumption that if you don't name the countries, you make the mainstream media go back and look at what President Obama signed that they will understand, oh, this is what President Obama proclaimed that he is basing this on, so we can't be so mean to President  Well, it didn't turn out that way, and they are learning that just because it would make great sense, be common sense in most areas of the country--that is areas that are not the fringe[[Page H805]]that voted for Hillary Clinton, but most of the country would say it is common sense. It isn't common within the original 10-by-10 mile boundaries of the District of Columbia, which are no longer 10 by 10 after ceding the land west of the Potomac to Virginia back in the 1840s.  But number four in this Hayward article: ``Obama banned immigration from Iraq, and Carter banned it from  `` `Fact-checking' website PolitiFact twists itself into knots to avoid giving a `true' rating to the absolutely true fact that Jimmy Carter banned Iranian immigration in 1980, unless applicants could prove they were enemies of the Khomenei theocracy.  ``One of PolitiFact's phony talking points states that Carter `acted against Iranian nationals, not an entire religion.' As noted above, Trump's Executive Order is precisely the same--it does not act against an `entire religion,' it names seven countries.''  But, you know, I had some personal experience with I used the word earlier today, ``hack,'' ``political hack,'' in an interview, and that is what I think of They shouldn't be called They ought to be called ``PolitiHack.''                              {time}  1800  I know I was speaking here on the House floor--I think it was last year--and I made a statement based on data received by the Senate on the percentage of American citizens and the percentage of noncitizens--non-American citizens--who were in Federal prison for possession of a controlled substance. The reason I singled out possession was because President Obama has tried to make it appear that people in Federal prison have gotten such a bad rap because they really--just simple possession--they didn't deserve to be in prison so long. There is this whole intimation that, gee, there are people in Federal prison for possession of controlled substances who should have been let out a long time ago, and that is why we needed to have our laws changed.  Well, since the President had mentioned people in Federal prison for possession, I singularly pointed out that the huge majority of people in Federal prison for simple possession were not American citizens. I'm going from my memory, but, apparently, PolitiFact wanted to do as they normally do and cover for the Democrats and try to do a hatchet job on a Republican since they are not political fact, they are political hack. So my communications person gets an email from ``PolitiHack'' that uses the name PolitiFact and wanted to know the source of my information because they were going to rate my statement. She provided the facts as provided by this administration to the  Clearly what I had said was exactly true. I had quoted specifically from the data from the Obama administration, and it was 100 percent accurate. So then they come back--they thought they would catch me in not having proper information, and they come back to my communications person and said: Well, we have got information from the Bureau of Prisons that showed that if you look at all offenses that involved controlled substances, the percentage of noncitizens is not nearly that high. So why would he use just possession?  The point was because President Obama had used simple possession to try to make it look as if people in Federal prison were not there for very serious crimes, and there is certainly a smaller number of people in Federal prison for possession than for dealing drugs and other charges.  So in the end, after all the back and forth, they basically perpetuated a fraud upon the American people, PolitiFact--a bunch of political hacks--by not being willing to say that my statement was 100 percent true because they, in some contorted manner, did not want to point out that my statement was exactly true. They refer basically to, oh, that the number wasn't near that high of people involved in controlled substance. I didn't mention everybody with controlled substance.  So that is just a parenthetical in Hayward's article for me because I know personally PolitiFact is a political joke if what they were doing was not so serious in harming the American people by misrepresenting the true facts of what is going on. I hope that at some point being still remaining an entrepreneurial country for a little longer--at least we have got nearly 4 years to go that we can be assured of as an entrepreneurial country--at least in that time perhaps we will have an entrepreneurial group that will rise up and start scoring PolitiFact to show just how unfair they are, and, on occasion, when they are actually fair, show that as well so the American public can actually score the illegitimate scorers.  But going back to this article, it says: ``As for Barack Obama, he did indeed ban immigration from Iraq, for much longer than Trump's order bans it from the seven listed nations, and none of the people melting down today uttered a peep of protest. Richard Grenell summed it up perfectly in a Tweet: `Obama took 6 months to review screening for 1 country. Trump will take 3 months for 7 countries. . . . ' ''  This article goes on: ``5. Trump's refugee caps are comparable to Obama's pre-2016 practices: David French, who was touted as a spoiler candidate to keep Donald Trump out of the White House during the presidential campaign--in other words, not a big Trump fan--wrote a lengthy and clear-headed analysis of the Executive Order for National He noted that after the moratorium ends in 120 days''--and that is one section. It ends in 120 days, the other section is 90 days, another part says they will have 30 days to produce a report.  But it goes on to say: ``Trump caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year . . . which is roughly the same as President Obama's admissions in 2011 and 2012, and not far below the 70,000 per year cap in place from 2013 to 2015.  ``Obama had fairly low caps on refugees during the worst years of the Syrian civil war. He didn't throw open the doors to mass refugee admissions until his final year in office. Depending on how Trump's review of Syrian refugee policy turns out, he's doing little more than returning admissions to normal levels after a four-month pause for security reviews.  ``6. The Executive Order is legal: Those invoking the Constitution to attack Trump's order are simply embarrassing themselves. The President has clear statutory authority to take these actions. As noted, his predecessors did so, without much controversy.  ``Most of the legal arguments against Trump's order summarized by USA Today are entirely specious, such as attacking him for `banning an entire religion,' which the order manifestly does not do. Critics of the order have a political opinion that it will in effect `ban Muslims,' but that's not what it says. Designating specific nations as trouble spots and ordering a pause is entirely within the President's authority, and there is ample precedent to prove it.  ``It should be possible to argue with the reasoning behind the order, or argue that it will have negative unintended consequences, without advancing hollow legal arguments. Of course, this is America 2017, so a wave of lawsuits will soon be sloshing through the courts.  ``7. This Executive Order is a security measure, not an arbitrary expression of supposed xenophobia. Conway stressed the need to enhance immigration security from trouble spots in her `Fox News Sunday' interview. French also addressed the subject in his post:  ``When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know they've succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations.''  The article goes on. It is well written, points are well made, and I would humbly submit, Madam Speaker, that we had the statistics last year that showed that for the cost of bringing one Syrian refugee to the United States for 1 year, we could help take care of 12 Syrian refugees in place in a safe zone over near their home.[[Page H806]]  Now, I am very encouraged that even though President Obama simply would not ever agree or strive to have a safe zone in areas near the refugees' homes so we can take care of 12 times more than we can possibly bring to our country for the same cost, and he is working on that, and he has got some agreements, and it looks like that may be a possibility. We give air cover, help create safe zones in areas there in the Middle East so the refugees can live without being killed and horribly brutally murdered and abused. That makes more sense. It appears that the President has worked with or talked with the Saudi authorities and perhaps will be able to get something like that worked out.  There were people just quite emotional over the fact that Saudi Arabia was not mentioned and Egypt was not mentioned. Actually, the order did not mention any nations by name. The Trump executive order simply referred to what President Obama signed off on which included seven countries. These are seven countries where it shouldn't even be arguable among people of common sense that we do not have, have not received, and cannot get adequate information from which to determine whether people wanting to come into the United States are actually refugees or if they are part of al Qaeda, al Nusra, and ISIS, and they want to come kill Americans and end our freedoms and our way of life. That is why such an executive order was entirely appropriate.  Although I supported a different candidate for President for over a year, I applaud President Trump in caring so deeply about the American public that he would take the honorable and appropriate steps to protect Americans that the last administration would not take.  A great article in Townhall from Matt Vespa is entitled: ``Friendly Reminder: Obama Selected The List Of Seven Countries in Trump's Executive Order.'' That certainly should be noted yet again.  Another great article here by Seth Frantzman says: ``Obama's Administration Made the `Muslim Ban' Possible and the Media Won't Tell You.'' It is a good article there.  I think this article from John Hayward from January 27 on Breitbart may give us insight as to why there is so much howling by CAIR and CAIR associates because there were implications of people involved with CAIR in the Holy Land Foundation trial.                              {time}  1815  One just merely need to go look at the pleadings. Here in Congress, since Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch went through their entire terms as Attorneys General and continued to refuse to provide the discovery documents in the Holy Land Foundation trial that were provided in pretrial to the convicted terrorist supporters, it is pretty incomprehensible for some of us.  On one occasion, when Attorney General Holder pointed out that, well, there may be some classified issues involved, I pointed out to him--apparently, it went right over his head and he couldn't discern--the fact that the Justice Department gave the documents I am requesting to people that were then convicted of supporting terrorism.  If Justice could give them to the terrorists without concern about being classified, surely they could give them to Members of Although some of us may argue in such ways that it terrifies some people, we are not terrorists and we are authorized to receive classified information. We should have been authorized in Congress to receive the same documents that the Justice Department provided to the terrorist supporters who were convicted.  This article from John Hayward, January 27, points out that:  ``According to Reuters, a `factional' debate is under way within the Trump administration over adding the Muslim Brotherhood to the State Department and Treasury lists of foreign terrorist organizations.  ``This is a measure often called for by critics of the Brotherhood as Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney, who once again recommended an official terrorist designation on Wednesday's edition of Breitbart News  ``A source in the Trump transition team told Reuters the effort to so designate the Muslim Brotherhood is led by National Security Adviser Michael The source was personally in agreement with  ``In Congress, a bill to add the Muslim Brotherhood to the official terrorist list was introduced this month by Senator Ted Cruz and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson denounced the Muslim Brotherhood as an `agent of radical Islam' during his confirmation hearings, but he has not made public statements regarding adding them to the foreign terrorist organization list.  However, other Trump advisers, and members of the intelligence and law-enforcement communities, argue the Brotherhood has `evolved peacefully in some countries,' Reuters claims.  ``They also expressed the pragmatic concern that going hard on the Muslim Brotherhood could complicate diplomatic relations with nations such as It would unquestionably, however, please such U.allies as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, although there have been signs the Saudis might be softening on the Brotherhood as they search for allies against ISIS in  ``One official familiar with the State Department's deliberations conceded that the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology has influenced such terrorist groups as Hamas, but since it is a large, loose organization spread over several nations, it could be legally difficult to apply the terrorist designation. Allied nations such as Britain have also expressed suspicions about the Brotherhood's influence, while stopping short of a formal terrorist designation.''  So this is important to note. It is a good article. But I can't help but wonder if the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, may be getting quite concerned about the potential for designating their friends in the Muslim  There may be a mutual relationship there. There may be people that are part of both groups. No doubt, CAIR is getting quite concerned about heightened talk about naming the Muslim Brotherhood as the terrorist organization they are. It is just that they don't use terrorist tactics, as some of them have indicated before, when they are making great progress without terrorism, but knowing that eventually, after they get as far as they can with peaceful methods, they will ultimately be resorting to terrorism to bring the United States and other Western civilizations, countries into the international caliphate, wherein we are ruled by a caliph.  So it is interesting times. Here, tonight, in perhaps an hour and a half or so, our new President will name the nominee to fill the Honorable Antonin Scalia's spot on the Supreme He is still greatly missed. He was a great man. He was a great jurist. He was a great patriot and he was great for America and our freedoms. So we will look forward to hearing that.

President Carter had identified an area that really didn't have any wildlife to speak of. Yes, it was part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but it was an area that really didn't have wildlife to speak of. As I understand it, there are some caribou that may walk across there from time to time, but they can't stay because there is not enough to sustain them. But President Carter, as anticarbon energy as he was, realized that is an area that we can agree ought to be drilled for the production of oil and gas, and it has been fought over and over.  Who stands to gain?  Well, actually, the American public. But since so much oil has now been found out in my friend Mike Conaway's district in west Texas, up in the Dakotas, we are not as needful of that as we were. But the people who will really benefit are the people of Alaska, and then additional beneficiaries will be the people of the United States and the people who want to get out from under the iron fist of Russia rising. We will be able to help them with that by not only becoming energy independent; but after energy independent, exporting oil and gas to other nations so they don't feel the pinch that nations like China and Russia are putting on them.

8247,topic-id,926,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.40, a joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of the rules submitted by the Social Security Administration relating to implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.  On December 19, 2016, in the waning days of the previous administration, the Social Security Administration published a rule finalizing the criteria for sending the names of certain Social Security beneficiaries to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System,  Under the rule, an individual's name will be sent to the NICS if they receive disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits based on having a mental disorder, the person is between age 18 and the full retirement age, and the SSA determines that the person needs a representative payee to manage their benefits. Individuals who meet these criteria would be prohibited from exercising their Second Amendment right to possess firearms.  This rule is a slap in the face of those in the disabled community because it paints all those who suffer from mental disorders with the same broad brush. It assumes that simply because an individual suffers from a mental condition, that individual is unfit to exercise his or her Second Amendment rights. No data exists to support such an egregious assertion. In fact, studies show that those who suffer from mental disorders are more likely to be victims of crime rather than perpetrators of crime.  Furthermore, there is a total absence of any meaningful due process protections under the rule. Currently, citizens lose their right to possess a firearm when they have been convicted by a judge or jury of a felony or misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, when they have been dishonorably discharged after given a hearing, or when they have been deemed a fugitive after being given an option to appear and avail themselves of their due process rights, among other reasons.                              {time}  1345  All of these have one thing in common: they all provide due process to the affected individual.  Under the SSA rule, the affected party has no ability to defend himself or to even introduce evidence before the SSA denies his right to possess a firearm. Additionally, at no time during the process during which the SSA is seeking to deny someone his Second Amendment rights must the Social Security Administration make a determination that the individual poses a risk to himself or others. This is the standard that has long been used to determine if the right to possess a firearm should be prohibited.  Some may point to the rule's appeals process as providing a form of due process. However, the appeals process is severely flawed because it puts the burden on individuals to prove that restoring their Second Amendment rights would not pose a danger to public safety or be contrary to the public interest. In every other instance in which someone is facing a loss of his ability to possess a firearm, the burden is on the government to prove that the individual should have his right taken away. Under this flawed system, the individual bears the burden against the government. This is not what due process looks like.  During debate on the rule for this joint resolution, I heard a number of reasons from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as to why they opposed this joint resolution. Quite frankly, I am shocked at what little regard they have for the disabled community. The gentleman from Massachusetts claimed that this joint resolution was done at the bidding of the National Rifle Yes, the National Rifle Association does support H.40. However, what my colleague from Massachusetts failed to mention during the debate yesterday was who else supports the joint resolution.  Supporters include the American Association of People with Disabilities, the National Disability Rights Network, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Arc of the United States, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the Disability Law Center of Alaska, the National Council on Independent Living, and the National Coalition for Mental Health Even the National Council on Disability--an independent Federal agency that makes recommendations to the President and Congress to enhance the quality of life for all Americans with disabilities and their families--has called on Congress to utilize the Congressional Review Act in order to repeal this rule.  It was also mentioned--and will, undoubtedly, be mentioned here later today--that this rule received over 91,000 comments. What they didn't tell you, and what I am guessing they won't tell you today, is that the overwhelming majority of the comments opposed the rule. Opposition wasn't based on small, technical issues. It was based on the fundamentally flawed concept of the rule. Many of the organizations I mentioned earlier provided comments to the agency. Rather than listen to the organizations advocating for the rights of the disabled, the previous administration decided to ignore them.  I thank the gentleman from the State of Texas (Mr.Sam Johnson) for his hard work on this important issue that affects law-abiding citizens in every congressional district in  I ask my colleagues to support this resolution--to stand with the disabled community and to stand with the Support H.40.

I'm proud to have been the lead sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990,[[Page H907]]which opened doors of independence, access, opportunity, and equity for millions of Americans with differing abilities.  In Congress, Democrats have put forward commonsense gun safety laws that would prevent violent and dangerous individuals with mental disabilities from purchasing firearms. However, the Republican-led Congress would not allow even a vote on such legislation.  President Obama took a series of limited steps within his authority, one of which was this rule, whose aim has been to prevent those who shouldn't have guns from obtaining them. I believe that, absent action from Congress to enhance our background check system, this rule represents an imperfect but necessary step.  It is imperfect because it stigmatizes the disability community unfairly and needs a stronger appeals process to protect the rights of those who fall under its purview. I disagree with the premise that having a mental disability that precludes independent management of one's finances correlates with a heightened risk of violence. I have read the rule and recognize that it was written in a narrow way so that it applies only to those with severe mental illnesses.  I've had many discussions over the past several days with leaders in the disability community. I've grappled with the very difficult questions this resolution poses and ultimately decided that, given these circumstances, the best step right now is to oppose this resolution.  I look forward to working closely with the disability community and gun safety advocates to push for Congress to take up legislation that keeps all Americans safe from gun violence while protecting the rights of those with differing abilities.

The fact that Kevin Concannon retired is not news--he has done that several times before, and each time, he moved onto more exciting and challenging positions.  In 2016 Kevin Concannon retired from the USDA as the Undersecretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services after 8 years of service.  Kevin is a tireless advocate of people--all people. His work to assure that every effort was made to address hunger in this country is an indicator of his compassion, understanding of both the issues and solutions, and his unwavering faith in the ability of this great country to care for those who are struggling--whether it is food insecurity or earlier in his career on mental health issues, long-term care, and child welfare.  At USDA, Kevin worked tirelessly to increase options for SNAP beneficiaries to access fresh local foods at Farmers Markets; he was determined that children should have more access to nutritious foods in WIC, schools, and childcare. While Kevin and I agree on that goal, I must add that, as a native Mainer, Kevin may have missed the mark on where white potatoes fit into those meal plans.  Kevin Concannon came to USDA with an amazingly broad spectrum of experience. From 1987 to 1995, he served as the director of Oregon Department of Human Resources; after having served commissioner of Maine Department of Mental Health and In 1995, I was fortunate to be able to bring him back to his home State of Maine to serve as the commissioner of Maine's Deparment of Human At the time, I commented that he was the Dan Marino of commissioners and welcomed him back. I would point out that Dan Marino is now serving as the VP of the Dolphins, and I expect that, in the same way, Kevin Concannon will find ways to continue his public service--and that will benefit us all.  Kevin led efforts throughout his career to improve child welfare, expand Medicaid and child health insurance, integrate programs of public health and medical care, and improve systems for long-term care for elders and people with disabilities. Many of those efforts were national in scope, and he was selected by his peers to serve as the president of the American Public Welfare Association from 1994 to 1995.  In every role, in every effort, Kevin Concannon has been an exemplary public servant and leader.

8212,topic-id,1365,"Mr.President, I rise today to once again open a small portion of the Arctic coastal plain, in my home State of Alaska, to oil and gas development. I am introducing the bill because, now more than ever, new production in northern Alaska is vital not only to my state's future, but also to our Nation's energy and economic security.  It has been known for more than nearly 4 decades that the 1.5 million acres of the Arctic coastal plain that lie inside the northern one-eleventh of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are the most prospective lands in North America for a major conventional oil and gas discovery. The U.Geological Survey continues to estimate that this part of the coastal plain--which represents just 3 percent of the coastal plain in all of northern Alaska--has a mean likelihood of containing 10.4 billion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, as well as a reasonable chance of economically producing 16 billion barrels of oil. Even the relatively recent major finds in North Dakota's Bakken field and the recent estimates of shale oil in Texas' Wolfcamp formation pale in comparison, as ANWR is likely to hold over three times more conventional oil than any other onshore energy deposit in North  In the 1990s, opponents dismissed ANWR's potential and argued that the nearby National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was forecast to contain almost as much oil. However, early this decade the U.Geological Survey significantly reduced its oil estimates in the 23 million acre reserve. Instead of containing somewhere between the 6.7 to 15 billion barrels as forecast in 2002, the USGS now forecasts a mean of 896 million barrels--a dramatic downward revision. While I still believe oil production must be allowed to proceed in NPRA and that development of satellite fields must be allowed to occur, the revised forecast means that opening a small area on shore to the east on the coastal plain, is now more vital than ever for America's economic and national security interests.  That is especially the case given that President Obama late last year closed almost all of Alaska's outer continental shelf oil and gas deposits to future exploration and development. That makes production of onshore deposits even more vital for Alaska's economic future, and for the Nation's long-term energy security.  America once received more than 10 percent of its daily domestic oil production from fields in You heard correctly, production already occurs in Arctic Alaska, and has for nearly 40 years. We have successfully balanced resource development with environmental protection. Alaskans have proven, over and over again, that those endeavors are not mutually exclusive.  Today, however, we face a tipping point. Alaska's North Slope production has declined for years and now accounts for just under 5 percent of the Nation's daily production. It is now forecast to decline further to levels next decade that will threaten the continued operation of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline A closure of TAPS would shut down all northern Alaska oil production. This would devastate Alaska's economy, drag global oil prices even higher, and deepen our energy dependence on unstable petrostates throughout the world, especially once oil shale production peaks in the Lower 48 States.[[Page S116]]  Anyone who takes the long view on energy policy recognizes that no matter what energy policy our Nation pursues, we will use substantial amounts of oil well into the future. The more of that oil we produce at home, the better off our economy, our trade deficit, our employment levels, and the world's environment will be. To help meet future demand both here in America and throughout the rest of the world, and to help avoid a tremendous price spike in the event of supply disruptions, we need to take steps today to ensure new production is brought online, as soon as possible.  ANWR development will provide huge benefits for the U.Let's examine this with some simple math. ANWR's mean estimate of over 10 billion barrels, at even today's $50 per barrel price, means that there is half a trillion dollars worth of oil locked up beneath this small area in northern Alaska--and even more when prices rebound. That is half a trillion taxable dollars, and it is difficult to calculate or even fathom the corporate and payoll taxes that this would generate for our treasury. But we do know that there are hundreds of billions of dollars in pure Federal royalties since my bill devotes 50 percent of the value to a Federal share, rather than the 10 percent which current law allows.  As our Nation grapples with a huge budget deficit, nearly $20 trillion in national debt, and a lack of capital to incentivize new energy development, it is folly for America to further delay new onshore oil development from The question is no longer, ``Should we drill in ANWR?'' Today, it has become, ``Can we afford not to?''  I understand that no matter what happens, some will remain opposed to development in this region. The outgoing administration has attempted to not only prohibit oil and gas development onshore in the coastal plain--proposing to forever lock the area up into formal wilderness--but also has proposed to impede oil and even natural gas development from vast portions of NPRA and from the offshore waters of the Beaufort and Chukchi This mindset ignores Alaska's economic realities, it ignores the Nation's looming energy challenges, and it ignores the fact that Arctic oil production can proceed without any significant environmental impact. Our development has coexisted productively with polar bears, and will not harm the Porcupine caribou herd or any other form of wildlife on the Arctic coast. The groups who oppose my legislation seem totally oblivious to strides made in directional, extended reach drilling, three- and four-dimensional seismic testing, and new pipeline leak detection technology, all of which permit Alaskan energy development to proceed safely without harm to wildlife or the environment.  For all these reasons, I am reintroducing legislation to open the coastal plain of ANWR to development. At the same time, I am again focusing and narrowing that development so that just 2,000 acres of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain can be physically disturbed by roads, pipelines, wells, buildings or other support facilities. At most, just one-tenth of 1 percent of the refuge's coastal plain would be impacted. For comparison's sake, 2,000 acres is roughly the size of National Airport--compared to an area roughly three times the size of the state of It is hardly a blip on the map.  Limiting development to such a small area is important. It will help guarantee--beyond any shadow of doubt--the preservation in a natural state of more than sufficient habitat for caribou, muskoxen, polar bear, and Arctic bird life. My legislation also includes stringent environmental standards.  The bill, named the Alaska Oil and Gas Production Act, AOGPA, which is being cosponsored by my colleague from Alaska, Senator Dan Sullivan, also includes guaranteed finding to mitigate any impacts in the region, and guarantees that the Federal Government will receive half of all revenues generated.  For decades, Alaskans, whom polls show overwhelmingly support ANWR development, have been asking permission to explore and develop oil in the coastal plain. Finally, technology has advanced so that it is possible to develop oil and gas from the coastal plain with little or no impact on the area and its wildlife.  At this time of unsustainable debt, and an unstable global environment, we need to pursue domestic development opportunities more than ever. My ANWR bill offers us a chance to produce more of our own energy, for the good of the American people, in an environmentally-friendly way. I hope this Congress, given the new administration that will soon take office, will have the common sense to allow America to help itself by developing ANWR's substantial resources. This is critical to my state and the Nation as a whole. And with this in mind, I will work to educate the members of this chamber about I will show why such development should occur, why it must occur, and how it can benefit our Nation at a time when we need the domestic jobs and energy security that ANWR will produce.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-05-pt1-PgS114.txt,1694,TRUMP'S REFUGEE ACTIONS,2017.0,5.0,February

I know that for many of my fellow Rhode Islanders and for many Americans, the economy is not producing the jobs and wages they want and they need. I share that sentiment and have pushed for job and wage policies like the minimum wage, paid leave, and health care that help struggling families cope. I have pushed for job creation by putting people to work by rebuilding our Nation's roads, bridges, transit systems, schools, and new housing. But I think it is important that everyone in this Chamber take a step back and understand where our economy was, where it is today, and what is at stake.  In 2007, the housing market began to collapse. One measure of the housing market is the seriously delinquent rate, which is the percentage of loans that are 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure. Here are just a few examples of the hardest hit States: 13.2 percent in Arizona in December 2009, 9.63 percent in Ohio in December 2009, and 20.61 percent in Florida in March 2010.  By the end of President Obama's term in office, here are the seriously delinquent rates for those same States: 1.35 percent in Arizona in September of 2016, 3.59 percent in Ohio in September of 2016, and 4.14 percent in Florida in September of 2016. Just to remind on this, Florida went from a seriously delinquent rate of over 20 percent in 2010 to just over 4 percent in 2016 because of the policy, the programs that were initiated by the President and supported by this  In 2007, the unemployment rate began to skyrocket. Again, here is what that meant in a few States at their highest unemployment rates: 11.2 percent in Arizona in November of 2009, 13.6 percent in Nevada in December 2010, 11 percent in Ohio in January 2010, 11.2 percent in Florida in January 2010, and in my home State, double digit unemployment rates also.  By the end of President Obama's term in office, here are the preliminary rates for those states as of December 2016: 4.8 percent in Arizona, 5.1 percent in Nevada, 4.9 percent in Ohio, and 4.9 percent in We have seen improvement across the  I urge my colleagues to take all of this into account when they consider Mr. These are sobering numbers, and behind each of these numbers is an individual or a family, our constituents, who suffered real and serious harm. We owe it to our constituents to do something so that these generational losses will be prevented from happening again. We came out of a deep abyss through difficult work, through cooperative efforts; we have reached a point where we are poised, I hope, to continue to move forward, and we don't want to go back. That was at the heart of our work on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection It was to learn the lessons from this catastrophe so that we would never endure another in our history.  Unfortunately, for some of my constituents in Rhode Island and others around the country, the aftershocks of that financial crisis have not fully dissipated. We are still living in some respects with what happened. There are still too many looking for a decent-paying job or facing gut-wrenching financial decisions like whether to turn the heat off or to skip feeding the family another day, just to make ends meet.  Indeed, one of my constituents recently wrote:       My wife and I lost nearly half our assets in the 2008      financial crisis. Over eight years later, and our house is      still worth less than the mortgage that remains on it. We are      both professionals, and will have to stay that way until we      are 75 in order to come close to the standard of living we      enjoy now during retirement. The financial reforms enacted      under Dodd Frank, and Obama's regulation that requires      financial advisers and brokers to act in their client's best      interests, are critical to my family's well-being and to the      health of the US economy. I would like to know how you plan      to defeat any attempts to unravel these rules. Given the      clear threat that Trump poses to our economy, and the losses      I have already suffered due to bankers' greed and      incompetence, without these rules I feel better off putting      my money in my basement and will do exactly that. At least we      won't lose half of what we own.  Those are the words of a professional family in Rhode Island who have seen this struggle firsthand, and they ask this question: What are you going to do to protect the reforms and the advances we have made that have been manifested in the economic statistics that I shared with my colleagues?  As you can see, for this Rhode Islander and for many others, the law we put in place to stanch the bleeding and stabilize the financial system is a critical help.  But some have so demonized Dodd-Frank that they would have you believe otherwise. That may be why its opponents prefer calling it Dodd-Frank instead of its full name, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, because it is about reforming Wall Street and protecting consumers. It is a lot easier to be against something called Dodd-Frank than it is to be against Wall Street reform and consumer protection. But as my colleagues just heard in my constituent's own words, Dodd-Frank is ``critical to my family's well-being and to the health of the US economy.''  The question I have to answer as my constituent's Senator is whether Mr.Mnuchin will support Dodd-Frank, push efforts to further reform Wall Street, and place as his highest priority the protection of consumers as our next Treasury  Based on a review of Mr.Mnuchin's record, the answer, to me, is very clear: No, he will not.  As chairman of OneWest Bank, Mr.Mnuchin made a fortune employing questionable foreclosure practices that made the financial crisis worse for families and seniors. What is particularly worrisome is that OneWest engaged in so-called robo-signing, where companies cut crucial corners by not properly reviewing or even bothering to read foreclosure documents.  Indeed, according to one news report:       Erica Johnson-Seck, vice president of OneWest's department      of bankruptcy and foreclosures . . . robo-signed an average      of 750 foreclosure documents a week, according to a sworn      deposition she gave in a Florida case in July 2009 . . .      Under oath, Johnson-Seck acknowledged that she did not read      the documents she was signing, taking only about 30 seconds      to sign her name. To speed up the process, Johnson-Seck said      she shortened her first name on her signature to just an      ``E.'' She said in the deposition that OneWest's practice was      to review just 10 percent of the foreclosure documents for      accuracy.  As part of the confirmation process, when asked whether his company engaged in robo-signing, Mr.Mnuchin responded that OneWest did not robo-sign documents. However, it is not clear that this was the case, and not just because of ",CREC-2017-02-10-pt1-PgS1073-6.txt,1982,PROVIDING FOR THE EXPENSES OF CERTAIN COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE OF,2017.0,10.0,February

8256,topic-id,259,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Sam Johnson of Texas for his work on this important resolution and his many years of service to our country.  Mr.Speaker, in the final weeks of President Obama's final term, the Social Security Administration finalized a rule that flat out discriminates against millions of individuals with disabilities by denying them their Second Amendment rights.  But it gets worse. Not only does the rule place these innocent individuals' names in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, it does so in a way that strips them of their due process. Specifically, it would subject these people to a very timely appeals process requiring them to prove their own innocence before their name could be removed.  In other words, this rule turns due process on its head by shifting the burden of proof from the government to the individual to ensure their constitutional right is not stripped away.  Moreover, as a member of the Social Security subcommittee, I am very concerned that this rule falls way outside the bounds of the Social Security Administration's mission. Instead of using the Social Security administrator's field office staff to help Ohioans manage and understand their benefits, this rule diverts resources away from that core mission toward one that is constitutionally suspect.  That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Chairman Sam Johnson of Texas' resolution that protects Americans' Second Amendment rights and protects Americans with disabilities, their constitutional right, to due process under the law.

8206,topic-id,1566,"Mr.Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for the way that, on a nightly basis, he comes down to the well and helps inform people. Jefferson, in the writings of our Founding Fathers, talked about how important it was to have an informed electorate.  I just really appreciate the way the gentleman gives people clarity and information that they can then digest and make their decisions with. That process of informing is, I think, a vital part of the politic. He does it on the daily basis, and I appreciate it. His doing so matters to me and to the people that I represent.  I appreciate so much the gentleman's yielding because I want to talk just a couple of minutes about a bill that I introduced today entitled the REAL ID Privacy Protection  It is a bipartisan bill. It is supported from the Republican side by people like Mark It is supported on the Democratic side by Democrats like Chellie Pingree from I think they do so because it is a commonsense bill that gets at some of the deficiencies that one can find in REAL  Quite specifically, what it does is eliminate the requirement that your personal documentation and documents be held and archived, in essence,[[Page H807]]in warehouses for 10 years. It will not require your stuff to be out in government databases for 10 years. Secondly, it eliminates the requirement that the DMV databases be co-linked. Thirdly, it creates uniformity with regard to the way in which extensions are granted.  So the bottom line is your driver's license could still be used to get you in the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort or it could be used to go into Joint Base Charleston or a whole host of other facilities around this country. More significantly, for the average flying public, you could still use your driver's license next year to be able to get on a plane in the United States of  Why is all this important?  It is important because individual privacy matters. It is important because equal treatment under the law matters. It is important because the 10th Amendment really matters. States have a role in which the Founding Fathers intended the Federal Government to fit with the State government, to fit with local government, and to fit with individual prerogative.  Now let's examine each one of those couple of things. One, if you look at South Carolina driver's licenses, just as an example, they are secure. We have holograms. We have barcodes. We have a whole host of different things that create security.  Yet, in the wake of 9/11, what the Federal Government, Homeland Security, and others decided at that time was that, in essence, what they wanted was a de facto national ID card and for the Federal Government to, in essence, federalize what had previously been a State function, with State's issuing driver's licenses.  There is not a Federal driver's license. Texas has driver's licenses, South Carolina has driver's licenses, Florida has driver's licenses. Each State may have a little bit different way of doing so, but it was a state prerogative.  In the wake of that Federal requirement--I was wearing a different hat at the time; I was wearing a Governor's hat--I joined with, for instance, Governor Schweitzer from Montana in saying: Wait, this doesn't make sense. The States still have a vital role here. This role does not need to be federalized. We pushed back and, long story short, we were successful with many others in that effort. Yet, what is happening is many of those deadline requirements are now reemerging and approaching.  The question we have to ask ourselves in Congress is: What are we going to do about it? Are we going to push back again? Or are we going to try and slow this again? Or are we just going to let the Federal Government come in and steamroll what has been a State function?  I think it is important that we act, and that is why we introduced this bill. It, again, gets at three important things. One, privacy matters. Quite simply, if government doesn't need your stuff, they don't get your stuff. I think that is a simple premise. Again, let me say it again. If government really doesn't need your stuff, it shouldn't get your stuff.  What do I mean by that?  What I mean is, if the requirement, as is now the case, is that the Federal Government take your personal information and they archive it for the next 10 years, do you really feel that you are more secure?  I would argue that is not at all the case. I would argue that it is much better to have a system that, when you take your birth certificate, you take your marriage license, you take your divorce papers, you take your citizenship papers, whatever it is that you have, take it all, let folks at the government level decide whether you are who you are or whether you are not who you are, and then give your stuff back to you. They don't need to house it for the next 10 years.  That is all this bill does. If you house it for the next 10 years, in fact, there is a considerable cost. The unfunded mandate to States is $17 billion.  So what we are saying is make the determination. Take, again, all your stuff, look at it, but then give it back, rather than requiring States to archive this stuff for the next 10 years.  It also matters because, again, of individual human privacy. Whether it is a divorce decree, whether it is a marriage license, whether it is citizenship papers, whatever it is, we have been in hearings over the last couple of weeks where it was proven that the Russians were quite involved in hacking of American databases.  Why do we want to open that up to Chinese hackers, Russian hackers, to whoever it is, if it isn't required and necessary from the standpoint of security?  Two, this bill simply gets at the notion that States matter. The 10th Amendment matters. Patton was once attributed with saying that, if you tell a soldier to take a hill, tell them to take the hill. Don't tell them how to attack the hill.  The same is true of the Federal Government as it relates to Give us a secured requirement, but then allow Texas to go about their way of taking the hill and South Carolina to come with its way of attacking the hill, as long as we take the hill, which is the necessary security requirement.  I think it is also important from the standpoint of security that one thing we have learned over time is that centralization of data does not make data more secure. We have a host of different breaches that have occurred at the Federal level that prove this point.  I think that one of the things that is interesting about Pearl Harbor is that the boats were in one spot and it was one-stop shopping for the So, in fact, what we have seen in terms of military strategy going forward is people spread assets out. They don't want them congregated all in one spot so that an attacker would be able to take down a multitude of different assets with one particular raid. I think the same is true in the information age, as it relates to databases.  Finally, this bill is about equal treatment under the law. I think that what many States--South Carolina would be among them--are concerned about is: Is this too subjective? If you happen to be a blue State versus a red State, does that have some degree of determination in the way in which you get an extension or you don't get an extension?                              {time}  1830  Eighteen States and territories have been granted extensions. Seven States have been granted very limited extensions. All this bill does is say, Let's make that process transparent so that States can look one to the other and say, How was it that you got an extension but I didn't? I think that that level of uniformity would make sure that nobody suspects this system of being arbitrary or capricious by nature.  That is in simple form what the bill does. Again, it is about your privacy. We have had a long debate over the course of our country on security versus freedom, and what we don't want to do is give up certain, in essence, soul conditions, if you will, for freedom, including this notion of federalism, in our efforts to be secure. It is about recognizing that States are not wards of the Federal government, that a $7 billion unfunded liability really does matter to the taxpayers of different Finally, it is about equal treatment under the law.  Again, the bill is called the REAL ID Privacy Protection I would ask Members to join us on that bill. I would ask folks out there listening to talk to their House Member about that bill because I think it is one that makes a whole lot of sense.  I would say, again, how much I appreciate the gentleman from Texas yielding. Most of all, I thank him for the way he comes down to the well on such a regular basis to inform the American public.

8229,topic-id,650,"Mr.President, I came to the floor yesterday to voice my serious concernswith some of the remarks made by the Secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson, in his hearing.  I was worried that hismilquetoast posture toward Russia, especially his failure to support strong U.sanctions--existing or proposed--bespoke afundamental misreading of the geopolitical climate and the true nature of our international security challenges.  I wasworried that, as Secretary of State, he only promised to recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for a[[Page S298]]period of 12months. Exxon's interests overseas aren't going away after 1 year. That is not good enough to resolve what is, potentially, amassive conflict of interest.  I am worried that Mr.Tillerson, as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil, conducted business withall three foreign state sponsors of terrorism through a foreign subsidiary in a way that allowed Exxon to evade U.sanctions.As the head of Exxon, Mr.Tillerson did business with the terrorism trifecta: Iran, Syria, and This raises seriousquestions that the man who is nominated to be the face of the United States to the world has so much experience doing businesswith our most prominent and concerning adversaries.  At the hearing, under questions from the senior Senator from New Jerseyand the Senator from Oregon, Mr.Tillerson denied having knowledge of these dealings and directed the Senators to seek moreinformation from ExxonMobil itself. Three times he told the committee that he ``did not recall'' any of the details. Throughoutthe afternoon, it sounded like he was following the dodgeball rules for confirmation hearings: Dodge, dip, duck, dive, anddodge. In fact, he basically admitted it to the junior Senator from  I just read in the Washington Post that, onthree separate occasions, the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote letters directed to Mr.Tillerson himselfseeking more information on these undisclosed dealings during his tenure as CEO and chairman--once on January 6, 2006, once onMay 4, 2006, and again on December 1, 2010.  In general, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. But it gives megreat concern that Mr.Tillerson says he has zero recollection of an SEC inquiry into his company's business dealings withforeign state sponsors of terrorism--real concern. He got three letters from the SEC on a matter of major, major importance thatwould concern the whole corporation--the giant ExxonMobil--and he says he doesn't recall. This is the kind of matter that shouldbe handled and approved by an organization's most senior leader.  Mr.Tillerson presents himself as a hands-on manager. Itdefies credibility to believe he doesn't recall. This is extraordinarily troubling because either one of two things is true.Either Mr.Tillerson was aware of these SEC letters and was familiar with these dealings but didn't want to answer the questionshonestly, or, indeed, he had no knowledge of consequential financial disclosures made by his own company. If we consider that,in concert with all the other things he claimed to have ``no knowledge of''--including the widely reported extrajudicial killingsin the Philippines, whether or not Saudi Arabia was a human rights violator--imagine, he had no knowledge of whether Saudi Arabiawas a human rights violator; people in a fifth grade world history class would know that--whether or not his company was engagedin lobbying against, or perhaps for, energy sanctions--then maybe Mr.Tillerson does not have the necessary management skills orknowledge base to be the chief diplomat of the United States of America, running a Department that is obviously worldwide,farflung, and with thousands and thousands and thousands of employees.  Simply put,we need answers. What did Mr.Tillerson know and when did he know it? The American people expect their Secretary of State to bestraightforward and honest with them--not coy, not dissembling. Most importantly, they expect him or her to have the interests ofthe American people and our friends and allies around the world at the forefront of their mind.  Unfortunately for Mr.Tillerson, and for this country, yesterday's hearings and today's reports raise more questions than answers. The American peopledeserve answers.

8295,topic-id,647,"Madam President, these past few weeks, I have had the[[Page S1077]]opportunity to come to the floor to recognize truly exceptional Alaskans--those who dedicate their time, energy, and talent to strengthening our communities and making Alaska a truly extraordinary place to call home.  My colleagues here, those in the Gallery, those watching on TV, might know Alaska for its natural wonders. We certainly have those in spades. We want you all to come visit. It will be a life-changing experience, I promise.  For those of us who live there, community is everything. Living in one of the most magnificent places on Earth also has challenges. We depend on each other, our traditional knowledge, our ingenuity, our determination to overcome those challenges, particularly as a community.  Today I would like to transport you to the village of Igiugig in Southwest Alaska, and introduce you to an amazing young woman who is truly making a difference in her community. AlexAnna Salmon is our Alaskan of the  First, a little bit about where she lives. Rich in Alaskan Native traditions, her village is home to around 70 residents year-round, growing to more than 200 in the summer months. The name Igiugig comes from a Yupik word meaning ``like a throat that swallows water.'' It is referring to the location of the village which sits where the Kvichak River meets Lake  Western Alaska has been home to thriving, sustainable communities for a millennia, but rising energy costs and overregulations have put the future of these communities at risk. In fact, many of these communities, particularly in rural Alaska, face some of the highest energy costs in the country, which is a bit of a cruel irony given how resource-rich Alaska is, but in typical Alaska fashion, this village, facing these energy challenges, comes together as a community to embrace new technologies and new ways to address these challenges.  At the forefront of this rural revolution and sustainable community is our Alaskan of the Week, AlexAnna Raised in Igiugig, AlexAnna has emerged as a leader in her community, now serving as the village council president.  She has had that position since just after graduating cum laude from Dartmouth College in 2008, with a double major in Native American studies and anthropology.  While at Dartmouth, she won a prestigious writing award for her senior thesis on life in her village. When she was done with college, she, along with her sister, came back to her community, to her village, to raise her family. In her words, she stated, ``I felt that I had the greatest childhood here in This is where kids need to be raised.'' She wants their childhood experiences to be as great or even better and meaningful as hers.  To keep her community thriving, particularly with these energy challenges--and to make it even a better place for the next generation--she encourages healthy lifestyles, helps improve local infrastructure, and works tirelessly toward ensuring that people in her village have a sustainable source of food and energy.  AlexAnna has overseen the establishment of community farms and gardens, wind turbines, solar collectors, centralized recycling, building upgrades, weatherization, and most recently helped launch a very exciting hydro project.  For her dedication to the well-being of her community and to all Alaskans and for tackling unique challenges with both creativity and determination, for making the impossible, in some of the most extreme parts of our country in terms of rural living, seem possible, AlexAnna Salmon is the Alaskan of the  Congratulations, AlexAnna, and thank you. Your dedication epitomizes what it means to be an Alaskan, honoring the traditions of our past and seizing the opportunities here and now to provide for a bright future.

8258,topic-id,4340,"Mr.Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.40.  As part of our bold agenda for the American people, we are reining in the out-of-control bureaucracy in We are taking action to roll back 8 years of Obama administration overreach.  Today we are stopping an egregious violation that flies in the face of the This regulation, finalized in the final days of the Obama Presidency, would deny certain Social Security recipients their Second Amendment rights without due process.  If you receive Social Security disability payments and someone helps you manage those payments, this regulation stops you from being able to purchase a firearm, your name gets added to a Federal database, and the burden is on you to prove it doesn't belong there. This is absolutely outrageous.  This regulation discriminates against individuals with disabilities by denying them their Second Amendment rights and violating their rights of due process. And it gives far too much power to bureaucrats at the Social Security Administration, who should be focused on making sure people get the benefits they deserve, not deciding who can own a gun.  This is why we are standing up for the Second Amendment rights of all disabled citizens. Being disabled doesn't make you a danger to society, and getting help managing your benefits doesn't mean you forfeit your constitutional rights.  Mr.Speaker, I want to absolutely thank Congressman Sam Johnson and Congressman Ralph Abraham for their leadership on this issue. I strongly support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record additional letters of support.         National Association of County Behavioral Health &            Development Disability Directors,                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2017.     Re NACBHDD and NARMH Letter of Support for the CRA on the SSA          NICS     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Office of the Democratic Leader,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: NACBHDD and      NARMH urge you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA)      resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social      Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016,      ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of      2007. This rule would require the Social Security      Administration to forward the names of all Social Security      Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income      (SSI) benefit recipients who use a representative payee to      help manage their benefits due to a mental impairment to the      National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).       NACBHDD is a national organization that represents county      mental health, substance use, and developmental; disability      directors in Washington, NARMH represents rural mental      health in the       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NACBHDD and NARMH      conveyed our opposition to the rule through a letter to the      Obama Administration and through the public comment process.      We join many of our[[Page H901]]     mental health coalition members and advocates who--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.           Sincerely yours,                                            Ron Manderscheid, PhD,     Executive                                  ____                                                 National Alliance                                            on Mental Illness,                                  Arlington, VA, January 31, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     Office of the Democratic Leader,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The      National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) writes to urge you      to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to      disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security      Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation      of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule      would require the Social Security Administration to forward      the names of all Social Security and Supplemental Security      Income (SSI) disability beneficiaries who use a      representative payee to help manage their benefits, and who      have been found eligible by meeting or equaling an SSA mental      impairment listing, to the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System (NICS).       NAMI is the nation's largest grassroots mental health      organization dedicated to building better lives for the      millions of Americans affected by mental illness, with more      than 1,100 state and local affiliates nationwide. NAMI      recognizes and supports the need to prioritize reducing gun      violence in the U.However, we are gravely concerned that      the rule, as adopted, perpetuates unfounded stereotypes about      people with mental illness and other mental disabilities that      have no basis in fact. Moreover, we believe that the rule may      have unintended negative consequences, including deterring      individuals from seeking or receiving help when they need it.       Our specific concerns about the rule are the following:       There is no evidence supporting the proposition that people      who are assigned Representative Payees on the basis of mental      illness or other mental disabilities pose increased risks for      gun violence or threats to public safety;       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies      to transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, the assignment of a Representative Payee to a      recipient of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social      Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is not equivalent to an      adjudication. Rather, it is a unilateral determination by the      SSA that a person may need help in managing his or her      benefits. There is no hearing, the beneficiary is afforded no      oppornmity to testify or provide evidence why he or she      should not be assigned a Representative Payee, and there are      no other due process protections typically associated with      formal adjudications.       The new rule reinforces unfounded perceptions associating      mental illness and other mental disabilities with violence.      Scientific studies that have assessed risk factors for      violence contain no evidence linking difficulties with      managing benefits with increased risks for violence.       SSI and SSDI provide vital links to medical benefits for      people with mental illness. The rule may deter individuals      from applying for these benefits for fear that their names      will be added to a public database maintained by the      Without such benefits, access to mental health treatment and      services will be impeded.       Mr.Speaker and Madam Leader, NAMI asserts that the      adoption of this misguided rule in the aftermath of      Congressional adoption of a comprehensive bill to improve      mental health care in America is exactly the wrong step to      take. We therefore urge Congress to act, through the CRA      process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage      it inflicts on people with mental illness and other      disabilities.       Thank you for your prompt attention to these concerns.           Sincerely,                                             Mary Giliberti, J.D.,     Chief Executive                                  ____                                   National Association for Rights                                      Protection and Advocacy,                                 Huntsville, LA, January 31, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The National Association of Rights Protection and Advocacy      (NARPA) urges you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA)      resolution to disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social      Security Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016,      ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of      2007.'' NARPA was formed in 1981 to provide education and      advocacy in the mental health arena. Members are attorneys,      people with psychiatric histories, mental health      professionals and administrators, academics, and non-legal      advocates. Central to NARPA's mission is the promotion of      those policies and strategies that represent the preferred      options of people who have been diagnosed with psychiatric      disabilities.       This rule requires the Social Security Administration to      forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance      (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit      recipients who use a representative payee to help manage      their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National      Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The rule is      inconsistent with the statute it implements, has no      evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate      inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental      disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-     scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the      agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits      applications toward a mission in which the agency has little      expertise.       First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The      National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS      database on the basis of a determination that the person      ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''      as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental      illness, incompetency condition or disease.'' The appointment      of a representative payee simply does not meet this standard.      It indicates only that the individual needs help managing      benefits received from       Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to      address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,      targeting individuals with representative payees and mental      impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In      doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful      action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts      from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for      gun violence.       Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association      of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important      efforts to promote community integration and employment of      people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people      with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or      services, or from applying for financial and medical      assistance programs.       Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA      without providing any additional resources. Implementation of      the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work      of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to      overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are      waiting for months and years for determinations of their      benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to      make the determinations about safety that it would be called      upon to make as part of the relief process established by the      rule.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule. We urge      Congress to act, through the CRA process, to disapprove this      new rule and prevent the damage that it inflicts on the      disability community.

NCIL represents people with disabilities, Centers for      Independent Living (CILs), Statewide Independent Living      Councils (SILCs), and other organizations that advocate for      the human and civil rights of people with disabilities      throughout the country.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, NCIL joined the      CCD Rights Task Force to convey its opposition to the rule      through a letter to the Obama Administration and through the      public comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--     opposed the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.

Re Safari Club International Support for House Joint          Resolution 40.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     Washington,     Nancy Pelosi,     House Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: Safari Club      International (Safari Club) supports House Joint Resolution      40, which provides for Congressional disapproval under the      Congressional Review Act of the final rule submitted by the      Social Security Administration (SSA) relating to      ``Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of      2007,'' adopted on December 19, 2016, 81 91702.       Safari Club seeks Congressional disapproval of the rule for      several reasons. It deprives an individual of the ability to      receive or possess a firearm, including for recreational      hunting, due to that individual's inability to manage his or      her financial affairs (Firearms Rule). Under the Firearms      Rule, the prohibition would apply when the SSA designates a      representative payee because of the individual's mental      impairment. A mental impairment that makes an individual      incapable of handling his/her financial affairs does not      necessarily equate to an inability to properly abide by the      law in the use of firearms. The Firearms Rule unfairly      attributes illegal conduct to law abiding citizens.       In addition, the Firearms Rule fails in its attempt to      rectify its unfair treatment of individuals with mental      impairments through its program for individuals to request      relief from Federal Firearms prohibitions. This program      places on the individual with a mental impairment the costly      and burdensome task of collecting and presenting data to      overcome the presumption that he or she is incapable of      abiding by the law. This program forces upon law-abiding      citizens the task of confronting a federal bureaucracy just      to prove that they should not be unfairly treated as a      criminal due to a mental impairment.       For these reasons, Safari Club supports a joint resolution      stating ``that Congress disapproves the rule submitted by the      Social Security Administration relating to Implementation of      the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, and such rule      shall have no force or effect.''

8305,topic-id,1591,"Madam President, I want to compliment my friend, the Senator from Ohio, for his comments. I know my friend, the Senator from Washington, is going to make comments after this, so I will try to make mine as brief as possible.  I apologize. I joined the majority of Senators who are a little bit raspy today after our late night last night.  I rise in opposition to the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to serve as our Nation's next Secretary of the  As the President's principal economic adviser, the Treasury Secretary holds a special significance in our system of government. The Treasury Department must ensure America's debts are paid, secure our role as a global economic power, and develop policies that help build an economy that works for all  Based on Mr.Mnuchin's record, my meeting with him, along with his answers during the Senate Finance hearing and followup questions, I am unable to support his nomination to serve as Treasury  I want to take time today to discuss some specific policy issues that Mr.Mnuchin and I disagree with and some of the areas where I hope that if he is confirmed, we might be able to find common ground.  On financial reform and protecting the economy from too big to fail, Mr.Mnuchin's comments, coupled with comments and announcements from others in the administration, are deeply concerning.  Mr.Mnuchin's statements of ``concern'' about title II of Dodd-Frank, in particular, revealed to my mind, at least, a disturbing lack of understanding about how the financial system has evolved since the 2008 crash.  We should never forget that Lehman Brothers' collapse caused enough uncertainty across the financial system to trigger a run on nearly every other bank. The Lehman collapse also was part of the requirements that required that $700 billion much fabled taxpayer bailout.  The resulting financial chaos destroyed millions of jobs, devastated home values, and froze lending to consumers and small businesses. The truth is, many Americans are still trying to dig their way out of that financial crisis.  To ensure that taxpayers didn't end up on the hook again for another bailout, Congress passed Dodd-Frank that required banks to put in additional financial capital to make sure there were living wills so these large, significant financial institutions actually had ways that they could resolve themselves and, in a sense, get ready for bankruptcy. But we also said, in the event that bankruptcy was not adequate, there would be, as a cause of last resort, the ability using the FDIC to unwind these large institutions.  Well, we are years later and what we have seen is that other countries around the globe had basically modeled their systems after what we created in terms of title I and II in Dodd- Since 2010, our regulators have worked diligently with the Bank of England and other foreign counterparts to ensure a global megabank can be resolved without using taxpayer dollars.  I would further note that even the National Bankruptcy Conference, which is composed of bankruptcy judges, lawyers, and academics, believe ``orderly liquidation authority under Title II should continue to be available, even if the bankruptcy code is amended.''[[Page S1087]]  Unfortunately, Mr.Mnuchin and other members of the administration have expressed great concern with title II, and that causes me concern in terms of his nomination.  In tax reform, the Secretary of the Treasury has also historically played an important role. I have long argued that our Tax Code is broken. It is simply not working for enough Americans and American businesses.  I would welcome efforts to smartly--and on a bipartisan basis--work to reform the Tax Code, but I am concerned about how a tax reform process under this administration might play out.  First, Mr.Mnuchin has repeatedly said there should be no absolute tax cut for the upper class. I found that good. Some have even started to call this the ``Mnuchin rule.''  As the nominee, though, he has failed to commit to following his own rule or to provide any specific answer on how he would reduce the tax burden on middle class and working families. In fact, President Trump campaigned on a plan that based upon independent budget analysis, would add close to $5 trillion to our national debt and that would, in the same amount, slash taxes for corporations and those at the top of the income scale. Yet this same plan and any effort to be revenue-neutral would end up then raising taxes on middle-class families.  The truth is, again, an independent analysis of President Trump's plan shows that while middle-class earners might see a smaller increase in their aftertax income, the increase and the benefits to the upper 1 percent would be where most of the benefits went to. That is before we even get to issues like the President's plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the implications that has for middle-class  Because of this and because of his unwillingness to explain how we would pay for this tax reform and the notion that somehow through dynamic scoring this would all, in effect, self-correct leaves me with great concerns. I would simply point out to my colleagues that when Mr.Camp proposed a tax reform plan that I didn't agree with--but it at least had some basis in financial reality--there were eight separate dynamic scoring plans put together; in effect, magic dust that could somehow resolve even big tax cuts that would suddenly, somehow mysteriously pay for themselves.  We saw the effects of that kind of action with the Bush tax cuts early in 2003. We have seen this well in terms of actions that have led our country to $20 trillion in debt.  So I believe that Mr.Mnuchin's failure to come through with a truly revenue-neutral or legitimate plan that would not misuse dynamic scoring raises enormous concern as well.  Finally, I am concerned that Mr.Mnuchin lacks an understanding of the critical role the Treasury Department plays in both crafting and implementing economic standards.  It was useful to hear that Mr.Mnuchin committed to 100 percent sanctions during his nomination. I am not sure, with some of the actions of the administration since then, if we can actually hold him to those commitments.  Treasury obviously has a role that is much more important than just enforcement. Treasury's role vis-a-vis Iran, Treasury's role vis-a-vis the Russian sanctions are extraordinarily important in his unwillingness, particularly around Russia, to make a firm commitment. Again, this raises a clear concern for me, and this is a concern that is shared by both Democratic and Republican Members of the Senate who feel that we need to keep the pressure on Mr.Putin's behavior not only in the Middle East but in Ukraine and, candidly, Russia's unprecedented involvement and interference in our own election.  Again, the Treasury Secretary plays an important and critical role.  There are areas--let me make clear though--where, if Mr.Mnuchin is confirmed, I hope to work with him, and that one area in particular is housing finance.  I believe very strongly--and having worked with many Members on the other side--that we need to reform our housing finance system so we don't have, in the case of Fannie and Freddie, instances where when times are going good, there is private sector gain, but when crisis happens, the taxpayer pays the bill.  We saw this take place back in 2008, where the American taxpayers literally had to put up $188 billion of taxpayer money to bail out Fannie and  It is true, many years later, most of those funds have been repaid, but as somebody who spent longer as a venture capitalist than I have as a Senator, I can assure you, the taxpayer did not get fair return on those funds that were taken out in the midst of the crisis.  Now we see certain hedge funds were trying to take advantage of this arbitrage, buy in to Freddie and Fannie, and then hope that policymakers will turn a blind eye and simply return to the old style of doing business, where as long as things are going well, hedge funds and others will do well by owning Fannie and Freddie, but if the stuff hits the fan again, taxpayers will be caught holding the bill.  I was happy to hear--and I was pleased to hear that Mr.Mnuchin went on record during the Finance hearing, opposing the so-called recap and release plan and was supporting a bipartisan solution to reform these entities.  Again, if Mr.Mnuchin is confirmed, I look forward to working with him in this area.  Finally, there is an area that I think most of us on both sides of the aisle realize that we can't play Russian roulette with and that is dealing with our debt ceiling. Here again was an area where I would actually give Mr.Mnuchin some credit because he acknowledged that the notion that some have put forward that if America would prioritize to pay one bill and not another is both financially unsound and practically impossible. On that item, I want to give Mr.Mnuchin his due.  On balance, because of some of the comments that Mr.Mnuchin has made around tax reform, around sanctions, around the issues related to making sure we have a vigorous and independent Treasury, I don't believe he brings the characteristics and qualities needed to be a Treasury So I will not be able to support his nomination, and I will urge my colleagues in joining me to oppose him when his vote comes up on  With that, I yield the floor.

8297,topic-id,4186,"Madam President, out on the campaign trail, Donald Trump talked a big game about Wall He said: ``Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us.'' He claimed that he was not going to let Wall Street get away with murder.  His closing ad expressed outrage at Wall Street ``controlling the levers of power in Washington.'' It pictured Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein as part of ``the global special interests that were rigging the economy against working families.''  Then Trump won, and within days he hired and nominated enough Goldman Sachs alumni to open a new bank branch in the White His senior strategist, Steve Bannon, spent half a decade at Goldman Sachs as an investment banker. His National Economic Council Director, Gary Cohn, came directly from Goldman Sachs, where he spent 25 years and rose to be second in command at the bank. His Senior Counsel for Economic Initiatives, Dina Powell, came directly from Goldman Sachs, where she has been a partner since 2010.  Finally, Donald Trump nominated Steve Mnuchin to serve as his Secretary of Mr.Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, much of it in the distribution that created and peddled the kinds of mortgage-backed securities that would later blow up the financial system.  Personnel is policy. The selection of all of these Goldman Sachs executives to serve as core members of Trump's economic team shows that the President has no interest in reducing Wall Street's influence in Washington and leveling the playing field for working families. Instead, it will be the same Republican playbook--gutting the rules for big banks, firing the cops on Wall Street--the same playbook that paved the way for the 2008 financial crisis.  But even among the group of Goldman Sachs bankers surrounding the President, the selection of Mr.Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary stands out. The Treasury Secretary leads the Council responsible for making sure Wall Street doesn't blow up our economy again.  The Council cannot do anything without the support of the Treasury No other official has greater responsibility to stand up to Wall Street if they threaten the economy again. Yet there is nothing--nothing--in Mr.Mnuchin's record to suggest that he could stand up to Wall In fact, there is nothing in Mr.Mnuchin's record to suggest that he would even want to stand up to Wall Street, that he has even thought of standing up to Wall  Mr.Mnuchin is the ultimate Wall Street insider. From the moment he graduated from college until today, he has worked at a big bank or a hedge fund. If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Mr.Mnuchin to get tough with his old buddies and tell them to knock it off?  In fact, you can expect just the opposite. Mr.Mnuchin pretty much laps the field when it comes to personal experience in tilting the playing field in favor of financial interests and against working families. In late 2008, as the financial crisis was sweeping across the country, Mr.Mnuchin lead a team of millionaires to purchase IndyMac Bank out of Federal receivership. He rebranded the bank as OneWest and put himself in charge as Then, Mr.Mnuchin and OneWest acted swiftly and decisively to boot more than 60,000 families out of their homes across the country.  Look, I get it. Foreclosures happen in an economic crisis. But OneWest, Mr.Mnuchin's bank, was different. It quickly gained a reputation as a foreclosure machine, both because it was so aggressive at foreclosing on families and because the bank hardly did anything else.  Countless homeowners who were trapped by a OneWest mortgage had their lives turned upside down. Some ended up homeless.  How sleazy and out of line was Mr.Mnuchin's bank? Well, the bank paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits for predatory foreclosure practices. They were so sleazy that they even got hit with almost $3 million in fines for violating the rights of dozens of Active-Duty servicemembers.[[Page S1078]]  You really have to ask: What kind of a man does something like that--cheats our soldiers while they are on Active Duty? The model Mr.Mnuchin developed for OneWest was terrible for homeowners, but it was fabulous for him. Six years after buying the bank, he sold it and reportedly pocketed as much as $200 million in personal profit--$200 million for 6 years of throwing families out of their homes--wow, only on Wall  Mr.Mnuchin's leadership of OneWest is critical to evaluating his fitness to serve as Treasury That is why I joined 24 other Democratic Senators in asking Chairman Hatch of the Senate Finance Committee to include some of Mr.Mnuchin's foreclosure victims as witnesses at Mr.Mnuchin's hearing.  The chairman refused. So Democrats invited some of those homeowners to come to the Senate anyway to share their stories at a forum. We invited every Senator--Democrat or Republican--to attend the forum. We also invited Mr.Mnuchin to attend. Not one single Republican showed up--not one. Mr.Mnuchin refused to attend. But Senate Democrats turned out to listen. The stories that we heard will break your heart.  We heard from Colleen Ison-Hodroff, from Minneapolis, Colleen is 84 years old. She and her husband Monroe got a reverse mortgage on their fully paid-off home from Financial Freedom, which is a OneWest subsidiary. At the time, the broker assured them that Colleen could keep living in her home even if her husband passed away before she did. But just days--just days--after Monroe's funeral, Mr.Mnuchin's bank told her she needed to pay off the entire loan or face foreclosure. She has been fighting them off for 2 years now, but the threat hangs over her and her family.  Sylvia Oliver from Scotch Plains, NJ, also told us her story. She had been trying for years to get a loan modification from For years, the bank refused to work with her in good faith. Sylvia choked up as she described how she felt when her young daughter told her: Mom, I love our home. She had to smile and look her daughter in the eye, not knowing whether they could keep that home for more than even a few more weeks.  We heard from Cristina Clifford, from Carlsbad, Cristina is a real go-getter, a self-employed small business owner who saved up enough money to buy her first home soon after she turned 20. When the financial crisis hit, the income from her business dried up, and she reached out to Mr.Mnuchin's bank for a modification. But when she sent in her modification paperwork, along with the check for her first new payment, she sent them in a single envelope, and Mr.Mnuchin's bank claimed they had never received the paperwork even though they cashed the check that was in the same envelope.  Ultimately, Mr.Mnuchin's bank foreclosed on Cristina, just days after an employee personally had assured her that she could still work out a modification to keep her home. But she lost her home.  We also heard from Heather McCreary, a mother of twin boys from Sparks, Like a lot of families, Heather and her husband Jack were hit hard in the financial crisis. She lost her job as a home health aide, and Jack, who worked construction, got fewer hours and lower wages. Heather and Jack applied to OneWest for a modification. They did everything they were told. But it did not matter to Mr.Mnuchin and his friends at  The bank strung them along for years and then, in the blink of an eye, foreclosed so abruptly that it literally put Heather, her husband Jack, and their twin boys out on the street.  All four of these women begged the Senate to reject Mr.Mnuchin's nomination. Heather said:       Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the country's financial      system is an insult to families like mine, families who      worked hard and did everything they could to get by after the      economy collapsed. Take it from my experience, I know he will      not be looking out for working people. Instead, he will use      his position to make the economy work better for people like      himself.  No track record of independence from Wall Street, a history of profiting off the financial crisis by squeezing working families to the breaking point--each one of those should be disqualifying to serve as Treasury That should be the end of his nomination. We should be done with this. But there is more.  During Mr.Mnuchin's nomination process, he flat-out lied to the Senator Casey from Pennsylvania asked Mr.Mnuchin a straightforward factual question about foreclosure abuses at Mr.Mnuchin claimed they did not happen. That is not even a good lie. Within days, reporters found court documents contradicting Mr.Mnuchin's claim. You know, something like that should not be a partisan issue. A person who lies to Congress should not be the country's top economic official--period, done.  But when Senate Democrats demanded that Mr.Mnuchin come before the Finance Committee again to account for his statement, Republicans on the committee unilaterally changed the rules and rammed Mr.Mnuchin's nomination through without a single Democrat present.  Do Senate Republicans care about Mr.Mnuchin's lies?  The American people should.  If Mr.Mnuchin is willing to lie about something that is so easily disproved by public court documents, what else is he willing to lie about? How can Congress or the American people believe him ever again?  We know Mr.Mnuchin has the full support of Wall The big bank lobbyists, Mr.Mnuchin's hedge fund pals, man, they want to see him confirmed. They are lobbying hard. They know he will help out his old buddies and give them all the financial rule rollbacks and sweetheart deals that they want. What we know is that is usually enough to carry the day around here.  But me? I am going with Colleen and Heather and Sylvia and I heard what Mr.Mnuchin and his bank did to them and to thousands more like them in Massachusetts and all across the country. The U.Senate should not reward that kind of sleazy, cruel, and sometimes illegal conduct by making him the Secretary of  We cannot say to the millions of people who lost their homes, who lost their jobs, who lost their savings during the financial crisis, that a man like Mr.Mnuchin will be entrusted with the keys to our We cannot say to the American people that someone who lied to Congress--who lied and didn't even have to come back and explain his lie--can become a senior Cabinet official.  A lot of people believed Donald Trump when he said he would be tough on Wall A lot of people voted for him because of that promise. By hiring half of Goldman Sachs to run the economy, Donald Trump has made clear he has no intention of keeping his promise. And now, with the vote on Mr.Mnuchin, the American public will have the chance to see whether Senate Republicans are serious about keeping Wall Street in line too.  Don't hold your breath, I will be voting no on Mr.Mnuchin's nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.  I want to read some of the stories that we have about Mr.Mnuchin's time at You know, you don't have to take this just from me. I may be the one speaking here today, but it is the voices of Colleen and Heather and Sylvia and Cristina and thousands of others whose lives were ruined by Steve Mnuchin's aggressive foreclosure tactics that really deserve to be heard.  I have already told you about Colleen Ison-Hodroff, the 84-year-old woman who is getting cheated out of her home, her home that she lived in for over 50 years and that was fully paid off. She is getting cheated out of that home by Steve Mnuchin's bank.  Now what I would like to do is to share her full story in her own words. This is what she had to say:       My name is Colleen Ison-I am 84 years old. I am a      resident of Minneapolis, My husband Monroe Hodroff      and I purchased our home located at 2753 Ewing Avenue in 1963      as a home for our family of six children. They called us the      Brady Bunch of Ewing Our house was the heart and soul      of our family. Monroe and I were married for 55 years, and we      successfully ran four small grocery stores. I would like to      thank you all very much for allowing me to share my story.       I am here today because Financial Freedom, my reverse      mortgage servicer, is trying to foreclose on my home. This is      despite the fact that when my husband Monroe and I took out      this loan, they told us that I could[[Page S1079]]     remain in the home if Monroe should die before me.       In July of 2006, my husband and I decided to take out a      reverse mortgage loan with Financial It was a very      complicated process. Someone came to our house and I was      asked to sign a number of papers. Usually, Monroe handled the      financial matters for our household. We were told that I      could live in the house if Monroe passed away. It was never      Monroe's or my intention that the survivor of the two of us      would have to sell the house or leave if one of us died. We      would not have signed for the loan if we thought that was the      case.       My husband Monroe passed on September 12, 2014. A mere 10      days later, despite what we had been told, Financial Freedom      contacted me and told me that I needed to pay off the loan      immediately. This was news to me. I was in no financial      position to do so. Since then, Financial Freedom has been      trying to foreclose on me. I think this is an injustice in      that an elderly woman was deceived, and now Financial Freedom      is trying to take my home. Why would Financial Freedom do      this to me? I relied on what I was told, and now they are      trying to kick me out of our family home.       How was I supposed to know if what I was told wasn't true?      What am I supposed to do now?       My understanding is that in such circumstances, Financial      Freedom blames HUD for it kicking out Non-Borrowing      Experts who have reviewed my paperwork have told me that this      isn't even a HUD-backed loan, so Financial Freedom has no one      to blame but themselves. It seems Financial Freedom should be      working to keep people like me in their homes, and not      fighting to kick us out.       I hear that Steve Mnuchin was a leader of the bank that is      doing this to me and other seniors. I do not think a man like      that should be the Treasury Secretary and in charge of our      economy. We can't let that happen. Thank you again for      allowing me to tell my story on behalf of those who have had      bad dealings with Financial Freedom and  Thank you, I appreciate you telling your story.  I also talked about Heather McCreary, her husband, and her twin boys, and how her family was left out on the street because of the greed of Steve Mnuchin and OneWest  Heather courageously shared her story with us, and here is what she said:       My name is Heather My husband Jack, my two kids      Jaden and Clara, and I are from Sparks, This is my      story about how my family's American Dream turned into a      nightmare. I'm sharing my story with the hope of explaining      why we cannot let Steve Mnuchin become Secretary of the      Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the Treasury      Department would mean that a man who profited off the      struggles of families like mine would be one of the most      powerful people in the U.economy.       For a while, it was looking like our shot at the American      Dream was going pretty well. In 2006, Jack and I bought our      dream home in Sparks--just a mile away from my parents, and a      short walk to Jaden and Clara's school and to parks the kids      could play in. I was working as a home health care worker and      Jack was working in construction, and together we were      managing just fine.       Then, in 2008, when the economy started to get worse, I was      laid off. The following year in 2009, Jack was laid off too.      Though Jack was able to find another job pretty fast, he had      to take a big pay cut--from about $25 an hour to $8.50 an      hour. Between the cut in Jack's pay and the loss in income I      experienced when going on unemployment insurance benefits      after I got laid off, we were pinched and we were drowning      financially. However, we were determined to keep our dream      home, so Jack and I were tenacious about doing whatever we      could to get help. We sought help from the Hope Now Alliance,      which is an alliance of HUD-approved counselors who provide      free foreclosure help, and from the Washoe County Senior Law      We worked side-by-side with both organizations to do      everything required of us by our mortgage servicer IndyMac,      which later became       When we first asked for help, OneWest gave us a short      forbearance and allowed us to make a smaller payment for      several months with the goal of a reduction in our monthly      mortgage payments through the Home Affordable Modification      Program (or HAMP). By applying for the HAMP program, we      thought we were back on the road to keeping our home. We      complied 100 percent with OneWest's requirements for HAMP--we      were incredibly nervous about being able to keep our house,      so we were extremely careful to make sure we did everything      we could to keep the process going forward. Our application      for HAMP was processed and we were approved for a      modification. I sent in the signed paperwork and the first      payment under the modified payment amount.       But then the process started to fall apart.       After a whole 30 days, OneWest returned our personal check      and told us that only certified checks would be accepted, so      they were now voiding the modification offer. We had followed      the instructions to the letter on OneWest's paperwork,      crossing our ``T''s and dotting our ``I''s. But in the end,      this didn't matter--and OneWest's rejection of our HAMP      application put us on the road to foreclosure.       We applied two more times for loan modifications over the      next six months because we were given assurances by people at      OneWest that they would approve our application. We again      complied with every request OneWest made of us, taking care      to send in extra documents whenever OneWest requested them.      But as far as I can tell, OneWest never attempted to process      the loan modification.       The foreclosure went through and we lost our home on      September 10, 2010. The foreclosure left us without a home,      and finding a new rental was extremely difficult because of      our credit. Juggling the demands of raising our twins and      this was so hard--the foreclosure even meant that our kids      had to miss school. Eventually we did find a new place, but      we had to pay an outrageous rent--even though it was not a      good home for us at all. It's hard to explain the shame,      embarrassment, and grief that Jack and I felt.       I've cried a river of tears over this. I really didn't      think we were asking too much: we wanted to hang onto our      home for the sake of our kids, and we did everything we could      to stay in our home. And while I will probably never know      exactly what OneWest did, the outcome of my story proves that      Steve Mnuchin's company had no interest in helping us. They      wanted to foreclose because they were focused on their      profits. Putting Steve Mnuchin in charge of the country's      financial system is an insult to families like mine: families      who worked hard and did everything they could to get by after      the economy collapsed.       Take it from my experience--I know he will not be looking      out for working people. Instead, he will use his position to      make the economy work better for people like himself. On      behalf of my family and others like it, I ask you to please      reject Steve Mnuchin as Treasury  Thank you, Heather, for sending in your letter. I appreciate it.  And remember Sylvia? She and her family are facing foreclosure later this month, yet she still came all the way to Washington to stop the Senate from putting Steve Mnuchin in a position to harm millions of others.  Sylvia told us her story, and this is what she said:       My name is Sylvia Oliver, I am a homeowner from Scotch      Plains, New I got my mortgage from IndyMac in May      2008, and about a month later, IndyMac failed. I want to      share my story because it is more than a house--it is a home      for me, my husband, and my three children and my      grandchildren.       In early 2009, my husband and I were facing financial      difficulties. Because of the economy being in bad shape, my      husband was between jobs. We reached out to OneWest to      request a modification. We were told that we had to make      three payments in order to move forward on a permanent      modification, and so we made those three payments. After      making those payments, I reached back out to OneWest to find      out what the next steps were. But I couldn't get a straight      answer from them, so we continued making partial payments,      even though it was a challenge for us financially.       In February 2010, I submitted a modification application to      OneWest About six weeks later I received a Notice of      Intent to However, the person I had been talking      to at OneWest, a man named Albert, told me not to worry, and      encouraged me to continue submitting updated documents to the      bank. So, for the next year, I would submit new documents to      the bank, through FedEx and through faxes. And, every week, I      would call Albert and ask if he had an update on my      situation, and every week I was told there was no answer and      to call back the next week.       After a year of my weekly phone calls, I finally a received      a denial letter from OneWest in February 2011, when they said      they couldn't modify my loan.       Albert at OneWest told me I could reapply for a      modification, which I did, because I really wanted to keep      our home.       For the next several months, the cycle would repeat with      the bank telling me to reapply for a modification, me      believing that they were sincere, and then a few months later      being told that we had been declined again. This was      surprising, because during this time we were back on our feet      and our incomes were both increasing, which meant we were in      a better position to pay for our mortgage.       At the end of 2015, I received another notice of      foreclosure from the bank. At this point it became clear to      me that OneWest never had any intention of modifying the loan      in such a way that they would still get paid back and we      would be able to keep our home.       In March of 2016, I hired a lawyer because I thought they      might have more success in working with the bank than I did.      At my attorney's advice, I filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy as      part of another modification application. That process went      on for about five or six months, with the same cycle of me      sending paperwork over and over to the bank, and the same      answer again.       Last year I was facing foreclosure three weeks before      However, that was then postponed until this month.      In fact, I was supposed to be foreclosed on by OneWest      today--  That is the day she came to Washington--[[Page S1080]]       however, after Senator Menendez's office called OneWest, I      learned that my sale had been postponed at least until next      month.       Earlier this month, I sought help from a HUD approved      housing counselor. She worked with me and my husband to      document our income and to submit a modification application.      After analyzing the situation, she was surprised to hear that      we had not qualified for a modification earlier, especially      since my husband and I both had good incomes.       As of right now, I am still facing foreclosure next month--  That would be February--     and I know in my heart this is because OneWest's only intent      was to foreclose on my home.       This bank has had ample opportunities to modify my loan. In      fact, they told me that they own the loan, so I know they      can't blame the situation on an investor not allowing them to      modify my loan. Nobody should have to go through the      experience that I have gone through during the past several      years with OneWest It has been very painful and      stressful not knowing if my kids and my family were going to      have a home to live in or if it is going to be foreclosed on.       I would ask you to remember my experience when you consider      whether Mr.Mnuchin is qualified to lead the Department of      the As the CEO and Chair of OneWest Bank, ",CREC-2017-02-10-pt1-PgS1073-6.txt,2182,PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED BY THE,2017.0,10.0,January
8293,topic-id,781,"Madam President, the Senate is now debating the nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be the Secretary of the Treasury, and this is yet another nomination on which the majority has walked away, unfortunately, from a 20-year bipartisan approach when it comes to the vetting process.  In 2009, when Tim Geithner was President Obama's first Treasury nominee, a vetting issue came up and both sides of the Finance Committee carried the investigation out to its conclusion, but the situation has turned out quite differently this time.  There were several properties in the United States and abroad worth $100 million missing from Mr.Mnuchin's disclosure. He failed to disclose several positions in various firms. He misled the public. He misled the committee about his bank foreclosure tactics, and he appears to have hidden key data requested by Members of this body. Frankly, I don't believe these investigations would have been uncovered at all if not for the work of the minority's investigation team. The majority, however, looked the other way, and the vetting process was ended prematurely. So the vote on this nomination is imminent. That is the first concern held by Members on this side, and I am going to speak more about that today and as this debate continues.  This morning, though, I want to focus on the substance of our concerns.  The single biggest challenge is what to do to reconnect working Americans with this country's economic engine. There are communities across the land, including many in my home State of Oregon where folks are just waiting for economic recovery to show up. They see their homes foreclosed, storefronts boarded up, factories shuttered. They[[Page S1074]]just feel stuck. Aside from the President himself, nobody in America has greater influence over this Nation's economic future than the U.Treasury That is the case whether it is through tax reform that fights unfairness, rules that rein in Wall Street abuses, or smart infrastructure and trade policies that create good-paying jobs here at home. We call them red, white, and blue jobs.  The person who becomes Treasury Secretary has to be somebody who is ready to work on behalf of all Americans, including those Americans from the corners of our Nation where optimism has dimmed. If Steven Mnuchin's record is any indication, he simply doesn't fit that mold, not even close.  There is a lot to debate as the Senate considers Mr.Mnuchin's nomination. Particularly significant, in my judgment as the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, is the issue of how our Tax Code punishes wage-earning I am going to cover that this morning. In my view, though, the debate begins with the story of OneWest, Mr.Mnuchin's bank. It begins with a lot of gory details of how OneWest industrialized the process of kicking people out of their homes and onto the streets, and it begins with the details of how Mr.Mnuchin enriched himself at the same time his foreclosure machine was running.  As I described, the financial crisis was a personal setback from which a lot of Americans still have not recovered, but for Mr.Mnuchin, it wasn't exactly a setback at all. In fact, it was the deal of a lifetime. In March, 2009, Mr.Mnuchin led a group of investors who bought IndyMac Bank, one of several banks that had been engulfed in crisis the year before.  Mr.Mnuchin and his group got an unusually sweet deal from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, buying $23.5 billion worth of assets for less than $1.6 billion. IndyMac was renamed OneWest Bank and it opened up shop the very next day.  As part of this sweetheart deal, Mr.Mnuchin got what is known as a Shared-Loss Agreement from the Federal Deposit Insurance Under the deal with OneWest, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation made nearly $900 billion in payments to OneWest for IndyMac loans. Total payments from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to OneWest, including payments for loans made to OneWest subsidiaries First Federal, La Jolla, and Financial Freedom, were $1.22 billion.  It didn't take long after Mr.Mnuchin rolled out the newly branded OneWest for the bank to be investigated by State attorneys general around the country. Already they had big concerns about OneWest's foreclosure practices, and this, in my view, is where you see the guts of the foreclosure machine beginning to show itself.  As part of this investigation, a OneWest vice president who worked under Mr.Mnuchin, Erica Johnson-Seck, admitted under oath to the practice known as robo-signing. This witness said she signed more than 750 foreclosure documents a week without reading them and with no notary present during the process. That is a violation of the law. When asked how much time she spent executing each foreclosure document, ",CREC-2017-02-10-pt1-PgS1073-6.txt,1247,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,10.0,March
8262,topic-id,207,"Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Johnson for standing up and defending our Nation's Constitution again, not just in his service to our country during the Vietnam era, but here in Congress and his many years here.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. As a tireless advocate for the protection of our Second Amendment rights, I am disappointed, but not surprised, in the Obama administration's attempt to impair Americans' right to own firearms, by fiat, in its last days of existence. It is unconscionable and unthinkable that a President would do that to the citizens of this country.  This rule claims to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check but, in reality, acted as a gun grab on individuals who receive disability insurance benefits or Supplemental Security Income payments. Participants in those programs should not be forced to worry that, in order to receive government assistance, they must sacrifice their constitutional liberty at the random whim of a government bureaucrat. The Second Amendment to our Constitution states very clearly that the right to keep and bear arms ``shall not be infringed,'' and Congress cannot stand by and allow unaccountable rulemaking from a previous administration to infringe on that right.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  ",CREC-2017-02-02-pt1-PgH894-3.txt,2115,EXECUTIVE SESSION,2017.0,2.0,February
8272,topic-id,152,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to bring attention to the burden ObamaCare has placed upon my constituents.  They have seen their healthcare costs rise while their quality of care has lowered. It is imperative that we repealObamaCare immediately.  I also emphasize to the folks here and at home that, as we repeal ObamaCare, we will make sure there is a stable transitionperiod during the replacement so that people do not have the rug pulled out from under them. This transition period will give usthe time we need to ensure our healthcare reform is full of truly patient-centered solutions that allow patients, families, anddoctors to direct their health care.  Congress must focus on the principles of affordability, accessibility, and quality to provide the American people withgenuine healthcare reform, but we can only get to that point by repealing ObamaCare now.
