       CONGRESS MUST FINISH REFORM OF THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, last week a Federal court temporarily 
overturned the termination of the fired Phoenix VA hospital director, 
Sharon Helman. Helman was relieved of her duties in 2015 after a 
whistleblower disclosed a string of scandals, including manipulation of 
wait times to collect performance bonuses. Even worse, in a separate 
court case, she pled guilty and was convicted of accepting over $50,000 
in illegal gifts. For this, she is currently on probation.
  Mr. Speaker, Congress must take swift action to ensure former and 
current VA employees like Ms. Helman are held accountable. Those who 
disregard their duty to our Nation's veterans should never be allowed 
to keep their jobs, salaries, or benefits after proven dereliction of 
duty. Our veterans do not deserve--and they cannot afford--VA leaders 
who put profit and expediency over the health of those who have worn 
our Nation's uniform.
  Congress has taken steps to reform the Veterans Administration, but 
we must finish our job. That is why I was proud to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 
1259, the VA Accountability First Act. American veterans are counting 
on us to keep our promises and protect them from self-serving 
bureaucrats. I intend to do just that.
