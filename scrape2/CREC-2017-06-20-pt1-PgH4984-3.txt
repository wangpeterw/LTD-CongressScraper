           RECOGNIZING ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alzheimer's and 
Brain Awareness Month. Alzheimer's is

[[Page H4985]]

the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, and more than 5 
million Americans are currently living with it. Every 66 seconds, 
someone in the United States cultivates the disease.
  This disease is not only deadly, but it is also costly. Alzheimer's, 
as well as other forms of dementia, cost the Nation roughly $259 
billion annually.
  Our communities are stepping up. Last year, I joined the Walk 2 End 
Alzheimer's event at Target Field, where more than 12,000 people turned 
out for the cause. It is this passion that has led to initiatives like 
the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act, of which I am a cosponsor. This is an 
important step in finding a cure through the forming of public-private 
partnerships to pursue different and new research opportunities.
  Mr. Speaker, we are at a reflection point--an important reflection 
point for Alzheimer's research. The more commitment we put forward, the 
more progress that we will make in finding a cure. While we have made 
significant progress, we will not be satisfied until a cure has been 
found.
