                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Eternal God, empower us today to trust You more fully and to accept 
our responsibility to bring peace to our Nation. Let that peace begin 
in our individual lives, creating an oasis of concord in an arid and 
truculent world.
  May our Senators bring the music of Your unity to their work, finding 
creative solutions to intractable problems. Lord, whisper to them words 
of instruction to help them find wisdom for these challenging days. May 
they shoulder the responsibilities that come with the privilege of 
freedom.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
