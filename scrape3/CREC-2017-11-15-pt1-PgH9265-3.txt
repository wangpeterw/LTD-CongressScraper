   HONORING ERNEST WALLS ON HIS INDUCTION INTO THE GEORGIA MILITARY 
                         VETERANS' HALL OF FAME

  (Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
remarkable individual from my home district, Mr. Ernest Walls of 
Monroe, a 93-year-old World War II veteran who was recently inducted 
into the Georgia Military Veterans Hall of Fame.
  Private First Class Walls joined the U.S. Army in the midst of World 
War II at the age of 18. In a display of incredible valor, under the 
22nd Infantry Unit, he was part of the wave of troops to storm Utah 
Beach, the westernmost beach of the five landing areas of the Normandy 
invasion, where they fought their way across a killing zone without 
hesitation. He was later wounded and captured by the Germans. He spent 
a year as a prisoner of war.
  When asked about his heroic action, he said: ``Only the grace of God 
helped us win the war, and America came back as the most blessed and 
most powerful Nation on Earth.''
  Due to an unfortunate clerical error, it took Mr. Wells nearly 55 
years to receive his POW status and full benefits. Thankfully, since 
then, he has been rightfully awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple 
Heart, French Legion of Honor, and Prisoner of War Medal.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Private 
Wells and to extend our personal and sincere appreciation to him, as 
well as all our men and women in uniform. We, as a nation, are forever 
grateful.
