                                 PRAYER

  Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Capitol Hill United Methodist Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  God of power and peace, we pause before this pro forma session to 
remember all who form this great body called Congress.
  We give You thanks today for each Member, their families and loved 
ones, for Member staffs, committee staffs, House officers and their 
staffs, all the support staff, security and custodial teams, interns, 
fellows, vendors, and contractors.
  Lord, thank You, thank You for all who work tirelessly in this place.
  Today, we also confess that despite our efforts, and sometimes even 
because of them, violence and division wreak havoc in us and our world. 
This week, we are especially aware, Lord, of the devastation humans 
have the power to unleash on one another.
  God of Shalom, forgive us. Remind us that You give a far greater 
power: peace.
  Give us today the courage to face our fears, self-honesty to 
recognize our role in any dispute, generosity to ensure others' needs 
are met, stamina and humble strength.
  In other words, form us for the work of peace.
  Amen and amen.
