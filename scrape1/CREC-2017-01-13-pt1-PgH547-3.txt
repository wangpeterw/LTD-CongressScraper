     Interior ostensibly to protect habitat for the Greater Sage 
     Grouse also negatively impact several vital 
     militaryinstallations and training facilities in the Western

     act tomitigate negative impacts of the federal land use 
     restrictions in order to preserve national defense readiness, 
     while at thesame time, respecting the 10th Amendment
