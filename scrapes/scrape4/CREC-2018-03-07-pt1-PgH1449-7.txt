                       BIPARTISAN ACTION ON GUNS

  (Ms. GABBARD asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the students, 
faculty, staff, families, and community around Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School who lost 17 of their own 3 weeks ago today.
  I rise to join the entire community of Parkland and millions of 
Americans all across the country, Democrats and Republicans, who are 
saying enough is enough. The time for action is now.
  We cannot allow partisan politics to get in the way of taking 
meaningful action in areas where both parties agree and that have the 
support of most Americans across this country. Here are a few examples:
  Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation I have cosponsored 
to ban bump stocks.
  Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation to close the 
loophole exploited by the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooter last year.
  Both Democrats and Republicans support legislation to uphold Second 
Amendment rights and strengthen the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System.
  Now is the time for us to come together and to take meaningful action 
towards responsible, commonsense gun safety reform.
