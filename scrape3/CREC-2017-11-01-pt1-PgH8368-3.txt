                 STOP HABITUAL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS

  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)

[[Page H8369]]

  

  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Sergio Jose Martinez was trolling a 
parking garage in sanctuary city Portland, Oregon, armed with a knife. 
He set his sights on his prey, a defenseless 65-year-old woman, and he 
attacked her.
  But the woman fought back and pressed the panic button in her car. 
Martinez, the coward, fled the scene, but he was caught. Get this, Mr. 
Speaker: Martinez, after serving several stints in U.S. penitentiaries, 
has been deported over 20 times. But the criminal does his time, gets 
deported, and just comes back into the United States.
  Our border protectors do the best they can, but they are outmanned, 
outgunned, and outfinanced by the drug cartels, criminal gangs, and 
outlaws trying to enter the United States.
  The Border Security for America Act authorizes a border wall, both 
physical and virtual, puts more boots on the ground, more boats in the 
water, and gives more equipment to our law enforcement.
  We must keep criminals like Martinez out of the United States.
  And that is just the way it is.
