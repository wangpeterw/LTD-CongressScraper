       CONDOLENCES TO FAMILIES OF THE 2ND MARINE RAIDER BATTALION

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my condolences to 
the families of the 15 marines and one Navy corpsman who tragically 
lost their lives last week.
  These servicemembers were among the most elite in our armed services, 
with six marines and the sailor from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion 
located at Camp Lejeune. The other nine were based out of Stewart Air 
National Guard Base located in Newburgh, New York.
  Many of them had been deployed and served in conflicts in the Middle 
East. These American heroes valiantly served and placed the needs of 
our Nation first.
  As the parent of a marine now deployed in the Middle East, it is with 
a heavy heart that I offer my condolences to the friends and families 
of these exceptional Americans. The greatest worry of family and 
friends is the tragic loss of a loved one who is serving; thus, it is 
important to honor and remember these brave men and the sacrifices they 
made to preserve our way of life.
  We thank them and remember them for their service and sacrifice. 
Semper fi.
