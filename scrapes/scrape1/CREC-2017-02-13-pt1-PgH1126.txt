            By Mr. WALBERG:
        H.R. 1004.
        Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant 
     to the following:
       Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the 
     United States; the power to regulate commerce among the 
     several states and Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 to make 
     all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying 
     into Execution the foregoing Powers.
       The bill will prevent Executive Agencies from violating the 
     rule and spirit of the Administrative Procedures Act by 
     requiring additional transparency about public communications 
     made by the agencies; most importantly communications made 
     with the intent of artificially promoting support for pending 
     regulatory actions. Congress has the authority to limit 
     regulations by the Executive branch under its Commerce Clause 
     power and it is necessary and proper to introduce legislation 
     to effectively carryout this power.
