ANNOUNCEMENT BY COMMITTEE ON RULES REGARDING AMENDMENT PROCESS FOR H.R. 
   1215, PROTECTING ACCESS TO CARE ACT OF 2017, AND H.R. 1304, SELF-
                        INSURANCE PROTECTION ACT

  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee will be issuing 
announcements outlining the amendment processes for two measures that 
will likely be before the Rules Committee next week.
  An amendment deadline has been set for Monday, March 27, at 10 a.m., 
for H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017; and H.R. 
1304, the Self-Insurance Protection Act.
  The text of these measures will be available on the Rules Committee 
website upon this announcement.
  Please feel free to contact me or my staff if you have any questions.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.
  Mr. McGOVERN. I appreciate the gentleman informing us about next 
week, but I am concerned about this week still.
  Can the gentleman inform me whether or not we will have a CBO score 
on the healthcare repeal bill that we are going to be taking up in the 
Rules Committee tomorrow?
  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the gentleman asking this question.
  As the gentleman has previously asked at the Rules Committee, I 
advised the gentleman that tomorrow, at 10 a.m., the Rules Committee 
will be convening for the purpose of amendment and discussion of the 
text that will come, and it would be my belief that that would be 
available in the evening hour, as I assume we will still be in.
  Mr. McGOVERN. Will we have a CBO score before the Rules Committee 
meets?
  Mr. SESSIONS. It is my belief that I will have one.
  The gentleman does understand that the CBO, in order to get it 
correctly processed, we have not pushed them. They have advised us they 
would anticipate having a score, they believe, tomorrow evening.
  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the gentleman.
  But as I said in the Rules Committee, I just think, under regular 
order, we ought to have the score and know how many people will lose 
their health insurance before we consider it in the Rules Committee.
