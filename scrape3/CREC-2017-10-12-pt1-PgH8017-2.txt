            OVERCOMING PROBLEMS WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Speaker, I want to commend President Trump's 
decision this week with executive orders to do some of the work we have 
been unable to do so far in the House and the Senate, helping people 
overcome the problems with the ACA, the Affordable Care Act.
  One of the measures he put forth was association health plans to 
allow employers' employees to form health plans that suit them--indeed, 
to associate with their type of business, their type of industry on a 
small scale in their neighborhoods. It makes perfect sense, if you want 
to give people more choices.
  Also, short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans, which 
allow people to have, if they are in between jobs, instead of limiting 
it to just 3 months, perhaps just a little longer. In the interim, 
while they are in between jobs, they have choices that they could 
afford with the elements in the plan they would like.
  Finally, health reimbursement arrangements, which make it where 
employees--if they want to provide benefits to their--employers to 
their employees, that they can reimburse for more issues in their plan, 
such as helping them pay for their premiums, if that is how the 
employee wishes to have that.
  Flexibility is what we need; choices are what we need; and then 
Congress needs to be able to accomplish something in the Senate so we 
can bring it back and give this to the American people.
