 RECOGNIZING CONGRESSIONAL APP CHALLENGE WINNER FROM ARKANSAS' SECOND 
                         CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Congressional 
App Challenge winner from Arkansas' Second Congressional District, Anne 
Li.
  Currently a sophomore at Central High School in Little Rock, Anne 
aspires to major in computer engineering and has the goal of pursuing a 
career in programming.
  STEM education is education for the future, and having serious skills 
in computer programming and coding open up tremendous opportunities for 
our youth. It gives them the skills to compete in a 21st century job 
market as well as the skills to act on their imagination and engage in 
their entrepreneurial exploration.
  I wish Anne the very best as she continues her studies at Central 
High School and beyond in this critical field.
  As a member of the Congressional STEM Education Caucus and the dad of 
a STEM student at the university, I want to continue to support the 
growth of STEM education throughout Arkansas and America.
