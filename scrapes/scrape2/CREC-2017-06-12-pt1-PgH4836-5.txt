                      PRESIDENT TRUMP'S MUSLIM BAN

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, the tired, the poor, the huddled masses 
yearning to breathe free are still welcome in America, no thanks to 
President Trump. Today, for the second time, President Trump lost a 
ruling on his Muslim ban in the Federal courts of appeal.
  The purpose of the President's ban is clear. The then Presidential 
candidate Trump explicitly called for a total and complete shutdown of 
Muslims entering the United States. Just last week, President Trump 
criticized his revised ban as politically correct and called for a much 
tougher version.
  The President's executive order is a Muslim ban, plain and simple. 
Any argument to the contrary is undercut by the President's own tweets.
  President Trump, by his own words and by his own actions, is 
abdicating America's moral leadership. The greatness of America is not 
built on isolation and discrimination. It is built on the rule of law 
and the ideals of equality and inclusion and on the rich history of 
immigration.
