                       REPUBLICAN HEALTHCARE BILL

  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, for 7 years, Republicans have been making 
promises about their secret healthcare plan. They said that under their 
plan, nobody would have to carry health insurance if they did not want 
to; and then when they got sick, they could demand their health 
insurance with no exclusions for preexisting conditions, no limits on 
coverage for expensive diseases, and that their coverage would be 
better and cheaper than ObamaCare for all Americans.
  While they made these questionable promises, the Affordable Care Act 
provided more than 20 million Americans with lifesaving health care. 
And now, after 7 years, Republicans have finally revealed their secret 
plan. We now see that virtually all their promises were lies. Their 
plan will rapidly bankrupt Medicare, and those over 50 will see massive 
cost increases, and millions will lose their health care.
  They did keep one promise, though. Massive new tax cuts for the 
wealthy. For that, millions of American families will pay a terrible 
price.
