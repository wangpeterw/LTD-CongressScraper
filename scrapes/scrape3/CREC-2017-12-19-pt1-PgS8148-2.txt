                       TRIBUTE TO CONNOR BARRETT

 Mr. THUNE. Madam President, today I recognize the hard work of 
my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Connor 
Barrett. Connor hails from Bend, OR, and is an aspiring law student.
  While interning for the Commerce Committee, Connor assisted the 
Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. He is a dedicated worker who 
was committed to getting the most out of his internship. I extend my 
sincere thanks and appreciation to Connor for all of the fine work he 
did for the committee and wish him continued success in the years to 
come.
