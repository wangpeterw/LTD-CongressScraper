            HONORING THE LIFE OF MAJOR GENERAL TIM LOWENBERG

  (Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of 
Major General Timothy Lowenberg, former Adjutant General of the 
Washington State National Guard.
  After attending law school, Tim served on Active Duty at McChord Air 
Force Base before joining the Washington National Guard as a Judge 
Advocate Staff Officer.
  He was promoted to Adjutant General, honorably serving Washington 
State and our Nation. He stood up for our citizen soldiers, worked to 
ensure that the National Guard had the resources it needed, and oversaw 
multiple deployments to the Middle East.
  In addition, Tim established the Washington Youth Academy, providing 
an education and opportunity for at-risk youth across the State.
  As a member of the Washington legislature, I was pleased to work with 
him on this, a cause that he was very passionate about, and was able to 
see his vision become a success.
  Upon retirement, he continued to serve his country and community. He 
will be missed by many, but his legacy of determination, kindness, and 
dutiful service to Washington and these United States lives on.
  Please join me in remembering Major General Timothy Lowenberg, my 
friend.
