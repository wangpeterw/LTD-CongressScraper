                              GOP TAX PLAN

  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, the tax bill passed by the House GOP 
today embodies everything that Americans dislike about Congress:
  It was drafted behind closed doors where the drafters cast aside 
expert analysis and relied instead on special interests and faulty 
disproven assumptions.
  The plan slashes tax rates for multinational corporations and the 
superwealthy, but leaves hardworking Americans in the 47th 
Congressional District to pay the bill.
  It penalizes taxpayers in California and other blue States for 
investing in our schools, in our roads, and in our public services.
  It cruelly hits children, seniors, and low-income Americans by 
putting at risk Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, and Social Security.
  Mr. Speaker, I could not, and proudly did not, vote for this 
disastrous piece of legislation.
