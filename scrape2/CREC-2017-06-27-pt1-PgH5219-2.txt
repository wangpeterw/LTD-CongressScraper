                          HONORING FRANK KUSH

  (Mr. BIGGS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a legendary 
Arizonan, Frank Kush, who passed away last week at age 88.
  Frank is best known for his career as coach of the Arizona State 
University Sun Devils football program. He won 176 games over 21\1/2\ 
seasons, the most ever in Sun Devil history. He was named national 
Coach of the Year after the 1975 season and was elected to the College 
Football Hall of Fame in 1995.
  Coach Frank Kush was not only concerned with wins and losses, he was 
a mentor for young men and ensured that their professional and academic 
development rose above their athletic prowess. Coach Kush influenced 
hundreds of young men during his career at Arizona State. His impact is 
ever-present in the lives of his former players, and his legacy will 
never be forgotten.
