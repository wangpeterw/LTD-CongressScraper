                          STOP GTMO TRANSFERS

  (Mrs. HARTZLER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge this administration 
to stop releasing terrorists from Guantanamo, wherethey can be returned 
to the Middle East and rejoin the fight. Approximately one in three 
former Guantanamo Bay detainees areconfirmed to have reengaged or are 
suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities after transfer.
  The White House, despite clear understanding of congressional intent, 
recently gave four more individuals the opportunity toresume their 
fight against American ideals by releasing them to Saudi Arabia. This 
is irresponsible and dangerous.
  Even more disturbing are the President's plans to transfer more 
detainees, further threatening the safety of our troops andthe security 
of the American people. It is appalling to me that the President would 
consider transferring the likes of Osama binLaden's security guards and 
others trained by al Qaeda.
  I urge this administration, in its final 8 days, to bear in mind 
potential consequences of his decision and to halt any moretransfers. 
The security of American families and military personnel are at stake.
