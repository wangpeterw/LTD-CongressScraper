     CONGRATULATING MUGSHOTS GRILL & BAR ON THEIR 14TH ANNIVERSARY

  (Mr. PALAZZO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ron Savell and 
the entire Mugshots Grill & Bar staff on 14 years of successful 
business.
  On January 10, 2004, the first Mugshots Grill & Bar was opened in 
Hattiesburg, Mississippi, near the campus of my alma mater, the 
University of Southern Mississippi. While the original, unfortunately, 
burned down in 2011, there are now more than 18 restaurant locations 
spanning three States.
  Ron is a fellow USM Golden Eagle that continues to expand his 
businesses in south Mississippi. Most recently, he has opened Brewsky's 
in Hattiesburg and Patio 44 in Hattiesburg and Biloxi. His restaurants 
continue to fuel the economies of my district.
  The success that Ron has had in such a short amount of time is a 
testament to his entrepreneurial spirit and his hard work, persistence, 
and determination. And, of course, he has a great partner: his wife, 
Caitlin, and their beautiful family.
  Next time you are in south Mississippi, be sure to stop by Mugshots 
Grill & Bar and have yourself a delicious peanut butter burger.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ron on his 14th anniversary.
