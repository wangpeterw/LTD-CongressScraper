                    UNITED IN REINING IN REGULATIONS

  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, for the last 8 years, Americans have felt 
the burden of excessive and intense regulatory overreach having to 
comply with time-consuming rules and regulations. But that ends now. 
For the first time in 8 years, the legislative branch and the executive 
branch are on the same page. We must get the government out of the way.
  Last week, I joined my colleagues on the One In, One Out Act, which 
requires Federal agencies to repeal or revise a rule before they can 
issue a new one, and any new rule must be of equal or lesser cost to 
Americans.
  And in true Trump fashion this week, the President announced his own 
version, the one in, two out executive order.
  These measures are commonsense at their core. To begin growing our 
economy and creating jobs, we have got to reduce the size and scope of 
the Federal Government and tackle the mountain of red tape surrounding 
our Nation's job creators. Americans are ready for growth and 
innovation, and, for the first time in a long time, the President is on 
our side.
