                              THE TAX BILL

  (Mr. SARBANES asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, as Congress careens toward passage of a 
massive rewrite of our Tax Code, we ought to look at the process that 
got us here. This tax bill has seen no hearings, no expert testimony, 
and absolutely no honest efforts to build bipartisan support. This is a 
terrible shame and the result is a terrible sham.
  Who are the ones calling the shots on this tax bill?
  The corporate lobbyists and the big money donors who will make out 
like bandits. They are the ones who will walk away with a smile on 
their face and money in their pocket. Meanwhile, millions of 
hardworking Americans will see their taxes increase under this plan. 
The latest numbers from the CBO say that 82 million Americans will be 
worse off.
  A good tax plan would be trying to address widening wealth and income 
inequality in our country. A good tax plan would be seeking to invest 
in our people and our infrastructure. It would seek to help working 
families and build up the middle class. But this plan does the 
opposite.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues to pull the plug on this 
tax proposal that is of, by, and for the wealthy and well-connected. We 
can, and we must, do better for all Americans.
