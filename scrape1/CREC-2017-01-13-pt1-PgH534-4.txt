                             SHAM AND SCAM

  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans just voted to begin the 
repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Their misguided andheartless effort 
will not just affect thousands of insurance policies in Nevada, but it 
will cost the State jobs, it willdiminish access to health care, and it 
will jeopardize lives.
  Nevada had one of the highest uninsured rates in the country before 
the ACA. Since then, we have cut the rate by almost 50percent, and we 
have created a system that now provides 400,000 children and adults 
with coverage. But Trump and thecongressional Republicans don't want to 
hear about that.
  Make no mistake, when they voted to repeal the ACA, they are revoking 
vital programs that offer cancer screenings and mentalhealth 
assistance. They are rescinding provisions that prevent insurance 
companies from charging women more than men, or fromdenying benefits 
because of preexisting conditions.
  This is unconscionable. Instead of repeal and replace, the 
Republicans should just call their proposal ``destroy anddelay,'' or 
perhaps just simply ``scam and sham.''
