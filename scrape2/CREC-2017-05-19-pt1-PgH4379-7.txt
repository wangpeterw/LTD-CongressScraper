  Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Police Week and 
to say ``thank you'' to the men and women in New Jersey and in our 
country who keep our community safe, and especially to honor those who 
paid the ultimate price in their efforts to do so.
  Sadly, this year alone, we have lost 48 police officers in the line 
of duty across the United States. We cannot repay the debt our 
communities owe to these heroes and their families, but we can start by 
expressing appreciation for their bravery, dedication, and service, and 
making sure law enforcement knows that they have our full support.
  Our police officers and all first responders can't protect us and 
themselves without the resources they need to do their job safely and 
effectively. Not only do police protect us from criminals, but they are 
on the front lines of the war on terror, especially as we have seen the 
rise of homegrown and lone-wolf terror after 9/11.
  To close, I want to reiterate my deep appreciation for the work of 
local, county, and State police officers in my district in New Jersey 
and across our country who keep our communities safe.
