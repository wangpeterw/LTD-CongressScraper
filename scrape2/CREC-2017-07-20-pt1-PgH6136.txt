                 WISHING JOHN McCAIN A SPEEDY RECOVERY

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, yesterday I left an event and went straight 
to my

cellphone. The first thing on it was a notice that John McCain had 
brain cancer. I literally stopped in my steps and thought about John 
McCain and was saddened.
  Senator John McCain is a true American hero who served our country in 
Vietnam and has served our country in this House of Representatives and 
the United States Senate.
  When he ran for President, he had a bus called Straight Talk, and 
that wasn't just a name on a bus. He is a straight shooter.
  He has been a voice of reason and honesty, standing up and speaking 
truth to power during these last 6 months of this current Presidency, 
and somebody whom we need as a voice.
  It seems that Arizona produces those voices. They produced it with 
Barry Goldwater, and they produced it with John McCain.
  He is a nice guy, too. The few opportunities I had to interchange 
with John McCain or go up to him and say something to him about an 
issue, he was always very easygoing, very pleasant, a good human being.
  I urge you, if there are people in your life that you think well of, 
that you care about, let them know it now, and keep John McCain in your 
prayers. Hopefully, he will come back and continue to serve the United 
States as he has throughout his entire life.
