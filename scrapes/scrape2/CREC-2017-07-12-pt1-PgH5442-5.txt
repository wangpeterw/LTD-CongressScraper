            INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK

  (Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, The Buffalo News, in a feature 
story this week, highlighted the impressive development of the once 
dormant urban streets in Buffalo, New York; streets like Niagara 
Street, Main Street, and Ohio Street.
  What these road projects have in common in their resurgence is a 
smart and targeted Federal commitment to infrastructure that has been 
successfully leveraged to yield significant private investment and 
achieve the maximum benefit for our community and for the Nation.
  Buffalo--long ago humbled by economic devastation--is now a national 
model for communities nationwide in showing how infrastructure 
investments can create jobs and improve the life quality of 
communities.
  Infrastructure investment creates jobs in the construction trades and 
supply and materials industry immediately and unleashes the investment 
of the private sector in a cause-and-effect economic response.
  Buffalo has come a long way, and we still have a long way to go. The 
lessons of our success can and should be shared with the Nation through 
this institution.
