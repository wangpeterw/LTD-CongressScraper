                    ENSURING VETERAN ACCESS TO SNAP

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week the House 
debated the National Defense Authorization Act, which I believe is one 
of the most essential responsibilities of Congress, to fund our armed 
services. This House works to ensure our servicemen and -women have the 
resources they need to keep America safe.
  We must also make certain that our veterans, our military, have 
access to the resources they need to be successful in civilian life. 
This certainly includes access to nutritional food.
  Out of the 22 million veterans in the United States, about 1.7 
million are in households that currently participate in the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Approximately 46 
percent of our veterans are senior citizens, including those who served 
in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.
  Veterans of all ages may also have widely varying levels of 
disabilities or limitations. SNAP cannot solve all of the challenges a 
veteran or a member of an Active-Duty military family faces, but it can 
help eligible veterans once they return home.
  As the Agriculture Committee prepares the next farm bill, we must 
remain vigilant in our dedication to

serve those who have given so much in the defense of our Nation.
