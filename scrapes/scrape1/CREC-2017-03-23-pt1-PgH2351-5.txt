                     WELCOMING PASTOR BOB MacGREGOR

  The SPEAKER. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
Herrera Beutler) is recognized for 1 minute.
  There was no objection.
  Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to introduce 
my pastor and dear friend, Bob MacGregor, as our guest chaplain this 
morning.
  Pastor Bob is the lead pastor of City Harvest Church in Vancouver, 
Washington, my home church. City Harvest is a thriving church that 
greatly impacts our community by caring for the needy and supporting 
mission work.
  Pastor Bob and his wife, Sue, have four daughters and eight 
grandchildren. They have been married for 38 years and share a burden 
to help build marriages and families of ministers who face the demands 
of ministry life.
  It is my great pleasure to welcome Pastor Bob and thank him as he has 
blessed us this morning with his prayer.
