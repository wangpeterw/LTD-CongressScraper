                        NATIONAL K9 VETERANS DAY

  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, this week, we recognized National K9 
Veterans Day. It was on March 13, 1942, that the U.S. Army K9 Corps was 
officially formed, although dogs have had a role in our military ever 
since our country's founding. We not only honor military dogs, but also 
police dogs, customs dogs, border patrol dogs, and other working dogs 
that work to protect our communities.
  These dogs provide an incredible service to our brave men and women 
overseas. They are responsible for saving lives and preventing 
injuries, sometimes at their own expense.
  Many of our servicemembers form very strong bonds with these loyal 
companions. That is why I authored the Military Working Dog Military 
Retirement Act and was proud to see it pass with overwhelming 
bipartisan support last Congress. This new law guarantees that service 
dogs are returned and retired to the United States after serving 
overseas. Previously, military members were often forced to spend their 
own money to bring these animals home.
  Mr. Speaker, let us remember and honor these four-legged heroes. They 
are a valuable component of protecting Americans through their courage 
and their loyalty.
