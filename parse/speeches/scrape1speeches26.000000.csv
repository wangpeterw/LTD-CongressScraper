1463,topic-id,842,"Mr.Speaker, I rise to express my fervent support for President Trump's executive order: Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist  I, along with many other Members of Congress, have been speaking out for more than a 1\1/2\ years about the dangers posed by our U.N.-run refugee resettlement program. I applaud President Trump for following through on his promise by imposing strict vetting for seven countries that President Obama labeled in 2016 as countries of particular concern for terrorism.  Liberal activists and politicians are leveling baseless assertions about the Trump policy only to see a lazy and complicit media parrot their claims without exercising due diligence to validate it. To me, this is fake news. And in this incident, it is the mainstream media that is pushing this misinformation. Let's separate myth from fact and inject a little coolheaded commonsense into this national dialogue.  Friday's executive order does a few things: It pauses the entry of all refugees for the next 120 days; it caps refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017 at 50,000; it stalls, for 90 days, the admission of foreign nationals from seven countries that are well established as terrorist hotspot countries; and it puts priority on highly persecuted religious minorities when the refugee program resumes.  The media has echoed the protesters' assertion that this is somehow a Muslim ban. They are flat-out wrong. Remember, it was President Obama who created this seven-country list, not President  If it were a Muslim ban, then why doesn't it include restrictions on the other 40 majority Muslim nations? That makes no sense. That is because this is a targeted approach to deal with the threat posed by terrorists who operate freely in these failed states and pose a direct threat to the American people. There is absolutely nothing in this executive order that says anything[[Page H825]]about banning any particular group of people.  Another shortsighted fallacy being propagated is that President Trump is the only President to ever implement restrictions on refugee admissions. Conveniently forgotten is the fact that in 2011, President Obama stopped processing refugees from Iraq for 6 months after a terrorist plot was uncovered involving two Iraqi refugees who had come into the United                              {time}  1015  Previous Presidents of both parties have responded to global threats with refugee admission limitations, so characterizing Trump's actions is unprecedented, is simply fiction and a gross demonstration of partisanship.  As ISIS has infiltrated the ranks of refugees in Europe, the President is similarly responding to global threats with the appropriate safeguards as he sees fit.  This is something that he should be praised for--not condemned.  The notion that the executive order is inherently un-American must be addressed as well. After all, America is the land made up of immigrants that has been a safe harbor to millions fleeing persecution around the world since her inception.  But in order for this to continue, we must be vigilant to protect our homeland.  America is the greatest Nation in the world, and if we let up on our pursuit of the highest national security standards, we will see this greatness slip away--to the detriment not only of all American citizens, but to the entire world.  Finally, I must address the false notion that having a Christian ethic demands that we accept all refugees with open arms. Well, if that is the case, why aren't we opening the doors wide to the 60 million refugees worldwide rather than only a fraction of 1 percent?  As a follower of Jesus Christ, I do believe that we should help those in need around us, and that America should be involved in helping the displaced and persecuted whenever we can.  Perhaps a more compassionate approach might be to take the money that we spend settling one refugee in the United States and, instead, for the same price, provide for 12, for a dozen, refugees in a safe haven near their own home countries.  Just as a father's primary responsibility is to care for his own children, the chief role of the President and other national leaders is to ensure the best interest of the citizens under their charge.  If President Trump were to overlook the safety of the American people, it would simply be an abdication of his own responsibility that the American people elected him to do.  It seems the President's opponents have cherry-picked particular Bible verses to suit their own political agenda, while ignoring other basic Biblical concepts of stewardship and responsibility out of sheer political convenience.  To conclude, the hysteria surrounding this national security executive order must come to an end.  After all, the main provisions of this executive order are temporary in nature and are in line with what many Presidents in the past have done.  ISIS presents one of the most extensive and complex threats to our Nation, and we do want our President to take every precaution to make sure that Americans are safe.  This--not the false narratives of Trump's opponents--must be the focus of the national dialogue, and we must share in what he is doing.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-01-pt1-PgH824-2.txt,2270,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1430, HONEST AND OPEN NEW EPA",2017.0,1.0,March

1305,topic-id,1315,"Mr.President, I come to the floor today to express my strong support for the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the U.Supreme Few individuals over the last century have impacted the American legal discourse as profoundly as the late Justice Antonin  In the wake of his untimely passing last February, Justice Scalia left behind a legacy of faithfully applying the law and upholding the principles of our Judge Neil Gorsuch is a worthy successor to Judge Antonin  Judge Gorsuch understands the protections granted in the Constitution, including the separation of powers, federalism, and the Bill of He knows that the Constitution provides Americans with an indispensable safeguard against government overreach.  His past opinions demonstrate that he will honor constitutional protections afforded through due process, the right to bear arms, equal protection under the law, and religious freedom.  Legal experts from across the political spectrum are very much in agreement with the Gorsuch nomination. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Judge Gorsuch the highest possible rating of ``well qualified'' for the Supreme I couldn't agree more.  One of Judge Gorsuch's associates, the chief judge of the Tenth Circuit who served with Judge Gorsuch, has said about him:       Judge Gorsuch brings to the bench a powerful intellect      combined with a probing and analytical approach to every      issue. He brings to each case a strong commitment to limit      his analysis to that case--its facts, the record, and the law      cited and applicable. He does not use his judicial role as a      vehicle for anything other than deciding the case before him.  President Obama's former Solicitor General Neal Katyal penned an op-ed in the New York Times supporting Judge Gorsuch and wrote:       I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help      restore confidence in the rule of law.       His years on the bench reveal a commitment to judicial      independence--a record that should give the American people      confidence[[Page S2160]]     that he will not compromise principle to favor the president      who appointed him.  Those are the words of the Solicitor General who argued on behalf of President Obama's administration in front of the Supreme  Judge Gorsuch has been through the confirmation process before--as we have heard many times on this floor--when Senators, some of them in this body today, approved his nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit without opposition.  I was privileged to meet with Judge Gorsuch several weeks ago, and it was clear to me through our conversation, a thorough examination of his record, and watching last week's hearing in the Judiciary Committee that Judge Gorsuch will decide cases fairly, based on our Constitution and laws. Isn't that the way it should be? This is what West Virginians expect from a Supreme Court  Newspapers in my State have recognized this nominee's strong qualifications of independence and respect for the rule of law. The Charleston Daily Mail editorialized:       Gorsuch has strong legal credentials and deserves to be      confirmed.       He is the kind of pick that any president should make,      Democrat or Republican, because of his proven qualities      necessary for any justice: a strong understanding and respect      for the nation's founding document, the U. The Wheeling Intelligencer and News Register wrote:       During hearings last week, Gorsuch's suitability for a high      court post was made abundantly clear.       He is precisely the type of judge--faithful to the      Constitution not ideology on specific issues--the nation      needs.  And the Martinsburg Journal said:       Gorsuch seems to believe in using the plain language of the      Constitution to decide cases, regardless of his own      preferences.       That--someone who believes only the people not the courts      can change the Constitution--is precisely the type of Supreme      Court justice we Americans need.  The American people benefited from an open and transparent Supreme Court process that led to Judge Gorsuch being nominated.  During the 2016 Presidential election, both candidates were transparent about the type of Supreme Court Justice they would appoint if elected. President Trump released a list of 21 names, a list that included Judge Gorsuch, and promised voters that he would fill this Supreme Court vacancy with someone from that list. Voters paid attention.  According to an NBC News exit poll, 70 percent of voters said the selection of a Supreme Court Justice was either the most important factor in their vote for President or an important factor. Let me state that again--70 percent.  The American people weighed in, and President Trump acted wisely in selecting Judge He is a mainstream judge who is well qualified for the U.Supreme  Unfortunately, the Democratic leader has indicated that his party intends to engage in an unprecedented partisan filibuster of this nomination. A filibuster of a nominee of this caliber would be a tremendous mistake, I believe, that would harm the Senate as an institution. There has never been a Supreme Court nomination that has been defeated by a partisan filibuster of the type that the Senate Democrats are telegraphing. It is one thing to vote against a nominee on whatever grounds a Senator may wish, but it is quite another to filibuster in an effort to block a nomination that has been submitted by a duly elected President who has the support of the majority of the  Senators have always enjoyed the ability to filibuster nominations. That ability has remained available because Senators have shown restraint in applying the power that comes along with requiring unlimited debate. The clear tradition of the Senate--and this is a body of tradition, I have learned--over the course of its 230 years of history is a confirmation by a majority vote. That tradition has been demonstrated in recent Supreme Court nominations.  President Obama nominated both Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan to the Supreme Neither Justice Sotomayor nor Justice Kagan faced a filibuster in the  President George Bush nominated John Roberts as Chief There was no filibuster attempt against that nomination.  President Bill Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Neither faced a filibuster.  President George H.Bush nominated David Souter and Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Neither Justice faced a filibuster even though 48 Senators voted against the Thomas nomination.  One recent Supreme Court nomination did require a cloture vote when a group of Democrat Senators attempted to block a vote on the nomination of Justice Alito's nomination, but a large majority of Senators--72, in fact--invoked cloture, which preserved the bipartisan practice of rejecting filibusters against Supreme Court nominees. Among those who rejected the Alito filibuster in 2006 were the two Democratic Senators from my State--Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Jay There were 72 Senators who voted to invoke cloture on Justice Alito's nomination, but only 58 ended up voting for the final confirmation.  The Senate has a very clear history of rejecting the use of the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations, but there is no justification for a filibuster on the Gorsuch nomination. Neil Gorsuch is a mainstream judge with the highest possible rating from the American Bar He was confirmed by the Senate, without objection, in the year 2006. His service on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has earned him the respect of his judicial colleagues, and he has demonstrated the independence and respect for the law that the American people expect from a Supreme Court I hope that at least eight of my Democratic colleagues will join us regardless of how they, ultimately, will vote on Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. I hope they will recognize the need to invoke cloture on this nomination.

1474,topic-id,1074,"Mr.President, the last 6 years have been devastating to local economies across coal country. The Mine Safety and Health Administration has estimated that at least 60,000 coal jobs have been lost since 2011, and thousands of these jobs have been in my home State of West  Excessive government regulation and other factors have done more than cost jobs. These policies have imperiled our coal miner retirement benefits, and they have left local governments struggling to keep up to pay for education, to pay for public works, and to pay for law enforcement. I can tell my colleagues story after story I have seen in our newspapers about this very thing.  In October, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee heard testimony from Wayne County, West Virginia commissioner Robert He said that the coal severance tax revenues in Wayne County in West Virginia--his county--dropped by 88 percent in 2013 and 2016. This drop left the county without a vital funding source that traditionally helped to pay for local volunteer fire departments, senior citizens programs, and education.  West Virginia University economist John Deskins told the Senate Energy[[Page S494]]and Natural Resources Committee in August that six West Virginia counties were suffering a depression--a depression--because of the coal downturn. And just last week, the State of West Virginia projected that its annual State budget faces a $500 million shortfall.  So what was the response of President Obama's administration in its last days in power? Yet another job-killing and anti-coal regulation that would make a bad situation in my State worse.  The Department of the Interior published its stream protection rule on December 20, 2016, and it made the rule effective on January 19, 2017--just 1 day before President Obama left office. There is a lot of irony here, and I don't think it is by chance. According to a National Mining Association Study, one-third of remaining coal jobs could be placed at risk by the rule.  Today I am proud to join Leader McConnell as he introduces the Stream Protection Congressional Review We are also joined by my colleagues in the West Virginia congressional delegation, including Congressman David McKinley and Congressman Evan Jenkins, and others. We are going to be introducing a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act, blocking the Obama administration's stream protection rule.  Once this resolution of disapproval is passed by Congress--and I believe that it will be, and signed by President Trump, which I believe that it will be--I am confident that both things will happen: The stream protection rule will be nullified, and the Department of the Interior will be prohibited from imposing a similar rule without permission from  The stream protection rule deserves to be eliminated through the Congressional Review Act process. Despite its title--because why would we get rid of something called the stream protection rule--this rule will do little to actually protect our streams, but if left in place, this rule would cost even more coal jobs in my State and across the country that have already been devastated.  West Virginia's former Department of Environmental Protection secretary Randy Huffman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I served last Congress, that the proposed version of the stream protection rule was ``an unnecessary, uncalled for political gesture.''  I would like to say that Secretary Huffman was serving under a Democratic Governor in my  The stream protection rule is the result of an incredibly flawed regulatory process that excluded State officials. Of the 10 States that began the regulatory process--people were asked to join together to begin this process--working with the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining, eight of those States eventually removed themselves from the process because of the Department's unwillingness to actually seriously consider their input. In other words, they were just there for window dressing.  Ohio's chief of Mineral Resources Management Larry Erdos told the Environment and Public Works Committee last February that ``OSM has not provided for meaningful participation with the cooperating or commenting agency states.''  Congress took action to instruct the Department of the Interior to reengage with the States, realizing what was happening here, before moving forward with this rulemaking process. However, despite this direction from lawmakers in the Congress, the Department failed to address the State concerns.  Wyoming director of Environmental Quality, Todd Parfitt, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that ``the failure to engage cooperating agencies throughout this process is reflected in the poor quality of the proposed rule.'' He called on the Office of Surface Mining to withdraw the rule and reengage with States and other stakeholders.  Last week, West Virginia's newly appointed secretary of Environmental Protection--again under a new Democratic Governor--Austin Caperton wrote to congressional leaders detailing our State's concerns with the stream protection rule. Secretary Caperton gave three main reasons for West Virginia's opposition to this rule.  First, he said that the rule upsets the statutory balance between environmental protection and allowing coal mining to take place in the first place. Second, the rule conflicts with the congressionally directed role of the States to be the exclusive regulators of mining activities. And third, the rule conflicts with the Federal Clean Water Act and State water quality standards--pretty broad-ranging concerns.  The concerns from environmental regulators in mining States across the country explain why 14 States, including the State of West Virginia, have already filed lawsuits to stop this stream protection rule. Fifteen State attorneys general, led by West Virginia's attorney general Patrick Morrisey, have written to Congress asking that this rule be blocked using the Congressional Review  State environmental regulators are not alone in their opposition to this rule. Cecil Roberts, who is the president of the United Mine Workers of America, wrote just last week in support of this resolution of disapproval. He said that ``the last thing America's coal-producing regions need at this time is another regulation that will have the effect of reducing employment even more and further stifling economic development.''  West Virginia cannot afford another job-killing regulation that once again inserts Washington and their one-size-fits-all standard into a regulatory process that is supposed to be effectively managed--and is effectively managed--by our State agencies.  The stream protection rule is a flawed policy that was born out of a flawed process.  The rule deserves to be eliminated promptly, and I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the McConnell-Capito resolution of disapproval and to vote to block the rule in the coming days.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS491.txt,1676,EPS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2017,2017.0,30.0,March

Mr.Speaker, I want to talk about the bill before us, the EPA Science Advisory Board, but also I want to talk about Mr.McGovern's amendment on  They actually are linked because the last time a great power decided to deny science-based policy and to actually dictate politically what was science and what wasn't was Stalin's Soviet A famous scientist named Lysenko turned out to be a fraud and a con artist. But for 30 years, his thinking dominated Soviet science to the detriment of the Soviet people. It actually led to a famine in Ukraine, killing millions of people because he insisted on his political brand of agricultural science, which wasn't science at all.  My friend from Massachusetts I think is wrong when he asks: What is the emergency? I don't think he understands that, from the Republican point of view, science mixed with public policy is an emergency. We have to do something about it.  The world was created 4,273 years ago and carbon dating is a fraud. As your coastal areas are under water, think about the comfort of Republican philosophy: it is just a theory, and disputable at that. By the way, let's defund any research on it. Let's back out of our commitments. Let's be the only major nation in the world that denies that climate change is real and is going to affect us in almost every aspect of our lives moving forward, including our children and their children.  We owe them better. That is the emergency. God forbid the Environmental Protection Agency have policies and regulations that are science-based. God forbid we look at empirical research to guide us in making thoughtful policies to protect the public. God forbid we look at the science of lead and other toxins in water supplies, let's save $7 million in Flint, Just today they announced a $100 million settlement. That anti-scientific decision, that political decision, put the people of Flint, Michigan, at risk, and it is now going to cost $100 million to fix.  That is the consequences of an anti-empirical philosophy, and that will be the consequence of polluting this board with corporations and corporate representatives who are guilty of polluting in the first place. Of course, they won't welcome regulation of their own respective industries, and the Republicans are their enablers. That is what is going to happen if this bill passes.  With respect to Russia, each day there are more troubling revelations that make clear that senior-level Trump officials had undisclosed contact with Russian officials about the campaign, perhaps, the transition, and about sanctions. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was fired after only 3 weeks on the job for lying about this very thing to the Vice President of the United Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from any Russian probe because of compromised testimony at his nomination hearing. FBI Director James Comey confirmed an investigation into the Trump campaign's possible collusion with Russian officials.  What has been the most visible reaction from my friends on the other side of the aisle in this Congress?  The frenetic behavior of the Intelligence Committee chairman that has seemingly compromised the committee's ability to investigate.  This ought not to be about partisan politics. It ought to be about restoring congressional independence and integrity, one of our most cherished democratic institutions; in fact, the most cherished, a free election without foreign interference.  So I support Mr.McGovern's potential amendment. I will also oppose the previous question.

Shelby wanted to find a way to honor the men and women who put their lives on the line for our safety: our veterans.Specifically, she wanted to help those veterans who suffer from posttraumatic stress.  After learning about the Arkansas Veterans Hospital posttraumatic stress disorder program, Shelby began to talk with anyonewho would listen about the program--friends and family, her church congregation, civic clubs, and other organizations acrossWarren and Bradley She told them about her passion for helping veterans, the good work this program does, and how muchit would benefit from additional support.

1374,topic-id,893,"Mr.President, I would like to take a moment to recognize my constituents, Brian and Joanne Leber, of Leber Jeweler in Chicago, A third-generation, family-owned business first established in 1921, Brian and his wife, Joanne, are dedicated to socially conscious and eco-friendly fine jewelry. Leber Jeweler has been instrumental in not only serving as a model for responsible and ethical sourcing in the jewelry industry, but Brian and Joanne also have a deep history of activism and philanthropy, advocating for important policies that support human rights.  In 1999, Brian and Joanne developed and launched Earthwise Leber Jeweler was the first company in the United States to use conflict-free Canadian diamonds, and the landmark collection also utilizes fairly traded gemstones and recycled precious metals, all sourced, mined, designed, and produced with concerns for both the environment and fair-labor standards.  Brian and Joanne also have been notable advocates for laws related to the responsible sourcing of precious stones and metals, including of rubies and jadeite from Burma and gold and tungsten from the Democratic Republic of In 2007, Brian testified before Congress in support of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, and in 2009, he advocated for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Kimberley Process for its human rights abuses in the Marange diamond fields. Then, in 2010, Brian supported efforts to pass bipartisan legislation that would create a mechanism to enhance transparency in the sourcing of conflict minerals and help American consumers and investors make informed decisions.  I have had the privilege of traveling to the Democratic Republic of Congo twice, in 2005 and 2010. It is a nation of breathtaking natural beauty, but like too many others, it has suffered from the paradox of the resource curse. Despite being rich in natural resources that should seemingly promote growth and development, the Democratic Republic of Congo has faced decades of weak governance, poverty, and incomprehensible violence. And fueling much of the violence, at least in part, has been the contest for control of these resources and their trading routes. Sadly, this violence had coined a dubious distinction for eastern Congo, known as the Rape Capital of the  I have seen firsthand the efforts of people like Jo Lusi and Denis Mukwege, who founded the HEAL Africa Hospital and the Panzi Hospital, respectively, restoring health and dignity to the survivors of sexual violence. When I chaired the first-ever hearing in the U.Senate about the uses of rape as a weapon of war in 2008, Mukwege stressed the importance of not just treating the consequences of sexual violence in the Congo, but addressing the root causes.[[Page S1474]]  Most people probably don't realize that the products we use and wear every day, from automobiles to our cell phones and even our wedding rings, may use one of these minerals and that there is a very real possibility it was mined using forced labor from an area of great violence. In 2009, I joined with then-Senators Brownback and Feingold--a Republican and a Democrat--along with then-Congressman Jim McDermott, to pass bipartisan legislation that would help stem the flow of proceeds from illegally mined minerals to those perpetuating such violence. For the first time, companies registered in the United States were required to report in U.Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures any usage in their products of a small list of key minerals from the Congo or neighboring countries. Companies also had to include information showing steps taken, if any, to ensure the minerals are legitimately mined and sourced and that, by responsibly sourcing these minerals, they are not contributing to the region's violence. It wasn't a ban, but a transparency measure aimed at giving consumers choice and fostering a cleaner supply chain.  It took time for the SEC to thoughtfully craft the rule for this simple and reasonable law, and disappointingly, as is increasingly too often the case with the rulemaking process, some tried to gut the law in court, but its core provisions have been repeatedly upheld.  A look since then at the filings submitted to the SEC indicates that some companies had already been leaders on this for years--Apple Inc., Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc., KEMET Corporation, just to name a few. Leber Jeweler has been a trailblazer in its own right from the start as well.  It has been 7 years since passage, and we are seeing this law make a difference. According to the nongovernmental organization the Enough Project, an expert on the issue, more than 70 percent of the world's smelters and refiners for tin, tungsten, tantalum, or gold have now passed third-party conflict-free audits. In addition, the International Peace Information Service found that, as of 2016, more than three-quarters of tin, tantalum, and tungsten miners in eastern Congo are working in mines where no armed group involvement has been reported.  There is new concern today that the President may sign an Executive order suspending this simple reporting requirement; and yet many companies have come out in support of its continuation, including Brain and Joanne of Leber Jeweler  I am grateful to Brian and Joanne, for their support and advocacy on this important cause. They and others like them in the industry have been stalwart advocates for the responsible sourcing of minerals, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on ways to stem the horrific violence in the Democratic Republic of                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-28-pt1-PgS1473-2.txt,326,PROVIDING FOR EXCEPTION TO LIMITATIONAGAINST APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS AS,2017.0,28.0,January

1426,topic-id,2539,"Mr.Speaker, as the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I join with my colleagues. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.Castro), who is a valued member of our committee, for his leadership on this critical issue, and also the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.Sires). I agree with everything that they have said heretofore about these draconian cuts.  I am here because I am rising to strongly reject the Trump Administration's draconian cuts to the International Affairs Now 2\1/2\ months into the Trump Administration, I find myself deeply troubled by the direction American foreign policy is heading on many fronts. I was particularly shocked when the White House released its fiscal year 2018 budget calling for a 31 percent cut to American diplomacy and development efforts.  In my view, cutting the International Affairs Budget by even a fraction of that amount would be devastating. We haven't seen many details, but a cut that drastic would surely mean that too many efforts and initiatives that do so much good would wind up on the chopping block.  Here is the bottom line: Slashing diplomacy and development puts American lives at risk. If we no longer have diplomacy and development tools to meet international challenges, what does that leave? It leaves the military.  Now, don't get me wrong. I have always supported a strong national defense, and I do support our military, and I do support giving them more money. But I also support using military force only as a measure of last resort. We should not send American servicemembers into harm's way unless we have exhausted every other option. If we are not investing in diplomacy and development, we aren't even giving these other options a chance.  We rely on diplomacy to resolve conflicts across negotiating tables at multilateral gatherings and in quiet corners so that we don't need to resolve them down the line on the battlefield. Our diplomats work to strengthen old alliances and build new bridges of friendship and shared understanding.  Just last week, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing on the[[Page H2688]]Trump Administration's efforts to decimate our International Affairs In his testimony at the hearing, former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said that morale at the State Department is ``at its lowest point in my memory.''  It is deeply disturbing to hear that our diplomats, many of whom serve in dangerous places at high risk to themselves and their families, are so disheartened.  Of course it is not just former diplomats who reject these cuts. A recent letter signed by more than 120 retired generals and admirals to House and Senate leadership said: ``We urge you to ensure that resources for the International Affairs Budget keep pace with the growing global threats and opportunities we face. Now is not the time to retreat.''  Mr.Speaker, I include their letter in the Record in its entirety.                                                February 27, 2017.     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House,     House of     Nancy Pelosi,     Minority Leader,     House of     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader,     U.    Chuck Schumer,     Minority Leader,     U.      Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Majority Leader      McConnell, and Minority Leader Schumer: As you and your      colleagues address the federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018.      we write as retired three and four star flag and general      officers from all branches of the armed services to share our      strong conviction that elevating and strengthening diplomacy      and development alongside defense are critical to keeping      America safe.       We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises      our nation faces do not have military solutions alone--from      confronting violent extremist groups like ISIS in the Middle      East and North Africa to preventing pandemics like Ebola and      stabilizing weak and fragile states that can lead to greater      instability. There are 65 million displaced people today. the      most since World War II, with consequences including refugee      flows that are threatening America's strategic allies in      Israel, Jordan, Turkey, and       The State USAID, Millennium Challenge      Corporation, Peace Corps and other development agencies are      critical to preventing conflict and reducing the need to put      our men and women in uniform in harm's way. As Secretary      James Mattis said while Commander of U.Central Command,      ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need      to buy more ammunition.'' The military will lead the fight      against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong      civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of      extremism--lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice, and      hopelessness.       We recognize that America's strategic investments in      diplomacy and development--like all of U.investments--must      be effective and accountable. Significant reforms have been      undertaken since 9/11, many of which have been embodied in      recent legislation in Congress with strong bipartisan      support--on human trafficking, the rights of women and girls.      trade and energy in Africa, wildlife trafficking. water. food      security. and transparency and accountability.

1427,topic-id,625,"Mr.Speaker, in 2013, Secretary of Defense Mattis similarly said: ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately. So I think it's a cost benefit ratio. The more that we put into the State Department's diplomacy, hopefully the less we have to put into a military budget as we deal with the outcome of an apparent American withdrawal from the international scene.''  That is from Secretary of Defense I couldn't agree with him more.  Now, I believe that development helps to lift countries and communities up today so they can become strong partners on the global stage tomorrow. A lot of us think we have a moral obligation to help cure disease, improve access to education, and advance human rights. But even if it were not the right thing to do, it would be the smart thing to do because those efforts lead to greater stability, more responsive governments, and stronger rule of law--populations that share our values and priorities. Poverty and lack of opportunity, on the other hand, provide fertile ground for those who mean us harm.  All these efforts, by the way, cost cents on the dollar compared to military engagement. People think international affairs and foreign aid are a massive chunk of the Federal budget, but the chart right over here next to me shows how it actually stacks up: 1.4 percent. And we make that sliver of the pie even smaller. It will come back on us in spades. 1.4 percent of our Federal budget goes to all these programs.  The diseases we don't combat will reach our shores; the communities on which we turn or backs may be the next generation of people who mean us[[Page H2690]]harm; and the conflicts we fail to defuse may well grow into the wars we need to fight later at a much higher cost in terms of American blood and treasure. Just imagine having to tell the parents of a young American soldier that their son or daughter was killed in battle because we weren't willing to spend the tiny sums needed to prevent the conflict.  Finally, let me say that the American people don't want to see us slash diplomacy and development. In fact, recent data shows that 72 percent of Americans believe the country should play a leading global role. Nearly 6 in 10 believe funding levels at the State Department should stay the same or increase.  Fortunately, the Congress is a coequal branch of government. I want to the remind the executive branch of that. We in Congress decide how much to invest in our international affairs, not the White  For example, regardless of how this administration is playing footsie with Vladimir Putin, Congress will devote resources to push back against the Kremlin's efforts to spread disinformation and destabilize our allies, just like they did to the United States during last year's election campaign.  I am hopeful that, as we move forward with next year's spending bills, we continue to provide our diplomatic and development efforts the support they need and the support they have received under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike.  With the President's proposed cuts, I fear what message we are sending to the world. The United States is the global standard bearer for freedom, justice, and democracy. If we cede our role as a global leader, make no mistake, someone will step into the void. It could very well be another power that doesn't share our values or our interests. Think Russia or some country like that.  We cannot allow that to happen. I am committed to ensuring it doesn't, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to firmly reject President Trump's cuts.

1428,topic-id,92,"Mr.Speaker, I couldn't agree with him more. And, you know, it is especially interesting since, during the campaign, President Trump attacked the previous administration for not being strong enough, for not showing American presence. And now with this cut, with this proposed 31 percent cut, I couldn't think of anything that would make us weaker or make us unable to do what we need to do.                              {time}  1845  So I hope the President remembers what he said during the campaign and acts accordingly so that these massive cuts can be taken away.

1430,topic-id,239,"I would add that we give foreign aid, and it is good for those countries, but it is also good for us. It also helps us. If there is a drug problem in Central America, it inevitably comes up to our border.  If there is some problem with some developing country, say, we have a disease that could--Ebola or something like that, and we give money to help eradicate it, well, that will prevent Ebola from coming into the United So it is really a win-win situation.  Again, if we are going to be the leaders of the world, certainly of the free world, and we want other countries to follow our lead, well, if you are a leader, you have to lead. What we are doing is in our own best interests, not only just in the other countries' best interests.  I think it is important to say that. And it is important to, again, say, 1 percent--1.4 percent of our total budget is all the foreign aid and all the money that we give in terms of eradicating diseases, in terms of crime, in terms of everything that is actually very important to us as well. The American people think it is much higher, but it is not.  So if you take the President's slashing of it, it would virtually make all of this impossible to do.

That kind of talk worries me because it is our alliances that are the pillar of our foreign policy and the strength of the United States and our alliances which have worked so well since World War  So if we denigrate our alliances, and then we cut funding for all these programs that help various countries so we can be a leader by about a third, that doesn't say much for a robust foreign policy.

1471,topic-id,648,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor as we have just filed a resolution--a bill actually--with 26 cosponsors that would repeal the immigration ban placed by President President Trump's Muslim ban is unnecessary, it is unconstitutional, and it is un-It should be repealed immediately.  The Executive order prohibits individuals from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen from entering the country. It even bars relatives of Americans from visiting. The order suspends the entire U.refugee program, and most egregiously, Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely unless they are These provisions are not what America is all about.  First, the order is unnecessary. Individuals from the 7 targeted countries and 150 other nations are already thoroughly screened. Visitors fill out visa applications. They submit photographs that run through biometric databases. Their personal information is reviewed, including names, addresses, and dates of birth. They are interviewed at a U.consulate. The process could take months to complete and eliminates the need for the travel ban.  In addition, the move to ban refugees has no legitimate national security reason because these refugees undergo an even more thorough screening process that can take up to 2 years to complete. The vast majority of refugees are women and children who have experienced the absolute worst of humanity.  Let's not forget the heart-wrenching image of the small body of Aylan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy, washed up on a beach, dead. I will never forget this small boy in his short pants, his shoes, and his socks, lying on that beach. To turn away women and children and men in their time of dire need is not what this Nation is all about.  Let me make this point: The poor execution of this Executive order has resulted in chaos and confusion. It is unclear whether the Justice Department or Homeland Security had any input. There seems to have been a disagreement about whether it would apply to green card holders. There was confusion about whether it applies to[[Page S492]]individuals already in transit or approved for travel. Even airport directors--I have spoken directly with the directors of Los Angeles International and San Francisco International, and there was confusion about how it applies. Even airport directors were left in the dark about how many people were detained and who they were.  Sara Yarjani was one Californian caught up in this mess. She is an Iranian national studying at the California Institute for Human Science in San Diego under a valid student visa. After being detained at LAX for 23 hours, she was sent back to Europe, a clear violation of the nationwide stay against the order. What I am saying is that the court stay was actually violated. This is just one of more than 100 stories from the weekend.  I believe this order is also unconstitutional. The First Amendment prohibits government from establishing a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The order violates this First Amendment by targeting Muslims and favoring The order may also violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which forbids the government from burdening the person's exercise of religion. The law bars any discrimination based on national origin in the issuance of a visa.  Finally, detaining people at airports may violate their Fourth Amendment rights.  This was an ill-considered overreach, as the courts showed over the weekend, and it should be repealed.  So the bill that 27 of us are introducing rescinds the President's Executive order. The text is simple because the message is simple: We won't stand for these types of actions.  In conclusion, I would like to say that I am so proud of the peaceful demonstrations we saw, and I join those who are so passionate about the free exercise of religion and free speech. These are our values, Mr.President, as a nation, and I will be right there with you if anyone tries to violate them.                                 ______                                       By ",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS491.txt,1332,1845,2017.0,30.0,January
1487,topic-id,768,"Mr.President, today I wish to express my disappointment in today's vote on H.67 and my strong opposition to H.66. These resolutions overturn rules issued by the Department of Labor that are essential to providing increased access to retirement savings programs at the city and State levels.  Among all working families in America ages 32 to 61, the median family in America had only $5,000 saved in 2013. This indicates to me that we are clearly facing a retirement savings crisis.  In California, 7.5 million workers don't have access to a retirement savings plan through their jobs, including 3.4 million women. Of those without a workplace retirement savings plan, almost 5 million are individuals of Color, and over 3.5 million are  The good news is that, when a person has access to a retirement savings program through their workplace, they are 15 times more likely to save for retirement.  In California, legislators have been working for more than 4 years to create the Secure Choice program as a way of addressing the retirement crisis we face. This program allows workers to easily save for retirement through a deduction made directly from their paycheck.  Those who need access to a workplace retirement program the most, individuals with lower incomes, are far less likely to have that access. These are the people who stand to gain the most from the Secure Choice program and lose the most by Congress halting its progress.  Let me share some examples of the people who would be impacted. Most eligible employees work for small businesses that might not be able to offer retirement savings plans on their own, and nearly half of eligible workers work in the retail, hospitality, healthcare, and manufacturing industries.  This program supports lower- and middle-class workers by providing access to the tools they need to control their financial future. The average wage of workers eligible for this program is $35,000, and 80 percent of eligible workers earn less than $50,000.  We are facing a time of deep income inequality and must stand up for programs that support the middle class, like Secure Nationwide, the bottom 90 percent of households have seen their income drop compared to what it was in 1970. Meanwhile, the top 1 percent has seen their household income triple.  As workers struggle to make ends meet, it is appalling to me that Congress would actively take away a key resource for financial planning.  Californians want to ensure that all employees have access to a retirement savings program. The Department of Labor's State rule clears the way for California to set up programs like Secure Choice by clarifying employers' obligations to the accounts.  This rule would also help small businesses compete for qualified workers who expect and deserve access to a workplace retirement savings program. Small Business California supports the Department of Labor's rule paving the way for these programs and opposes this resolution.  Finally, in California, our State chapter of the Chamber of Commerce specifically asked for an opinion from[[Page S2149]]the Department of Labor on employer obligations. Once the Department of Labor's rule was issued, CalChamber no longer opposed the California bill.  In fact, the legislation that passed in California requires the State board to report a finalized rule from the Department of Overturning the Department of Labor's rule completely ignores the effort and care taken in California to craft a program that works for both employees and employers.  Nationally, almost half of working-age households do not have retirement savings accounts, and 55 million people don't have access to a workplace retirement plan. This is shocking.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the median retirement account savings for families ages 56 to 61 was only $17,000 in 2013. This is only slightly higher than the 2016 poverty threshold for a household of two people aged 65 and older.

1308,topic-id,1468,"Mr.President, I rise this afternoon to discuss a true American value: equal pay for equal work. This is something that we all believe in, and tomorrow is National Equal Pay It is a meaningful reminder that equal pay remains among the challenges before us.  Women make the world work. We are breadwinners for our families. We are also financial planners, nurses, and teachers. We have always been a powerful force, and our progress has been hard-earned.  Women today are managers, entrepreneurs, public servants, and CEOs, and our country is stronger for it. But despite these great strides, there is more work to do to encourage prosperity for America's families.  For nearly 4 years in this body, I have led discussions about equal pay. I am encouraged by the interest from the White House on addressing the workplace challenges that women face today. To that end, I have reintroduced a proposal I believe will make a real difference for families. It is called the Workplace Advancement  The idea behind it is fairly universal and straightforward: equal pay through empowerment. The bill aims to empower employees--especially women--with information about wages so they can be informed advocates for their compensation. When it comes to discussing wages in the workplace, sometimes it can hurt to ask. A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their compensation compares to others. The Workplace Advancement Act would lift that fear, free up information, and create a more transparent workplace.  A simple principle is at play here. When workers, especially women, have more information, they can more confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements. Knowledge is power. With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. For example, they might be willing to accept less pay if they can have Fridays free for doctors' appointments or family time or simply as a day for self-care.  The Workplace Advancement Act contains language similar to an Executive order that President Obama issued in 2014. Many congressional Democrats requested this action, which is actually more limited in scope than my legislation. Some even praised it. Senator Heinrich called the action ``a critical step to ensure that every woman has a fair shot at fairness and economic success.'' Congresswoman Susan Davis of California said the action was a ``historic step forward.''  Importantly, for employers, the Workplace Advancement Act would not impose new Federal regulations, and no employer would be compelled to disclose salary information. It simply prevents retaliatory action against employees who ask after it.  Fifty-three Republicans and five Democrats in the Senate supported a version of the Workplace Advancement Act last With bipartisan support like this, this bill is possible.  Let's take advantage of this rare moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward solution. Let's come together so we can look families in the eye and say: We heard you. We have heard you on this issue, and we are going to take action on it.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr.Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                   Recognition of the Majority Leader  The majority leader is recognized.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.Mr.President, this week is an important one for the American people, for the Supreme Court, and for the The Judiciary Committee just reported out Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination--the next step in considering the Supreme Court nominee before the full It was unfortunate to see our Democratic colleagues on the committee break with recent precedent and not support this clearly well-qualified and widely respected Supreme Court nominee.  I would remind colleagues that in addition to simply agreeing to an up-or-down vote on their nominations on the Senate floor, Republicans offered each of the last four first-term Supreme Court nominees of Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama at least some bipartisan support in the committee votes. Judge Gorsuch is no less qualified than those four nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama, and it is disappointing he didn't get the same bipartisan support in the committee today.  It now seems apparent that this well-qualified and widely respected judge will be subject to the first successful partisan filibuster in the history of the Senate--the first successful partisan filibuster in the history of the This is a new low but not entirely surprising given that the Democratic leader announced before the nomination was even made that it was hard for him to imagine a nominee this President would nominate whom he could support. He even went so far as to say that he would be willing to fight the nomination ``tooth and nail'' and might even ``keep the seat open'' in perpetuity. It is not too late for our Democratic colleagues to make the right choice.  This week, the Senate will continue to debate Judge Gorsuch's nomination here on the floor. This is a matter of great importance, which is why we are planning to dedicate this week's floor time almost entirely to continued robust debate of this nomination rather than double-tracking it with legislative items, as has been done in the past. Already, several Members from both sides of the aisle have come to the floor day after day to offer their viewpoints on Judge I would encourage Members to take advantage of this time to continue discussing his excellent credentials, judicial background, and broad support from across the political spectrum in our country.  Let me remind colleagues the many ways in which Judge Gorsuch has shown himself to be an outstanding nominee to serve on the High  Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to his current position as a Federal judge. Not a single Democrat opposed him then, including Senators Obama, Clinton, Biden, Leahy, and He has participated in more than 2,700 cases since then. He has been in the majority 99 percent of the time. He has enjoyed the unanimous support of his fellow judges 97 percent of the time.  The American Bar Association--a group the Democratic leader called the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations--awarded him its highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''  He has amassed a wide array of supporters, including Democrats and Republicans, current and former colleagues, the legal community, and editorial boards all across our country. They say Gorsuch is eminently well-qualified. As Judge John Kane, a Carter appointee, put it, ``I'm not sure we could expect better [than Judge Gorsuch], or that better presently exists.''  They say that Gorsuch is independent. Neal Katyal, President Obama's former Acting Solicitor General, said he has ``no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule of law'' because Gorsuch's ``years on the bench reveal a commitment''--a commitment--``to judicial independence.''  They say Gorsuch is fair and impartial. The Denver Post editorial board noted that ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind and talented writer whom observers praise for his ability to apply the law fairly and consistently.'' They went on: ``[W]e appreciate his desire to strictly interpret the Constitution,'' the paper continued, ``based on the intent of our nation's founders, even when those rulings might contradict his personal beliefs.''[[Page S2163]]  They say Gorsuch is highly revered by Democrats and As USA TODAY noted in its editorial endorsing Gorsuch's confirmation just today, ``He has gotten an array of glowing references, including from some Democrats and liberals.'' I mentioned some this morning; there are many more.  Here is just one additional example of how praise for Judge Gorsuch has bridged the political divide: Despite their ideological differences, former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a Democrat, and former Colorado attorney general John Suthers, a Republican, agree that Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed. They said:       Gorsuch's temperament, personal decency and qualifications      are beyond dispute.       It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and      exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he      or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and      will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical      judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.  It reminds us of what David Frederick, a board member of the left-leaning American Constitution Society and longtime Democrat, recently said: ``The Senate should confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no principled reason to vote no.''  ``There is no principled reason to vote no.'' He is absolutely right. So it goes without saying that there is no principled reason to block an up-or-down vote on this supremely qualified nominee, either.  I look forward to joining my Senate colleagues in supporting Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court later this week.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

By the way, I am also looking forward to the investigation into Russia and the sale of such a huge percentage of our uranium by Hillary Clinton's State They approved it. But we will get into that later.  Right now we are talking about a fantastic bill because the EPA is very close to being omniscient, omnipotent, and ubiquitous--they are everywhere all the time. We have had a hard time in the last 20, 30 years as it got more and more heavenly in getting information on why they were making the decisions they were. As the EPA has continued to crush jobs, like in Texas if there were no EPA, we have agencies that have continued to make our water and air cleaner and cleaner every year, and, despite the EPA's constant interference, they are doing a great job.  But one of the things that we have wanted, as my friend, Mr.Woodall, was pointing out for years, is whether it is a Democrat in the White House or a Republican, we just wanted some openness. We wanted to know what these seemingly arbitrary rules were based upon.

It is something I hope will be a bipartisan vote as we require the EPA to just show the basis of what you are doing, and then we can know whether this American god, this EPA, actually has feet of clay or is back in the real world or is actually killing jobs unnecessarily.                              {time}  1300  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2471-5.txt,1801,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1430, HONEST AND OPEN NEW EPA",2017.0,28.0,January
1475,topic-id,3578,"Mr.President, the resolution of disapproval I am introducing today via the Congressional Review Act repeals a Social Security regulation that unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. It also violates the fundamental nature of the Second  The Second Amendment recognizes the God-given right to self-defense. In order to take away that right, the government must have a compelling interest. Furthermore, the law of regulation to achieve that compelling interest must be narrowly tailored. In other words, the government better have one heck of a good reason for going against the Second  The Justice Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Social Security Administration have not protected Second Amendment rights adequately under the previous administration. Our fundamental Second Amendment rights were constantly under attack.  For example, hundreds of thousands of veterans have been reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without due process. Of course, that system amounts to a national gun ban list for those reported erroneously. Veterans were reported without first having a neutral authority find them to be a danger to self or others and thus have a legitimate right to deny them their Second Amendment rights. According to the government, the veterans needed a fiduciary to manage benefit payments. That is not a sufficient reason under the law. Needing help with your finances--simply needing that help--should not mean you have surrendered your fundamental right of self-defense, and it doesn't mean that you are a danger to the public.  On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be a danger before reporting their name to the[[Page S495]]gun ban list. During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted that the list was broader than it should have been. Senator Durbin said: ``Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names goes too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far.''  For the record, there were 260,381 names from the Veterans' Administration sent to the gun ban list for allegedly being in the ``mental defective'' category. Now, it just happens that this was 98.8 percent of all the names in that category. So the Veterans' Administration reported more names by far than any other agency.  Senator Durbin's staff and mine have met over these issues since that debate. I appreciate and thank Senator Durbin for that outreach, and I want to work together with him to solve these problems for the But now, the Social Security Administration is about to make the same mistake as the Veterans' Administration; that is, unless we stop them right here and right now with this resolution of disapproval. If we don't stop this, it could lead to hundreds of thousands of Social Security recipients being improperly reported to the gun ban list.  At its core, Social Security's new regulation allows the agency to report people to the gun ban list under two circumstances. First, the beneficiary needs to have someone designated to help manage benefit payments. That sounds like the VA; right?  Two, the beneficiary has an affliction based on a broad ``disorders list.'' But the process for designating someone to help a recipient manage Social Security benefits is not a process that is very objective. But the process for designating someone to help a recipient manage their Social Security benefit should be objective.  The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the following last year in testimony about this process that offends us here in the Senate and is the reason of this resolution: ``It's not a scientific decision, it's more of a personal opinion.''  This ``personal opinion'' of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for taking away a person's fundamental Second Amendment right to bear arms.  Further, the second element--the so-called ``disorders list''--is a convoluted mess of afflictions that may or may not cause someone to be considered dangerous. Many of the listed disorders also do not impact gun safety at all. For example, some afflictions deal with anxiety disorders, fear of large crowds, or a lack of self-esteem. The list is complex, the list is long, and the list is not designed to regulate firearms. Rather, the list is designed to regulate whether a person can manage his or her beneficiary payments--in other words, can they handle money.  But here is the essential question that the Federal Government is incapable of answering. If they aren't dangerous, why does the Social Security Administration, like the VA, want to take away their guns?  The National Council on Disability, a nonpartisan and independent Federal agency, has come out against the Social Security Administration's rule and in favor of the repeal that this resolution of disapproval will accomplish. The Council has repeatedly stated its concerns about the agency failing to determine that people are dangerous before reporting their names to the gun ban list.  It has been the National Council on Disability's ``long-held position that restrictions on gun possession and ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to themselves or others.''  The Council has also stated that the rule ``unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a representative payee.''  Another organization, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, a coalition of 100 national disability groups, shares the same concerns about the regulation about which we are having this resolution of disapproval: ``The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.''  With that being said, even the ACLU wrote a letter in opposition to the agency regulation. I ask unanimous consent that these letters, as well as others, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Simply stated, the agency rule uses a massive regulatory net that captures innocent individuals who should be left alone. Just because a person is assigned a fiduciary does not make that person or those persons dangerous. Whenever the government tries to eliminate fundamental constitutional rights, it is required to narrowly tailor its regulatory action so that innocent people are not impacted. The Social Security regulation fails in that regard.  That is why both the National Council on Disability and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities have called specifically for using the Congressional Review Act to repeal the final rule. That is what our introduction of resolution will accomplish.  Constitutional due process is wholly lacking. For example, the agency does not afford a beneficiary a formal hearing before his or her name is reported to the gun ban list.  Now, think about that. The Second Amendment, which recognizes a fundamental constitutional right, is being simply ripped away without a formal dispute process to initially challenge the action. Instead, the beneficiary must wait until their name is already on the gun ban list, and only then can the beneficiary appeal the decision by the grace of the government. This process effectively reverses what should be a burden on the government. The government should not be able to strip a fundamental constitutional right without due process and then place the burden on the citizen to try to restore it.  A hearing should be afforded before the infringement of a fundamental right, not afterward. The burden must be on the government to prove its case. That simply is the American way--our Constitution's way.  The Social Security Administration regulation falsely claims that it requires an adjudication before reporting names to the gun ban list, but there is no hearing afforded to the Social Security recipient before placing a name on the gun ban list. Of course, without a hearing, that process cannot honestly be called an adjudication. In other words, the Social Security Administration is blowing blue smoke when they say that. Without an adjudication, the process violates Federal law.  Here is the kicker. In order for beneficiaries to remove their names from the gun ban list, they have to prove they are not dangerous. Guilty until proven innocent, and the burden is on you to prove your innocence. Any way you look at it, that is totally unfair, a violation of the Constitution, but common sense ought to tell everybody it is just plain wrong.  The Federal Government, under the Obama administration, treated Social Security recipients with contempt and disregard when this rule was put out. With our resolution of disapproval, we can effectively terminate this unconstitutional government regulation, which the new Trump Administration supports. I encourage all of my colleagues to support our efforts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Council on Disability,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.Senate, Washington,     Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,                Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on      behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding      the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)      released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of      the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In      accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned      against implementation of the proposed rule because:       [t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to      manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,      possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not[[Page S496]]     only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with      disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the      stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a      representative payee[.]       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.       NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on      the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of      SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming      it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues      SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and      difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to      beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule      creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long      noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do      the important work it is already charged with doing. With all      due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply      a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to      implement this rule may strain the already scarce      administrative resources available to the agency, further      impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In      this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.

Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of      Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a      Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require      the Social Security Administration to forward the names of      all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a      mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS).       The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the      largest coalition of national organizations working together      to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-     determination, independence, empowerment, integration and      inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all      aspects of society.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights      Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a      letter to the Obama Administration and through the public      comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.

Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington,     Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington,       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law urges you to support      a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' The Center is a      national legal advocacy organization that protects and      advances the rights of adults and children with mental      disabilities.       This rule would require the Social Security Administration      to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance      (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit      recipients who use a representative payee to help manage      their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National      Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).       The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements,      has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate      inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental      disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-     scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the      agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits      applications toward a mission in which the agency has little      expertise.       First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The      National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS      database on the basis of a determination that the person      ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''      as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental      illness, incompetency, condition or disease.'' The      appointment of a representative payee simply does not meet      this standard. It indicates only that the individual needs      help managing benefits received from       Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to      address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,      targeting individuals with representative payees and mental      impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In      doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful      action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts      from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for      gun violence.       Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association      of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important      efforts to promote community integration and employment of      people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people      with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or      services, or from applying for financial and medical      assistance programs.       Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA      without providing any additional resources. Implementation of      the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work      of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to      overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are      waiting for months and years for determinations of their      benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to      make the determinations about safety that it would be called      upon to make as part of the relief process established by the      rule.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President,[[Page S497]]     Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability      policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review      Act to repeal this rule.

1473,topic-id,1652,"Mr.President, we are introducing today a CRA that is kind of interesting. This is something that has only been successful one time.  I think everyone knows that during the past 8 years, under the Obama administration, we have seen thousands, literally thousands of regulations that have come through that have been anti-business, many of them anti-certain businesses, such as the oil and gas industries. It is no secret, the fact that we have had a President, in President Obama, who has had a war on fossil fuels.  It is interesting to me that when I go back to my State of Oklahoma--one reason I go back all the time is because I want to be around real, rational people. Sometimes I get the feeling there really aren't any around here. They ask questions. They will say: Tell me. Explain this to me. In the United States of America, in order to generate power, 89 percent of the power we are generating is either fossil fuels, coal, oil, gas, or nuclear. If we do away with 89 percent of our generation capability, then how do we run the machine called America?  The answer is that we can't. But we don't get those types of questions here. I am sure most of us who go back find that kind of concern, and it is not confined to  I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee during the 8 years--during the time President Obama was in office, and most of the regulations were actually associated with that committee. Many committees have regulations associated with their committees but not nearly as many as Environment and Public An example is the WOTUS regulation. Ask anyone with the American Farm Bureau or anyone who deals with farmers and ranchers, and the 1 problem they have, they will tell you, is nothing that is found on the AgNu Committee; it is the overregulation of the That is one example. The Environment and Public Works Committee is the committee that has the jurisdiction over the EPA--at least we are supposed to.  During the time when WOTUS came through--the water regulation--it has historically always been the States' jurisdiction to handle water issues, not the Federal Government, with the exception of navigable water. I think we all understand that. In fact, there were several liberal Members in the House and Senate who tried to take the word ``navigable'' out of the regulations, and we defeated them every time. The last two who tried to do that were, in fact, defeated in the polls.  We know that in the State of Oklahoma--I should say our farmers know that if you put the Federal Government in charge of water regulations in the western part of Oklahoma, which is an arid part of the State, it would end up being designated as a wetland. Anyway, that is a major concern they had.  Another example of regulation is President Obama's Clean Power We all know how that came about. Way back in 1972, I was one of the bad guys who told the truth about what they were referring to as global warming, saying the world was coming to an end. Even though a lot of the Members of this body didn't join in and agree with me, every time, without exception, they came up with a bill that would do something--such as a cap-and-trade bill, for example--we defeated the bill, and it was continually defeated by an even larger margin as time went by.  President Obama came in, and when he couldn't get the legislation he wanted passed, he tried to do it through regulation. That is what he did with the Clean Power Plan--another rule that was rejected.[[Page S493]]  I only bring up those examples because they are typical regulations that put people out of business that actually came through my committee.  I am here to introduce S.9. This did not come through my committee; it came through a provision that is in the Dodd-Frank bill. Anyone going back to their States and talking to bankers or anyone in the financial industry, when talking about the Dodd-Frank bill, it is an example of the same type of overregulation that takes place on many of the issues that come before my committee.  Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank bill requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop a rule that requires companies to report payments made to a foreign government or the U.Federal Government relating to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, and minerals. That is a requirement which is not found in our committee, but it is found in the committee that handled the Dodd-Frank bill.  While that may not sound all that significant, it strikes at the heart of American competitiveness. It makes public the information of our very best companies on how to win oil and gas deals. It requires companies to disclose and make public highly confidential and commercially sensitive information, and this is information that foreign competitors don't have to provide. Under this regulation, we would be required to provide it. That means that American companies would have to disclose all of the background and sensitive information that companies develop in competing for contracts of some kind having to do with oil and gasoline. It could be with another country, like It could be with individuals over there who are not friendly to the United Countries that don't wish to disclose the details of their commercial deals would now have a strong incentive to go with companies in countries that don't have that burdensome requirement. That is only natural.  To make matters worse, the SEC's rule lacks an exemption for circumstances in which disclosure under 1504 would violate the laws of a country where a U.company is operating. So it leaves U.companies with a choice of complying with U.laws or the laws of foreign countries. That is an impossible position to be in and could put U.employees at risk of criminal prosecution abroad for facilitating the release of this information.  If that weren't enough, the cost of complying with this regulation is enormous. American companies would have to comply, and it could cost millions of dollars. The SEC's estimate of the total compliance cost initially would be up to $700 million. The ongoing compliance costs would be as much as $581 million annually. Those costs would be borne by U.companies, and our competition would not have to do that.  The courts already struck down this rule when it was first developed in August 2012. The DC Federal district court struck down the rule in 2013 because of two substantial errors. Specifically, the Commission had ``misread section 1504 to mandate public disclosure of the reports'' and had arbitrarily declined to provide an exemption for countries that prohibit disclosure.  The new rule, finalized in June of 2016, doesn't look any different. It is the same rule. Even though the SEC was told by the courts that the rule did not reflect congressional intent, they continued to put out a new rule that had the exact same problems as the one the court had vacated. It is the same rule. It is as if the Obama administration was rushing this rule out in hopes that there wouldn't be time or an opportunity for a court or Congress to overturn it. But here we are in the process of overturning it.  Last week President Trump issued an Executive order to reduce the regulatory impact on American businesses. With this CRA, we have an opportunity to effectively participate in that. Our focus should always be America first. As the Congress looks at the competitiveness of American companies, we should not be subjecting our own citizens to lawsuits, and that is exactly what this regulation would do.  By the way, I think we are going to get a lot of CRAs going forward, and I think it is important for people to understand what the CRA is. The CRA is the Congressional Review  There are a lot of liberal people who like to have power concentrated in Washington--like with the WOTUS rule. They would rather have the jurisdiction of the waters of the United States with the Federal Government instead of with State governments. That is human nature. That is not something up for debate. Everybody knows that.  When individuals who are trying to centralize power in Washington go home and hear complaints from people in their States about regulations and overregulation in our society, their response is, well, that is not us, that is some unelected bureaucrat. A CRA forces Members of the Senate and House of Representatives to be held accountable to the people by having to take a position so that they can't go home and say: No, the regulators are doing this. It is interesting because it puts them in a position where, if we pass a CRA--and we are going to pass S.9--this will come before this body and we will have to say yes or no. Should we do away with this rule that everyone back home is opposed to? It forces them to be honest.  I think this is one CRA that many Democrats should be sponsoring and voting for, and I wouldn't be surprised if we are able to get some cosponsors.  Let me add one last point to outline what this is about. Within the Dodd-Frank bill, section 1504 is a requirement on U.companies competing for oil and gas deals throughout the world to disclose to their competition what goes into their bid and how they are putting it together, even when the other side doesn't have to do that.  I look forward to having the opportunity to bring this to the floor as soon as we get our initial 30 signatures on here.

Last week, the Seattle City Council voted unanimously to divest from Wells Fargo, making it the first major city to do so.  Led by Native American and environmental activists, our city made an important statement about the vision that we have for our community and for our world. That vision centralizes both the rights of our native brothers and sisters, and our environment.  Just like it did with the $15 minimum wage, Seattle continues to be a leader and a model for the rest of the country, and activists and cities around the United States have picked up the torch.  We stand united in prioritizing our environment, as it is deeply connected to the health of our communities. Rather than allowing dangerous pipeline projects to continue, putting millions of people at risk, we should be focused on being leaders in the international fight against climate change.  I am committed, Mr.Speaker, to taking every opportunity to protect our resources and fight for a bold alternative energy plan that includes a just transition that creates great union jobs and puts us on a sustainable path forward.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-02-15-pt1-PgH1224-2.txt,99999999999999,"PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1431, EPA SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD",2017.0,15.0,January

1539,topic-id,346,"Mr.Speaker, a few months ago, a woman from my district walked into my office and told me about her daughter, a young lady diagnosed with acute mental illness at just 4 years of age.  A decade later, the stories that that young mom shared would split your heart: stories of countless ER visits, endless fights with insurers and courts,[[Page H2296]]a little girl being boarded at a hospital for 21 days while they searched up and down the East Coast to find a bed where she could stay.  At 14 years old, she has now spent half of her life in residential care. But it was how her mother ended that story that has stuck with me. She looked me in the eyes and told me that: ``Compared to other people I know, we have been lucky.''  Mr.Speaker, that is not luck. This is a mental health system so broken that it is hard to recognize.  And how have our Republican colleagues followed up in response? They have offered a piece of legislation that is one of the largest assaults on our mental health system in recent history.  The GOP repeal bill will remove guaranteed behavioral health coverage for everyone covered under the Medicaid expansion. It will abandon those suffering from substance abuse disorder to fend for themselves in a country ravaged by opioid abuse. It will allow work requirements for care, forcing countless people to somehow choose between getting treatment and keeping their job. It will help insurers further skirt parity laws that require them to treat the mentally ill fairly. It will send out-of-pocket costs soaring for the most vulnerable among us.  Mr.Speaker, one in five Americans today suffer from mental illness. These brave men and women and their families that love them deserve more than the cheap luck of a broken system. They deserve more than the empty rhetoric of a bill that ``might'' cover or ``could'' cover the care that they need. They deserve an ironclad commitment from their government that we will have their back.

1281,topic-id,3311,"Mr.President, I have come to the floor this evening in celebration of an important milestone, but speaking about it actually presents a little bit of a challenge. In our current environment, how do you give a statement about a Secretary of State, a Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, a Russian Ambassador, and an exchange of millions of dollars without making sensational headlines? Well, my answer to that is you tell the story of Alaska and the Treaty of Cession that brought Alaska into our Nation on March 30, 1867, exactly 150 years ago tomorrow.  If we are going to be fair, this story actually begins years before 1867. The United States and Russia had been in discussions over Russia's territorial claims since 1856, but the domestic turmoil and the Civil War in the United States stymied progress. So it wasn't until March 11, 1867, when Edouard de Stoeckl, Russia's Foreign Minister to the United States, met with then-Secretary of State William Seward that discussions really began in earnest.  From that time on, things really picked up speed. Just a few weeks later, on March 29, 1867--150 years ago today--Stoeckl received a cable from Czar Alexander II, approving a deal--a deal that would transfer Russia's interests in North America to the United In my office, I actually have a copy, a replica of the deal that was written, along with the note for $7.2 million. That was the deal, but closing it in time was far from certain.  With work in this Congress rapidly wrapping up ahead of its April adjournment--can you imagine that, actually having an adjournment around this body in April? But that was the way it was 150 years ago. There was little time to complete an agreement and see it ratified, but Secretary Seward was determined, and despite some rather lackluster interest from President Andrew Johnson, he pressed forward with this.  When Ambassador Stoeckl received the cable, he went to Seward's house on Lafayette Square to deliver the news to him. According to the National Archives, Mr.Stoeckl said: ``Tomorrow, if you like, I will come to the department, and we can enter upon the treaty.'' To which Seward replied: ``Why wait until tomorrow, Mr.Stoeckl? Let us make the treaty tonight.''  Secretary Seward was not merely a determined man; he was really a very canny man--canny because before he met Ambassador Stoeckl, he consulted with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who at the time was Charles Sumner of He did this to ensure smooth action by the U.Senate in approving a treaty. In other words--and this is a lesson that all good members of the executive branch should perhaps take to heart--the Secretary consulted with the Congress before taking action.  Conveniently, Senator Sumner and Secretary Seward lived on opposite sides of Lafayette Square from each other, and, according to the National Archives, they were able to meet at Secretary Seward's home. While Senator Sumner made no commitments about the passage of the treaty, he did send a note to Secretary Seward later that evening saying that following its adjournment at noon on Saturday, March 30, ``the Senate would be glad to proceed at once with Executive business'' and consider the treaty. With that, Ambassador Stoeckl and Secretary Seward went to work, crafting the treaty that night and long into the morning, finally putting their signatures to it at 4 a.m. on Saturday, March 30, 1867.  By 10 a.m. that same day, Secretary Seward had met with the Cabinet and with President Johnson to execute a proclamation calling the Senate into special session on Monday, April 1.  It was in Senator Sumner's famous speech to the Senate that day that the word ``Alaska'' was first officially used to describe the new territory. The word ``Alaska'' is Aleut in origin. Traditionally translated as ``mainland,'' it literally means, ``the object toward which the action of the sea is directed.''  It is important that I pause in reciting how Alaska came into the United States, first as a territory and later as a full member of our Union, by recognizing that while Western nations made deals about who ``owned'' the lands and the waters of Alaska, a diverse and vibrant Native people had already lived there for at least 14,000 years. While explorers, scientists, trappers, and settlers had come to Alaska from all over the world, the vast majority of our population were Alaska  Thankfully, after years of wrongful and misguided policies of assimilation, we in Congress now appreciate the incredible history and cultures of Alaska's indigenous peoples and have worked diligently to fulfill our trust responsibilities to them. Today, major landmarks like Denali, which is the highest mountain in North America, are again known by their rightful Native names. Today, Tribes are empowered to provide healthcare and other services to their people, and Federal agencies are required to consult with Alaskan Native Tribes on issues that impact their daily lives.  While we can all wrestle with the inherent challenge created for many by words like ``purchase'' and recognize[[Page S2117]]historical injustice, we must also look at the moment through the eyes of those who played a part--to see the opportunity as they did--so that we may capture it to better inform our future.  Senator Sumner's words remind us that what he, Secretary Seward, and others saw then was a foundation for opportunity, which continues in Alaska to this day. For example, in his remarks, Senator Sumner referenced a communication from the legislature of the Washington Territory to President Andrew Johnson in 1866. He said:       Your memorialists, the Legislative Assembly of Washington      Territory, beg leave to show that abundance of codfish,      halibut, and salmon of excellent quality have been found      along the shores of the Russian possessions. Your      memorialists respectfully request your Excellency to obtain      such rights and privileges of the Government of Russia as      will enable our fishing vessels to visit the ports and      harbors of its possessions to the end that fuel, water, and      provisions may be easily obtained, that our sick and disabled      fishermen may obtain sanitary assistance, together with the      privilege of curing fish and repairing vessels in need of      repair.  Long before my advocacy for Alaska's fisheries here in the United States Senate, long before my warnings about the dangers of genetically modified seafood, Washington and Alaska had a strong connection that was built on the bounty of our oceans. The economic importance of Alaska's fisheries was a prime consideration in America's acquisition of Alaska even then. It was a critical part of our effort to attain Statehood some 50-plus years ago. And today, it has grown into a fundamental element of the Pacific Northwest's economy.  Alaska's seafood industry now creates an estimated 118,000 jobs, $5.8 billion in annual income, and $14.6 billion in economic output nationally. We feed America, and we feed the world, with everything from our cod and our crab to our halibut and our salmon. Alaska's seafood exports alone would rank sixth compared to all other seafood-producing nations--not States, but nations.  Yet fisheries were but a small part of the justification Senator Sumner offered his colleagues at the time. The prime consideration is one that today remains unappreciated by most Senator Sumner stated the following:       The projection of maps is not always calculated to present      an accurate idea of distances. From measurement on a globe it      appears that a voyage from San Francisco to Hong Kong by the      common way of the Sandwich islands, is 7,140 miles, but by      way of the Aleutian islands it is only 6,060 miles, being a      saving of more than one thousand miles, with the enormous      additional advantage of being obliged to carry much less      coal. Of course a voyage from Sitka, or from Puget sound, the      terminus of the North Pacific railroad, would be shorter      still. . . . To unite the east of Asia with the west of      America is the aspiration of commerce now as when the English      navigator recorded his voyage.  Thus said Senator The cession of Alaska secured the Pacific trade route with Asia for And today, that great circle route represents the path that thousands of vessels annually take from ports along the west coast of the United States to Asia and back again. Chances are that the products created through the hard work of Americans in the middle of our country transit through Alaskan waters on their way to  Beyond the economic linkages, Alaska's geography has long been an asset recognized not just by our domestic strategic institutions but also by our enemies. While the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is a day that will live in infamy, the Japanese campaign in the Aleutians has been called the Forgotten Six months after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese bombed Dutch Harbor and occupied Attu and Kiska in the Aleutian Alaska Natives were captured and sent to On May 11, 1943, the United States moved to retake Attu, landing 11,000 troops on the island. Some 1,000 Americans and more than 2,000 Japanese lost their lives in the fighting--the only land battle on American soil during World War  The Japanese attacked the Aleutians for the same reason that Senator Sumner supported the purchase of Alaska--for control of the Pacific transportation routes.  Many historians believe Japanese Admiral Yamamoto launched the attack to protect his nation's northern flank. The United States fought to regain those islands for the very same reason.  Brigadier General William ``Billy'' Mitchell--often called the ``father of the Air Force''--told Congress back in 1935:       I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will      hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic      place in the world.  Most of us in Alaska think that Billy Mitchell was correct.  Just as Alaska straddles the great circle route across the Pacific, it sits at the center of the air crossroads of the world. Ted Stevens International Airport in Anchorage sits halfway between Tokyo and New York City and less than 9\1/2\ hours by air from 90 percent of the industrialized world.  Think about that. Oftentimes we think about Alaska as so remote and so far away, but when you look at that globe and you look at Alaska's geographic position, we are in the center.  The airport is 2 in the United States for landed cargo weight and 6 in the world for cargo throughput. In 2012, 71 percent of all Asia-bound air cargo from the United States and 82 percent of all U.S.-bound air cargo from Asia transited through it.  It is no exaggeration to say that the significance of Alaska to the airborne and maritime trade of the United States likely exceeds even the treaty's biggest boosters' dreams back in 1867.  Alaska's strategic significance is now more important than ever. Our natural resources have provided energy and minerals for our Nation for decades--from the oil on our North Slope to our gold, silver, copper, and other metals. We are a storehouse of just about everything that you can think of and everything that you need in modern society.  We are blessed with an abundance of natural resources. We have committed to harnessing them responsibly. As long as there is an understanding of that here in Washington, DC, we will continue to produce every type of energy and many types of minerals for the good of our  Alaska also remains key to our Nation's defense. North Korea's consistent disregard for international norms and their aggressive attempts to acquire ballistic nuclear capabilities threaten our national security. The investments that we must continue to make in Alaska's missile defense infrastructure are fundamental to our national security interests.  Thanks to my colleagues here in the Senate and the Pentagon's continued recognition of Alaska's strategic importance, we continue to leverage our strategic location for America's national security. The installation of the long-range discrimination radar at Clear, the stationing of F-35s at Eielson, and the continued support for the 425th at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson--or JBER, as we call it--are just some of the critical investments we are making and must continue to make in  Understanding the opportunity of Alaska also means understanding the geography and the environment of our In preparing for this speech, I was struck by a latter part of the communication from the Washington Territorial Legislature to President Andrew Johnson in 1866. It stated:       Your memorialists finally pray your Excellency to supply      such ships as may be spared from the Pacific Naval Fleet in      exploring and surveying the fishing banks known to navigators      to exist along the Pacific Coast from the Cortes Banks to the      Bering Straits, and as in duty bound, your memorialists will      ever pray.  I would be remiss if I didn't note that--historical language aside--this request reads as if it could have been submitted to the Budget Committee by the current delegations from Alaska and  As we prepare to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Treaty of Cession tomorrow, our sesquicentennial, it is important to remind ourselves just how little has changed in our understanding of Alaska--understanding where it is, how far we have come, and how far we have yet to go when it comes to mapping and to charting.  In 2015, a couple of years ago, I had the honor of attending a celebration back home. It was an event where we celebrated a landmark event--that 57 percent of our land in the State had finally been mapped. That is how young a State Alaska really is. Recognizing that we just do not have accurate mapping in the State, it kind of struck me. For what else do we celebrate 50 percent of completion of anything, except[[Page S2118]]for us? We were making some progress, and it was worthy of celebration.  As bad as our basic mapping is, the situation is worse offshore in our waters, in the same places where the Washington Territorial Legislature asked for assistance back in 1866.  So 150 years ago, we were asking for assistance with the charting, but after 150 years, just 2.5 percent of the U.Arctic has been surveyed to modern standards. Just 2.5 percent of the U.Arctic has been surveyed to modern standards. Some 91 percent of the U.Arctic has either not been surveyed at all or relies on lead line readings, many of which were taken prior to the Treaty of Cession in 1867.  We talked to the Coast Guard and continue to hear stories about Captain Cook's voyage up to the north. It was actually a voyage on which a relative of mine, John Gore, was with Captain Cook, and they literally would put lead lines over the side of the ship, drop them down, and then recorded the readings.  Again, 91 percent of the U.Arctic has either not been surveyed or was surveyed with lead lines, and we are still relying on this data.  The U.has been chairing the Arctic Council now for 2 years. As we wrap up our term at the Arctic Council, I fear that we have accomplished much less than I, and many Alaskans, had hoped. It is Alaska that makes the United States an Arctic nation, a fact that was appreciated even at the time this body considered the appropriations for the treaty.  In a letter to the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1868, Joseph Wilson, who was the Commissioner of the General Land Office at the Department of the Interior, relayed the importance of the treaty to the committee, including this:       It gives her [the United States] also a hold upon the coast      of the great circumpolar ocean, the importance of which, as      yet imperfectly appreciated in the country, is awakening very      great interest in England, Denmark, Sweden, France,      and Germany are contemplating and organizing movements      looking to the exploration and occupancy of the      unappropriated northern regions of this continent--movements      which it becomes us to watch with jealousy, and promptly      circumvent.  Think about that statement 150 years ago.  Well, today, Russia, China, India, and a great number of other nations are looking to the Arctic as an emerging region of international significance, and they are seizing the opportunities that we continue to defer there.  I greatly appreciate my colleagues' attention to these issues, particularly the work of my colleague from Maine and the members of the Arctic Caucus, as we work to raise awareness and press administrations to put the same sort of energy and effort into the region that other nations are. They, too, see the importance of the Arctic to our national interest, as Commissioner Wilson did back in 1898.  After noting the importance of the Arctic attributes of Alaska, Commissioner Wilson went on to say:       Judged from this standpoint alone, and supposing the entire      country of Alaska to be a mere polar desert and utterly      uninhabitable, the developments of a very few years will show      that the acquisition of this territory at the stipulated      price is one of the most advantageous arrangements that our      diplomacy ever secured.  Think about those words: $7.2 million and the United States has  So when Commissioner Wilson said that in a few years it would ``show that the acquisition of this territory at the stipulated price is one of the most advantageous arrangements that our diplomacy ever secured,'' I would suggest, President Trump, this was a deal. We got a great deal with  Popular history may refer to ``Seward's folly'' or you hear that when you are reading it in history books, or it is also referred to as America's acquisition of ``Walrussia'' when describing the Treaty of Cession, but that ignores the broad support that the treaty actually had at the time. For example, the editors of the Charleston Daily News Miner recognized this on April 12, 1867:       As that territory is said to contain the highest mountain      in the world, he [Secretary Seward] has provided a fit      pinnacle from which the American Eagle can, when the days of      good feeling come back, spread itself over the immense      country that will then lie peacefully beneath the shadow of      its wings.  Indeed, there was opposition to the Treaty of Two Members of this body even voted against ratifying the treaty, but 37 did vote to ratify. And while the appropriations actually took another year, as appropriations often do, the treaty was largely viewed as a success.  From Alaska's fisheries to its minerals, from its oil and gas resources to its diverse and vibrant cultures, and from its position on important trade routes to its significance to our national security, Alaska's contribution to America has been and continues to be as big as our geography.  We are still a young I was actually born in the Territory of I am just the sixth Senator to have the honor of serving my State in this body. But while we might be young and small in population, we are very, very rich in spirit.  In his speech on this floor, Senator Sumner said: ``Small beginnings, therefore, are no discouragement to me, and I turn with confidence to the future.''  So I stand before the Senate today grateful for the future that Senator Sumner and Secretary Seward saw for Russian They were men of vision who brought a diverse, challenging, rich territory under the wing of the United Alaska, I believe, is better for it and so is  I appreciate the Senate's indulgence to tell a bit of the story of this day in our national experience and would like to close my remarks as Senator Sumner did on this floor nearly 150 years ago today by quoting him.

1294,topic-id,1812,"Mr.Speaker, on Tuesday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 233, providing for consideration of H.1431, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will reform the Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, Science Advisory Board to ensure that it is unbiased and transparent in performing its duties.  The SAB, the Science Advisory Board, was first established by Congress in 1978 and plays a vital role in reviewing the scientific foundation of EPA's regulatory decisions, while also providing critical advice to us here in Congress as well as the The information it reviews is used to justify important policy decisions at the EPA and should be held to the highest standards because it is imperative that the regulated community and the public can have confidence that EPA decisions are grounded, that science should be both reproducible and transparent.  However, shortcomings with the current process have arisen in recent years, including limited public participation, EPA interference with expert advice, potential conflicts of interest, and serious deficiencies with the process to select the board members. Far too often, the SAB's authority has been used by the EPA to silence dissenting scientific views and opinions, rather than promoting the impartiality and fairness that is the cornerstone of unbiased scientific advice.                              {time}  1230  At its inception, the SAB was intended to function independently in order to provide candid advice and guidance to the Yet, if the Agency undermines this autonomy, then the SAB's value to both the EPA and Congress, I believe, is severely diminished.  Mr.Speaker, to address these issues, H.1431 would reform the SAB and reaffirm its independence so the public and regulated entities can have that confidence that sound science is driving policy decisions at the  The bill makes several important reforms to the SAB, such as requiring board members to be qualified experts; disclosing conflicts of interest and sources of bias; and ensuring that the views of members, including the dissenting members, are available to the public. It provides the public with the opportunity to participate in the advisory activities of the board and gives people the ability to view the agency's responses to issues raised by the  Additionally, the bill requires that at least 10 percent of the board is comprised of State, local, and tribal experts; that board members do not participate in advisory activities that involve reviews or evaluations of their own work; and that EPA publicly disclose all board member recusals; and that comments are published in the Federal  So these reforms will improve the existing regulatory process, while also reinvigorating the scientific judgements that are often directly linked to regulatory decisions.  The EPA relies on SAB reviews and studies to support new regulations, new standards, assessments, and other Agency actions. A transparent and accountable Science Advisory Board is critically important and can assure the public that the data that Federal agencies rely on is scientifically sound and unbiased.[[Page H2530]]  This legislation would reinforce that the SAB process is a tool to help policymakers with complex issues, while also preventing the EPA from taking actions that impede the free flow of impartial scientific advice.  Mr.Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of an important measure that will improve the peer review process and ensure sound science is used in the Federal rulemaking process. It is a simple, relatively straightforward bill that will make the SAB more consistent, transparent, and accountable to our bosses, the American people.  Transparency in regulations based on the highest quality science should not be a partisan issue. In the 114th Congress, a nearly identical version of this bill was passed by the House, I am glad to say, with bipartisan support. I hope we can join together again to pass this important bill with support from Members of both sides of the aisle, from both parties.  I urge my colleagues to support this rule as well as the underlying legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr.McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr.I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.Newhouse), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. This is the 23rd closed rule of this short, new Both Democrats and Republicans have been denied the opportunity to amend nearly 60 percent of the legislation that has been brought to the floor through the House Rules  This effort by Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership to halt a fair and open debate in the people's House is outrageous. We are supposed to be a deliberative body where both parties get to deliberate. These Putinesque rules that shut down all debate need to stop. This isn't the  You know, I think Representative Rooney, a Republican, said it best last week: ``I've been in this job for 8 years, and I'm wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that's been something positive, that's been something other than stopping something else from happening.''  Well, Mr.Speaker, today we are considering a piece of legislation that seeks to prevent the EPA from protecting public health and the environment--not exactly positive.  This bill was brought to the Rules Committee in an emergency meeting last night. And let me emphasize that, an emergency meeting.  Mr.Speaker, I think the American people have a pretty good idea of what is and what isn't an emergency. A tree falls on your house, that is an emergency. Your rose bush needs pruning, not an emergency. Timmy fell down a well, that is an emergency. Timmy might stub his toe, not an emergency.  On April 28, the government will run out of money. That is an emergency, even if it is self-inflicted by the And we have no shortage of other actual emergencies that we should be dealing with: a devastating opioid epidemic, crumbling roads and bridges, mounting evidence of Russian meddling in our election, and people being killed every day due to gun violence, not to mention Flint, Michigan, is still dealing with the residual health effects of toxically polluted water.  These are just a few examples of actual emergencies that Congress is doing nothing to address. Instead, the underlying bill, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, is brought to the Rules Committee and to the House floor as an emergency piece of legislation.  As we learned last week, the American people are paying attention to what we do here. They are smart enough to know what an emergency is. And this bill isn't addressing an emergency, Mr.Speaker; it is creating one.  The Science Advisory Board at the EPA provides a way for the Agency to use sound, independent, and objective scientific data to help make their decisions. Science, Mr.Speaker--you may have heard of it--is kind of a big deal.  But this bill won't help the EPA to include more scientists in the decisions. It will force them to include people with potential financial conflicts of interest on the Science Advisory Board so long as they disclose them. I mean, do we really want people on our advisory boards if they could profit from a decision that they are about to make? There is nothing scientific about corruption, and this is exactly what this bill will open the door to.  This bill also limits the participation of scientific experts at the EPA, leading to a disproportionate representation of big business and corporate special interests. Are these really the people we want making decisions about the health of our kids and the policies that should be protecting our environment? Is that what we want?  So what is this bill really about? Well, it is about allowing the Republicans' big corporate cronies a direct route to the decisionmakers at the It is about disrupting the EPA's ability to fairly enforce the rules, hold corporate polluters accountable, and protect our health. It is about undermining scientific fact with political cronyism.  Now, maybe things have changed lately. It has been a while since my last science class. But I am pretty sure there is no step in the scientific method that says consult corporate cronies. The truth is that this Republican majority wants the EPA to base their decisions on fiction, not fact.  Americans can't afford to have the EPA run by people who live in a fantasyland where facts and science don't matter. Our environment and the health of our families are too important.  This law is going to have real-life consequences. It undermines science, hurts the environment, and it helps polluters. We need to allow the EPA to make decisions based on fact. We need to ensure that EPA is always free from financial conflicts, not making decisions based on panels filled with industry insiders like the ones that this bill would create.  Mr.Speaker, this bill defies logic. It defies reason. It defies sanity. It will hurt the people who sent us here, and it will help polluters. Republicans are putting corporate greed ahead of public health, and the American people will be the ones who will suffer. Americans deserve better. We should be fighting on behalf of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, let me tell my Republican friends what I tell first graders that I talk to back in my district in Massachusetts when I go to visit their schools. I usually begin by telling them that science is important. It is a big deal, and it is such a big deal that all our schools teach it. And if you do your homework and if you study hard and you pay attention, you might grow up someday to become a scientist, and scientists are people who dedicate their lives to protecting the health and well-being of people all over the world, and they dedicate their lives to protecting our planet.  Scientists tell us things that are really important. They tell us things like climate change is caused by greenhouse gasses, something my Republican friends continually deny. They tell us that polluted air can give children asthma. They tell us that lead in children's drinking water causes learning problems. They tell us pesticide exposure can cause cancer. These are important things.  We all learned in school, thanks to science, that the Earth orbits around the Sun, that gravity causes this pen to fall when I drop it, that plants turn sunshine into energy, that dinosaurs roamed the Earth millions of years ago.  Mr.Speaker, the first graders I talk to, they get it. They understand the importance of science. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues in this Chamber do not. And I would bet that those first graders understand the importance of making sure that it is scientists who sit on scientific advisory boards and not corporate cronies.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2529-3.txt,2275,ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT,2017.0,29.0,April
1295,topic-id,300,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the gentleman's comments. In fact, some of those comments he was making I thought he was quoting me, or at least quoting parts of my own speech.  Certainly, I agree that the decisions made by the Environmental Protection Agency should be based on fact, not by industry insiders, and that is exactly[[Page H2531]]what this legislation would do. I can't think of any instance where asking for more full public participation as well as transparency is not a positive step, and that is exactly what we are trying to do here.  In reference to the number of closed rules that we have had this year, let me just remind the good gentleman that 15 out of the 23 closed rules were actually the Congressional Review Act, the CRAs that we have been working on. They are prescribed to be a closed rule. That is the nature of a  So I would think that, in the good gentleman's estimation of this bill and all the negative things that could potentially come of it, that we should be able to come to some bipartisan agreement on this, especially considering the political climate that we are in today, the occupant of the White House today, certainly in Republican hands, and I would think our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would be very interested in ensuring an unbiased source of information that comes from the SAB to give to the EPA in making their important decisions. This, I would think, would be a good idea for both sides of the aisle, no matter who is in the White House, and I would agree that it is.

1297,topic-id,522,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As we get back to the bill at hand, I think it is important that there are a lot of important topics out there that people want to touch on, and that is all well and good. Just like my friend from Texas, a fine member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, brought up other bills that are important and that relate to what we are talking about here today, and I think that is important as well.  But I think I see an underlying theme here. We all agree on one thing: we want the EPA to use science. We want public participation. We want and we need transparency.  This is certainly a positive step in a bill, Mr.Speaker, that went through regular order, that was introduced with bipartisan support, that went through the markup process, and that was reported out without amendments, something that this body in the last Congress passed, I believe, in a bipartisan fashion.  Just to underscore the importance of taking this important step--and let me underscore again--no matter which side of the aisle you are on, it is important that we do this because of who you may think is the right person or the wrong person occupying the White House, it is important that the EPA has an unbiased source of information in order for it to make its decisions.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a news release from the American Chemistry          [From the American Chemistry Council, March 9, 2017]        ACC Supports Legislative Efforts To Improve EPA Science       Washington.--The American Chemistry Council (ACC) issued      the following statement in support of the H.1430, the      ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017'' (or      The HONEST Act) introduced by Chairman Lamar Smith (R-TX) and      H.1431 ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017,''      introduced by Congressman Frank Lucus (R-OK).       ``Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory      certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs.

Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory process,      EPA has systematically used its authority to silence      dissenting scientific experts. Rather than promote fairness,      transparency and independence to ensure unbiased scientific      advice, EPA routinely has ignored its own Peer Review      Handbook and silenced dissenting voices on expert panels.

1300,topic-id,1038,"I think we have run to the end of our speakers.  Mr.Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr.Speaker, let me first remind Members that we are asking for a ``no'' vote on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, we will bring up an amendment that will allow the bill that Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings have introduced, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in our 2016 election.  This is the appropriate place to do it because we are blocked in every other way in terms of trying to bring this to the floor, and the Rules Committee is a committee that prioritizes legislation that helps set the agenda, so this ought to be part of it. This anti-science bill can still be debated and voted on. It won't derail that, but it will allow the House to be able to deliberate on this bill that would create a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.                              {time}  1300  This is a big deal. The American people deserve the truth. My Republican colleagues ought to get out of the way and allow this commission to be created so that the American people can actually have some trust in a process that determines the extent to which the Russians interfered in our election.  Again, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.  With regard to the rule that we are debating today, I would again remind everybody that this is a closed rule. There are some Members of this House who have never seen an open rule, ever. I hope that changes because I do think that, again, there ought to be more deliberation here, there ought to be more back and forth. Even ideas that I strongly disagree with on the Republican side, they ought to have the opportunity to come here and be able to present them and we can vote up or down on them.  I think we need to break this pattern of shutting the process down. It is what resulted in the debacle last week with your horrible healthcare bill, the one that only 16 percent of the American people supported. It is pretty hard to get that low, but my friends managed to be able to set a new record on unpopular legislation--so bad that it had to be withdrawn from the floor for consideration.  I would argue it is the closed, authoritarian-like process that produced a lousy bill. If my friends continue to adhere to this closed process, they are going to get more lousy pieces of legislation that are going to do great harm to the American people brought to this floor.  This bill that is before us today, again, has been brought to the floor under this expedited procedure called an emergency provision. It is just being rushed to the floor as an emergency.  This is not an emergency. The opioid crisis is an emergency; the crisis in Flint, Michigan, is an emergency; our crumbling infrastructure is an emergency. There are deficient bridges and roads in every one of our congressional districts. That is an emergency. We need to address that.  Keeping the government open is an emergency. But to say this is an emergency is kind of ridiculous. It is not an emergency. It is kind of like our house is on fire and you are saying: I will get out the hose later, but I need to wash the dishes first.  That is how this kind of fits into what we are doing here today. This doesn't qualify for that.  On the substance of the bill, we have this radical idea that scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory committees, not corporate cronies, not people who are interested in covering up for polluters or doing their bidding. We think experts and scientists ought to sit on scientific advisory boards. That is the radical idea that we have. This bill, unfortunately, undermines that.  What this bill does is threaten public health by stacking advisory boards with industry representatives, and it weakens scientific review. It is that simple. I don't care what your political ideology is, I don't think you want that.  Let me just mention some of the groups that are opposed to this:  The Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Geophysical Union, and the American Lung Association strongly oppose this bill. The American Public Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America oppose this bill. Clean Water Action opposes this bill. Earthjustice, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, Health Care Without Harm, League of Conservation Voters, and the National Medical Association oppose this bill. The Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Union of Concerned Scientists all oppose this bill. The Food Policy Action opposes this bill.  I can go on and on. Every organization that is an advocate for the health and well-being of the American people oppose this bill. We are bringing it up for an up-or-down vote, no amendments, a closed rule, and here we are.  I would just say, Mr.Speaker, again, this is a bad idea. I guess if you are an ally of big corporations or of corporations that engage in pollution, this is a good idea. But if you are interested in protecting the health and well-being of the American people, and the globe, for that matter, this is a bad idea.  As I began, I mentioned that when I speak to first-graders, they understand the importance of science. They get it. They want us to be good stewards of the environment. They want us to protect this planet. They understand the importance of science.  But I am always amazed how many people in this Chamber just don't get it. I find that really sad. I want to give my kids, and someday my grandkids and great grandkids, a future where we respect the environment. When we pass bills like this, it makes that less certain.  Mr.Speaker, I would urge my colleagues again to vote ``no'' on the previous question and, please, in a bipartisan way, reject this lousy piece of legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-29-pt1-PgH2529-3.txt,2275,DON'T CUT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET,2017.0,29.0,January
1301,topic-id,1534,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  This bill is a good idea, and I think the debate that we have had here today underscores the importance of this as we consider this under the rule.  H.1431 addresses problems that have arisen over the years with the Science Advisory Board, and actually would return the Board to its intended purpose--something maybe the gentleman does not agree with--to provide independent expert advice on scientific and technical information.  By modernizing the policies and the procedures of the governing of the SAB, Congress, with this bill, can take[[Page H2534]]critical steps to make sure that the SAB is best equipped to provide that independent, transparent, balanced review and the analyses of the science used that guides the EPA's regulatory decisions.  One key issue that this measure would address is the importance of having regulations that are supported by science and that are reproducible and accessible for peer review, not antiscience, like some people have said. Quite the opposite. We want science. We want good science.  The scientific method demands that the result of scientific studies be capable of replication. This is all the more critical when the information is used to develop and set public policy, which is why the methods and the data used by the EPA and the SAB must be publicly available for purposes of replication and verification. If you don't want public transparency, I guess you should vote ``no'' on this bill.  Mr.Speaker, opponents of the legislation have argued that it makes unnecessary and unproductive changes to the SAB, that it would restrict the ability of scientists to engage on the issues they specialize in, creates new burdens through the public comment and transparency provisions, and weakens the ability of the EPA to use the best available science and data to support its rules and regulations.  I believe that these arguments fail to recognize what this bill actually does accomplish. They seem to ignore the importance of reforming the Federal rulemaking process in a way that ensures sound science is the bedrock on which Federal rules and regulations are built--sound science; is that a radical idea--and that these are not predetermined political agendas.  Unfortunately, the EPA has diluted the Board's credibility by systematically silencing dissenting opinions, ignoring calls for balanced participation, and preventing the Board from responding to congressional reports. Fully 10 percent of the seats on the Board will be filled by State, local, and tribal representatives, improving the balance of that participation.  H.1431 simply encourages greater transparency, debate, and public participation in the Board, which will result in better decisionmaking at the I think that is something everyone should be able to agree on. I don't think public participation is a burden, but, rather, a benefit that improves the relationship and the interaction between Federal regulators and the public.  By strengthening public participation, improving the process for selecting expert advisers, and expanding transparency requirements, this legislation takes critical steps that will improve our regulatory system, while also ensuring that the most qualified and the most capable scientists are free to undertake a balanced and open review of regulatory science.  Mr.Speaker, it is time to update the law. It is time to restore independence to the Science Advisory It is time to strengthen scientific integrity. Science is an invaluable tool that helps policymakers navigate complex issues, yet this resource has been severely diminished if the EPA interferes with expert advice, limits public participation, and fails to disclose potential conflicts of interest.  As President Reagan said in guidance to the EPA: ``The purpose of the Science Advisory Board is to apply the universally accepted principles of scientific peer review to the research conclusions that will form the basis for EPA regulations, a function that must remain above interest group politics.''  Mr.Speaker, I believe H.1431 gets to the heart of President Reagan's point. Greater debate, unbiased scientific advice and independent peer-reviews, and public participation will only result in better decisionmaking at the Federal level. I believe that this is the goal we all share, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, as well as the underlying bill.  The material previously referred to by Mr.McGovern is as follows:          An Amendment to 233 Offered by Mr.McGovern       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on Foreign After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.''

He told us that he depends on the ACA for his medications andtreatments, without which he fears he will die.  Paul lives on an unstable income, and it is only because of the ACA that he is able to afford his treatments. The staffer inmy office who spoke with Paul told me that he could feel the fear in Paul's voice as he listened to Paul's story. Paul isrightly concerned about[[Page H396]]whether he will be able to afford his next urologist appointment and what will happen if he can nolonger pay for his depression medication.  Now, Paul told us that this was the first time that he publicly announced his medical conditions because he wants people tosee the human face on the problem of the ACA repeal. He wants people to know that the ACA is keeping people alive.  Over 20 million people now depend on the They are not empty numbers.

1444,topic-id,2274,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation. First, when the gentleman from Georgia said there were no amendments brought forward on this in the Rules Committee, that is partial truth but not the entire truth.  The entire truth is, when we have a process whereby Members believe that there might be an amendment process, there is something called a call for amendments which is issued. Often our chair, Mr.Sessions, and my friend from Georgia has heard Mr.Sessions come down to the floor and say: We are calling for amendments on this bill. Submit them. The Rules Committee will consider them and allow some of them to advance to the floor. At least you know you have a fair shot.  In this particular case, there was no call for amendments issued, which means, yes, Members could have spun their wheels, and sometimes you feel like a hamster doing that, just running around and not moving anywhere in one of those circles. And if we thought there was any realistic hope that amendments could be included, I, myself, would have been happy to submit one, as would many of my colleagues.  Chairman Smith actually requested a closed rule on this. So, again, the chairman of the committee and the Rules Committee gave every indication that we are not allowing any amendments to this bill; and that is what discourages Members from going through the work of submitting an amendment if they have a good idea what the outcome is already going to be.  So this is a closed rule. This is an antiscience bill. It is another example of how we go around the ability of Members to improve bills and, instead, work in a partisan, smoky, backroom manner where this bill emerges fully formed. The chair of the committee of jurisdiction himself didn't want any amendments or any changes to this rule, and the Rules Committee never called for those amendments.  Now, if the goal of this bill is somehow to increase government transparency, why don't we start with the lawmaking process and have an open rule that allows Democrats and Republicans to improve a bill and offer their best ideas forward? And if they are good ideas, they will be incorporated into the bill. If they are bad ideas and can't command a majority of this body, they will be defeated.  But, unfortunately, these partisan tactics that were seen trying to ram through legislation last week that failed when the Speaker and the President refused to work across the aisle with us on healthcare reform and now on improving the process at the EPA, instead of working with us to improve science, they are seeking to undermine the integrity of the important scientific work done at the Environmental Protection Agency and bury the Environmental Protection Agency in red tape.  The underlying legislation that this rule talks about has a lot of problems, Mr.Speaker, and so many problems, in fact, I won't even be able to talk about them all during my limited time for debate here. Hopefully they will be able to cover some more during the debate on the bill.  The first issue I want to address that is highly problematic with this bill, and it is something that is so important to the American people--liberal, conservative, and moderate--and that is the issue of privacy.  This bill would undermine the privacy of American families in a number of ways. What it would do is prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency, an agency that exists to protect our health, from taking any action unless it is based on data that is fully available to the public. Now, that sounds good, ``fully available to the public.'' But what does that mean?  You see, normally the EPA has relied on peer-reviewed, scientifically valid research to inform its actions. Now that is something that the process of science across the world informs. It is a very important, well-founded process that respects the efforts of scientists everywhere and the diligence of a peer-reviewed process.  Much of these bodies of work utilize personal health information and confidential data which, currently, are legally protected from public disclosure. The EPA identifies the academic papers that it uses in the Federal Register so we have that transparency, but it doesn't release the legally protected private data--participants in studies, health of people--to the general public nor is there any scientific value to that personal information.  The value is in the studies, which are done scientifically and are already made public. This bill would force the EPA to either ignore these valuable studies because they utilize private[[Page H2473]]data or violate Federal law by sharing confidential patient information with the general public. We are talking about everything ranging from Social Security numbers, to whether you got cancer from something you were drinking as a child, to our most intimate health or lifestyle issues that are researched by the agency.  The majority here, the Republicans, are trying to include a provision in the bill that allows personally identifiable information to be redacted prior to the EPA making the information available. I am sure my colleague from Georgia will cite that, but that is woefully inefficient because it has a loophole in that very provision that basically negates that provision in another section by allowing the EPA administrator to allow any person who signs a confidentiality agreement to have access to all the redacted data.  So, again, basically, at the whim of the administrator, they can allow companies and people in there--the information can be put in front of people who have access to it, to use it in any way they want, and that is highly personal information.  Again, whether it is under the coverage of a confidentiality agreement or not, it is shown with unknown partners. This is not the Federal agency itself. This is perhaps even the company that caused the pollution that wants to come in and look at it or just various Americans with prurient interests who want to know intimate health details, and there is effectively no protection for that. It is entirely at the whim of the administrator of the Environmental Protection  So that is an enormous setback for the privacy of American families and a woefully insufficient privacy protection with a loophole that is big enough to drive a truck through. There is not even a numerical limit on the amount of people or corporations that would be allowed access of that data. There could be a blanket permission from the administrator allowing thousands, tens of thousands of people, again, to see the individually identifiable data, including your Social Security Number, including your health details or medical records, including things that affect property value and affect health.  Another major issue with this bill, major fault, is it actually undermines the goal of the Agency itself. The Environmental Protection Agency, which has the congressional mandate to keep our air and water clean, to protect our health, this bill actually does the opposite by burying the Agency under a mountain of red tape and bureaucracy.  This bill removes sound, scientific, objective decisionmaking and replaces it with ridiculous amounts of red tape, adding to the process of regulations, adding to the process of rules, requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to jump through additional bureaucratic hoops to use certain information, and making their entire goal of fulfilling their mission less efficient than if this bill were not the law.  The Environmental Protection Agency already uses a peer-reviewed scientific process. They publish in the Federal Register the reference of the works that they are basing their opinions on, just as the rest of America's scientific community does. This bill undermines the scientific process, is unscientific, and is opposed by so many scientific advocacy organizations, including opposed by the Union of Concerned Scientists who are strongly opposed to this legislation.  Now, on top of the red tape and antiscience aspects of the bill, this would also cost the government $1 billion of EPA funds; that is according to analysis of a very similar bill last These are funds that would be diverted away from protecting our health and safety, which is what they are doing now, toward creating more red tape and bureaucracy for the very agency that the American people entrust with the goal of keeping our air and water clean and the American people healthy.  Look, we all know what this bill is. It is a thinly veiled attack on science, part of the antiscience agenda that we are seeing from the Republican  The budget that the President offered earlier this month cuts science funding to the bone. Enormous setbacks in the very research into lifesaving science in the future that would help improve our quality of life and duration of life and help our economy boom are being devastated under the President's budgets.  Scientific research creates billions of dollars of economic impact and innovation in States like mine, Colorado, and every other Science helps keep us healthy. It keeps crops alive and productive. It keeps our businesses open and keeps America as a global leader in innovation.  I also want to take a moment to highlight that, while this bill is being heard on the floor today, President Trump is signing an executive order that effectively repeals all of the work that the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies have done in the last 8 years to protect our planet from the impacts of climate change.  Unfortunately, while we focus on a bill that forces scientists to not use the best science available, the President has signed an executive order that will essentially begin the repeal process of the Clean Power The Clean Power Plan is a basic requirement for States to bring their emissions down to a sustainable level to protect Americans' health, to reduce the amount of pollution in our air and water, and to reduce the human impact on climate change.  The executive order also, unfortunately, undermines some of the commonsense protections we have with regard to fracking, something that is near and dear to my constituents and people in Colorado, as an area that is impacted by extraction activities.  This repeal, for example, would allow oil and gas companies to hide the chemicals that they use when producing oil and natural gas. Picture that: fracking wells near homes and schools who would no longer have to report what chemicals could potentially be leaking into drinking water or groundwater. How can that possibly further our goal to protect the health and welfare of the American people?  So, at the same time, we have this legislation undermining the scientific process of the Environmental Protection Agency and burying the Environmental Protection Agency under red tape, coordinated the same week with the President's disastrous executive order that will hurt the health of the American people and, ultimately, cost lives.  These are just another step in the undermining of science and the work to improve and protect the health of the people of our country. The Environmental Protection Agency relies on the best science available when developing new standards, and they are fully transparent about posting those scientific studies.  However, because many of the studies that this bill requires would impact legally protected private data, like personal medical records, to reach their findings, the Environmental Protection Agency could even be prohibited from considering that research.  This ridiculous restriction would force the EPA to ignore a lot of relevant information because of the desire of the researchers and the legal imperative of the researchers to protect the private data of the participants, ultimately leading to policies that are ineffective and are not based on sound facts or science.  Mr.Speaker, facts exist. Science and the pursuit of truth is an incredibly important human endeavor, and we can't afford to disregard that quest for truth in the name of a fiction-based reality that we increasingly seem to be headed toward as a nation.  Without sound and strong science, America will fall behind in the world. Americans will--our lifespans will be of lower quality and lower duration, and our economy will be hurt as we cede our leadership role to more forward-looking countries willing to invest in the future.  If this bill had been in place over the last few decades, I am pretty sure that the cloud of smog over Denver, Colorado, would probably still be there. Rivers and lakes across this country would suffer from pollution in a significantly worse way, and that is not the future that the American people want.  If the EPA is prevented from using the best available peer-reviewed research data on air quality, asthma will be causing more attacks and, yes, even deaths of children across our country.  Let's see this legislation for what it is--an attack on science, a giveaway to corporations who benefit from pollution, who don't like the fact that the EPA is using sound silence, who want to create and live in their own fictional[[Page H2474]]reality, where the externalities of their actions somehow don't matter.  We need the truth. The American people deserve the truth. We deserve the benefit of the outcome of the process of objective science, and this bill undermines that by burying the Environmental Protection Agency under immense red tape, while preventing them from using some of the very peer-reviewed studies that would lead to the very best decisionmaking possible to protect the health of the American people.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2471-5.txt,1910,MOTION TO PROCEED TO LEGISLATIVE SESSION,2017.0,28.0,January
1446,topic-id,978,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I have some scoring from the Congressional Budget Office, dated March 11, 2015, that I include into the              H.1030--Secret Science Reform Act of 2015   As ordered reported by the House Committee on Science, Space, and                       Technology on March 3, 2015                                SUMMARY       H.1030 would amend the Environmental Research,      Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1978 to      prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from      proposing, finalizing, or disseminating a ``covered action''      unless all scientific and technical information used to      support that action is publicly available in a manner that is      sufficient for independent analysis and substantial      reproduction of research results. Covered actions would      include assessments of risks, exposure, or hazards; documents      specifying criteria, guidance, standards, or limitations; and      regulations and regulatory impact statements.       Although H.1030 would not require EPA to disseminate any      scientific or technical information that it relies on to      support covered actions, the bill would not prohibit EPA from      doing so. Based on information from EPA, CBO expects that EPA      would spend $250 million annually over the next few years to      ensure the transparency of information and data supporting      some covered actions.       Enacting H.1030 would not affect direct spending or      revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.      H.1030 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT       This legislation would direct EPA to implement H.1030      using up to $1 million a year from amounts authorized to be      appropriated for other activities under current law. Although      H.1030 would not authorize additional appropriations to      implement the requirements of the bill, CBO estimates that      implementing H.1030 would cost about $250 million a year      for the next few years, subject to appropriation of the      necessary amounts. Costs in later years would probably      decline gradually from that level. The additional      discretionary spending would cover the costs of expanding the      scope of EPA studies and related activities such as data      collection and database construction for all of the      information necessary to meet the legislation's requirements.                           BASIS OF ESTIMATE       Under current law, EPA typically spends about $500 million      each year to support research and development activities,      including assessments to determine the potential risk to      public health from environmental contaminants. The number of      studies involved in supporting covered actions depends on the      complexity of the issue being addressed. For example, when      addressing a recent issue with flaring at petroleum      refineries, EPA relied on a dozen scientific studies. In      contrast, when reviewing the National Ambient Air Quality      Standards, the agency relied on thousands of scientific      studies. In total, the agency relies on about 50,000      scientific studies annually to perform its mission--although      some of those studies are used more than once from year to      year.       The costs of implementing H.1030 are uncertain because      it is not clear how EPA would meet the bill's requirements.      Depending on their size and scope, the new activities called      for by the bill would cost between $10,000 and $30,000 for      each scientific study used by the agency. If EPA continued to      rely on as many scientific studies as it has used in recent      years, while increasing the collection and dissemination of      all the technical[[Page H2475]]     information used in such studies as directed by H.1030,      then implementing the bill would cost at least several      hundred million dollars a year. However, EPA could instead      rely on significantly fewer studies each year in support of      its mission, and limit its spending on data collection and      database construction activities to a relatively small      expansion of existing study-related activity; in that      scenario, implementing the bill would be much less costly.       Thus, the costs of implementing H.1030 would ultimately      depend on how EPA adapts to the bill's requirements. (It      would also depend on the availability of appropriated funds      to conduct the additional data collection and database      construction activities and related coordination and      reporting activities under the legislation.) CBO expects that      EPA would modify its practices, at least to some extent, and      would base its future work on fewer scientific studies, and      especially those studies that have easily accessible or      transparent data. Any such modification of EPA practices      would also have to take into consideration the concern that      the quality of the agency's work could be compromised if that      work relies on a significantly smaller collection of      scientific studies; we expect that the agency would seek to      reduce its reliance on numerous studies without sacrificing      the quality of the agency's covered actions related to      research and development.       On balance--recognizing the significant uncertainty      regarding EPA's potential actions under the bill--CBO expects      that the agency would probably cut the number of studies it      relies on by about one-half and that the agency would aim to      limit the costs of new activities required by the bill, such      as data collection, correspondence and coordination with      study authors, construction of a database to house necessary      information, and public dissemination of such information. As      a result, CBO estimates the incremental costs to the agency      would be around $250 million a year initially, subject to      appropriation of the necessary amounts. In our assessment      that figure lies near the middle of a broad range of possible      outcomes under H.1030. CEO expects that the additional      costs to implement the legislation would decline over time as      EPA became more adept and efficient at working with authors      and researchers to ensure that the data used to support      studies are provided in a standardized and replicable form.

Mr.Speaker, the EPA protecting our quality of life, our air, and our water has nothing to do with Heaven or It is based on science.

It really doesn't make any sense to talk about people worshipping the We respect the scientific work of the EPA, and maybe this confusion between faith and science is what is leading to the undermining of the scientific aspects that the EPA reaches their conclusions on.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that shows the strong opposition from those who advocate for our health against this bill. Alliance of Nurses, American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, National Medical Association, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, and others have all signed a letter in opposition to this bill because this bill threatens the health of the American people.                                                   March 27, 2017.       Dear Representative: The undersigned health and medical      organizations are writing to express our opposition to the      EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2017 and the Honest      and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017. Our      organizations are dedicated to saving lives and improving      public health.       Science is the bedrock of sound medical and public health      decision-making. The best science undergirds everything our      organizations do to improve health. Under the Clean Air Act,      EPA has long implemented a transparent and open process for      seeking advice from the medical and scientific community on      standards and measures to meet those standards. Both of these      bills would restrict the input of scientific experts in the      review of complex issues and add undue industry influence      into EPA's decision-making process.       As written, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would      make unneeded and unproductive changes that would:       Restrict the ability of scientists to speak on issues that      include their own expertise;       Block scientists who receive any EPA grants from serving on      the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, despite their having the      expertise and conducted relevant research that earned them      these highly competitive grants;       Prevent the EPA Scientific Advisory Board from making      policy recommendations, even though EPA administrators have      regularly sought their advice in the past;       Add a notice and comment component to all parts of the EPA      Scientific Advisory Board actions, a burdensome and      unnecessary requirement since their reviews of major issues      already include public notice and comment; and       Reallocate membership requirements to increase the      influence of industry representatives on the scientific      advisory panels.       In short, EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act would limit      the voice of scientists, restrict the ability of the Board to      respond to important questions, and increase the influence of      industry in shaping EPA policy. This is not in the best      interest of the American public.       We also have concerns with the HONEST This legislation      would limit the kinds of scientific data EPA can use as it      develops policy to protect the American public from      environmental exposures and permit violation of patient      confidentiality. If enacted, the legislation would:       Allow the EPA administrator to release confidential patient      information to third parties, including industry;       Bolster industry's flawed arguments to discredit research      that documents the adverse health effects of environmental      pollution; and       Impose new standards for the publication and distribution      of scientific research that go beyond the robust, existing      requirements of many scientific journals.       Science, developed by the respected men and women      scientists at colleges and universities across the United      States, has always been the foundation of the nation's      environmental policy. EPA's science-based decision-making      process has saved lives and led to dramatic improvements in      the quality of the air we breathe, the water we drink and the      earth we share. All Americans have benefited from the      research-based scientific advice that scientists have      provided to       Congress should adopt policy that fortifies our scientists,      not bills that undermine the scientific integrity of EPA's      decision-making or give polluters a disproportionate voice in      EPA's policy-setting process.

If the gentleman from Georgia has any evidence that this bill will cost less, I encourage him to bring it forward.  This bill, frankly, would force the EPA to be dishonest, to not use the best available science, and threaten the privacy of the American people.  Our goal should be to help the agencies that we charge with protecting our health to use the best possible science to do the best possible job that they can. We should not be throwing up roadblocks and red tape and bureaucratic mazes that hurt the quality of work and the science that we base our protections on.

That is simply not on the minds of the American people.  What is on the minds of the American people is that we need a full accounting for the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is why we have a bill to create a bipartisan commission to investigate that Russian interference in a manner that has credibility with the American people, that can end this increasingly bizarre spy novel that seems to be unfolding in this city that we are meeting in now, and replace it with investigations and facts and a full accounting for the American people as to what happened and who was involved.

1516,topic-id,2455,"Mr.President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The material follows:          KEELAN DURHAM, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)       Climate change is the most important issue facing our      nation and the biggest challenge our world has ever faced. It      threatens us at the most immediate level--the very land,      water and air that we have called home for thousands of      years. Addressing climate change will require tremendous      policy shifts and changing massive amounts of infrastructure      that we have spent many years and billions of dollars making.      And it will require people and governments to collaborate at      a worldwide level. The United States is the richest most      powerful country in the world. We have achieved this position      in world politics by being a leading force in creating      prosperity and democracy around the world. However, by      achieving this, we have wreaked havoc on the environment at      the expense of the greater world. Now, we have a moral      obligation to to lead the world in implementing strong      policies toward a renewable future. If we fail to address      climate change, both our nation and nations around the globe      will suffer tremendous consequences. According to the      environmental protection agency's (EPA) ``Climate Impacts on      Coastal Areas'', Rising seas alone will cause the United      States to lose a projected 28,800 square miles of land. This      would submerge large parts of fourteen US cities, displace 25      million people, and destroy billions of dollars worth of real      estate. Rising seas would claim beautiful areas all along the      coast such as the beaches of Culebra the multimillion dollar      condos of Malibu or of the beautiful coast of      Outside the United States, small island countries that have      done very little to cause global warming could be wiped of      the face of the planet.       As the richest most powerful country with the oldest, and      arguably the strongest, democracy ever we need to take bold      action and implement strong policies to stop global warming.      There are many things the United States can do to address      climate change. We could put a price on carbon pollution;      this would create a disincentive to use oil and possibly hurt      oil companies profits. We could create strong incentives and      grants for renewable energy; this would make it easier and      cheaper for individuals and businesses to instal renewable      energy like solar or wind. A huge step forward would be to      ban coal mining and oil extractions from public lands--just      this would keep millions of tons of CO2 out of the      atmosphere and greatly help the environment. Merely stopping      all new gas and oil infrastructure in its tracks would be a      huge step in the fight against climate change. There is more      we can do but this would be a start.       Currently the United States has been doing very little to      combat global warming. The Paris Agreements were a step in      the right direction but oil companies still have many members      of congress working for them and with Donald Trump as      president progress will likely will be lost and not made.      This is why we must fight for this issue, and all issues that      we know are important. If we do this, we show the oil      companies and corrupt politicians that this government is for      ``we the people of the United States'' and not ``we the super      huge and super rich corporations of the United States''.      Together we can make huge progress towards a renewable energy      future and towards protecting our environment for future      generations.          MORGEN EDWARDS, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, our country spends more on training      men and women to go to war than what it does on training our      family members and our neighbors to come home. We spend more      money on the military as whole, than what we do our veterans.      Our veterans deserve more benefits through an increased      budget of ten percent, we must reform the VA, and help to put      an end to the 22 veterans who commit suicide a day. To help      put an end to veteran suicide rates, there should be funding      to create a separate organization to solely focus on the      mental health of our veterans, readjusting them to civilian      life, and acting as a twenty-four hour hotline to help      prevent veteran suicide. This should be comprised of experts,      and people who can adequately represent them when it comes to      congress and budgeting.       In order to save our veterans, we first must provide the VA      with a better budget, in order for the VA to provide veterans      with access to benefits. The projected budget for the      president to spend on the VA as of 2017 is 182.3 billion      dollars, and according to the VA this is a ``4.9% increase      over the 2016 enacted level.'' If we increase the budget by      ten percent to start out, than the VA could have more money      to provide our veterans with better benefits, thus helping to      cut down on wait times by employing more qualified      individuals, while helping to provide more options for care      and help to the men and women who need it. According to      Military times ``The average wait time across the system as      of May 15 was 6.89 days for primary care, 10.15 days for      specialty care and 4.4 days for mental health appointments,      according to the report.'' Wait times should be no more than      three to four days, and if at all possible we should try      cutting that down even more, to ensure the safety of our      veterans.       We must train our veterans on how to readjust to civilian      life, help them to find and maintain jobs, help them find      housing and teach them about PTSD and mental health      awareness. We must train them to not be afraid to speak out      about their mental health. Most importantly, we must not send      them away when they seek help, telling them to ``just forget      about it.'' If we have the means to train them to go to war,      than we must take those same means but apply it to training      them to come home. No longer should we send of veterans home      to fend for themselves. If we have the resources to send them      to boot camp to go to war than we have the resources to send      them to boot camp to come home. We should try and expand the      Wounded Warriors Project, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of      America, and American Veterans and their efforts to provide      transition programs.[[Page S488]]         REBECCA GREEN, JOHNSBURY ACADEMY SOPHOMORE (FINALIST)       I believe that one of the most pressing issues that is      facing our nation today is the conservative movement to      remove federal funding from Planned I think that      this is very important, because Planned Parenthood clinics      are key providers not only of family planning services, but      also preventative care, and other important health care      services for low income women and families, and therefore,      defunding this organization would negatively impact access to      healthcare in these vulnerable socioeconomic groups.       The movement to defund Planned Parenthood is centered      primarily on ideological and political reasons surrounding      the pro-life movement and their argument that tax dollars      should not be allowed to support organizations that provide      abortions. Yet, Planned Parenthood data demonstrated that      only 3% of their budget goes to fund abortion, with the rest      of their funds going to contraceptive services (31%), testing      and treatment of STD's (45%), other women's health care      services (14%), and screening and prevention of cancer (7%).      According to a report from the Guttmacher Institute, in 2014,      Planned Parenthood prevented 2.2 million unintended      pregnancies and averted many cases of sexual transmitted      diseases, and cervical and breast cancer through screening      PAP smears and mammograms and HPV tests and vaccinations,      resulting in a net public savings of $13.6 billion, or $7.09      for every public dollar spent. Defunding Planned Parenthood      clinics could therefore have a significant negative impact on      both these health benefits and the health care savings that      come from their services.       An example of the effects of this movement to defund      Planned Parenthood can be seen in the case of Texas, where      cutting federal funding to this organization led to closure      of more than 80 clinics and deprived thousands of low-income      women of highly effective contraceptive methods, resulting in      a drastic increase in the rate of births covered by       In conclusion, Planned Parenthood has created a nationwide      network of clinics that provide a wide breadth of services to      low income women and families who often fall in the gap      between Medicaid and insurance coverage. Efforts to defund      this organization would deprive this vulnerable socio-     economic group from important health care services, and cause      profound negative impact, not just on preventative care and      overall women's health, but on state and national health care      spending.          ABIGAIL HALNON, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)       My fellow Americans, I am humbled and thrilled to be your      president. I believe that the American people are generous,      insightful, and accepting. Our nation gains its power,      strength, and beauty from its diversity. We strive, as a      nation, to be an international leader in perpetuating ideals      of freedom and equality. It is my concern that there are many      acts in this country that violate these fundamental beliefs.       It is important that the United States is a country      recognized as a pioneer of social justice on a worldwide      stage. It is our moral duty to uphold the highest standards      of equality and acceptance. We have made great steps towards      this in recent years. The landmark Supreme Court decision in      2015 of Obergefell v. Hodges upheld the fundamental right to      marry, regardless of sex. We must further prove our nation's      belief in freedom and opportunity by the legislation that we      pass. There is progress yet to be made.       Currently, practicing conversion therapy on gay and      bisexual Americans is widely permitted across the U.This      is a process under which non-heterosexual people are      subjected to various means to reverse their sexual      orientation. Conversion therapy, based on a scientifically      discredited premise, must see an immediate ban. It permits      the means to punish and abuse innocent The vast      majority of these victims are minors. This practice      perpetuates a false and violent belief system that      homosexuality is a mental disease and that a cure must be      sought. It is an obscene violation of the basic human rights      of gay, lesbian, and bisexual It should not be      permitted by law.       Although it receives little public support, only 5 states      have banned conversion therapy on minors. These acts of hate      and misinformation must be outlawed nationwide. It is an      injustice and a crime to subject torture on Americans, most      often minors, who have committed no offense. An immediate      country-wide ban must take place.       We must work to defy all accounts of prejudice based on      sexual orientation and gender identity. The freedom and      mobility of transgender and nonbinary Americans is severely      limited. Their rights and protection are being eroded by      current legislation. A recent law in North Carolina known as      the ``bathroom bill'' allows regulation of bathroom access      for transgender individuals. Legislation that regulates      bathroom use by transgender Americans is an act of hate and      tragic misinformation. Rates of violence or misconduct by      transgender individuals in bathrooms are so unprecedented      that there are virtually no statistics on it. There is no      need for regulation. These laws must immediately be struck      down. These are basic and necessary rights and they must not      be infringed upon. Discriminatory acts based on sexuality and      gender identity have implications outside of their specific      goals. The use of U.law to marginalize any group      perpetuates dangerous and violent beliefs. Our      misunderstanding cannot become rejection. Our fear cannot      manifest into anger.       Americans will not stand for the perpetuation of hate,      fear, and misinformation. We will not reject our neighbors      and our friends. Our country must make these necessary steps      towards true equality.   KARLEY ZIER, MISSISQUOI VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)       Raising the price of minimum wage would benefit everyone      differently, but all in a commendable way. This would give      people on government assistance more of an incentive to      secure a job. It would keep the average family of four from      drowning in debt just to buy groceries for the week.      According to Sherrod Brown, Senator of Ohio, ``Anyone who's      tried to pay a heating bill, fill a prescription, or simply      buy groceries knows all too well that the current minimum      wage does not cut the mustard.'' Sherrod explains exactly how      tough it is to try and survive off from the ongoing minimum      wage price.       Minimum wage in Vermont should be raised for a multitude of      reasons. One way the state could benefit from this would be      the amount of people withdrawing from welfare and other      government funded programs. The state could benefit from this      act because unemployed rates would go down with more people      applying for jobs. Families living off of minimum wage have      barely enough money to meet their basic needs per week or per      month. Someone making minimum wage at $9.60 an hour for eight      hours a day and five days a week will earn $384. Therefore,      one will make $1,536 per month without any taxes being taken      out. According to USA Today, the average cost of groceries      per week for a family of four is $150-$200. The average cost      of rent in Vermont is $900 per month. Being left with $436,      which would be non-existent due to taxes, leaves no room to      pay for other needs or necessities. People wouldn't have      money to pay for phone bills, transportation expenses, or      daycare because one would be working. Someone would not be      able to pay for any of these necessities because of the fact      they wouldn't be able to afford them living off of minimum      wage.       People who are using government assistance programs could      benefit from this because there would be a reason for them to      want to work. If people make the same amount off of welfare      as they are making while working a forty hour job each week,      of course they are going to choose welfare, or other      government assistance programs. There is no incentive for the      people on welfare to want to get a job with the minimum wage      being so low and having to pay for expenses they wouldn't      need to pay for while being unemployed. The other people in      the state could benefit from this by the amount of people      withdrawing from the welfare program. The more people who      withdraw from the system, the less tax money that one say to      pay to fund these types of programs. Overall, those are the      reasons why the minimum wage in Vermont should be      raised.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-30-pt1-PgS487.txt,1010,DON'T CUT INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET,2017.0,30.0,March

1307,topic-id,1774,"Mr.President, first, let me thank my friend and colleague from Nebraska for her indulgence.                 Explosion in Saint Petersburg, Russia  Before I begin, Mr.President, I want to express our concern here in the United States for our friends in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the wake of an explosion on their subway system this morning. Russia has been in the news a lot recently, typically in adversarial terms. Today is a time to remember that, whatever our differences, we wish no ill to the people of any nation. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the Russians who were killed this morning. We wish a swift recovery to the injured and hope the perpetrators are soon brought to justice.                       Nomination of Neil Gorsuch  Mr.President, I rise this afternoon on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, which was just advanced by the Judiciary  This afternoon, it has become clear that Judge Gorsuch does not have the 60 votes that are necessary to end debate on his nomination. So now the focus is shifting away from the issue of whether Judge Gorsuch will get 60 votes on the cloture motion and toward the fundamental question before us: Will the majority leader break the rules of the Senate in order to get Judge Gorsuch on the bench?  My friend, the majority leader, has said several times that Judge Gorsuch will be confirmed by the end of this week one way or another. What he really means when he says that is, if Judge Gorsuch does not earn 60 votes in the Senate, which is now the likely outcome, the Republicans must--underline ``must''--exercise the nuclear option to pass Judge Gorsuch on a simple majority vote.  I think the majority leader reasons that if he says it enough times, folks[[Page S2161]]will start believing it--that he has no choice--but they should not. It is a premise no one should swallow. The majority leader is setting up a false choice of supporting Judge Gorsuch or he will have no choice but to break the rules. Maybe, to the majority leader, the nuclear option is the only option, but there are many alternatives. The majority leader makes up his mind independent of what Democrats do on issue after issue, but on this one, he says he has no choice. Maybe he has no choice because the rightwing of the Republican Party--organizations like the Heritage Foundation--will go after him if he does not, but he certainly has a choice to do the right and courageous thing.  Instead, Republicans are playing the game of ``they started it.'' They say Democrats started this process by changing the rules for lower court nominees in 2013. They fail to mention the history that led to that change. The reason that Majority Leader Reid changed the rules was that Republicans had ramped up the use of the filibuster to historic proportions.  They filibustered 79 nominees in the first 4 years of President Obama's To put that in perspective, prior to President Obama, there were 68 filibusters on nominations under all other Presidents--from George Washington to George Under President Obama, exclusively, in the first 4 years of his administration, Republicans filibustered 79 nominees. They deliberately kept open the DC Court of Appeals because it has such influence over decisions that are made by the government.  We all know the hard-right Federalist Society and the hard-right Heritage Foundation want to limit what government can do. The deal we made in 2005--a group of Senators, the so-called Gang of 14--allowed several of the most conservative jurists in the land to become judges and be confirmed to that circuit court. Yet, when President Obama came in, our Republican colleagues insisted on holding three seats of that court open. They, literally, said that they would not allow the seats to be filled at all by President  Sound familiar? Merrick Garland knows it is.  At the time, I pleaded several times with Senator Alexander, my dear friend from Tennessee, to let us vote on some of the judges for the DC I asked him to go to Senator McConnell and say that the pressure on our side to change the rules after all of these filibusters was going to be large. Let's avoid it, I said. But Senator McConnell said no.  Republicans had refused all of our overtures to break the deadlock that they had imposed. So if the majority leader wants to conduct this partisan ``they started it'' exercise, I am sure we could trace it all the way back to the Burr-Hamilton duel.  The fact is that the Republicans blocked Merrick Garland by using the most unprecedented maneuvers. Now we are likely to block Judge Gorsuch, and that means neither party has gotten its party's choice in the last 2 years.  We can go back and forth and blame each other, but in the recent history of the vacancy caused by Justice Scalia's death, we have both lost. We lost Merrick Garland because of the majority leader's unprecedented blockade, and Republicans will lose on Judge Gorsuch because we are doing something we think is reasonable in asking that he be able to earn 60 votes as so many others have. We think the two are not equivalent, but in either case, we have both lost.  We are back to square one, and Republicans have total freedom of choice in this situation. No one is forcing them to break the rules. They don't have to treat the nuclear option as if it were their first and only option. It is a false choice.  To my friends on the other side, the answer isn't to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee. Presidents of both parties have done so in the past when Supreme Court picks failed to merit confirmation. Again, the answer isn't to change the rules; the answer is to change the nominee.  The majority leader should have the vision and courage to see past this impasse, and I believe he should seriously consider a different option. The President, Senate Republicans, and Democrats should sit down together to come up with a mainstream nominee who can earn bipartisan support. We are willing to meet with them anywhere, anytime to discuss a consensus nominee.  Now, I know my colleagues on the other side will say Judge Gorsuch was a mainstream nominee and Democrats would never support any judge nominated by President We disagree. We probably can't support any nominee whose sole vetting is by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist They were the sole gatekeepers for the Scalia vacancy, and each is well known to be a rightwing, wealthy special interest group dedicated to moving the bench way to the right. Their selection of Judge Gorsuch shows it. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post did analyses done by experts that showed that Judge Gorsuch would be a very, very conservative--many would say rightwing--Justice on the bench. The New York Times said he would be the second most conservative Justice on the bench--second only to Justice Thomas--and more conservative than the late Justice The Washington Post actually said he would be the most conservative Justice on the bench, based on his record--even more conservative than the very, very conservative Justice  In fact, we Democrats have never let special interest groups be the gatekeeper. We have never said to any special interest group, as President Trump did: Give us a list, and we will choose from that list. That is what Republicans did. We have never done it.  In the past, Presidents have done just what we are suggesting for selecting Supreme Court President Bill Clinton sought and took the advice of Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch in nominating Justices Ginsburg and Breyer instead of Bruce President Obama took the advice of Republican Senators when he picked Merrick Garland--a consensus, mainstream nominee.  President Trump, on the other hand, ignored the Senate and only sought the advice and consent of rightwing special interest groups when making Supreme Court picks. He was running. He had to shore up his support on the hard right. So he said: I am outsourcing the entire selection process to two groups--which, again, are not consensus groups. They would admit that themselves--the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Lo and behold, the process didn't produce a nominee who could earn 60 votes. By contrast, Justice Ginsburg earned 93 votes and Justice Breyer earned 87.  So we are offering President Trump and our friends on the other side a way forward. They don't have to break the rules to get a Justice on the bench. They don't have to break the Senate confirmation process, fundamentally weakening the constitutional principle of advice and consent, to get a Justice on the bench. President Trump could simply consult with Members of both parties to try and come up with a consensus nominee who could get approved and meet a 60-vote threshold.  The answer, again, isn't to change the rules. It is to change the nominee.  We Democrats are not going to oppose every Republican nominee. Of course, we realize a nominee selected this way would not completely agree with our views, but Judge Gorsuch is so far out of the mainstream that he isn't able to earn votes to pass the Even Justices Roberts and Alito--two very conservative judges--earned a bunch of Democratic votes, and each got more than 60--one, in his nomination, and the other, 72 votes in the cloture process.  So the Republicans are free actors. They can choose to go nuclear or they can sit down with Democrats and find a way forward that preserves the grand traditions of this body.  The majority leader himself has said the one thing the two leaders have always agreed upon is to protect the integrity of this institution. He continued, and this is a direct quote: ``I think we can stipulate . . . that in the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial matters.''  Mitch McConnell: In the Senate, it takes 60 votes on controversial matters. He has long stood for that proposition for the many years I have been here.  A Supreme Court seat, I believe, meets the majority leader's standard[[Page S2162]]for 60 votes. I hope that instead of crippling the Senate in a partisan way--removing that 60-vote threshold for controversial matters like the Supreme Court--my Republican friends consider the option of working together to find a solution we can both accept. It may seem like a novel concept around here, but that option is always on the table.  I yield the floor.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

1465,topic-id,460,"Finally, Mr.President, I wish to turn to the CBO report that just came out today. The Congressional Budget Office today released a new report outlining the consequences of the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Remember, the CBO is a nonpartisan entity. The numbers don't lie. Try as they might, our Republican colleagues can't discredit them.  The numbers are even worse than experts could have imagined. Repealing the Affordable Care Act will mean tens of millions will lose their health insurance and individuals will see their premiums double. Let me repeat that. If the Republican bill passes--according to CBO, which is nonpartisan--tens of millions will lose their health insurance and individuals will see premiums double. Thirty-two million Americans would lose their health insurance, 18 million within the first year of repeal.  The report makes it crystal clear that the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for millions of Americans and kick millions more off their health insurance. No wonder President-Elect Trump realizes repeal without replace is the real disaster. No wonder he has admonished the Congress not to do plain repeal.  Some Republicans have tried to dismiss the CBO report as meaningless. I would remind my Republican friends of two points. First, this is the CBO Director that Republicans handpicked. This is not some Democratic operative. He is a person who knows numbers, who was chosen by our Republican colleagues. You can't reject his findings.  Second, this is your repeal bill that the CBO is analyzing. They didn't make up the scenario. They took the exact bill we had on the floor and said: What are going to be the consequences? Devastating--over 30 million losing coverage, premiums doubling. All the things that our colleagues are complaining about with ACA are even worse under their bill. Their complaints on ACA are incorrect. We have gained numbers, and costs have gone down. The rate of costs have gone down--much lower than they would be under this report.  I say to my colleagues, this is your repeal bill. The CBO didn't make this up. It looked at the bill you sent to the President's desk, the bill you say your repeal bill will be modeled on. It isn't meaningless. It is your plan.  Now that repeal is real and not just a political exercise, the tide is turning. The American people are becoming roused by the prospects of dismantling health reform and leaving chaos in its wake. This is exactly why Republican Members of Congress are getting an earful back home from constituents who want them to turn back from their dangerous plan to make America sick again. I urge my Republican colleagues to listen to the growing outcry before it is too late.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-17-pt1-PgS324-2.txt,1036,PROVIDING FOR EXCEPTION TO LIMITATIONAGAINST APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS AS,2017.0,17.0,March
1402,topic-id,3337,"Mr.Speaker, tonight I rise in support of describing to each of my colleagues some important attributes of a big issue that we are all working on, and that is about health care. I rise today to talk about not just the current state of health care, but also a direction about where this body has an opportunity and a chance to go to make America's healthcare system even better so that it is the greatest healthcare system in the world.  President Obama signed what is known as ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, into law on March 23, 2010. This was an attempt then by the President and his party, receiving no votes from the Republicans in the House or the Senate, to offer a brand-new vision to the American people of their idea of health care.  It took several years for the American people really to comprehend and understand this undertaking, but we are now in the sixth year of ObamaCare, and it has turned out that it not only is not sustainable, but it has provided millions of people who have lost coverage, higher premiums. It is not uncommon to see where some healthcare providers are raising their rates by 60 percent, and in 2013 alone, 4.7 million Americans had their preferred healthcare system canceled.  So the plan began with the high accolades of President Obama and Democrats, only to see, in its sixth year, it has become a concrete life preserver to many who are not only on the plan, but those who would wish to have their own healthcare coverage and cannot because of this law.  Tonight what I would like to describe to my colleagues is a chance for them to begin understanding that the American people have elected Donald Trump, Republicans, back into the majority, and Republicans back again into the majority in the United States This was done because there were a number of ideas that were made well aware to the voting public that Republicans would have an answer not only to repeal, but to replace the Affordable Care  Republicans, in fact, now that we are in our second or third week of being in the majority, with President Trump taking office last Friday, Republicans have begun working not only with themselves, but with this administration on ideas that will make the replacement of ObamaCare even better for each and every person in this country.  The ability to make this transition, I believe, will require a deliberate and disciplined approach by Members of Congress and the American people for us to listen to each other, for, you see, Republicans do have better ideas to fix health care for all The basis of the understanding about where Republicans will come from, I believe, is embodied in the law as it exists today.  In 1943, employer-sponsored insurance exemption was given. It was during World War It was at a time when there were wages that were frozen but opportunities for benefits to be given to employees that would not be taxed. And so back in 1942, this benefits system arose. Sure, it became an opportunity as a result of being employed. It became an employer benefit. And that is what has taken place today with about 150 million Americans who receive the benefits of pretax contributions not only by their employer, but also by the employee to their healthcare system.  Well, just last December, under the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress made a new change, updating, allowing more[[Page H676]]people in the system, this time small business, allowing small business the opportunity to deduct up to $4,500 per employee, a chance for them to receive their health care on a pretax basis.  What this has established now is a different, unfair system that Mr.Trump was speaking about when he was on the campaign trail. He referred to it as a rigged system. Now, he was not just speaking about the healthcare system. He actually was speaking about much of the way America operates, systems that are not fair for the average American not only to have a shot at making their life better, but in this case, a healthcare system where about 150 million Americans get their health care on a pretax basis and others do not. This is the basis of where I believe Republicans have an opportunity to help make the tax advantage for all Americans available.  So the question is: Who is insured and who is uninsured? Well, we can go to the chart that we see here. About 49 percent of all the people in this country who are insured, health care would be provided by an employer, meaning that an employer most likely is able to offer, as a benefit, a healthcare package on a pretax basis, and the employee is able to receive that, allowing them to make their own contributions on a pretax basis.  As an example, as a Member of Congress, I have this opportunity. My employer, being in the House of Representatives, provides about 70 percent, which is standard for the operations of almost any business in this country, 70 percent, and the employee would provide 30 percent. In this case, I provide the premiums of about $13,000 for my health care.  Then I have a $3,600 deduction under my ObamaCare health insurance that I receive. I am required by law, as a result of being a Member of Congress, to receive, to buy into health care that would be ObamaCare, and then I have a $3,600 deductible that is a pretax contribution. So I make about a $17,000 contribution to my health care every year. Not unusual for employer-provided contributions on a pretax basis.  Medicaid is about 20 percent of all the people who are insured, and then, as you see here, Medicare is about 14 percent.  As you look at Medicaid, Medicaid is what is commonly known as insurance for those people who are at or below the poverty level to gain coverage. But it comes with strict requirements. Many of those requirements work against the opportunity to go and get a job for fear that they will lose their contribution that comes from the government because they might not have an opportunity to receive other help.  Then, as you see, we have got exchanges, and those that just buy their own insurance. And then about 9 percent, or about 30 million Americans, are uninsured.  This is the current status of where we are in America today.  When I say these things to people back in Dallas, Texas, I receive a lot of feedback, and one of them that I have selected comes from a man who is self-employed. He falls under the what might be off exchange, meaning he pays for his own health care without it being on a pretax basis. He said: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur--penalized.  This is true of the 20 percent who are on They are in a system that essentially keeps them there and keeps them from going to gain the opportunity to receive full-time employment because it might not be an employment that provides health care.  So Republicans have a daunting challenge. We have a challenge to understand that there are about 12 to 20 million people who presently are on ObamaCare, including Members of Congress, and it is a very expensive--not only to the country, but also to individuals--insurance plan.  The biggest problem with ObamaCare is not its expense. The problem is that people are not on the system, as we were told would happen. We were told there would be upwards of 40 million people, providing an opportunity for more people to pay into the system, to sustain the system, and for it to be, what I would say, structured in such a way to where it had young people, middle-aged people, and perhaps older people up to Medicare age who would be paying in or be a part of a system--and it didn't work that way.  Younger people are not in ObamaCare because it is tremendously expensive, and they have found that to meet their deductible, it takes thousands and thousands of dollars. It does not meet their needs. It does not meet my needs with my family. It would not be a preferred healthcare choice that I or my family would make.  So we now have a choice, a chance as a result of the American people saying: Okay, Republicans, let's see what you can do. Bring us your ideas to make health care better.  Here is one of the facts that we know. We know that of the family working status of uninsured, 74 percent of people who are uninsured go to work. Now, this is a staggering fact because we were told by President Obama and Democrats that they were going to make sure that people got health care, the working poor, as we were told, people who needed coverage. But, in fact, 74 percent of 30 million people get up and go to work.  What we find is that they have lost, many times, their full-time status because of ObamaCare rules and regulations, mandates on employers to where employers cut their full-time status to part-time workers. Because we have so many part-time workers, they cannot afford to get the payments that are necessary, even though they were above the Medicaid line.  So Republicans now have a choice to be able to say, if we are going to outthink ObamaCare, if we are going to make sure that we believe--as President Trump has said just in the last few weeks and on the trail as he was running, he believes we should have a system that is not rigged. We should have a system that helps cover every single American and creates an opportunity that is sustainable and does not mean that we have 60 percent or even double-digit increases every year in health care because of the inequities that exist in the system.                              {time}  1900  This is the system that exists today.  So what might be one of those options or alternatives?  One of those options or alternatives might be a bill that I have worked on for 2 years, with over 500 physicians from across this country, known as the National Physicians' Council for Healthcare The National Physicians' Council for Healthcare Policy has formally met with hundreds of doctors nine times. They are co-chaired by Marcy Zwelling from Los Angeles, California, and John Gill from Dallas,  We have worked diligently with economists also to put together a plan that matches what President Trump is speaking about, but probably has not had time to fill in all of the rest of the activities.  This is what I would like to tell you. We believe that we should first allow every single American to be a part of a pre-tax credit, an advanceable credit that can be given to every single American to allow them to buy into a nongovernment healthcare system. That means, yes, people who are on Medicaid today can receive their health care and go out and get a job without fear of losing their healthcare coverage. It means that you no longer would have to go to the Federal Government and the IRS and to tell them how much work or how much money you think you will do this next year, and if you guess wrong, to pay differently. It creates a well-understood system, and can be done for the same amount of money that is presently in the system today.  It means that a person, a family, would be able to, effective this next November, go online and go to a database and fill it in. I am from Dallas, I would put my name in, I would put my wife's name, our social security numbers, and our children, and it would allow this pre-tax credit that is advanceable, assignable, and refundable, not coming to me, but going to a healthcare plan that I could then purchase. I could co-purchase, I could put my own money in on a pre-tax basis.  But what it would mean to me, Pete Sessions, is that I would be out of I would choose to be in what is called a health savings account, an A health savings account requires that you have a major medical component with any coverage that you get.  What is major medical?  Major medical is hospitalization, the chance, the risk that you would have of[[Page H677]]needing hospitalization. It could be a car wreck, it could be cancer, it could be something really unexpected. But I would then purchase this major medical policy that is well known in the marketplace today, and then have a choice of deciding the type of coverage where I would pay the first $5,000 that is required. And then after that, based upon the risk that I would choose.  If I were younger, I would choose probably a plan that would be 90/10. That means that I would pay 10 percent beyond what happened after I paid my $5,000. Perhaps I couldn't afford that and would want to move to a 70/30 where I accept more of the risk.  The other component that I would then choose is a health savings account. That is I would take the $17,000 that I contribute to my health care every year, cash, and I would take that to a pre-tax cash account that would be available for me to go to the doctor. Instead of showing up with a card, I would shop the doctor that I choose, only buying the things that I and my family needed, choosing my doctor, and asking my doctor and the marketplace what services would be available for a cash price.  Generally speaking, cash prices are about 18 percent less. Because a doctor would receive that money directly in, rather than having to file a claim, or wait time to get back their money. It would allow my family a chance to receive virtually an 18 percent opportunity upfront savings. It would allow me to manage the things which I needed to and not worry about paying for the things I didn't use. It would save my local doctor, who would then look at me as a preferred customer as opposed to me shopping around, perhaps with others in the marketplace, based upon a model of ObamaCare, which today you can't always count on who your doctor would be. A far better idea. Every single American that would qualify would receive this opportunity, but not required.  Now, how do we make it better, because there is more?  We would, under every single one of these circumstances, take away the mandate on an individual and the mandate on the business. We would do away with the Cadillac tax, because I don't think health care should be taxed. I think everybody should have an opportunity, and the world's greatest healthcare plan would allow that. Every single person would have a chance to have their health care provided, just as I have mine, too.  So what I want to say to the Members today is Republicans are going to be sharing ideas. We are going to be presenting our ideas at the Energy and Commerce Committee, at the Ways and Means Committee, and we believe we have an opportunity under three scenarios to make sure that health care is available and ready for every single  First, we need to establish a Republican alternative that can be implemented this year. Not waiting. Our better idea is ready in a bill ready to go.  Would we do hearings?  Would we want to scrub that and maybe add some things?  We should be ready to do it and make the transition this year. We should use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous parts of mandates. Yes, we should. And I believe we are doing that.  Should we make sure that we replace before we repeal?  And we should allow HHS, under what is today becoming Tom Price, a proud Member of this body, a chairman of the Budget Committee, who is in hearings over in the Senate to be the secretary of Health and Human Services, he should use everything that is available in law today to manage a system and to make it better. But my bet is that he will count on real people, not government, to make these decisions. And in doing so, he will empower a better opportunity.  So what Republicans want to do is to establish a tax benefit system while allowing a continuation of an employer-sponsored system. Those people that are on a system today that is provided by your employer, that would continue. But we would do away with the mandates on the individual and the business and the Cadillac tax. And we would encourage each of these companies to continue that system and work with their employees on a benefit system to make it better.  We would make HSAs available to every single person, not just Members of Congress, to where they would have an opportunity to have a system that would help their health care and their families and not be use it or lose it. It would make no sense that I would have to spend $43,000 a year simply to start over next year when I could actually benefit from saving and being efficient with my money. Maybe I am 30 years old and want to save for the future. Maybe I am 50 and cannot save, but I would roll over the system and make it work for me.  It will allow private physicians to endure. And what this does is empowers the private physician.  But there is more. And that is we will also keep--I believe we should, and the world's greatest healthcare system would, keep what are known as consumer protections that today exist in law: dependent coverage through age 26, no lifetime or annual limits, modified guaranteed availability and renewability, prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions, prohibition on discrimination based on your health status, and nondiscrimination in healthcare coverage.  I would like to tell the Members that back in Dallas, Texas, I am proud to also represent the disability community. I believe I can look at every single person back in Dallas, Texas, in the 32nd Congressional District of Texas, and say this: If you like your health care, you can keep it. If you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor.  But, more importantly, I believe that we will give equal to or better than opportunities for every single We will end the discriminatory services that ObamaCare is today. Because virtually every single doctor and virtually every single hospital will begin taking coverage, where today only about 24 percent of doctors take ObamaCare because it does not reimburse properly. And hospitals all over Dallas that do not take ObamaCare, leading edge hospitals in Dallas, Texas, and across this country, will begin taking this new health care because it reimburses based upon actual cost and marketplace availability.  So to my colleagues who want to go back home and talk to their constituents about Republican ideas, I don't know which one we will end up with. What I do know is that Senator Bill Cassidy and I have worked with hundreds of physicians for 2 years, and we have a bill, the world's greatest healthcare plan. The world's greatest healthcare plan is a bill that you can understand that is guaranteed to provide people a better opportunity without guessing about their healthcare coverage, and it is not use it or lose it.  So it is my hope that my colleagues that saw this this evening and took part in this will understand that there is an opportunity to go back home and sell the world's greatest healthcare plan for their people back home, too.  I thank my colleagues for being here tonight.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-01-24-pt1-PgH675-2.txt,1548,AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET,2017.0,24.0,March
1424,topic-id,406,"Mr.Speaker, as the ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I am very concerned about these cuts. This undermines our leadership around the world and makes Americans less safe. When you consider that foreign aid is only 1 percent of our entire budget and helps keep Americans safe, it is an investment in our security.  Fully funding our State Department and ensuring our diplomats have the resources they need prevents conflicts, diffuses crises, and works to keep American soldiers out of harm's way.  U.foreign aid helps protect some of the world's poorest people from disease, starvation, and death. President Trump's own Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, said: ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition. . . .''  I signed onto a letter led by Ranking Member Engel, along with my Democratic colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging the Speaker to oppose these draconian cuts.  We are already hearing from our allies all over the Western Hemisphere how dangerous these cuts could be to the stability of the region. Countries like Colombia fought a 52-year-long war with the FARC guerrillas, and now, when they need us the most to implement the peace deal, the Trump administration has signaled it is ready to abandon one of our strongest partners in the world. The President claims to care about protecting our sovereign border, but this budget says otherwise.  Both Republican and Democrat administrations have pushed for a strong security, economic, and trade relationship with Pushing our neighbors away could cost billions of dollars to our U.businesses.                              {time}  1830  Instead of working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere, President Trump is preventing us from maintaining a robust relationship with our neighbors to pay for this unrealistic and ineffective wall.  In Central America, we risk seeing a repeat of the 2014 crisis when nearly 70,000 children made the dangerous journeys from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador after being threatened with violence, assault, and forced gang recruitment. Our engagement in Central America is helping to bring calm to the region, and abandoning our friends in their time of need puts America at risk. Retreating from the world will allow other countries like China and Russia to take our place as a global leader.  Instead of building a wall, the President should continue working with our neighbors to enhance cooperation instead of alienating friends who have stood by us for decades.

I think it is important to point out that when you talk about civilian control, General Mattis is, in fact, a civilian. Heis not in command of any Marine divisions right now. I don't think prior military service should be held against him when he hasthe ability to offer additional service to the country.  I hear this argument that: Well, he is a retired general, he is subject to the That is not an argument that has muchmerit. If that were the case, you couldn't have retired military officers serve in the If they were still consideredmilitary officers, it would violate the incompatibility clause of the  Now, this 7-year statutory restriction, I think it is understandable, but I don't think it is in any way sacrosanct.

Nobody was under any illusions that he was a civilian, and he was somebody who was revered.  Now, it is true the Founders feared the civil being subordinate to the military, but that is because they thought Republicangovernment could be overrun by a military junta. We don't have that danger here. We have a civilian President of the UnitedStates, a civilian Congress that is charged under the Constitution with providing and maintaining our Navy, with raising andsupporting our armies, and prescribing rules for the regulation of the Armed Forces, and we will have Jim Mattis, who is acivilian, as a Secretary of  This man, Jim Mattis, has been a faithful servant to our country.

Here we have a large amount of agreement, but we have adifference of judgment on what is best for the country.  I would say to all Members: We are about to do our job, and that is vote up or down on legislation that would allow GeneralMattis to serve.  Now, we are not irrelevant, because if we don't vote for this legislation, he does not serve. That is what Members areelected to do: to vote. We are about to vote, and we have essentially two choices.  Mr.Speaker, as I made clear, I share many of the concerns about the process, about some of the decisions that thetransition team made. There has been a lot of discussion about this setting a poor precedent; but, actually, there is only oneprecedent before us. That was 1950 with General And General Marshall himself did not testify in front of the House orthe Senate on the waiver legislation.  It was only after the waiver legislation was signed into law that General Marshall came to testify in front of the Senatefor his confirmation hearing. But there is nothing that is different from what we are doing today from the only precedent thatexists. So the notion that we are suddenly irrelevant, that we are harming the House, et cetera, I believe is mistaken.  I hope that we do not have a national security crisis on January 21 or 22, but the fact is, unless we pass this bill today,we are not able to have a Secretary of Defense on January 20.

I hope he does.That would ensure that General Mattis, if confirmed by the Senate on January 20, will go ahead and be sworn in and take officeat that point.  There are, as I have said, many concerns about how this was handled--the wording, et cetera. The bottom line, as some of mycolleagues have mentioned, is that there are men and women who have volunteered to serve our Nation even at the risk of theirown lives. There are Americans throughout the country who depend on those men and women to keep them safe and secure.

There were no amendments presented in the Rules Committee last night. We have reported a closed rule for consideration of this bill.[[Page H2472]]  Science is, Mr.Speaker, in the EPA's own words, the backbone of EPA's decisionmaking. President Obama, in 2011, issued an executive order about how agencies should go about making the regulatory process more effective. He said, and I quote: ``Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological information and processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.''  We talk so much about what divides us in this institution, in this town, sometimes even in this country, Mr.Speaker, I think that point is worth dwelling on.  Again, quoting from former President Barack Obama: ``Each agency shall ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological information and processes used to support the agency's regulatory actions.''  It is what the HONEST Act aims to do, Mr.It aims to provide the American public with the data that the EPA uses in each of its regulatory actions.  It would come as a surprise to many Americans, Mr.Speaker, to learn that there are Agency actions that take place based entirely on undisclosed data sets, that the regulatory arm of government can be at work based on secret data that will never be released to the American public to verify, to confirm in this what is often, in scientific communities, referred to as peer-reviewed literature.  We believe that, if we are making the rules, we should be able to expose the data on which those rules are based to scrutiny and, in fact, to challenge, Mr. One thing I have learned in this job is sometimes I am not as smart as I think I am. I don't know if that has ever happened to you, Mr.I am sure it has never happened to my friend from But sometimes we are not as smart as we think we are. Sometimes being challenged makes us better.  The HONEST Act, Mr.Speaker, aims to provide the opportunity simply by looking at the data for any American citizen to understand the regulatory actions being taken at the EPA, and, yes, if necessary, to challenge those actions if they believe they are not based on sound science.  Mr.Speaker, I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: Is this bill necessary? The EPA's mission is to protect the environment and public health, so, of course, it is going to use the best science.  The answer should be yes. The answer should be yes that in every set of circumstances we are always using the very best data. But as you know, time and time again, you can bring an expert into your office. A scientist on one side of the issue will tell you one thing; a scientist on the other will bring an equally compelling compendium of information to tell you the next. It is left to us, to the American people, to decide who is right and who is wrong.  This is nothing to be feared. This is something to be embraced. It has certainly been a characteristic of our great country for over 200 years.  But in these days of information pouring out of the administration at the speed of the internet, it is more critical than ever that we make that information available to the public. With the ability today to understand that information, to process that information, to compile that information, to inspect that information in details never before imagined, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that America has that opportunity.  With that, Mr.Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to support this rule to bring the bill to the floor and then to support the underlying legislation so that we can pass the HONEST Act, bringing clarity and transparency to the EPA rulemaking process.

And now that there is a Republican in the White House, we want to hold a Republican administration accountable for sound science.                              {time}  1245  So often in this town, we see one set of rules when you agree with the person in office and another set of rules when you disagree with the person in office. I don't think that is the right way to govern a country. I am proud that we are not falling into that trap. If it is good for the Obama administration, it is good for the Trump administration.  Number two, there is no smoke-filled backroom deal here. Number one, there is no smoke-filled room anywhere on Capitol Speaker Boehner is gone, and smoking is banned from all of our spaces. This bill went through a full committee hearing, the full committee process. So often, Mr.Speaker, you know at the beginning of a year like this one, we are trying to move legislation to the floor quickly. Some things that we have already had hearings and debate on, like this bill, from last Congress, we bring to the floor outside of regular order, and we skip the committee hearing process. Not so with this bill. It went through the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for a full hearing.  Mr.Speaker, we talk about transparency as if it exists at the I will remind my friend from Colorado, Mr.Speaker, we have to issue subpoenas from the United States Congress to get the EPA to share its data with us, notwithstanding to get them to share it with the University of Georgia or Georgia Tech or Caltech, or wherever the best scientific minds of the day are. We have to issue subpoenas to get them to share that information. Clearly, transparency is not the norm, it is the exception.  We talk about costs. My friend references $1 billion in costs from some study, apparently, not a peer-review study. I have not seen the data backing up this study. But the good news is I don't actually need the study. I have the bill itself, Mr.Speaker, and I will turn to the relevant part here. Paragraph 5, clarify that the administrator shall implement this section in a matter that does not exceed $1 million per year from the amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated. Now, you don't have to spend the entire million dollars, Mr.Speaker, but in the name of transparency, to make sure that folks have access to the data, we have said it is worth investing resources but not to exceed $1 million.  Finally, Mr.Speaker, we talk about the burden of red tape. I don't know if you have had to deal with the EPA or the DOT or the DOD or the DOE--insert DO acronym here--red tape is abundant in this Federal Government, and asking the Federal Government to be transparent is the antithesis of red tape. Since when did it become a burden on the institutions of government to be transparent with the American people? Since when, when you are making rules and regulations that affect the lives of every single American, did it become a burden to share the data on which those regulations are based?  I will say to you, Mr.Speaker, we get wrapped around the axle so often here that we end up getting further and further from our goals. Sharing data, getting peer-reviewed comments on that data, and having folks come out in support of the conclusions reached on that data are going to make us stronger as a nation not weaker. If you are proud of your underlying data, you should be proud to share that data. If you are embarrassed of your underlying data, I understand why you might want to keep it a secret.  We have an opportunity not to hide from science but to embrace science, we have an opportunity not to reach political conclusions but scientific conclusions, and we have an opportunity to restore the American people's trust in the institutions of government that are issuing these regulations. This is a small step in the right direction with the HONEST Act, Mr.Speaker, but it is an important step in the right direction. I hope my colleagues will support it.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-03-28-pt1-PgH2471-5.txt,2008,PROVIDING FOR EXCEPTION TO LIMITATIONAGAINST APPOINTMENT OF PERSONS AS,2017.0,28.0,January

1459,topic-id,1602,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, I often wonder what it is like to be in your position there, a distinguished career as a judge, and you come down here to talk about the EPA and whether or not the rules and regulations should be based on sound science or not, and you end up with a discussion over the There is no objection that can be lodged here for going outside of the scope of the bill.  I can always tell, when I come down for Rules Committee debate, whether or not we are really talking about something that divides us or whether we are just talking. If we are talking about something that divides us, we spend every moment of the hours that we have debating the nitty-gritty of the issue before us--talking about how quickly should that data be disclosed; how many folks should have access to it. Are there going to be episodes where the data needs to be kept super secret and folks can't be trusted with it? What should we do about new and emerging business practices, propriety technologies? How do we deal with those questions?  I enjoy those rules, Mr.Speaker, because we are doing exactly what we came here to do, and that is to delve into the details and get it right for the American people.  What I am led to believe on a day like today is that we are pretty close to getting it right for the American people because we are not talking about the nitty-gritty of the legislation. We are talking about the Clean Power Plan that the past administration put forward. We are not talking about the details of the legislation; we are talking about the Russians today. I think that is because there aren't many things much more common sense than sharing with the American people that data on which the laws of the land are made.  Mr.Speaker, there is no doubt that the EPA is involved in a complicated line of work, a critically important line of work.  I can't find a single constituent in the great State of Georgia that doesn't believe in clean water and clean air. I can find a whole lot of them who think that they believe more in clean water and clean air than does any institution in Washington, D.I promise you, no one cares more about the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area than those of us who live along the Chattahoochee River National Recreation  Nobody cares more about protecting the Earth in the great State of Georgia than those farmers who are creating the largest export we have in the great State of Georgia, which are our agriculture products.  We are in this together, which is why, when this bill came before the House last Congress, it passed with a bipartisan vote. These are commonsense ideas that bring us together more than they divide us.  Mr.Speaker, I think the real surprise is that folks believe the EPA to be transparent, and learn that it is not. Folks would not believe that this Congress has to subpoena information in order to get its hands on it.  What this bill would say is not only should Congress be able to access the information, but any reputable scientist should be able to access the information.  What my friend says about privacy concerns, they are a shared concern in this institution. There is absolutely nothing in this underlying legislation that threatens those privacy concerns. In fact, it requires that all private information be redacted before the information be utilized.[[Page H2478]]  Concerns over cost, again, are absolutely important, but I will read from the committee report: ``This bill does not contain any new budget authority, spending authority, credit authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax expenditures.''  That it is a pretty simple bill and a pretty simple rule. It asks that we lift the curtain of secrecy around the regulations that protect our health and safety. It asks that we make health and safety issues not things that divide us around process, but things that unite us around results.  Candidly, I came to this institution to achieve those results, Mr.Speaker, and I am proud to be carrying this rule to the floor today. I encourage all of my colleagues to please support this bill, and with its passage we can get to the underlying legislation, end the shroud of secrecy, and restore public confidence in the laws that protect all of our health and safety.  The material previously referred to by Mr.Polis is as follows:            An Amendment to 229 Offered by Mr.Polis       At the end of the resolution, add the following new      sections:       2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the      Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare      the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on      the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.     356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign      Interference in the 2016 The first reading of the      bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against      consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be      confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on Foreign After general      debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the      five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in      the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of      the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report      the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been      adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered      on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or      without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and      reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then      on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately      after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of      rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further      consideration of the bill.       3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.356.                                  ____        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous      question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.      A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote      against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow      the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a      vote about what the House should be debating.       Mr.Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of      Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the      previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or      control the consideration of the subject before the House      being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous      question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the      subject before the Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling      of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the      House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes      the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to      offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the      majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated      the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to      a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to      recognition. Speaker Joseph Cannon (R-Illinois) said:      ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman      from New York, Mr.Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to      yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first      recognition.''       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous      question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an      immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no      substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''      But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the      Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in      the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,      page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous      question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally      not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member      controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of      offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by      voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the      motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the      time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering      the previous question. That Member, because he then controls      the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for      the purpose of amendment.''       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.House of      Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special      Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on      such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on      Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further      debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:      ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a      resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control      shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous      question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who      controls the time for debate thereon.''       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does      have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only      available tools for those who oppose the Republican      majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the      opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
