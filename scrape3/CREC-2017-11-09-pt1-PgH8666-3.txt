                       THE TRICK TRICK TRICK ACT

  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, also known as the ``Trick Trick Trick Act.''
  This bill, Mr. Speaker, includes a $1.5 trillion cut to Medicare and 
Medicaid, raises taxes on middle-income families, and gives the biggest 
tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans.
  This bill eliminates personal deductions for medical expenses, 
creating further hardship for people facing illnesses; eliminates 
deductions for State and local income taxes, resulting in higher taxes 
for people who can't afford it; and eliminates deductions for interest 
paid on student loans, making quality education less accessible.
  Proponents of the bill, Mr. Speaker, will have you believe that these 
tax cuts will benefit working families, grow our economy, and decrease 
the Federal deficit. That is fake news. This bill does nothing more 
than destroy the hopes and dreams of middle Americans seeking a stable 
career, a fulfilled life, and a brighter future.
  The American people deserve better. I remain willing and able to work 
across party lines to achieve responsible tax reform.
  I say to my Republican colleagues: Do not pass this bill as a 
Republican bill. It must be bipartisan. If you do it, you will regret 
it.
