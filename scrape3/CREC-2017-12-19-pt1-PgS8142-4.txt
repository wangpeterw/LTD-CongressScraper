                       REMEMBERING LOHREN MARTIN

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I wish to remember the life of 
Lohren Martin, of Corbin, KY, who passed away on November 21, 2017, at 
the age of 87. A man of many talents, Lohren will be remembered most by 
those who loved him as a caring friend.
  A veteran of the Korean war, Lohren worked in his community as an 
attorney, a businessman, an entrepreneur, and a developer. Lohren's 
siblings and friends think of his humor, patriotism, and constant 
friendship.
  Elaine and I would like to extend our condolences to Lohren's wife, 
Arvilla, his children Eddie and Cindy, and all who knew and loved him. 
His life left a lasting impression on all of those around him, and I 
hope that their fond memories of Lohren will bring comfort in this time 
of grief.
  The Corbin Times-Tribune recently published an article on Lohren's 
life. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in 
the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

              Lohren Martin Remembered as `a Great Friend'

                           (By Angela Turner)

       ``The biggest thing I can tell you about Lohren Martin is 
     how much he valued every individual,'' Shirley Chandler said 
     about her brother.
       Siblings often share a special bond and it was no different 
     in the case of Shirley Chandler and her brother Lohren 
     Martin. Martin, who was a local attorney, businessman, 
     entrepreneur, developer, and Korean War Veteran (just to name 
     a few), died on Nov. 21.
       Growing up, Martin was the salutatorian of this high school 
     class. He attended several colleges and universities 
     including Sue Bennett College, Union College and the 
     University of Kentucky.
       According to Chandler, Martin's education was interrupted 
     when he was drafted into the Korean War. After basic training 
     he was selected to go into army intelligence. After training 
     in army intelligence, he was sent to Korea to interpret 
     aerial photographs. Chandler said while in Korea, Martin 
     lived in a tent and was dedicated and focused on the task at 
     hand.
       ``He was an awesome brother,'' Chandler said. ``He was a 
     great mentor, a great friend and confidant.''
       Martin's friends shared similar thoughts.
       ``He was a friend that would stick with you in good times 
     and bad times,'' said Martin's friend and business partner 
     Dave Huff. ``He was very patriotic.''
