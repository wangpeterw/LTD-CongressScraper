 SENATE RESOLUTION 325--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF THE WEEK 
  OF OCTOBER 29 THROUGH NOVEMBER 4, 2017, AS ``NATIONAL OBESITY CARE 
                                 WEEK''

  Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mrs. Capito, and Mr. Heinrich) submitted the 
following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:

                              S. Res. 325

       Whereas the disease of obesity is a major source of concern 
     across the United States, and more than \1/3\ of adults in 
     the United States are affected by obesity, with the number of 
     people affected by severe obesity in the United States 
     continuing to grow;
       Whereas experts and researchers agree that obesity is a 
     complex disease influenced by various physiological, 
     environmental, and genetic factors;
       Whereas studies show that bias against and stigma 
     associated with people affected by obesity can be significant 
     barriers to effectively treating the disease;
       Whereas research suggests that weight loss of as little as 
     5 to 10 percent of the total weight of an individual affected 
     by obesity can improve the associated health risks affecting 
     many patients living with obesity and can thereby support the 
     goals of reducing chronic disease, improving health outcomes, 
     and controlling healthcare costs;
       Whereas comprehensive and individualized strategies for 
     weight loss and weight management that consider all treatment 
     options, such as reduced-calorie diets, physical activity 
     modifications, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, have 
     been identified as important components of treatment;
       Whereas it will take a long-term collaborative effort, 
     which will involve partners in diverse fields taking active 
     roles, to improve obesity care and treatment; and
       Whereas the week of October 29 through November 4, 2017, 
     would be an appropriate week to designate as ``National 
     Obesity Care Week'': Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) supports the designation of the week of October 29 
     through November 4, 2017, as ``National Obesity Care Week''; 
     and
       (2) encourages all people in the United States to create a 
     foundation of open communication to eliminate the 
     misunderstanding and stigma regarding obesity and to improve 
     the lives of all individuals affected by obesity and their 
     families.
