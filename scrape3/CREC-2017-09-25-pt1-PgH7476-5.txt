                        HURRICANE-RIDDEN PLACES

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. In hurricane-ridden places, DREAMers are 
extraordinarily scared for their families, for the ability to recover 
from damages; and I see it every day.
  It is imperative that Republicans sign this bill to save and protect 
our DREAMers, who are, in fact, Americans. Do it for all of those who 
are suffering.
  Then, Madam Speaker, let me explain to you that FEMA needs to address 
the poverty of my constituents, individuals who are calling me in their 
apartments when their 84-year-old mother and themselves have lost 
everything, and they cannot get a FEMA inspector to that apartment.
  I will be addressing this with FEMA Director Brock Long, but we 
cannot go this route. People are still in uninhabitable housing. Over 
the weekend, seniors were evicted from their housing with no place to 
go.
  I am engaged with our public housing authority, but we have got to 
have a system that is orderly for those who are living in uninhabitable 
housing. And, FEMA, you have got to enhance the inspectors. These 
people are waiting for over a month for you to come to their apartment 
or home to inspect, because they have no resources at all, and they are 
depending upon the FEMA dollars based upon your inspection for the loss 
of personal items.
  The hurricane is still on for my friends in Puerto Rico and Florida 
and the Virgin Islands and Texas.
