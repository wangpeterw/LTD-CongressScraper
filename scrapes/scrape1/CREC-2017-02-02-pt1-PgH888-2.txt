               RECOGNIZING NATIONAL CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK

  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Catholic 
Schools Week.
  America's Catholic schools educate over 2 million students from 
diverse backgrounds each year, effectively preparing them for a 
brighter future and instilling in them faith-filled values. Data show 
that Catholic schools are often the highest-performing educational 
institutions in our communities. In fact, 99 percent of students from 
Catholic schools graduate from high school.
  This week, I applaud Catholic schools for making a difference with 
students throughout our country; I applaud the educators who invest in 
their students' academic and spiritual formation; and I applaud the 28 
Catholic grade schools and high schools that faithfully work in the 
18th Congressional District of Illinois.
  Today I am a cosponsor of a resolution that expresses congressional 
support of Catholic schools for their invaluable contributions to 
students and families across America. It is with deep gratitude that I 
recognize those Catholic educators who are shaping the next generation.
