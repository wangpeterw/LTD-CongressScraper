                 RECOGNIZING PASTOR FRANK HAMPTON, JR.

  (Mr. WALBERG asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Frank 
Hampton, Jr., as he celebrates 50 years of ministry at the Church of 
God in Jackson, Michigan.
  Over the years, Pastor Hampton has been a steady example of what it 
means to be a father, a pastor, a mentor, and a community servant.
  In addition to faithfully shepherding his congregation, Pastor 
Hampton has served as a volunteer chaplain for Allegiance Health, 
counseled disadvantaged youth, and helped build strong leaders in the 
community.
  He has worked in conjunction with Jackson's judicial system, Jackson 
Public Schools, Jackson County Jail, and the Interfaith Shelter.
  The longevity of his service to his congregation and to the community 
is a reflection of his mission to make a profound difference in the 
lives of everyone he meets.
  Pastor Hampton is a remarkable man of integrity, perseverance, and 
servant leadership. His 50 years of ministry have set the standard for 
our community. I congratulate him on his milestone and pray for God's 
many blessings in the years ahead.
