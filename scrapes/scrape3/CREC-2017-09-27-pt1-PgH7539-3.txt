                IN SUPPORT OF DREAMERS AND THE DREAM ACT

  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Members, I also want to join my 
colleague from Houston in prayers for Houston police officer Nestor 
Garcia and his family, but I rise today in support of the 68,000 
DREAMers that are in Houston, Harris County, Texas, and throughout our 
country, and call on congressional leaders to bring up the Dream Act 
for immediate vote.
  DREAMers and young men and women who were raised in America know no 
other country and are an integral part of our schools, our colleges, 
our workforce, and our communities.
  During the worst days of Hurricane Harvey, DREAMers helped rescue 
neighbors and save lives throughout Houston and the Texas Gulf Coast. 
DREAMers are now and will continue to be serving a key role in 
rebuilding our city.
  President Trump's announcement this month to end the DACA program was 
a gut punch to DREAMers who are helping their families and communities 
recover from Harvey's destruction.
  Congress has a moral obligation to honor the hard work and 
aspirations of the current and earlier generations of immigrants and 
DREAMers, and bring up the Dream Act for our immediate consideration.
