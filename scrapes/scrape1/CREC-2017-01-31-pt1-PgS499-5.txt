                      WELCOMING THE GUEST CHAPLAIN

  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, Senator Cotton and I would like to 
welcome Rabbi Barry Block and thank him for delivering the opening 
prayer to the Senate today. I am proud that he accepted our invitation 
to lead the Senate with his spiritual guidance.
  Rabbi Block is the leader of B'nai Israel--Arkansas's largest Jewish 
congregation--a position he has held since 2013. I have gotten to know 
Rabbi Block and his dedication to his congregants through his annual 
visits to Washington with the Religious Action Center of Reform 
Judaism. He has served Reform Judaism as a member of the Board of the 
Central Conference of American Rabbis and chair of its Resolutions and 
Nominating Committee and as president of the Southwest Association of 
Reform Rabbis.
  Serving as the guest Chaplain is an incredible honor. Today he is 
joined by his sons Robert and Daniel. He wished to share this 
experience with his congregants as well. I enjoyed meeting yesterday 
with him and his confirmation students to hear about their concerns on 
a wide variety of social issues. I appreciate his prayer for our 
country and its leaders.
  I yield the floor.
