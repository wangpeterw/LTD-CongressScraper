               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR MICHAEL ``PAKO'' BENITEZ

  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I recognize Maj. Michael ``Pako'' 
Benitez for all of his hard work on behalf of myself, my staff, and the 
State of South Dakota while working in my Washington, DC, office.
  Pako entered military service in 1997 and has devoted his career to 
the United States Armed Forces. Before his time in my office, Pako 
served as a flight commander and F-15E instructor weapons system 
officer. Pako's experiences and expertise have been a true asset to the 
office.
  I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Pako for his service 
to our country. I wish him continued success in the years to come.
