Our country faced daunting challenges during that period, and the Federal Reserve and the government's response to the financial crisis was not an easy undertaking.  The crisis demanded great effort and ingenuity from many people. It required close coordination across the executive branch, the regulatory agencies, Congress, and the private sector. Working with key decisionmakers at the board and throughout the government, Mr.Alvarez played an important role in developing and articulating the legal dimensions to virtually every initiative taken by the Federal Reserve to address the crisis.

Mr.Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thin Blue Line Act, legislation I have introduced to support our Nation's brave police officers, firefighters, and first responders.  This week, we recognize National Police Week, a time to reflect on the very professional service of our law enforcement officers and their families. It is also a time to honor the lives of those brave officers who were killed in the line of duty and made the ultimate sacrifice.  It is really a sad reality that attacks against law enforcement officers have skyrocketed in recent years. Their entire community endured an especially difficult and heartbreaking 2016. In fact, in the last year alone, police officer deaths from shootings have increased 56 percent, and ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers have increased a staggering 167 percent, nationally.  We need to send a very clear message: The intentional targeting and killing of our first responders will not be tolerated.  My bill, the Thin Blue Line Act, would make murder or attempted murder of a police officer, firefighter, or other first responder an aggravating factor in death penalty determinations. This bill will serve as a strong deterrent to anyone planning an attack against our brave men and women in uniform who protect and serve our communities.

The Purple Heart's history goes as far back as the founding of our General George Washington established what is now known as the Purple Heart Medal when he issued an order establishing the Military Badge of Merit on August 7, 1782. General Washington wished for the award to be used to recognize meritorious action performed by members of the Continental Army, and it took the form of a purple heart.  The Military Badge of Merit was discontinued after the Revolution and was not revived until 1932, when the Purple Heart medal was authorized as its official successor decoration. On February 22, 1932, the 200th Anniversary of the birth of George Washington, then-Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur resurrected the award, and it was redesignated as the Purple Quite appropriately, this reestablished Purple Heart Medal exhibits the bust and profile of George  It is around this time that the Purple Heart became synonymous with those unfortunate heroes who were killed or wounded in combat.

12122,topic-id,628,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker and my colleagues, though troubled and saddened by the recent attacks on law enforcement officials, I believe that H.115, the Thin Blue Line Act, is counterproductive to ensuring public safety and only serves to exacerbate concerns with the unfair and unjust death penalty.  H.115 expands the list of statutory aggravating factors in Federal death penalty cases to also include killing or targeting a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other first responder.  Aggravating factors are specific factors that judges and juries consider in determining whether a sentence of death is justified for the underlying offense. Passage of this bill would add a 17th statutory aggravating factor for Federal death penalty eligible offenses.  H.115 has been rushed to the House floor, without a single hearing and without the opportunity to consider amendments directly relevant to whether our system of imposing the death penalty is fair, just, and reliable. Like most of my colleagues, I support measures that would actually protect our first responders, brave men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us.  Unfortunately, H.115 not only fails to do this but would also exacerbate problems with the Federal death penalty.  First, H.115 duplicates Federal and State laws that enhance sentences of persons convicted of crimes of violence against law enforcement. The very law the bill seeks to amend, 18 U.S.section 3592, already states that a crime against a high public official, including a judge, a law enforcement officer, or an employee of a United States penal or correctional institution, is an aggravating factor that may be considered in determining whether a death sentence should be imposed.  Other Federal laws also impose a life sentence or death on persons convicted of killing State and local law enforcement officers, or other employees assisting with Federal investigations, as well as officers of the United States courts.  Secondly, H.115 does not address documented and systemic unfairness and racial unfairness in the disposition of the death penalty. Any legislation dealing with the Federal death penalty must also address numerous concerns related to racial disparity in application of capital punishment, the lack of qualified counsel and sufficient resources to represent those facing the death penalty, and faulty forensic ``science'' testimony ordered in support of convictions in death penalty cases.  The Federal death penalty, in particular, is rife with troubling evidence of racial disparity. For example, 36 of the 61 people currently on Federal death row are African American, Latino, Asian, or Native  If you break this down by Federal circuit, the results are even more disturbing. For example, 15 of 18 men who have received a Federal death sentence in the Fifth Circuit--Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi--in the modern era have been people of color.  Third, civil rights and civil liberties organizations oppose H.115. Organizations committed to the protection of civil rights and civil liberties, including the NAACP, ACLU, and the LCCR, have noted that the Thin Blue Line Act ``is an unnecessary and misguided attempt to politicize the unfortunate deaths of law enforcement officers and could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement and the communities they served.''                              {time}  1500  And finally, H.115 will not deter violence against police officers. By adding a 17th aggravating factor to the Federal death penalty statute, this legislation ignores scientific research regarding the ineffectiveness of capital punishment as a deterrent to crime.  It is important to note that the National Research Council of the National Academies has concluded that the studies claiming that the death penalty has a deterrent effect on murder rates are ``fundamentally flawed'' and should not be the basis of sound public policy.  Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Bob Goodlatte,     Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington,     John Conyers, Jr.,     Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington,       Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: We are      current and former law enforcement leaders and officers from      jurisdictions across the country. We ask you to oppose H.     115, the Thin Blue Line We[[Page H4340]]     do so because we believe this bill will do little to protect      the lives of police and first responders and will drive away      resources proven to be effective at protecting law      enforcement and preventing and solving crime.       We are all too familiar with the risks that local, state,      and federal law enforcement and first responders take each      day to prevent, investigate, and prosecute crime. In fact;      some of us have served alongside colleagues who were killed      in the line of duty. We understand the impulse to threaten      those who have murdered our fellow officers with the death      penalty, and some of us have experienced that desire      directly.       But we also know that the death penalty, as it currently      operates, is poor public policy. It is ineffective,      expensive, and can make irrevocable mistakes. It is also used      disparately and often on vulnerable populations, which      undermines our ability to create effective and trusted      relationships with those in the community on whose support      our success depends. That is why, while some of us may      philosophically support the death penalty, we all oppose its      expansion in practice--even under the auspices of supporting      law enforcement.       Each of us understands that it takes many and varied      resources to keep our communities safe. We need strong      partnerships with local government and the communities we      serve.

After going 16 and 1 in the postseason, earning the highest win percentage in NBA playoff history, and defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers 129 to 120 in game five of the NBA Finals, the Warriors have become champions for the second time in just 3 years. The best part: they did something for their fans that had never been done before--they won the title at home, in Oracle As a bay area native myself, I know how much this means to all of Dub  Everyone who is a part of the Warriors Organization--the video staff, the trainers, the owners, coaches, players and fans--deserves praise for a hard-fought and historic 2016 to 2017 season. The year was primarily marked by highs. Among my favorites was Klay Thompson's astonishing 29-minute, 60-point performance against the Indiana And who could forget Steph Curry's mind-boggling, half-court buzzer-beater against the Clippers?  The Warriors undoubtedly played remarkable basketball this year, but they also overcame their share of obstacles. When Coach Kerr was forced to take a leave of absence, the team rallied behind him and, under Mike Brown's leadership, continued to earn wins in his honor. When starters were sidelined due to injury, bench players stepped in and stepped up, demonstrating the team's depth and heart. When the Warriors were knocked down by the Cavaliers in game four of the finals, they woke up the next morning, flew home, and got straight to work--running hours of drills so they could come back stronger in game five.  The Warriors are a team with resolve and great character. They are highly focused but still manage to have fun together. They take care of each other, and equally as important, they take care of their community. The Warriors recognize that they are in a unique position to give back and effect positive change.  Over the past several years, the Warriors Foundation has awarded $5 million in grants to support educational initiatives in Alameda and San Francisco The foundation, along with individual players, has also refurbished over 60 basketball courts throughout the bay area, creating safe and beautiful places for our young people to play.

11919,topic-id,570,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank my colleague from Arkansas (Mr.Hill) for his years of hard bipartisan work that went into this bill.  I am proud to support this bill today because I believe that it will strengthen the abilities of investors to make informed decisions. This legislation would add transparency in the financial markets that will ultimately benefit consumers.  Exchange-traded funds are valuable and popular tools for investors to get exposure to diversified risk through a single security with low costs. My wife and I use them ourselves. They are, however, like the iPhone, very simple on the outside but incredibly complicated products on the inside. They often can be thoroughly understood only by those with the background and the time to analyze the way the ETF is constructed, as well as each of the underlying securities and the sectors they are targeting.  Retail investors and retirement savers often do not have this time and often do not have the expertise in the markets. High-quality research can help them make informed decisions about which ETFs to invest in, equipping them to make decisions on how to diversify across different sectors and indices.  ETFs are continuously issued, so they present unique potential risks to underwriting broker-dealers under the Federal securities laws.  Generally, the Federal securities laws prohibit a broker-dealer from participating in a securities offering from publishing research 15 days before or 30 days after the issuance for very good reason. This is to prevent research that could hype the security ahead of the offering or try to puff its price afterwards.  ETF pricing, however, reflects a wide variety of data across many issuers and classes of securities. Because they are continuously brought to market, it is necessary to provide a clarification in the law that research is permitted to be published continuously, because they are also continually traded on the exchanges. The antifraud provisions of the securities laws will still apply.  To be clear, this bill does not vitiate any rights of investors or responsibilities of broker dealers with respect to the accuracy and truthfulness of statements. Specifically, section 2(c)(1) provides that the antifraud and antimanipulation provisions of the securities laws are not limited by anything in this bill. Moreover, this applies only to bona fide research, and FINRA can require sales materials to be posted to the public.  Section 2(c)(2) preserves the powers of the SROs to oversee all of the practices of broker-dealers, including the publication of these reports.  Lastly, the bill provides for a statutory safe harbor should the Commission not be able to promulgate a rule in the 270-day period established by the bill. This statutory safe harbor is only available to research on funds that have been reported to the SEC for the last year, ensuring that it is true to the purpose of the bill to provide research to be used by investors for existing securities.  Statutory safe harbors exist elsewhere in the Federal securities laws, most notably section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 A statutory private offering exemption can be perfected without relying on regulation In practice, though, that does not happen, and I trust that the SEC will prescribe an appropriate set of rules consistent with section 2(a) of this bill so that the regulatory safe harbor will be effective.

12166,topic-id,7199,"Mr.Speaker, on Friday, so many say My late mother passed away in 1991, but she said TGIF one time, and the lady responded, S-H-I-T, and mother looked shocked. She said: ``Sorry, honey, it's Thursday.'' But this is not Thursday, it is Friday, and I really hoped we would be voting on a bill that wouldn't totally repeal ObamaCare, but it would give people a great deal of relief.  I know with all the talk from the other side of the aisle about how great ObamaCare is, when we look at the numbers, we know that promise after promise was broken in the passage of the ACA, or People lost their insurance, they lost the medications that they were eligible to have under their prior insurance, they lost their doctor, and they lost their treatment facility. That does take a toll on people's lives.  There was bragging about the people that now had insurance that didn't have it before. But we know it was clear, most of that was people that got stuck on It wasn't real insurance. As we look at the evolution of health care in America, we see that insurance has changed to where it is no longer insurance.  Right now in America, people who are actually medical doctors are some of the best and brightest that America has ever produced. But as an old history major and someone who continues to read and learn from history every week, it is worth noting that there have been strides made in health care and in medicine in the last 100 years that are unparalleled in the entire history of mankind.  There was a book called ``The Five Thousand Year Leap.'' I don't want to do it an injustice, but basically it points out that when settlers came to North America, not the immigrants that came perhaps from Russia who then later were referred to as Native Americans, but immigrants coming from Europe, the English, and even from Norway, during those years, they came in boats that were not powered other than by sail or by arm strength. Mankind had not made a lot of progress over 5,000 recorded years of history. If you looked at the implements that were used in farming when settlers in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries came to North America, there really had not been any great developments in production of food and in farming tools over the thousands of years that mankind had existed.  Yet I think largely because the Founders of the United States of America recognized the importance of ingenuity and rewarding not only hard work but intellectual developments and processes--in fact, in the Constitution, the Founders had the incredible foresight to provide for something called copyrights or patents because they wanted to protect intellectual property. They felt that if we protect and reward intellectual property, then it will encourage people to develop new ideas and find new and better ways. Within the last 100 years, we have made much more than a 5,000-year leap, and that is also certainly true in health care in the realm of medicine.  I don't think it is just pride in I think anyone objectively will have to note that if not for the Presidents of the United States of America and the medical breakthroughs in the United States of America and the contributions of medicine in the United States, we would not be where we are now with so much potential to cure diseases, to prevent diseases, to improve quality of life, and to elongate people's years on the  Some medical historians would say it was around 100 years ago that for the first time--some believe in the entire history of the mankind, recorded or otherwise--that for the first time, about 100 years ago, a person had a better chance of being healed or getting well after seeing a doctor than they had of getting sicker. It is extraordinary to think that for the thousands of years of man's existence it is only in the last 100 years that physicians actually were able to have a better chance of healing than harming.  We saw an old Saturday Night Live skit that played out where the barber was often also the doctor because he had sharp instruments to cut with. But even going back 200 years to 1799, just over 200 years, George Washington got ill. He had been out in the land that he loved there at Mount Vernon, just southwest of here, a place that he longed to be all during the For the 8 years he served as the commander to the Revolutionary forces, all of those days, nights, and weekends, he longed to be back at Mount But for the good of his country, he stayed with his troops.  There were entries in journals and letters from people who served under him and were stationed at Valley Forge: Why, even though they weren't fighting? Because Washington knew if he let the men go home, there was a good chance they wouldn't come back. If they didn't come back, then the Revolution was going to be over, and all of those who had participated would be killed by the British forces. So he stayed with the troops. He often allowed the officers to take leave and go home at night or on a weekend perhaps, but he stayed with the troops.  After the war was won, he went back to Mount He thought he was done. He had served his country and done what no one else had ever done in history. Although Cincinnatus did an incredibly selfless thing, it still wasn't to the level of selflessness of George When he thought he was done in 1787, here came leaders begging him to come back and lead the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia because, as they eventually made clear to Washington, if he did not come back and reside, all would be lost. All those who fought during the Revolution would have fought for nothing: it would all go away, and the British would be back in charge. There would be chaos.                              {time}  1215  So he agrees to come back. Then an incredible thing happened at the Constitutional After they[[Page H2963]]could not reach any agreement on much of anything, as Ben Franklin pointed out, Randolph made a motion that they recess until after a celebration of the country's birth, its anniversary in early  Why don't they go to church together, worship together, celebrate God's love and his gift in this country, and then come back and try what had been so unsuccessful for the 5 weeks or so to that point?  The motion passed. They went to church at the Reformed Calvinistic Church, a Christian church, and they worshipped God together. They asked for his leadership. The Right Reverend William Rogers, pastor of the Reformed Calvinistic Church in Philadelphia, did a powerful job of leading the worship of God in this Christian church. It was a nondenominational service. We still have a record of the prayer that was prayed by Reverend Rogers at that celebration.  People noted after they came back that there was a different spirit. Yes, there was disagreement, but it wasn't as rancorous as it had been before that. It eventually came to the great compromise that allowed one body to have equal numbers of representatives from each State, no matter what size, and another body would have equal power and its representatives would be chosen according to the number of people who lived in that That was one of the great compromises.  We end up with a George Washington thinks he is done, but after the Constitution is ratified, they begged him to allow them to elect him unanimously to be our first He doesn't want to do it. He eventually agrees, gives in. They elect him unanimously. They have a contested vote for Vice President, but John Adams wins. After 4 years, he was ready to go home. They begged him again to allow them to reelect him unanimously. He eventually gave in and served 4 more years as  Some did become disappointed with Washington during those 4 years because he would not allow the United States to get involved in the French That irritated some people, but Washington believed that America was so weak in that time, that if we got involved in a foreign war, albeit a civil war, we would end up losing what had been gained to that point. So he didn't let the United States get involved.  When he was begged to stay and let them elect him to a third 4-year term, it would not have been unanimous. He said, basically, that it would look too much like a monarchy if someone served 12 years. He refused and could not be deterred. He went back to Mount  There at Mount Vernon, as he loved to do, he was going around assessing what improvements needed to be made there on his property. It was cold. It began to rain. He was marking trees as to which ones would be cut and which ones would be allowed to remain.  It got dark. He came to the house, not realizing that visitors had come. Since the Washingtons were always so hospitable, even if they didn't know people were coming, Martha would provide food for them.  George Washington came in. He was wet, he was cold, and Martha implored him to go change clothes, as did the guests, but he wouldn't have of it because he was so polite, always more concerned about others. So he remained, ate in cold and wet clothes, and ended up developing some kind of cold or infection, and it turned into a very serious infection.  A doctor was called, and he couldn't understand why Washington wasn't doing better. They were draining blood from It should have healed him. It should have made him all well. If we are getting the bad blood out of him, we don't know why he is not getting better, but got weaker.  Imagine that: you drain a man's blood, he gets weaker. They didn't understand what they were doing. That was 218 years ago.  Washington got weaker. They were able to get ahold of the doctor, who was one of George Washington's best friends in the world, Craik loved George Washington loved him like a brother. Craik wanted to do all he could to get him well. This man who loved Washington and cared so deeply was one of the better doctors of the 18th century. He bled him again. He drained more blood from Washington's body, thinking that would help, and it didn't. As we know now, that was not helping. It was hurting. It was doing great damage.  That is what they thought just 218 years ago. In that intervening 218 years, the advancements in medicine have been staggering. We know now what helps and what doesn't help. There will probably come a time when, if we continue to develop research, as we have in the past, we will be able to look back at the year 2017 and say there were things that we were doing that were not as helpful as we thought, may have been harmful, but never again to the extent as occurred where the doctors actually were responsible for killing their friend, our American hero. I don't think we will get to that point again.  It is worth noting historically the developments of health care so that we can adequately see what has happened in the 7 years since ObamaCare got passed. We have done damage to health care in America under  I know people talk about all the people that have health insurance now that didn't before. So many lost their policy. They got a much worse policy. ObamaCare basically outlawed catastrophic insurance policies, which are those that have a high deductible with a low premium and ensure against basically something catastrophic, disease, injury. Yet, because of the problems that ObamaCare created, premiums skyrocketed for so many people and the deductibles dramatically increased.  So many people have told me about their deductibles going from $250, $500 to $6,000, $7,000, $10,000. There are so many paying more than $10,000 for their health insurance with a high deductible that they can never pay. We have done great damage to people's ability to get the health care they need, that they used to be able to afford.  It was in the last 40 or 50 years that, when people brought up health insurance, it really was insurance. You paid a very small premium each month against some unforeseeable event out there in the future, a catastrophic disease or injury. So you just paid a small premium, like term life insurance, to ensure against something you hope never would happen. In the meantime, you just paid for your health care.  I know that while growing up in Mount Pleasant, Texas, everybody knew the doctors that were there. We went to more than one. It was sometimes dictated by who raised their prices and who hadn't. Now we don't know who raises their prices. You get a bill from a healthcare provider and there is no way in the world to know how much the procedure costs, how much the visit costs, how much anybody is actually going to pay to satisfy this massive indebtedness. Chances are, maybe less than a tenth of what the bill says that the government will pay if it is Medicaid, Medicare, Blue Cross, Aetna, Anthem, or any of these health insurers.  You can't improve the cost of health care if you don't know what it costs. You can't have free-market principles bringing down the cost of health care when nobody knows what it costs.  We have gone from the days of having health insurance ensure against a distant catastrophic event to paying behemoth companies to manage our health care, to tell us what doctor we can see, which hospital we can go to. We pay for so many other people who come into the country illegally and don't have insurance. We pay for people in the country legally that don't have insurance.  We pay exorbitant amounts for people that go to an emergency room because the Supreme Court has told us that, regardless of whether someone can pay or not, they have to be seen and treated. What happens at the emergency room costs those who do pay dramatically more than if those individuals had just gone to a health clinic and had the same treatment for the same problem.  So there have been some great solutions proposed, none of which have been to have the government have more role, turn all of the Nation's health care into a big Veterans Administration where things can often be catastrophic.  One of the things that has really broken my heart to be a servant of the people of east Texas is so many veterans' stories of how they were not properly cared for medically. They[[Page H2964]]didn't get the care they need. They were waiting for months. Then I will have people tell me they got treated very well. They are in the Lufkin Clinic named for Charlie  Overall, I think our veterans would still be better off if all of them were given a card and told: If you want to go to your local VA clinic, if you have one close, fine. You just go to whichever is closest and it gives you the best health care. That provides competition and it keeps our word to the veterans that they will have the health care they need.  Veterans should not be penalized because they served our country and put themselves in harm's way. My 4 years on Active Duty in the U.Army did not entitle me to life health care, so I don't have that personal experience of dealing with the VA health care. I was not disabled. I still feel guilty because during my 4 years, 1978 to 1982, we were never in combat.                              {time}  1230  We were put on alert in 1979 that some of us, at least, might be going to Iran, and we should have. I still feel that thousands of Americans would be alive today if we had been sent back then and had done the job of the radical Islamists that President Carter had been welcomed in. Ayatollah Khomeini, President Carter welcomed him as a man of peace, and he has done anything but provide peace.  But we owe our veterans so much. George Washington knew that, and that is why in that picture just down the hall, that huge painting that John Trumbull had painted, Washington has his arm outstretched, piece of paper in there. On that piece of paper was his resignation. He had also sent a copy to all 13 Amazingly, the last part of his resignation was a prayer for the In that prayer for the Nation, he included that he prayed God would ensure that we would never forget those who had served in the field; talking about our veterans who had fought for this country because Washington knew if we were going to remain a free nation, then we would have to honor those, take care of those who suffered as a result of giving us, protecting our freedom. That is why also, if we ever fail to honor those who have honored us by serving us in the military, we won't last past the next major conflict. It is important we do that, and Washington knew that.  So, since Washington's death was certainly propelled by blood being drained, we know draining somebody of their life-giving blood is not normally a good idea, but in the last 100 years, just thinking about you have a better chance of getting well than you do of getting sick, look at the progress that was made in medicine in 100 years and look at the developments in medicine since ObamaCare came about.  Yes, we know the big pharmaceutical companies signed on to endorsing ObamaCare, as did the American Hospital Association and the American Medical Association and For every organization that signed on endorsing ObamaCare, if you read the ObamaCare bill, as I did, you could normally find where they got their payoff. You could normally find something that they were given to buy their support.  AARP has made more money than they would have ever dreamed before ObamaCare through the health insurance policies that they endorse. So, yes, there was a great deal of self-service for AARP to endorse a bill that did massive medical damage to retired people, a bill that cut $716 billion out of  When people realize AARP endorsed a bill that did so much gutting of Medicare, how could they do that if they really care about retired people?  Well, how they could do it is that they were going to be rewarded by selling or endorsing insurance that wouldn't have the 2 percent tax on it that most insurance would have. They got some other benefits out of it. I haven't seen how much profit they have made for a nonprofit organization, but I believe it was in 2008 that they made over $400 million, basically profit for a nonprofit, from their insurance sales. There is no telling how much that has increased. I would love to see the number since ObamaCare came about. But they got a big payday because they endorsed  The pharmaceuticals, we knew they were going to make tens of billions of dollars more than they ever had after They were bought off to endorse it. But for some of us who could see clearly down the road where it was heading, as I have told some in the pharmaceutical industry: By endorsing ObamaCare, if it is not changed, you will have signed the death warrant for your own industry because eventually it will lead to failure to recoup research and development.  Not initially, but by then the people who had endorsed ObamaCare from the pharmaceutical industry will no doubt have gotten their golden parachutes and could own an island somewhere. Who knows? But they will be plenty wealthy. They would have overseen the steps that would lead to the demise of the greatest developments in health care in thousands of years, really just in the last 50 or 60, extraordinary developments.  Something has to be done. That is why a majority of Americans did not support ObamaCare in 2009 and 2010. It is why a majority of Americans wanted change. They had to have change.  Like the old joke about the guy up in the tree who went up to get the gorilla out. After tangling for so long, he yells at the guy: Just shoot up in the tree.  He said: Yeah, but I might hit you.  And the guy yells: Yeah, but one of us has got to have some relief.  People suffering from health care under ObamaCare have been crying for relief: Just do something. We have got to have relief.  I have heard that from so many in east Look, something has got to be done. We can't keep going like this. We can't afford the premiums, and it is not going to get me help with health care because I can't pay the deductibles. Something has to be done.  I was hoping we would have a full repeal. The bill 2 years ago didn't fully repeal It did more than we have done in the bill we have now, but the reason I agreed to sign on was so many people were saying: We don't like ObamaCare, but we have got to have some relief. We have got to have relief.  We finally got concessions that would ensure that people's premiums would come down in 2 years--too late for the year, but would come down in 2 years, and then would continue to make progress in the area of premiums.  We would make great inroads in encouraging people. Instead of paying tens of thousands of dollars to health insurance companies, they would have a big hunk of that money going to their own health savings account. That was clearly going to lead us--and still can--to a place where patients control their own health care again, where they can go talk to a doctor and not have an insurance manager intervene and say: Uh-oh, you can't do that. Nope, you can't go see that person. Nope, we haven't given approval to this or that.  It is a doctor and a patient relationship the way progress has been made in the last 100 years that has given us, to a point, the best health care in the history of mankind.  Now, in the 1970s, when I was in the Soviet Union as an exchange student for a summer, I saw socialized medicine. We are talking real socialized medicine, the same kind of socialized medicine that President Obama and so many others called--they put this lovely sounding name--single payer. Now, it is socialized medicine. The government controls it all. You don't have any choices. It is in the hands of the government. They see all; they know all.  Once the government has that power, then they have the right--and an obligation even--to tell you what you have to do physically, what you can eat, who you can see, where you can go, when you can go. People who want total government control over people's lives--not of their own, but everybody else's--they understood, they had the vision that if we can get government control of health care, then we will be able to control all these minions all across  There are a lot of people in this body who I disagree with, but I know they want to do what is right for But it is not right for America and for Americans to have the United States Government dictating every aspect of our lives.  I long for the days when my liberal friends used to yell: We don't want the government in our bedroom.[[Page H2965]]  Because since then, they have been saying: Yeah, let's get the government in our bedroom, in our bathroom, in our kitchen, in our living room, in our garage. We want government control of everything.  As I have said before, the only thing it appears that George Orwell got wrong was the date. It wasn't 1984. But we still have a chance to get off this miserable road we are on. That is why the huge bulk of geographic America rose up on election day in November and said: We have got to have some relief. Whether we like Donald Trump or not, we have got to have some relief, we have got to have some change.  That is why the huge geographical United States voted for Donald The fringes of the United States, the coast and a few major cities said: No, we like the government telling us what to do, how to live, what we can have.  But across America geographically, that was not what people wanted.  This is our chance. I really had hoped that by compromising again, as the Freedom Caucus, that we could have a vote by today on a bill that would start us down the road of getting rid of ObamaCare, getting us back on a road toward freedom. We knew it was going to be tough.  If you don't think it would be tough, look at the Soviet Union after the fall of the wall and the Soviet There were so many Russians who said: What are we going to do? We have to look for a job--find our own job. We don't want that kind of freedom.  Well, they are finding out that perhaps they do.  One of the things that we had gotten as a compromise to try to help Americans in the agreement that has developed to this point was the elimination of the taxes that would have been kept in place under the proposed bill that was first filed by our leadership.  Another thing that would be in there is a requirement that if you are going to now be part of Medicaid, as we have had millions now having the government pick up the insurance through Medicaid, then we are going to put a similar work requirement, as was put on by Congress in the 1990s by the Republican House and  And though President Clinton didn't want to agree to that, once he saw they had the votes to override another veto, he agreed to sign it because rather than have his veto overridden--and now it is one of the things he brags about: Oh, yeah, while I was President, I reformed welfare, so you had to work.  As a result of that reform in the 1990s--it was not a callous move. It was a caring move by Republicans in the House and Senate who understood that it is not a punishment to have a job. It gives you a feeling of self-worth.                              {time}  1245  We are not going to get back to the days where as many people have jobs as used to until we restore that freedom and a requirement that, if you are going to make the American taxpayers pay for everything that you want and need, then, if you are able to work, you are going to have to do something.  As a result of that work requirement in the 1990s, income for single mothers, when adjusted for inflation, for the first time since welfare began in the 1960s under the so-called Great Society, for the first time, that income increased for single moms when adjusted for inflation.  The Federal Government, since the Great Society legislation, had begun to lure young women into holes, into ruts, from which they could not extricate themselves. After 30 years of the Federal Government luring people into holes they then could not get out of, they were required to get out of the hole, they did, and their lives improved.  Now, I know the mainstream media has been there to defend every bit of government control as it took over more and more. They would take their potshots at people like me that probably were more intelligent on national testing than they were. But, nonetheless, used all kinds of excoriating terms, make fun. Like the time I mentioned that I was told by somebody that they were in line to get groceries and the person in front of them had crab legs that were expensive, and this person said: Gosh, I am wishing I could have afforded crab legs.  But it turns out, when they pulled out the card, which let them know taxpayers were paying for those crab legs, he realized the reason that he can't afford crab legs is because he is paying for his and this other person's food.  Well, the press went nuts over that. It has been some years back. It wasn't long after that, after the media here in Washington belittled me, the media in New York belittled me, never brought it out, but we got a picture. They said nobody can get crab legs with money from food stamp programs, CHIP, any of that. You can't do that. We have got pictures of crabs for sale and the sign saying ``we take food stamps.''  Anyway, it is very clear that, when you see the signs that say ``we take food stamps'' for the crabs, that the media that belittled me back in those days, they had their fun, but they were just wrong, and they were lying to cover for more and bigger intrusive government.  I want to also thank my friend Tom I am not crazy about the amendment that he provided, but Tom is making a real effort: let's reason together. Let's come together on a bill. We compromise, and we get to a point where we can help our respective constituents. We can help  I felt like, with all of the compromises, we were going to bring down premiums more quickly. We were repealing at least some of ObamaCare--not enough, but at least some of it--and we were going to be able to move the ball forward so that we could get back to great advancements in improving people's health care and getting away from the insurance monopolies that have developed in each It has been reported that in around 30 States there is only one company left providing the insurance.  Well, this body did a great thing, and I appreciate very much Speaker Ryan agreeing to do it. But he and Kevin McCarthy allowed a bill to come to the floor. Our whip, Steve Scalise, found: Gee, this is a lot easier doing a whip on this thing than we thought.  But it would eliminate the exemption for health insurance companies from antitrust laws. Under the state of the law since 1945, under the McCarran-Ferguson bill back then, health insurance companies have been allowed to monopolize. They can take actions that, in some other industry, would cause the Department of Justice to come after them and sue them, take very strong actions, and could even result in criminal actions if someone is trying to monopolize. But, in health care, it has been allowed for years.  You can go in and tell somebody: We want, in our agreement, that if you take any of these other upstart insurance companies' insurance, you are going to be out of our network; and we are the big dog, so you will be out of luck.  Well, you can't do that when you are under the antitrust laws of the United States, but you can when you are exempt.  That bill came to the floor. We had over 400 people on both sides of the aisle vote for it. And I know good and well that if Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would bring that to the floor of the Senate, it will have probably every bit as high a percentage. It could even be unanimous. I can't imagine somebody in the Senate voting against it.  But, if we simply change the law to allow people to buy across State lines and we don't eliminate the exemption from antitrust laws, then instead of having 30 monopolies in 30 States, you will have one monopoly for the whole country. The one big company can drive everybody else out because the healthcare providers will know, if they are going to survive, they have got to have this one monopoly paying them. And the monopoly can put in the contract: You won't be in our network if you accept insurance from any other place.  So that has to go. The House did that. I look forward to the Senate doing that.  Our revised version that I was hoping we would vote on today still does not fully repeal ObamaCare, but by the negotiations that have occurred in the Tuesday Group, Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, committee of jurisdiction, we have made a great deal of progress, and I thought we were there. We didn't have any assurances that the Senate would pass exactly what we did, but we were going to move the ball forward.[[Page H2966]]  Now, today was as close as we have gotten to repealing and getting into law a big repeal of a big part of ObamaCare, but it didn't happen today. It needs to happen, and it needs to happen very soon.  But what did happen in the White House, the President has stood undeterred. Again, today, he signed another executive order. This one didn't do as the prior administration and usurped power that was not his, that only Congress has. He is working well within the law and gets good advice on this stuff.  I have got to say, even when I have talked to the President over the last few weeks, more than once, he wants to make sure that he is following the Constitution, and he is careful to say that. I like that. Let's check to see and make sure we are following the Constitution and we are not missing something here. I love having a President that is concerned about that. For all of the grief that President Trump has taken, he is concerned about it. He does not want to exceed his authority.  Unfortunately, we have judges in the Ninth Circuit, particularly, that exceed their authority on a regular basis. Mr.Speaker, that is why I am hoping that, in the very near future, we will break up the Ninth It would be okay with me if we restricted the Ninth Circuit, who doesn't have one care about precedence, about the They just have their political agenda. If we are not going to get rid of them altogether, then let's at least restrict their jurisdiction to controversies that arise within their building and then divide up the rest.  We need a new circuit. Let President Trump appoint all of the new 12th Circuit that will be created. I am very pleased that our Judiciary Committee is wanting to do something major regarding the Ninth Circuit being out of control.  And I do think an important step will be, when we eliminate the jurisdiction of a district court over immigration and naturalization matters, we have authority to create courts--all but one. The Supreme Court is the only one formed under the All the rest of them, we brought them into the world and we can take them out. We give them their jurisdiction and we can take it away. We need to do that if we are going to save this constitutional  So, Mr.Speaker, I would also like to finish by mentioning the National Day of Prayer recognition that is coming up on Anne Graham Lotz took over the gavel from Shirley Both are dear friends. Shirley Dobson has done an extraordinary job over the last 25 years.  The National Day of Prayer has continued the tradition for many years now. We do have an observance at the For a couple of decades, it has been at the Cannon Caucus It seats more than the rooms here at the Capitol do. We had hoped to have it in the rotunda. It is nondenominational. There are others than There are Jewish leaders that will participate and always have.  This coming Thursday is that day. Thousands of cities around the country will observe the National Day of Prayer that President Trump will do, as all the Presidents for many decades have done, and sign recognizing that as the Day of Congress has passed it recognizing that. Though Senator Schumer wouldn't let us have it in the rotunda, it will be in Statuary Hall, and it will be a day of prayer, thanksgiving, and fasting for some.  Our National Day of Prayer is really a day of celebration. I think it is something that has characterized this Nation from our very beginning. We had an order like none other from any commander I am ever familiar with. In my 4 years in the Army, we never had a commander issue an order like this. And certainly if one had been issued under the Obama administration's generals and admirals, the administration would have, no doubt, fired them immediately.  Washington issued an order for all its commanders that they had to allow our military members fighting for the United States to worship on They were to set up chaplains in each unit if there was someone who could fulfill that role, and, if not, they would be allowed to go to another unit's worship of the Lord on  Now, that was back in our founding. That is when we were fighting for existence. And for all those who have turned a blind eye to the real history of America--which is really hard to do with all of the evidence that is so overwhelming. But if one would just go down to the State Department down the road here, within the glass case there at the State Department, they have a copy of the original Treaty of Paris, 1783.  It surprised me. As much as I have studied history, I did not know how it started until I saw that. And I was actually with our pastor from Green Acres Baptist Church there in He and his wife, Cindy, were with me and my wife,  I have actually not been on a tour of the State Department since. A lot of it is pretty boring, but this is intriguing. This is the front of the Treaty of Paris, 1783. This was the document that required England, Great Britain, to recognize, in writing, that the United States of America was an independent country, that we did not have to do what we were dictated to by Great Britain, and that we were free and independent. There was still concern there in 1783.                              {time}  1300  Yes, they surrendered at Yorktown under General Cornwallis' command, but it is still 1783, the delegates are there at Paris, and the United States delegates are trying to figure out: How do we get these people to swear that they recognize we have a right to be independent? What can we get them to swear under that is so important to us and so important to those delegates from England that they would not dare break that oath?  Should we have them swear in the name of Allah, or Muhammad, or Confucius, or Buddha? What could we get the representative delegates from Great Britain, the United Kingdom, the most powerful empire in the world at that time, the most powerful military, navy to swear to? They are a lot bigger than us. What do we get them to swear under so that we know they have to take it seriously?  Well, they came up with it, and it starts the treaty, and it is the only thing in the Treaty of Paris that is huge lettering. And even I was surprised. In huge lettering, it says: ``In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity. . . .'' That is how the Treaty of Paris starts. That is what the United Kingdom Representatives had to swear under: ``In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity.''  It is also worth noting, as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the planner of 9/11--thank God he is still in Guantanamo Bay--he noted in his pleading, he gave the reference to the verse in the Koran that says that anyone who attempts to attach someone else to God, to Allah, should be killed. It is a capital offense. It is a death-penalty offense the way Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, ISIS, and others read the Koran, the way the radicals read it. It is a death-penalty offense, as he points out in his pleadings, if you say God has a son. If you say there is a Holy Trinity, that is worth the death penalty for the radical Islamists--not for the moderates, but some estimate 10 percent of  It is a capital offense, and both the United Kingdom Representatives and the United States of America Representatives signed proudly the Treaty of Paris, recognizing our independence, proclaiming what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed says is a death-penalty sentence. ``In the name of the most holy and undivided trinity.'' They said right there. It started our country, independently.  We recognize there is a most holy and undivided trinity. We say the Declaration of Independence started us, but that didn't really happen until somebody else agrees it is true. And our enemy, at that time, agreed it was true, and we began our And this National Day of Prayer is a day of rejoicing, a day of thanksgiving to the most holy and undivided trinity. And it would have been awesome if it could have been in the rotunda, but, under the rules of the Senate, if any Senator puts a hold on the bill, then it doesn't go forward for unanimous consent.  Hopefully, Senator Schumer is still there next year when it comes time. Hopefully, he won't put a hold on it if Anne Graham Lotz still has a vision of having the National Day of Prayer[[Page H2967]]celebration there in the Nation's rotunda.  But instead, next Thursday, it will be after 5 so it doesn't interfere with the normal workings. I had no problem with having the Holocaust recognition at 11 a.m. in the morning. Not only did I not have a problem with it, I was proud that we did it during the day like that. It should be noted. People should understand that unless you stand up for freedom, stand up for the teachings of Jesus, stand up for things that are actually in the Bible, you are not going to have the kind of freedom that allows people to be part of the greatest country in the world because that greatest country in world history will end up sliding down to the dustbin of history.  So it will be a great day. Mr.Speaker, I hope to see you there.  I yield back the remainder of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-28-pt1-PgH2962-2.txt,1801,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE FIGHT AGAINST,2017.0,28.0,May

12120,topic-id,1889,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, Federal law provides a list of 16 aggravating factors a jury is required to consider when deciding whether a death sentence is warranted in a Federal capital case. These factors include whether the defendant acted in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner; whether the defendant engaged in substantial planning and premeditation; whether the victim was particularly vulnerable; and whether the victim was a high public official.  High public official, as defined in the statute, includes a litany of high-ranking public persons from the President, to a foreign head of state, to a judge or law enforcement officer. Currently, however, the law only contains specific protections for Federal officers, not State and local officers.  H.115, the Thin Blue Line Act, introduced by my colleague, Mr.Buchanan, amends Federal law to add the killing of a State or local law enforcement officer as an aggravating factor for a jury to determine during the sentencing phase of a trial, when the jury is considering whether a sentence of death is justified.  This legislation enjoys widespread support in the law enforcement community. And, Mr.Speaker, we can all understand why. In recent years, police officers across our Nation have laid down their lives in the service of their communities, often with little recognition or support.  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 17 police officers have already died as a result of gunfire this year. Most recently, 2 days ago, Deputy Sheriff Mason Moore of the Broadwater County, Montana, Sheriff's Office was shot and killed during a routine traffic stop. We honor Deputy Moore's sacrifice, which is a stark reminder of how a routine event can quickly turn fatal for an officer of the law.  Now, Mr.Speaker, it is true that the scenarios where the provision in H.115 applies may be limited. It is true that the vast majority of homicide cases are prosecuted in State courts. It is also true that the circumstances where a defendant killed a State or local law enforcement officer during the commission of a Federal capital offense are probably limited.  But H.115 is, nevertheless, vitally important in the scenarios where it will apply--for example, in many terrorism cases. My colleagues may not remember that the terrorist who bombed the Boston Marathon also murdered an MIT police officer during their flight from the law. H.115 would also apply to situations where a State or local officer is killed serving as a member of a Federal task force. And it would cover volunteer first responders, who are, of course, authorized by law to carry out their duties.  Mr.Speaker, this legislation sends a simple message: The stalking and killing of law enforcement officers will not be tolerated.  H.115 is straightforward, commonsense legislation that will provide all the men and women of law enforcement, who serve and protect our communities every day, with the support they deserve.  As we conclude the 2017 National Police Week, I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr.Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill.                                           National Association of                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,                                  Alexandria, VA, January 5, 2017.     Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Buchanan: On behalf of the National      Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to      you to express our strong support for the Thin Blue Line       NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from      across the United States that serves to advance the interests      of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal      advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,      NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and      associations, including the Florida Police Benevolent      Association, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more      than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair      and effective crime control and law enforcement.       The Thin Blue Line Act increases penalties on those who      harm or target for harm public safety officers by making the      murder or attempted murder of a local police officer,      firefighter, or first responder an aggravating factor in      death penalty determinations.       This bill is critical, as law enforcement officer assaults,      injuries, and deaths have increased sharply in recent years.      In 2016 alone, ambush-style killings of law enforcement      officers increased by 167 percent. Establishing stricter      penalties for those who harm or target for harm law      enforcement officers will deter crime. Any persons      contemplating harming an office must know that they will face      serious punishments. NAPO strongly believes that increased      penalties make important differences in the attitudes of      criminals toward public safety officers, and ensure      protection for the community.       We thank you for your continued support of the law      enforcement community and we look forward to working with you      to pass this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                    William Johnson, Esq., CAE,     Executive                                  ____                                                National Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, 9 January 2017.     Vernon Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the      members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our      strong support for H.115, the ``Thin Blue Line Act.''       The ``Thin Blue Line Act'' increases the penalty for an      individual who targets, kills, or attempts to kill a person      who is a law enforcement officer, firefighter or any other      public safety officer, while he or she was engaged in the      performance of his or her official duties, because of the      performance of his or her official duties, or because of his      or her status as a public official or employee.       Law enforcement officers have always faced threats while on      duty but within the past few years, officers have become a      target for violence solely because of the uniform they wear.      As you know, the FOP has called upon Congress to expand the      current Federal hate crimes law to include law enforcement      officers for this very reason.       Of the 63 deaths by gunfire suffered by law enforcement in      2016, 21 of them--that's 33%--were ambush killings. These      were deliberate and sadly successful efforts by individuals      who set out to kill a police officer:       The ambush attack against the Dallas Police Department; the      deadliest day for law enforcement since 9/11 that saw 5      officers killed from gunfire;       The ambush attack against members of the Baton Rouge Police      Department that saw 3 officers killed from gunfire;       The ambush attack against 2 Iowa police officers, Scott      Martin and Anthony Beminio who were killed as they sat in      their respective patrol cars;       Officer Thomas Cottrell of the Danville Police Department      (OH) was killed by ambush.       All of these officers died because of the uniforms they      were wearing. Those in our profession have always been in      harm's way. It is our job to protect others but it should not      be ``part of the job'' to be a target of someone who is      looking simply to kill a cop. We do not accept that our      uniforms alone make us targets because someone was driven to      rage over a perceived injustice or desires to strike a blow      against our civil government.       On behalf of more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal      Order of Police, I want to[[Page H4334]]     thank you for introducing this legislation and amendment. If      I can be of any further help, please do not hesitate to      contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington      office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National                                  ____         Sergeants Benevolent Association, Police Department, City            of New York,                                                 January 17, 2017.     Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Representative Buchanan: I am writing on behalf of the      more than 13,000 members of the Sergeants Benevolent      Association of the New York City Police Department to advise      you of our strong support for H.115, the ``Thin Blue Line      Act.''       For too long, members of the NYPD, along with law      enforcement officers across this nation, have been targets.      There has been a proliferation of groups and pundits      impugning the motives and mission of law enforcement. They do      so with no regard for the impact it has on our ability to      protect life, property, and the freedoms we all hold dear.      These constant attacks and the excessive, exaggerated      rhetoric of anti-police elements have led some to declare an      open season on police officers, and to welcome with cheers      and praise the cowardly criminals who target law enforcement      officers with acts of violence. We saw this first hand in New      York City in December 2014, when Officers Wenjian Liu and      Rafael Ramos were ambushed and senselessly murdered as they      sat in their radio car on a Brooklyn street corner.      Unfortunately, they are not alone. According to the National      Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, in 2016 there were 21      police officers killed in ambush-style attacks. Shockingly,      20 of these officers were killed in eight multiple-shooting      death incidents--such as those that claimed the lives of 8      officers in Baton Rouge, LA and Dallas, TX--the highest total      of any year since 1932.       It is for these reasons and many others that the      legislation you have introduced is so important. The ``Thin      Blue Line Act'' would make the murder or attempted murder of      police officers, prosecutors, firefighters, and other first      responders at any level of government an aggravating factor      in federal death penalty determinations. The bill applies to      things like the interstate homicide of an officer, and is      applicable whether the officer is murdered on duty, because      of the performance of their duty, or because of their status      as a public official. While we know that law enforcement      officers will continue to be targets, regardless of their      uniform and whether they are on duty or off, active or      retired, this legislation sends the message that any action      to target law enforcement officers for murder or violence      will be met with the harshest of penalties. And that is a      message that is long overdue.       On behalf of the membership of our organization, thank you      for your leadership on this important issue. We look forward      to working with you to see it swiftly enacted into law.           Sincerely,                                                       Ed Mullins,                                      ____                                             Major County Sheriffs                                                   of America,                                                   April 25, 2017.     Vern Buchanan,     House of Representatives,     Washington,       Dear Congressman Buchanan: I write to you today on a matter      of significant importance to the Major County Sheriffs of      America (MCSA) and all of America's law enforcement      professionals. MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs      representing the Nation's largest counties with populations      of 500,000 or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100      million       As Vice President in charge of Government Affairs for the      MCSA, I am pleased to express our association's support of      your legislation, the Thin Blue Line This legislation      would make the murder of law enforcement officers,      firefighters and other first responders an aggravating factor      in capital punishment determinations.       In 2016, one hundred forty-four officers died in the line      of duty and to date, line of duty deaths are up 10 percent.      The targeting of law enforcement officers is unconscionable      and those who commit such heinous acts should be prosecuted      to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers      and other first responders have the right to go home to their      families at the end of their shifts.       The Thin Blue Line Act is a step in the right direction and      your work on this legislation is sincerely appreciated. We      value your support and look forward to working with you in      the future.

(b) Implementation of Safe Harbor.--In implementing the      safe harbor pursuant to subsection (a), the Commission      shall--       (1) not, in the case of a covered investment fund with a      class of securities in substantially continuous distribution,      condition the safe harbor on whether the broker's or dealer's      publication or distribution of a covered investment fund      research report constitutes such broker's or dealer's      initiation or reinitiation of research coverage on such      covered investment fund or its securities;       (2) not--       (A) require the covered investment fund to have been      registered as an investment company under the Investment      Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.80a-1 et seq.) or subject to      the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the      Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.78m, 78o(d)) for      any period exceeding the period of time referenced under      paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1) of section 230.139 of title 17,      Code of Federal Regulations; or       (B) impose a minimum float provision exceeding that      referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)(1)(i) of section 230.139      of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations;       (3) provide that a self-regulatory organization may not      maintain or enforce any rule that would--       (A) prohibit the ability of a member to publish or      distribute a covered investment fund research report solely      because the member is also participating in a registered      offering or other distribution of any securities of such      covered investment fund; or       (B) prohibit the ability of a member to participate in a      registered offering or other distribution of securities of a      covered investment fund solely because the member has      published or distributed a covered investment fund research      report about such covered investment fund or its securities;      and       (4) provide that a covered investment fund research report      shall not be subject to section 24(b) of the Investment      Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.80a-24(b)) or the rules and      regulations thereunder, except that such report may still be      subject to such section and the rules and regulations      thereunder to the extent that it is otherwise not subject to      the content standards in the rules of any self-regulatory      organization related to research reports, including those      contained in the rules governing communications with the      public regarding investment companies or substantially      similar standards.       (c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed as in any way limiting--       (1) the applicability of the antifraud or antimanipulation      provisions of the Federal securities laws and rules adopted      thereunder to a covered investment fund research report,      including section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.     77q), section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15      U.S.80a-33), and sections 9 and 10 of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.78i, 78j); or       (2) the authority of any self-regulatory organization to      examine or supervise a member's practices in connection with      such member's publication or distribution of a covered      investment fund research report for compliance with      applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws or self-     regulatory organization rules related to research reports,      including those contained in rules governing communications      with the public, or to require the filing of communications      with the public the purpose of which is not to provide      research and analysis of covered investment funds.       (d) Interim Effectiveness of Safe Harbor.--[[Page H2979]]       (1) In general.--From and after the 270-day period      beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, if the      Commission has not adopted revisions to section 230.139 of      title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, as required by      subsection (a), and until such time as the Commission has      done so, a broker or dealer distributing or publishing a      covered investment fund research report after such date shall      be able to rely on the provisions of section 230.139 of title      17, Code of Federal Regulations, and the broker or dealer's      publication of such report shall be deemed to satisfy the      conditions of subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of section 230.139      of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, if the covered      investment fund that is the subject of such report satisfies      the reporting history requirements (without regard to Form S-     3 or Form F-3 eligibility) and minimum float provisions of      such subsections for purposes of the Commission's rules and      regulations under the Federal securities laws and the rules      of any self-regulatory organization, as if revised and      implemented in accordance with subsections (a) and (b).       (2) Status of covered investment fund.--After such period      and until the Commission has adopted revisions to section      230.139 and FINRA has revised rule 2210, for purposes of      subsection (c)(7)(O) of such rule, a covered investment fund      shall be deemed to be a security that is listed on a national      securities exchange and that is not subject to section 24(b)      of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.80a-24(b)).       (3) Covered investment funds communications.--       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),      communications that concern only covered investment funds      that fall within the scope of section 24(b) of the Investment      Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.80a-24(b)) shall not be      required to be filed with       (B) Exception.--FINRA may require the filing of      communications with the public if the purpose of those      communications is not to provide research and analysis of      covered investment funds.

11918,topic-id,561,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today I rise in support of H.910, the Fair Access to Investment Research Act, which I have had the pleasure of working on with my friend from Illinois (Mr.Foster) in this Congress and now-Governor Carney in the last  Mr.Foster, I had the pleasure to speak with Governor Carney this weekend and tell him of our great collaboration in this Congress, and he sends his warmest regards for the process.  This bill, Mr.Speaker, is a commonsense, bipartisan, bicameral effort to increase access to research and information on exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, an important and rapidly growing investment vehicle in the United States and around the world.  Before coming to Congress, I worked in the banking and investment industry for nearly three decades, and I have witnessed firsthand the explosive growth in the ETF industry. Since I started my latest firm in the late 1990s, I have seen the exchange-traded fund selection grow from about 100 funds with about $100 billion in total assets to today's 2,000 funds with about $2.4 trillion in investment assets.  However, despite this rapid growth in the popularity in the ETF market and their increasing importance to retail investors, most broker-dealers do not publish research on ETFs due to anomalies in our securities laws and regulations.  The SEC has implemented safe harbors for research in support of various asset classes, including listed stocks, corporate debt, and closed-ended funds, and Congress has provided explicit safe harbors for research related to the offerings of emerging growth company securities. However, despite their similarities to those asset classes, ETFs do not benefit from similar safe harbors.  An ETF safe harbor is also not a novel concept to the Commission, and there is bipartisan consensus that this is something that the SEC should have done years ago. In addition to providing feedback on this bill for the past 3 years, the SEC, itself, has looked at granting a safe harbor for ETF research on multiple occasions but never quite got around to it.  The Fair Access to Investment Research Act simply directs the SEC to provide a safe harbor for research reports that cover ETFs so that these reports are not considered offers under the Federal securities laws. Because ETFs are continuously brought to the market, a safe harbor is necessary for broker-dealers to publish this research.  It also holds the SEC accountable to Congress by providing an interim safe harbor if the SEC does not act within a 270-day period, which would be effective until the Commission finalizes its rules in this area.  Providing this safe harbor will increase access to investment information for consumers and improve the efficiency of our capital markets. Given the importance of ETFs to the market and to the 6 million or so U.households that hold ETFs, steps to facilitate research and allow investors access to this useful information are long overdue.  Mr.Speaker, we want more information for our consumers about how their investments work, how an ETF fits into their investment portfolio, how it is consistent with their time horizon and their goals, and what the transaction costs are. What are the unique strategies around that ETF? Does it, in fact, use leverage or not? All these kinds of details will help our consumers know more about these products.

11891,topic-id,377,"Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the information that he has given us.  Suffice it to say there are a couple of these bills, obviously, that give us great pause. But having said that, the Appropriations Committee, over the last few weeks, has marked up, I think, all of its bills now, 12 bills. There was discussion about bringing an omnibus with all 12 bills in it. That has obviously not happened, and so we have what we refer to as a minibus.  We only have 17 legislative days left, Madam Speaker, until the end of the fiscal year on September 30. First, I would like to ask the majority leader if he can tell us the process under which the minibus will be considered. As the gentleman pointed out, there are four distinct appropriations bills that are included in the minibus.  Is this going to be an open rule?  Will all of these bills be open to amendment, or will they be considered under a rule so that our Members can prepare for the consideration of these appropriations bills?  Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  Mr.Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time, and I thank him for his question.  Madam Speaker, he is correct that, as of today, all 12 appropriations bills will be done from committee, marked up in subcommittee and full committee, and I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for their work. They achieved something that has not been achieved before in the timeline that they were given, and it is extraordinary the work they were able to do.  It is correct in the Make America Secure minibus package that we are bringing, that that package covers over 66 percent of our total discretionary spending.  As the Rules Committee has noted, the bill will come under a rule, so it will be a structured rule. We assume that there will be hundreds of amendments, as the gentleman knows, just like in the NDAA, more than 200 amendments.  I would like it noted there were more Democratic amendments than there were Republican amendments in the process that we worked through, and that is why I expect there will be late votes next week as well.

11892,topic-id,362,"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Madam Speaker, the gentleman made an observation about there were more Democratic amendments. That is unusual for your bills. We usually find more Republican amendments to your bills than we do Democratic amendments. But having said that, I think the gentleman's observation is correct.  I want to make it clear to Members of the House, perhaps, who have not served here very long, the first year I was majority leader in 2007, it wasn't just consideration in committee. We passed through the House of Representatives all 12 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate prior to the August break so that the Senate had a full month to consider them. We didn't get them all done, as you have suspected.  But in any event, I don't think I have ever seen, Mr.Leader, an omnibus passed prior to the August break. Individual bills being passed, but a minibus of this nature with, as you point out, 66 percent of the discretionary spending, which, by the way, there is no budget, and, therefore, this breaks the sequester level. It breaks the agreements that we have had in the past under Ryan-Murray for 4 years, two Congresses, and the number that is being used is a number that was simply taken out of the air. There has been no vote on the floor, no other way to have set that number.

It ought to be considered by the  It ought to have every Member's ability to speak to the issue of whether or not we ought to build that wall, not whether we ought to have security--we all agree that we should and must have security--but whether we do it with a wall, as I said, in which many members of the current administration do not believe it will work and have been quoted as saying so in the past, and there are many Members on our side who feel that.  I would hope that the majority leader would at least make it known to the Rules Committee that we ought to have that as a freestanding amendment, not incorporate it in a rule that the vote for the rule or a vote against the rule is, of itself, a vote on the wall itself.  Lastly, Mr.Leader, I want to say that you and I are both very concerned about the Russian sanctions and Iranian sanctions bill that is pending. We have been working very hard on that, very constructively on that, and I look forward, over the next 24 hours, more or less, to see whether or not we could get that resolved.  We have introduced, as you know, the Senate bill as a House bill. We would be for that if it would be brought to the floor. But we want to make sure that we move a bill, as you do, as quickly as possible and get agreement with the Senate and move that bill to the President's desk.  I thank you for your work on that, and I look forward to working with you over the next day or two to see if we can achieve that objective together.

We watched that police dog climb a 6-foot-high fence to come to my rescue.  I remember my dad pulling people from fires. I remember riding in the back of an old Jeep that was overhauled from an Army Reserve to fight prairie fires and grass fires, something I am sure that kids wouldn't be allowed to do today. My dad took me to the firing range time and time again, and I would watch my dad shoot 25 rounds into a small circle the size of a quarter week after week, training to do his job right.

12126,topic-id,642,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation which would expand the death penalty by adding a 17th aggravating factor--killing or targeting a police officer, probation officer, or firefighter--to the list of 16 aggravating factors already on the books.  Mr.Speaker, I have the greatest respect for our Nation's public servants, our police, our firefighters, the men and women of the Armed Forces, our teachers, and our other government employees. They serve our Nation out of a sense of duty to our country and for the honor and privilege of helping others.  But I cannot, in good conscience, support the bill we have before us simply because its purported goal, though certainly not its result, is to protect our public safety officers. The legislation is unnecessary and duplicative since there are already extensive penalties at both the State and local level for the murder of law enforcement officers.  As we know, numerous studies have demonstrated that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent to crime in any event. Numerous studies have shown that what enhances the deterrent is certainty and swiftness of punishment, not severity of punishment. Therefore, adding the death penalty as a punishment is unlikely to prevent future violence against our police and our firefighters.  In addition, I believe the bill is counterproductive to our goal of improving law enforcement and community relations.  If you oppose the death penalty, as I do, because, in many cases, there is no appropriate access to counsel, which we know; because the death penalty has racial disparities in its application, which we know; and because, as we have seen over the past many years, there is a strong possibility of a wrongful conviction leading to the untenable situation of putting an innocent person to death, and we know that this has been done in my State and others, then you should oppose this bill and any bill expanding application of the death penalty which will result in innocent men and women being executed. This bill does nothing to correct any of these issues.  If you oppose the death penalty on moral and religious grounds, perhaps because you believe that all life is sacred and that the State should not sanction death as a punishment, then you should oppose this bill as well.  There is another fundamental objection to this bill. It is one thing to impose a death penalty for murder, bad as that is, or for any crime; it is another thing to impose a death penalty for attempted murder. This bill imposes the death penalty for attempted murder of police, firefighters, and probation officers.  I am not aware that we have in the law, anywhere, a death penalty for an attempted crime; and here, we are establishing a death penalty for an attempt, an unsuccessful attempt. The bill imposes the death penalty on persons who ``killed or attempted to kill.''  So under this bill, if you aimed the gun, even if you did not hit the person or injure him in any way, the death penalty would be imposed. This is a fundamental change in the law for which we are given no reason at all.  The law has always recognized a distinction between a terrible act and an attempted terrible act. The attempted terrible act certainly should be punished, but not as severely as the accomplishment of the terrible act. Here, we are establishing a death penalty for an unsuccessful attempt to commit the crime, and no reason is given for this fundamental break with our legal traditions.  So, for all these reasons--this bill is unnecessary, duplicative, ineffective, counterproductive, and where it is new, excessive--I oppose this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.Johnson) will control the time of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.Goodlatte).  There was no objection.

12128,topic-id,235,"Mr.Speaker, I hadn't planned to speak again, but a gentleman on the other side was just completely incorrect in what he said, and I have the bill here.  The bill does establish the death penalty for attempted killing, and here is[[Page H4336]]the language. The bill is very short. It says:       The law is amended by inserting after paragraph 16 the      following:       Paragraph 17, killing or targeting of law enforcement      officer.       The defendant killed or attempted to kill, in the      circumstance described in subparagraph B, a police officer,      etc.  And B says:       The circumstance referred to in subparagraph A is that the      person was killed or targeted while he was engaged in      performance of his duties, basically.  So this implies the death penalty lists, as an additional aggravating factor for the death penalty, someone who killed or attempted to kill a police officer, a probation officer, a firefighter while they were engaged in their duties--killed or attempted to kill. That is what it means when it says killing or targeting. Targeting means attempting to kill.  It is very clear. You cannot misread this. Maybe the drafter made a mistake, but it is very clear. This applies the death penalty to someone who kills or attempts to kill. It is the first instance I know of in the entire corpus of American law where an attempted murder, attempted killing, an attempted anything is given the death penalty.

12131,topic-id,165,"Mr.Speaker, I must again correct the gentleman on the other side. The underlying title 18 is the criminal code. It lists a series of crimes and a series of penalties, and then you have a list of aggravating factors, which make the death penalty mandatory if any of them are present. There are 16 aggravating factors. This is number 17 and adds an aggravating factor; and when this aggravating factor is present, the death penalty is mandatory.  Among the things this aggravating factor says, is ``attempt.'' So it is the first death penalty--for that matter, it is the first death penalty, mandatory or not, for an attempt, as opposed to an actual killing. Even if it weren't mandatory, we should not have a death penalty for an attempt. You should have a severe penalty, but a death penalty should be reserved for actual murder and such crimes, not for an attempt. Attempt is always punished more leniently than the actual accomplishment of the heinous act.  ",CREC-2017-05-18-pt1-PgH4332.txt,850,FAIR ACCESS TO INVESTMENT RESEARCH ACT OF 2017,2017.0,18.0,July

The medical professionals that this bill addresses are already eligible to become certified medical examiners. This bill simply allows them to utilize the alternative certification process for VA-employed physicians that is currently being finalized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Unfortunately, the most recent available data shows that, of the 54,000 medical professionals listed on FMCSA's national registry of certified medical examiners, only 25 are employed by the The online training and testing system being developed by FMCSA and the VA should help remedy this situation.

Allowing VA medical professionals to utilize online training and testing will make it easier for them to obtain certification, while ensuring they are familiar with the specific medical standards required for commercial drivers.  Though the FAST Act used the word ``physicians,'' the process that FMCSA has outlined should also be available for use by VA-employed nurse practitioners, chiropractors, physician assistants, and other qualified medical professionals.

The process works well in Northern New Jersey, where the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA) plays an important role advancing regional projects that provides an important opportunity for local communities to offer meaningful input.  I joined my colleague, Mr.Sires, in a letter last summer expressing concerns with the draft rule and requesting that the comment period be extended.  I appreciate the DOTs end goal: to make planning more efficient, more comprehensible to stakeholders and the public, and more focused on projects that address critical regional needs. However, in a rush to judgment and ignoring the concerns of many comments from across the county, the DOT finalized a well-intended, but misguided rule. Specifically, I object to the severity of its reconstruction of the planning processes, practices, and understandings that have been in effect for MPOs for decades, and the ability for the public to comment.  Most concerning to me is that the rule could require the redrawing of Metropolitan Planning Areas (MPAs) and require Urbanized Areas (UZAs) to have a common MPO or common Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP). For densely populated regions like Northern New Jersey, the proposed rule would reduce local decision-making by either forcing MPO consolidation or requiring a burdensome multi-region single long-term TIP that could weaken local input. The NJTPA region covering my district already includes 6.7 million people and its TIP is over $2 Billion--adding any more to their plate would be unwieldy. We just need to witness the dysfunction at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to know that mandating New Jersey to undertake transportation planning with New York City and New York State in this way would be a recipe for disaster.  I thank my colleagues for advancing this bill, look forward to this rule being put back on the shelf, and hope DOT can come up with something less burdensome in their quest to reform transportation planning processes.

11939,topic-id,509,"Mr.President, today I am introducing the DEPSCoR Reauthorization Act of 2017 along with Senators Rounds, Brown, Collins, Carper, Coons, Whitehouse, Shaheen, Cortez Masto, and  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that we have universities in all 50 States capable of working with the Department of Defense on advanced research topics. A truly National network of university researchers who understand the needs of the Department of Defense puts us in the best possible position to respond to the ever-changing threats our armed forces face. This network will also meet the workforce needs of our defense laboratories by training graduate students in defense-relevant research. This bill reauthorizes the DEPSCoR program, which is modeled on the NSF's successful EPSCoR program for States that receive relatively low amounts of Federal science funding. The bill will focus the DEPSCoR program on defense research, while allowing the scientists and engineers of our defense laboratories to work directly with university researchers from DEPSCoR-eligible  Seven years ago, Congress asked the National Academy of Sciences to study the EPSCoR programs. The study concluded that it was in the National interest to engage scientific talent in all 50 States, and that EPSCoR programs were a valuable part of a National strategy to maintain global scientific leadership. The report emphasized that successfully engaging all 50 States required the involvement of technology-driven agencies, including the Department of Defense, to complement the basic science focus of the  Until 2009, the Department of Defense managed an EPSCoR-like program, known as An independent evaluation of DEPSCoR, conducted by the Institute for Defense Analyses, showed that DEPSCoR research contributed to the DoD mission, producing high-quality research and new technologies that were operationally deployed in areas such as missile guidance and communications.  DEPSCoR also successfully developed defense research capabilities in States historically underserved by Federal research and development (R&D) funding. Since DEPSCoR stopped receiving Congressional support, defense research in DEPSCoR-eligible States has plummeted, with the decreases far larger than the relatively modest amounts going to DEPSCoR awards. This shows that DEPSCoR was doing what Congress intended the program to do: develop competitive defense researchers in all 50  The impact of cancelling DEPSCoR went far beyond research grants. Developing university research capabilities in all 50 States is critical to meeting DoD workforce needs. The Defense Laboratory Enterprise is more national in scope than NASA or the Department of Energy's National Laboratory system, with facilities in 24 States, including DEPSCoR-eligible The 2016 review of DoD laboratories by the Defense Science Board reported that these laboratories depend on locally trained scientists and engineers. Without relevant training provided through DoD-supported research projects at nearby universities, these facilities may struggle to find highly qualified scientists and engineers.  Because of these concerns, I have been working with my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, Senator Rounds of South Dakota, to revive this program. This reauthorization uses the lessons learned from the previous iteration of DEPSCoR to improve the program, making it more responsive to Department of Defense needs.  I invite our colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-07-25-pt1-PgS4193.txt,1982,FAIR ACCESS TO INVESTMENT RESEARCH ACT OF 2017,2017.0,25.0,June

They all put their lives on the line to keep this country and our communities safe.  Congress must always ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the proper tools and resources to get the job done, and I am honored to play a role in this important work through my service on the Judiciary Committee and the Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice, and  But, Mr.Speaker, law enforcement officers need more than equipment and funding. They need our support. They need our support because they are under attack. The last few years have seen a disturbing uptick in the instances of police being targeted by violent criminals just because they are wearing a badge.  According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, at least 64 police officers were shot and killed in the line of duty last year, 21 of which were ambush-style killings. Attacks in Dallas, Baton Rouge, Chicago, and other places were chilling reminders of the dangers these brave individuals face when they go to work.  It is time to send a clear, strong message: If you kill a law enforcement officer, you will be brought to justice and punished to the full extent of the law. That is why I am proud to support H.115, the Thin Blue Line  Under current law, killing a Federal law enforcement officer is an aggravating factor when considering a death sentence for the offender, just as it should be. However, the same deterrent and prosecution is not extended to State and local police officers, firefighters, or first responders. The Thin Blue Line Act would change this by making the murder of local law enforcement an aggravating factor when considering a death sentence.  Mr.Speaker, had this provision been in place just 4 years ago, it would have applied to the Boston bombing case when the bombers killed a local campus officer. It would also apply when State and local officers serve on joint law enforcement task forces.  States all over the country are taking action to support law enforcement through stronger protection for officers and stricter penalties for criminals, and I believe Congress should do the same.

In light of such news, the American people are right to wonder who at the VA may be receiving a bonus this year. They are also right to be concerned about the nature and conditions of such bonuses.  H.1690 would add a simple reporting requirement to existing law that will streamline the oversight of bonuses at the It requires the agency to proactively provide information to Congress that details the amount of each bonus awarded to senior executives as well as the job titles of the individuals and the location of their employment.  Because of the patterns of mismanagement at the VA, veterans must know how bonuses are being awarded at the agency, and Congress deserves to receive this information in as timely a manner as possible without having to request it each year. This bill increases transparency over the bonus process without placing an undue burden on the agency.  It is an honor to represent a district that is home to more than 55,000 veterans. I owe it to each of them every day to make sure that the VA is accountable and transparent. Our Nation's veterans deserve the very best healthcare for their service and sacrifice to our  Mr.Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their support, and I urge my colleagues to support H.1690.

12048,topic-id,387,"Mr.Speaker, I rise in strong support of 145, expressing the support of the House of Representatives for the fight against corruption in Central  In too many Central American countries, it has become common practice for government officials to use public office to enrich themselves instead of serving the public good. For too long, corruption has allowed violence and poverty to hold these countries back.  But recently, the people of Central America have made it clear that they are ready for a change. In the last 2 years, young people from across the region have taken to the streets and demonstrated, and some real progress has been made.  In Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, the attorneys general have demonstrated independence and real courage.  In Guatemala, Attorney General Thelma Aldana has worked closely with CICIG, the International Commission Against Impunity in Under the leadership of Ivan Velasquez, CICIG has been instrumental in improving the capacity of Guatemala's prosecutors and has assisted with effective investigations into corruption and human rights violations.  In Honduras, Attorney General Oscar Chinchilla has worked with the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras, MACCIH, since 2016. Led by Juan Jimenez, MACCIH has promoted important legal reforms and is assisting with the investigations of high-profile corruption cases.  In El Salvador, Attorney General Douglas Melendez has made significant progress in tackling high-level corruption cases. I hope that the Government of El Salvador will recognize the value of CICIG and MACCIH and accept the international assistance that the attorney general and his prosecutors so clearly need.  Mr.Speaker, the countries of the Northern Triangle are at a crucial point in this fight against corruption, and we cannot turn back the progress that has been made. This resolution will send a very clear message that the United States will be a steadfast partner in its support for the fight against corruption in Central  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.

12064,topic-id,175,"Mr.Speaker, when President Trump withdrew from the Paris climate accord last week, I was in Germany meeting with some of that country's top officials, legislators, and business leaders. In our conversations, many of my German counterparts rightly emphasized that climate change is a major world threat, with potential to cause widespread and long-lasting damage if not acted upon.  So the news of President Trump's unilateral decision drew sharp criticism and deep concern. Our longtime allies viewed withdrawal as America ceding international leadership and turning its back on the world.  Indeed, withdrawing from the Paris climate accord reduces our ability to help shape a solution to the climate change crisis and retreats from our responsibility to serve as a global leader. It also ignores the role we, here in the United States, play in contributing to climate change.  I stand in strong support of American businesses and State and local leaders across our country who see beyond the shortsighted approach of this decision and will remain committed to furthering the goals of the Paris accord.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-06-07-pt1-PgH4659-2.txt,1884,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,2017.0,7.0,May
11938,topic-id,1886,"Mr.President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                1624       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Children, Farmers,      and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017''.     2.       Congress finds as follows:       (1) In 1996, Congress unanimously passed the Food Quality      Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-170; 110 1489)      (referred to in this section as ``FQPA''), a comprehensive      overhaul of Federal pesticide and food safety policy. That      Act amended the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and      Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.136 et seq.) (referred to in this      section as ``FIFRA'') and the Federal Food, Drug, and      Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.301 et seq.), the laws that govern      how the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to in this      section as the ``EPA'') registers pesticides and pesticide      labels for use in the United States and establishes      tolerances or acceptable levels for pesticide residues on      food.       (2) The FQPA directs the EPA to ensure with ``reasonable      certainty'' that ``no harm'' will result from food, drinking      water, and other exposures to a pesticide. If EPA cannot make      this safety finding, it must prohibit residues and use of the      pesticide on food. The FQPA mandates that EPA must consider      children's special sensitivity and exposure to pesticide      chemicals and must make an explicit determination that the      pesticide can be used with a ``reasonable certainty of no      harm'' to children. In determining acceptable levels of      pesticide residue, EPA must account for the potential health      harm from pre-and postnatal exposures. The economic benefits      of pesticides cannot be used to override this health-based      standard for children from food and other exposures.       (3) Chlorpyrifos is a widely used pesticide first      registered by EPA in 1965. Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate      pesticide, a class of pesticides developed as nerve agents in      World War II and adapted for use as insecticides after the      war. Chlorpyrifos and other organophosphate pesticides affect      the nervous system through inhibition of cholinesterase, an      enzyme required for proper nerve functioning. Acute      poisonings occur when nerve impulses pulsate through the[[Page S4194]]     body, causing symptoms like nausea, vomiting, convulsions,      respiratory paralysis, and, in extreme cases, death. Based on      dozens of peer-reviewed scientific articles, EPA determined      that exposure during pregnancy to even low levels of      chlorpyrifos that caused only minimal cholinesterase      inhibition (10 percent or less) in the mothers could lead to      measurable long-lasting and possibly permanent      neurobehavioral and functional deficits in prenatally exposed      children.       (4) People, including pregnant women, are exposed to      chlorpyrifos through residues on food, contaminated drinking      water, and toxic spray drift from nearby pesticide      applications. Chlorpyrifos is used on an extensive variety of      crops, including fruit and nut trees, vegetables, wheat,      alfalfa, and corn. Between 2006 and 2012, chlorpyrifos was      applied to more than 50 percent of the Nation's apple and      broccoli crops, 45 percent of onion crops, 46 percent of      walnut crops, and 41 percent of cauliflower crops.       (5) Chlorpyrifos is acutely toxic and associated with      neurodevelopmental harms in children. Prenatal exposure to      chlorpyrifos is associated with elevated risks of reduced IQ,      loss of working memory, delays in motor development,      attention-deficit disorders, and structural changes in the      brain.       (6) There is no nationwide chlorpyrifos use reporting. The      United States Geological Survey estimates annual pesticide      use on agricultural land in the United States, and estimates      that chlorpyrifos use on crops in 2014 ranged from 5,000,000      to 7,000,000 pounds of chlorpyrifos.       (7) In its 2016 report, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,      and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel recognized      ``the growing body of literature with laboratory animals      (rats and mice) indicating that gestational and/or early      postnatal exposure to chlorpyrifos may cause persistent      effects into adulthood along with epidemiology studies which      have evaluated prenatal chlorpyrifos exposure in mother-     infant pairs and reported associations with neurodevelopment      outcomes in infants and children.''.       (8) Chlorpyrifos has long been of concern to      Residential uses of chlorpyrifos ended in 2000 after EPA      found unsafe exposures to children. EPA also discontinued use      of chlorpyrifos on tomatoes and restricted its use on apples      and grapes in 2000, and obtained no-spray buffers around      schools, homes, playfields, day cares, hospitals, and other      public places, ranging from 10 to 100 feet. In 2015, EPA      proposed to ban all chlorpyrifos food tolerances, based on      unsafe drinking water contamination, which would end use of      chlorpyrifos on food in the United After updating the      risk assessment for chlorpyrifos in November 2016 to protect      against prenatal exposures associated with brain impacts, EPA      found that expected residues from use on food crops exceeded      the safety standard, and additionally the majority of      estimated drinking water exposures from currently allowed      uses of chlorpyrifos also exceeded acceptable levels,      reinforcing the need to revoke all food tolerances for the      pesticide.       (9) Chlorpyrifos threatens the healthy development of      children. Children experience greater exposure to      chlorpyrifos and other pesticides because, relative to      adults, they eat and drink more proportional to their body      weight. A growing body of evidence shows that prenatal      exposure to very low levels of chlorpyrifos can lead to      lasting and possibly permanent neurological impairments. In      November 2016, EPA released a revised human health risk      assessment for chlorpyrifos that confirmed that there are no      acceptable uses for the pesticide, all food uses exceed      acceptable levels, with children ages 1 to 2 exposed to      levels of chlorpyrifos that are 140 times what the EPA      considers acceptable.       (10) Chlorpyrifos threatens agricultural workers. Farm      workers are exposed to chlorpyrifos from mixing, handling,      and applying the pesticide, as well as from entering fields      where chlorpyrifos was recently sprayed. Chlorpyrifos is one      of the pesticides most often linked to acute pesticide      poisonings, and in many States, it is regularly identified      among the 5 pesticides linked to the highest number of      pesticide poisoning incidents. This is significant given      widespread under-reporting of pesticide poisonings due to      such factors as inadequate reporting systems, fear of      retaliation from employers, and reluctance to seek medical      treatment. According to the EPA, all workers who mix and      apply chlorpyrifos are exposed to unsafe levels of the      pesticide even with maximum personal protective equipment and      engineering controls. Field workers are currently allowed to      re-enter fields within 1 to 5 days after chlorpyrifos is      sprayed based on current restricted entry intervals on the      registered chlorpyrifos labels but unsafe exposures continue      on average 18 days after applications.       (11) Chlorpyrifos threatens families in agricultural      communities. Rural families are exposed to unsafe levels of      chlorpyrifos on their food and in their drinking water. They      are also exposed to toxic levels of chlorpyrifos when it      drifts from the fields to homes, schools, and other places      people gather. EPA's 2016 revised human health risk      assessment found that chlorpyrifos drift reaches unsafe      levels at 300 feet away from the edge of the treated field,      and the chemical chlorpyrifos is found at unsafe levels in      the air at schools, homes, and communities in agricultural      areas. The small buffers put in place in 2012 leave children      unprotected from this toxic pesticide drift.       (12) Chlorpyrifos threatens drinking water. EPA's 2014 and      2016 risk assessments have found that chlorpyrifos levels in      drinking water are unsafe. People living and working in      agricultural communities are likely to be exposed to higher      levels of chlorpyrifos and other organophosphate pesticides      in their drinking water.       (13) In 2015, leading scientific and medical experts, along      with children's health advocates, came together, under      ``Project TENDR: Targeting Environmental Neuro-Developmental      Risks'' (referred to in this section as ``TENDR''), to issue      a call to action to reduce widespread exposures to chemicals      that interfere with fetal and children's brain development.      Based on the available and peer-reviewed scientific evidence,      the TENDR authors identified prime examples of      neurodevelopmentally toxic chemicals ``that can contribute to      learning, behavioral, or intellectual impairment, as well as      specific neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD or autism      spectrum disorder,'' and listed organophosphate pesticides,      among them. In the United States, based on reporting from      parents, 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability or      other developmental delay. The TENDR Consensus Statement      concludes that ``to help reduce the unacceptably high      prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders in our children,      we must eliminate or significantly reduce exposures to      chemicals that contribute to these conditions.''.     3. PROHIBITIONS RELATING TO       Section 402 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21      U.S.342) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if it      bears or contains chlorpyrifos, including any residue of      chlorpyrifos, or any other added substance that is present on      or in the food primarily as a result of the metabolism or      other degradation of chlorpyrifos.''.     4.

(b) Contents of Review.--The review under subsection (a)      shall--       (1) assess the neurodevelopmental effects and other low-     dose effects of exposure to organophosphate pesticides,      including in the most vulnerable subpopulations, including--       (A) during the prenatal, childhood, adolescent, and early      life stages; and       (B) agricultural workers;       (2) assess the cumulative and aggregate risks from exposure      described in paragraph (1), which shall aggregate all routes      of exposure, including diet, pesticide drift, volatilization,      occupational, and take-home exposures; and       (3) be completed and submitted to the Administrator not      later than October 1, 2019.       (c) Regulatory Action.--       (1) Applicability.--This subsection shall apply if the      Administrator becomes aware of any exposure to any      organophosphate pesticide, including exposures described in      paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b), that does not meet,      as applicable--       (A) the standard under section 408(b)(2) of the Federal      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.346a(b)(2)); or       (B) any standard under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,      and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.136 et seq.).

TITLE I--CHICKAHOMINY INDIAN TRIBE     101.       Congress finds that--       (1) in 1607, when the English settlers set shore along the      Virginia coastline, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe was one of      about 30 tribes that received them;       (2) in 1614, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe entered into a      treaty with Sir Thomas Dale, Governor of the Jamestown      Colony, under which--       (A) the Chickahominy Indian Tribe agreed to provide 2      bushels of corn per man and send warriors to protect the      English; and       (B) Sir Thomas Dale agreed in return to allow the Tribe to      continue to practice its own tribal governance;       (3) in 1646, a treaty was signed which forced the      Chickahominy from their homeland to the area around the York      Mattaponi River in present-day King William County, leading      to the formation of a reservation;       (4) in 1677, following Bacon's Rebellion, the Queen of      Pamunkey signed the Treaty of Middle Plantation on behalf of      the Chickahominy;       (5) in 1702, the Chickahominy were forced from their      reservation, which caused the loss of a land base;       (6) in 1711, the College of William and Mary in      Williamsburg established a grammar school for Indians called      Brafferton College;       (7) a Chickahominy child was one of the first Indians to      attend Brafferton College;       (8) in 1750, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe began to migrate      from King William County back to the area around the      Chickahominy River in New Kent and Charles City Counties;       (9) in 1793, a Baptist missionary named Bradby took refuge      with the Chickahominy and took a Chickahominy woman as his      wife;       (10) in 1831, the names of the ancestors of the modern-day      Chickahominy Indian Tribe began to appear in the Charles City      County census records;       (11) in 1901, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe formed Samaria      Baptist Church;       (12) from 1901 to 1935, Chickahominy men were assessed a      tribal tax so that their children could receive an education;       (13) the Tribe used the proceeds from the tax to build the      first Samaria Indian School, buy supplies, and pay a      teacher's salary;       (14) in 1919, Lee Moore, Auditor of Public Accounts for      Virginia, told Chickahominy Chief O.Adkins that he had      instructed the Commissioner of Revenue for Charles City      County to record Chickahominy tribal members on the county      tax rolls as Indian, and not as White or colored;       (15) during the period of 1920 through 1930, various      Governors of the Commonwealth of Virginia wrote letters of      introduction for Chickahominy Chiefs who had official      business with Federal agencies in Washington, DC;       (16) in 1934, Chickahominy Chief O.Adkins wrote to John      Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, requesting money to      acquire land for the Chickahominy Indian Tribe's use, to      build school, medical, and library facilities and to buy      tractors, implements, and seed;       (17) in 1934, John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs,      wrote to Chickahominy Chief O.Adkins, informing him that      Congress had passed the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known      as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.461 et      seq.), but had not made the appropriation to fund the Act;       (18) in 1942, Chickahominy Chief O.Adkins wrote to John      Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asking for help in      getting the proper racial designation on Selective Service      records for Chickahominy soldiers;       (19) in 1943, John Collier, Commissioner of Indian Affairs,      asked Douglas Freeman, editor of the Richmond News-Leader      newspaper of Richmond, Virginia, to help Virginia Indians      obtain proper racial designation on birth records;       (20) Collier stated that his office could not officially      intervene because it had no responsibility for the Virginia      Indians, ``as a matter largely of historical accident'', but      was ``interested in them as descendants of the original      inhabitants of the region'';       (21) in 1948, the Veterans' Education Committee of the      Virginia State Board of Education approved Samaria Indian      School to provide training to veterans;       (22) that school was established and run by the      Chickahominy Indian Tribe;       (23) in 1950, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe purchased and      donated to the Charles City County School Board land to be      used to build a modern school for students of the      Chickahominy and other Virginia Indian tribes;       (24) the Samaria Indian School included students in grades      1 through 8;       (25) in 1961, Senator Sam Ervin, Chairman of the      Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the      Judiciary of the Senate, requested Chickahominy Chief O.     Adkins to provide assistance in analyzing the status of the      constitutional rights of Indians ``in your area'';       (26) in 1967, the Charles City County school board closed      Samaria Indian School and converted the school to a      countywide primary school as a step toward full school      integration of Indian and non-Indian students;       (27) in 1972, the Charles City County school board began      receiving funds under the Indian Self-Determination and      Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.458aa et seq.) on behalf      of[[Page H4252]]     Chickahominy students, which funding is provided as of the      date of enactment of this Act under title V of the Indian      Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.     458aaa et seq.);       (28) in 1974, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe bought land and      built a tribal center using monthly pledges from tribal      members to finance the transactions;       (29) in 1983, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe was granted      recognition as an Indian tribe by the Commonwealth of      Virginia, along with 5 other Indian tribes; and       (30) in 1985, Governor Gerald Baliles was the special guest      at an intertribal Thanksgiving Day dinner hosted by the      Chickahominy Indian     102.

(b) Federal Services and Benefits.--       (1) In general.--On and after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Tribe and tribal members shall be eligible for all      services and benefits provided by the Federal Government to      federally recognized Indian tribes without regard to the      existence of a reservation for the       (2) Service area.--For the purpose of the delivery of      Federal services to tribal members, the service area of the      Tribe shall be considered to be the area within 25 miles of      the Sharon Indian School at 13383 King William Road, King      William County,     304. MEMBERSHIP; GOVERNING       The membership roll and governing documents of the Tribe      shall be the most recent membership roll and governing      documents, respectively, submitted by the Tribe to the      Secretary before the date of enactment of this     305. GOVERNING       The governing body of the Tribe shall be--       (1) the governing body of the Tribe in place as of the date      of enactment of this Act; or       (2) any subsequent governing body elected in accordance      with the election procedures specified in the governing      documents of the     306. RESERVATION OF THE       (a) In General.--Upon the request of the Tribe, the      Secretary of the Interior--       (1) shall take into trust for the benefit of the Tribe any      land held in fee by the Tribe that was acquired by the Tribe      on or before January 1, 2007, if such lands are located      within the boundaries of King William County, Caroline      County, Hanover County, King and Queen County, and New Kent      County, Virginia; and       (2) may take into trust for the benefit of the Tribe any      land held in fee by the Tribe, if such lands are located      within the boundaries of King William County, Caroline      County, Hanover County, King and Queen County, and New Kent      County,       (b) Deadline for Determination.--The Secretary shall make a      final written determination not later than three years of the      date which the Tribe submits a request for land to be taken      into trust under subsection (a)(2) and shall immediately make      that determination available to the       (c) Reservation Status.--Any land taken into trust for the      benefit of the Tribe pursuant to this paragraph shall, upon      request of the Tribe, be considered part of the reservation      of the       (d) Gaming.--The Tribe may not conduct gaming activities as      a matter of claimed inherent authority or under the authority      of any Federal law, including the Indian Gaming Regulatory      Act (25 U.S.2701 et seq.) or under any regulations      thereunder promulgated by the Secretary or the National      Indian Gaming     307. HUNTING, FISHING, TRAPPING, GATHERING, AND WATER                          Nothing in this title expands, reduces, or affects in any      manner any hunting, fishing,[[Page H4254]]     trapping, gathering, or water rights of the Tribe and members      of the                   TITLE IV--RAPPAHANNOCK TRIBE,     401.       Congress finds that--       (1) during the initial months after Virginia was settled,      the Rappahannock Indians had 3 encounters with Captain John      Smith;       (2) the first encounter occurred when the Rappahannock      weroance (headman)--       (A) traveled to Quiyocohannock (a principal town across the      James River from Jamestown), where he met with Smith to      determine whether Smith had been the ``great man'' who had      previously sailed into the Rappahannock River, killed a      Rappahannock weroance, and kidnapped Rappahannock people; and       (B) determined that Smith was too short to be that ``great      man'';       (3) on a second meeting, during John Smith's captivity      (December 16, 1607, to January 8, 1608), Smith was taken to      the Rappahannock principal village to show the people that      Smith was not the ``great man'';       (4) a third meeting took place during Smith's exploration      of the Chesapeake Bay (July to September 1608), when, after      the Moraughtacund Indians had stolen 3 women from the      Rappahannock King, Smith was prevailed upon to facilitate a      peaceful truce between the Rappahannock and the Moraughtacund      Indians;       (5) in the settlement, Smith had the 2 Indian tribes meet      on the spot of their first fight;       (6) when it was established that both groups wanted peace,      Smith told the Rappahannock King to select which of the 3      stolen women he wanted;       (7) the Moraughtacund King was given second choice among      the 2 remaining women, and Mosco, a Wighcocomoco (on the      Potomac River) guide, was given the third woman;       (8) in 1645, Captain William Claiborne tried unsuccessfully      to establish treaty relations with the Rappahannocks, as the      Rappahannocks had not participated in the Pamunkey-led      uprising in 1644, and the English wanted to ``treat with the      Rappahannocks or any other Indians not in amity with      Opechancanough, concerning serving the county against the      Pamunkeys'';       (9) in April 1651, the Rappahannocks conveyed a tract of      land to an English settler, Colonel Morre Fauntleroy;       (10) the deed for the conveyance was signed by Accopatough,      weroance of the Rappahannock Indians;       (11) in September 1653, Lancaster County signed a treaty      with Rappahannock Indians, the terms of which treaty--       (A) gave Rappahannocks the rights of Englishmen in the      county court; and       (B) attempted to make the Rappahannocks more accountable      under English law;       (12) in September 1653, Lancaster County defined and marked      the bounds of its Indian settlements;       (13) according to the Lancaster clerk of court, ``the tribe      called the great Rappahannocks lived on the Rappahannock      Creek just across the river above Tappahannock'';       (14) in September 1656, (Old) Rappahannock County (which,      as of the date of enactment of this Act, is comprised of      Richmond and Essex Counties, Virginia) signed a treaty with      Rappahannock Indians that--       (A) mirrored the Lancaster County treaty from 1653; and       (B) stated that--       (i) Rappahannocks were to be rewarded, in Roanoke, for      returning English fugitives; and       (ii) the English encouraged the Rappahannocks to send their      children to live among the English as servants, who the      English promised would be well-treated;       (15) in 1658, the Virginia Assembly revised a 1652 Act      stating that ``there be no grants of land to any Englishman      whatsoever de futuro until the Indians be first served with      the proportion of 50 acres of land for each bowman'';       (16) in 1669, the colony conducted a census of Virginia      Indians;       (17) as of the date of that census--       (A) the majority of the Rappahannocks were residing at      their hunting village on the north side of the Mattaponi      River; and       (B) at the time of the visit, census-takers were counting      only the Indian tribes along the rivers, which explains why      only 30 Rappahannock bowmen were counted on that river;       (18) the Rappahannocks used the hunting village on the      north side of the Mattaponi River as their primary residence      until the Rappahannocks were removed in 1684;       (19) in May 1677, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was      signed with England;       (20) the Pamunkey Queen Cockacoeske signed on behalf of the      Rappahannocks, ``who were supposed to be her tributaries'',      but before the treaty could be ratified, the Queen of      Pamunkey complained to the Virginia Colonial Council ``that      she was having trouble with Rappahannocks and Chickahominies,      supposedly tributaries of hers'';       (21) in November 1682, the Virginia Colonial Council      established a reservation for the Rappahannock Indians of      3,474 acres ``about the town where they dwelt'';       (22) the Rappahannock ``town'' was the hunting village on      the north side of the Mattaponi River, where the      Rappahannocks had lived throughout the 1670s;       (23) the acreage allotment of the reservation was based on      the 1658 Indian land act, which translates into a bowman      population of 70, or an approximate total Rappahannock      population of 350;       (24) in 1683, following raids by Iroquoian warriors on both      Indian and English settlements, the Virginia Colonial Council      ordered the Rappahannocks to leave their reservation and      unite with the Nanzatico Indians at Nanzatico Indian Town,      which was located across and up the Rappahannock River some      30 miles;       (25) between 1687 and 1699, the Rappahannocks migrated out      of Nanzatico, returning to the south side of the Rappahannock      River at Portobacco Indian Town;       (26) in 1706, by order of Essex County, Lieutenant Richard      Covington ``escorted'' the Portobaccos and Rappahannocks out      of Portobacco Indian Town, out of Essex County, and into King      and Queen County where they settled along the ridgeline      between the Rappahannock and Mattaponi Rivers, the site of      their ancient hunting village and 1682 reservation;       (27) during the 1760s, 3 Rappahannock girls were raised on      Thomas Nelson's Bleak Hill Plantation in King William County;       (28) of those girls--       (A) one married a Saunders man;       (B) one married a Johnson man; and       (C) one had 2 children, Edmund and Carter Nelson, fathered      by Thomas Cary Nelson;       (29) in the 19th century, those Saunders, Johnson, and      Nelson families are among the core Rappahannock families from      which the modern Tribe traces its descent;       (30) in 1819 and 1820, Edward Bird, John Bird (and his      wife), Carter Nelson, Edmund Nelson, and Carter Spurlock (all      Rappahannock ancestors) were listed on the tax roles of King      and Queen County and taxed at the county poor rate;       (31) Edmund Bird was added to the tax roles in 1821;       (32) those tax records are significant documentation      because the great majority of pre-1864 records for King and      Queen County were destroyed by fire;       (33) beginning in 1819, and continuing through the 1880s,      there was a solid Rappahannock presence in the membership at      Upper Essex Baptist Church;       (34) that was the first instance of conversion to      Christianity by at least some Rappahannock Indians;       (35) while twenty-six identifiable and traceable      Rappahannock surnames appear on the pre-1863 membership list,      and twenty-eight were listed on the 1863 membership roster,      the number of surnames listed had declined to twelve in 1878      and had risen only slightly to fourteen by 1888;       (36) a reason for the decline is that in 1870, a Methodist      circuit rider, Joseph Mastin, secured funds to purchase land      and construct Stephens Baptist Church for the      Rappahannocks living nearby in Caroline County;       (37) Mastin referred to the Rappahannocks during the period      of 1850 to 1870 as ``Indians, having a great need for moral      and Christian guidance'';       (38) Stephens was the dominant tribal church until the      Rappahannock Indian Baptist Church was established in 1964;       (39) at both churches, the core Rappahannock family names      of Bird, Clarke, Fortune, Johnson, Nelson, Parker, and      Richardson predominate;       (40) during the early 1900s, James Mooney, noted      anthropologist, maintained correspondence with the      Rappahannocks, surveying them and instructing them on how to      formalize their tribal government;       (41) in November 1920, Speck visited the Rappahannocks and      assisted them in organizing the fight for their sovereign      rights;       (42) in 1921, the Rappahannocks were granted a charter from      the Commonwealth of Virginia formalizing their tribal      government;       (43) Speck began a professional relationship with the Tribe      that would last more than 30 years and document Rappahannock      history and traditions as never before;       (44) in April 1921, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson asked      the Governor of Virginia, Westmoreland Davis, to forward a      proclamation to the President of the United States, along      with an appended list of tribal members and a handwritten      copy of the proclamation itself;       (45) the letter concerned Indian freedom of speech and      assembly nationwide;       (46) in 1922, the Rappahannocks established a formal school      at Lloyds, Essex County, Virginia;       (47) prior to establishment of the school, Rappahannock      children were taught by a tribal member in Central Point,      Caroline County, Virginia;       (48) in December 1923, Rappahannock Chief George Nelson      testified before Congress appealing for a $50,000      appropriation to establish an Indian school in Virginia;       (49) in 1930, the Rappahannocks were engaged in an ongoing      dispute with the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United      States Census Bureau about their classification in the 1930      Federal census;       (50) in January 1930, Rappahannock Chief Otho Nelson      wrote to Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician of the United      States Census Bureau, asking that the 218 enrolled      Rappahannocks be listed as Indians;       (51) in February 1930, Truesdell replied to Nelson saying      that ``special instructions'' were being given about      classifying Indians;       (52) in April 1930, Nelson wrote to William Steuart at      the Census Bureau asking about the enumerators' failure to      classify his[[Page H4255]]     people as Indians, saying that enumerators had not asked the      question about race when they interviewed his people;       (53) in a followup letter to Truesdell, Nelson reported      that the enumerators were ``flatly denying'' his people's      request to be listed as Indians and that the race question      was completely avoided during interviews;       (54) the Rappahannocks had spoken with Caroline and Essex      County enumerators, and with John M.Green at that point,      without success;       (55) Nelson asked Truesdell to list people as Indians if he      sent a list of members;       (56) the matter was settled by William Steuart, who      concluded that the Bureau's rule was that people of Indian      descent could be classified as ``Indian'' only if Indian      ``blood'' predominated and ``Indian'' identity was accepted      in the local community;       (57) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau classed all      nonreservation Indians as ``Negro'', and it failed to see why      ``an exception should be made'' for the Rappahannocks;       (58) therefore, in 1925, the Indian Rights Association took      on the Rappahannock case to assist the Rappahannocks in      fighting for their recognition and rights as an Indian tribe;       (59) during the Second World War, the Pamunkeys,      Mattaponis, Chickahominies, and Rappahannocks had to fight      the draft boards with respect to their racial identities;       (60) the Virginia Vital Statistics Bureau insisted that      certain Indian draftees be inducted into Negro units;       (61) finally, 3 Rappahannocks were convicted of violating      the Federal draft laws and, after spending time in a Federal      prison, were granted conscientious objector status and served      out the remainder of the war working in military hospitals;       (62) in 1943, Frank Speck noted that there were      approximately 25 communities of Indians left in the Eastern      United States that were entitled to Indian classification,      including the Rappahannocks;       (63) in the 1940s, Leon Truesdell, Chief Statistician, of      the United States Census Bureau, listed 118 members in the      Rappahannock Tribe in the Indian population of Virginia;       (64) on April 25, 1940, the Office of Indian Affairs of the      Department of the Interior included the Rappahannocks on a      list of Indian tribes classified by State and by agency;       (65) in 1948, the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report      included an article by William Harlen Gilbert entitled,      ``Surviving Indian Groups of the Eastern United States'',      which included and described the Rappahannock Tribe;       (66) in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Rappahannocks      operated a school at Indian Neck;       (67) the State agreed to pay a tribal teacher to teach 10      students bused by King and Queen County to Sharon Indian      School in King William County, Virginia;       (68) in 1965, Rappahannock students entered Marriott High      School (a White public school) by Executive order of the      Governor of Virginia;       (69) in 1972, the Rappahannocks worked with the Coalition      of Eastern Native Americans to fight for Federal recognition;       (70) in 1979, the Coalition established a pottery and      artisans company, operating with other Virginia tribes;       (71) in 1980, the Rappahannocks received funding through      the Administration for Native Americans of the Department of      Health and Human Services to develop an economic program for      the Tribe; and       (72) in 1983, the Rappahannocks received State recognition      as an Indian tribe.     402.

(3) Tribe.--       (A) In general.--The term ``Tribe'' means the organization      possessing the legal name Rappahannock Tribe,       (B) Exclusions.--The term ``Tribe'' does not include any      other Indian tribe, subtribe, band, or splinter group the      members of which represent themselves as Rappahannock          403. FEDERAL       (a) Federal Recognition.--       (1) In general.--Federal recognition is extended to the            (2) Applicability of laws.--All laws (including      regulations) of the United States of general applicability to      Indians or nations, Indian tribes, or bands of Indians      (including the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.461 et seq.))      that are not inconsistent with this title shall be applicable      to the Tribe and tribal members.       (b) Federal Services and Benefits.--       (1) In general.--On and after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Tribe and tribal members shall be eligible for all      services and benefits provided by the Federal Government to      federally recognized Indian tribes without regard to the      existence of a reservation for the       (2) Service area.--For the purpose of the delivery of      Federal services to tribal members, the service area of the      Tribe shall be considered to be the area comprised of King      and Queen County, Caroline County, Essex County, and King      William County,     404.

11984,topic-id,854,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.984, the Thomasina Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017 will extend Federal recognition to the Chickahominy Tribe, the Eastern Chickahominy Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian  My district, the First Congressional District of Virginia, includes the historical tribal areas of several of these tribes. The six tribes are culturally and historically significant to the Commonwealth of Virginia and to the story of America itself. Ancestors from these tribes populated coastal Virginia when Captain John Smith settled at Jamestown in 1607. They were also the first of the American Indian tribes that entered into peace agreements, actually entered into peace agreements with the Crown of England because United States, at that time, was not formally a nation yet. So they were peace-loving even before the United States came of age.  Also, the connections that these tribes have with the Nation and the settlement of the Nation are extraordinarily important. If you go back in time, you know that six of these tribes were part of the Powhatan We know famously that Pocahontas was a member of the Powhatan Nation, and also there in Werowocomoco, there on the shores of the York River, saved the life of Captain John Smith; so we can see the significant impact that these tribes have had on the Nation's history and where we are today.  They are called first-contact tribes because they were the first tribes to contact the settlers as they came here to America to settle our land. In Jamestown there, the first connection they had was with these Virginia tribes. These first-contact tribes, as I have said, are intertwined with the birth of our Nation over 400 years ago, and they continue today to preserve a culture and heritage integral to Virginia and to the They are very proud of their history, and the tribal members today do much for our State in many different ways, as well as for our Nation, and are passionate about making sure that they are recognized, as other tribes are, in their critical nature to the government and Nation that we have today.  It is notable that many tribal members have also served our country bravely as part of the United States military. It is unacceptable that these tribal members, who selflessly and proudly served under the American flag during our Nation's conflicts, from the Revolutionary War to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have not been officially recognized by the Federal  Congressional recognition is also necessary because the record requirements by the Bureau of Indian Affairs administration process unfairly penalizes these Virginia tribes. Tribal records of these tribes were destroyed during the Civil War when many eastern Virginia courthouses were destroyed. Additionally, early 20th century Virginia racial purity laws barred Native Americans from identifying as Indian on State-issued birth certificates.  It is for these reasons that I am proud to have worked along with several of my Virginia colleagues in the House and the Senate to introduce this legislation that has received wide bipartisan support, including from former and current Virginia Governors who strongly supported this effort to recognize these tribes.  During the 114th Congress, the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs held a hearing on Virginia tribal recognition. Most recently, the committee marked up and reported the Virginia tribal recognition as part of Chairman Bishop's Tribal Recognition Act in During the legislative hearing, the previous administration's Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs testified that they did not object to action by Congress to enact the bill, given Congress' authority under the Constitution to recognize tribes. At the hearing, members of the committee also expressed bipartisan support for recognizing these six first-contact Virginia tribes.  Additionally, this legislation previously passed the House in both the 110th and the 111th It is clear that there is wide bipartisan support for this issue across the Commonwealth, across our Nation, and here in  Federal recognition would acknowledge and protect historical and cultural identities of these tribes for the benefit of all It would affirm the government-to-government relationship between the United States and these first-contact Virginia tribes as a matter of respect out of what they did in working to make this Nation what it is today and also in helping create opportunities to enhance and protect the well-being of tribal members.  This legislation will also provide certainty and finality on the gaming issue for the six Virginia tribes. H.984 clearly prohibits the tribes from conducting gaming activities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory The Federal Government's failure to recognize the Virginia tribes is a serious injustice, but it is one that we here today can correct.  Congress retains the authority to recognize Indian tribes, and I believe that it is right and just for us to continue to exercise that authority under the Constitution and recognize these six first-contact Virginia tribes. These first-contact tribes deserve equity and parity under the law. It is absolutely long overdue.  I urge your support for H.984.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

12071,topic-id,580,"Mr.President, I want to take a few minutes today to honor Alter Wiener, a selfless Oregonian who endured the horrors of the Holocaust and has shared his powerful story with countless students and adults. I would like to share his story with the Senate so that my colleagues can hear how he survived the Nazi atrocities and came to live in Hillsboro, OR, teaching young men and women in my home State the dangers of intolerance and exclusion.  Alter Wiener's story begins more than 90 years ago in the Polish town of Chrzanow, where he was born on October 8, 1926. Like many Jewish children, he attended both public and religious school and was taught the importance of family and faith. What was a happy childhood ended abruptly when the Nazis invaded his hometown in September of 1939. Mr.Wiener fled with his mother and siblings, but his father, forced to stay behind, was ultimately murdered by the  Barred from practicing his faith or attending school, Mr.Wiener was eventually ripped from his home in the middle of the night and deported to Blechhammer, a forced labor camp. He saw and experienced unimaginable horrors as he was moved from labor camp to labor camp, spending 3 long years in five concentration camps. When the Russian Army freed him in May 1945, he weighed only 80 pounds.  Mr.Wiener made his way to New York City, where he joined his cousins, the only other members of a family that numbered 123 to survive the Nazi atrocities. In New York, he worked tirelessly to rebuild his life, earning his high school diploma at age 38 and then a degree from Brooklyn He got married, started a family, and worked as an accountant. Through it all, he rarely spoke of surviving the Holocaust or the atrocities he had witnessed and endured. He says now that he simply didn't feel others would understand.  In 2000, Mr.Wiener moved to Hillsboro, The Oregon Holocaust Resource Center asked him to share his story, and, though he hesitated at first, he ultimately agreed to speak at Century High To his surprise, Mr.Wiener received hundreds of letters from students thanking him for changing their lives.  Mr.Wiener has since gone on to volunteer his time and energy to Holocaust education, giving more than 850 presentations to a wide range of audiences. In 2007, he published his autobiography ``64735: From a Name to a Number,'' detailing his harrowing experiences under the Nazi regime and his life thereafter.  Many of my colleagues have heard me talk about my own family's experience: how my parents fled Nazi Germany, how not everybody made it out, how we lost family in Kristallnacht and at Tolerance and inclusiveness are issues the Wydens take very seriously. That is why it is so special for me to be able to pay tribute to Alter Wiener today and to honor his work.  There is a concept in Judaism called tikkun olam, which means to repair the world. Truly, I can think of no bigger way to describe Alter Wiener's work than repairing the world. Every time he shares his story, more people understand the horrors of Nazi persecution and the inhumanity of the People also understand the importance of tolerance, pluralism, and inclusion, and they see the power of the human spirit to endure.  Today I offer my deepest affection and a heartfelt thank you to Alter Wiener for using your voice to teach generations to come to never, ever forget.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-27-pt1-PgS2614-3.txt,1247,TRIBUTE TO ALTER WIENER,2017.0,27.0,May
