                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Savior, lead us as a shepherd guides the sheep. We find consolation 
in the knowledge that You have gone before us to bring us to Your 
desired destination.
  Lord, direct the steps of our lawmakers so that even when they fail 
to fulfill Your purposes, You will continue to uphold them with the 
right hand of Your righteousness. May they remember that nothing can 
separate them from Your love. As they face the heat of tough decisions, 
provide them with the watered gardens and living springs of Your 
presence. Lord, You have begun a good work in them; carry it on to 
completion.
  We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.
