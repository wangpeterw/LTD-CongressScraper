                 WE NEED TO PASS A CLEAN DREAM ACT NOW

  (Mr. SCHRADER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Marco, 
a DREAMer in Portland, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to 
put forth a clean Dream Act bill.
  In 1995, Marco was brought to the United States when he was only 3 
years old. As a teenager with dreams of going to college, Marco 
realized he didn't qualify for financial aid because of his immigration 
status, but he did not allow this to deter him. Instead, Marco worked 
hard in various minimum wage jobs, allowing him the ability to attend 
college part-time.
  In 2012, after applying for DACA, Marco was granted a work permit, 
making it possible for him to earn a job with a law firm in Portland, 
where he worked his way up from the mailroom to be a legal assistant. 
His salary from the law firm enabled him to enroll in more classes and 
finally complete his bachelor's degree in accounting.
  Marco now works as an accountant for an Oregon nonprofit that helps 
benefit youth.
  This President claims to want only the best. I have news for him: we 
already have the best and brightest, and it is time we stopped treating 
them like second class citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, we need to pass a clean Dream Act bill.
