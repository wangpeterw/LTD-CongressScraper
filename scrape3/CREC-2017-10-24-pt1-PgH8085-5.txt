      TIME TO PASS NEW AUTHORIZATION FOR THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE

  (Mr. BANKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BANKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, four U.S. 
servicemembers were killed in Niger by Islamic militants. We thank 
these American heroes who paid the ultimate price for our country. 
Their service will never be forgotten.
  As we learn more about this situation, many of my constituents have 
asked why American personnel are in Niger to begin with.
  Today, we have U.S. servicemembers around the globe fighting or 
advising operations against ISIS, al-Qaida, and other terrorist groups 
on several continents. However, they are doing so under war 
authorization that Congress passed in 2001 and 2002, in the wake of the 
September 11 attacks.
  Rather than continuing to fight ISIS under an authorization passed by 
Congress 16 years ago, it is time to pass a new authorization for the 
use of military force that is focused on present-day and future 
threats.
  The authorizations passed by Congress in 2001 and 2002 are out of 
date. I have introduced new AUMF legislation that addresses the modern 
threats we face.
  The Constitution grants Congress the power of declaring war, and we 
need to take that obligation seriously and debate these important 
issues. My bill is a good starting point.
