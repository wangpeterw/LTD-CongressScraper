             HONORING THE LIFE OF BALTASAR CORRADA DEL RIO

  (Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize and honor the life of Baltasar Corrada del Rio, Puerto Rico's 
13th Resident Commissioner in Congress who passed away this Sunday at 
82 years old.
  Mr. Corrada del Rio was born and raised in Puerto Rico and was a 
founding member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. He served in this 
body from 1977 to 1985. He also served as mayor of San Juan, secretary 
of State, and associate justice for the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.
  Baltasar Corrada del Rio was a true statesman. His career exemplifies 
the qualities we all seek in our public servants: dedication, honesty, 
and love of our country. His life will be remembered for his unwavering 
support for American citizens of Puerto Rico and our quest for 
equality.
  Mr. Speaker, I pledge to continue Baltasar Corrada del Rio's work 
during my time in Congress and ask the House to join me in expressing 
condolences to his family and our profound gratitude for his years of 
service to Puerto Rico and in this Congress.
