   RECOGNIZING NICKLAUS CHILDREN'S NEW OUTPATIENT CENTER IN PINECREST

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nicklaus 
Children's Hospital in Miami on the opening of its new Sports Health 
and Urgent Care Center.
  With this new center, Nicklaus continues its proud tradition as one 
of the leading pediatric institutions in the Nation. Located in my 
congressional district, just down the street from my home in Pinecrest, 
this center will provide injury prevention and performance training 
programs, as well as rapid care, to our young athletes through the 
cutting-edge therapy services found at Nicklaus Children's Hospital. It 
will also serve as a resource to families to take their young children, 
sadly, in times of medical emergencies.
  For decades, Nicklaus Children's Hospital has inspired hope and 
promoted lifelong health in south Florida by providing the best care to 
kids in our community. It prides itself in bettering south Florida one 
patient at a time.
  So I invite everyone to come out and meet the staff of the new 
Nicklaus Sports Health and Urgent Care Center this Friday, December 15, 
at the Suniland Shopping Center in Pinecrest from 9 to 11 a.m.
