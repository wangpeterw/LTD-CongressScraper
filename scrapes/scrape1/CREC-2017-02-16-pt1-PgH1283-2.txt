                  THE THIRTY MILLION WORDS INITIATIVE

  (Mr. GAETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to a truly 
innovative pilot program in my district in Pensacola, Florida. This 
one-of-a-kind program, known as the Thirty Million Words Initiative, is 
a collaborative effort brought by researchers from the University of 
Chicago in partnership with the Studer Community Institute.
  The Thirty Million Words Initiative will educate parents of newborns 
at Sacred Heart Hospital, Baptist Hospital, and West Florida Hospital 
on best practices for speech and engagement during the critical 
learning stage up to 3 years old.
  As we all know, interaction by speech or music with young children 
has not only had an impact on learning abilities but also emotional 
needs. This program builds on this principle and strives to include all 
newborns, regardless of income level, race, or ethnicity.
  Through this simple commitment, we can challenge the socioeconomic 
stereotypes we have become too used to and build a future for leaders 
and innovators stemming from all walks of life and bringing new ideas 
for a vision for the future.
  This truly unique partnership between our community leaders and the 
parents of our future generation will garner a secure foundation for 
our children to bring stronger education, allow limitless 
possibilities, and meeting the challenges to build a better tomorrow.
