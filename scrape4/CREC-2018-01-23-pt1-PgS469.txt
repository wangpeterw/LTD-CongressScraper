SENATE RESOLUTION 377--RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FAITHFULLY SERVED AND RETIRED FROM THE ARMED 
FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES, DESIGNATING APRIL 18, 2018, AS ``MILITARY 
 RETIREE APPRECIATION DAY'', AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED 
STATES TO HONOR THE PAST AND CONTINUED SERVICE OF MILITARY RETIREES TO 
             THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE UNITED STATES

  Ms. WARREN (for herself and Mr. Cruz) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:

                              S. Res. 377

       Whereas there are approximately 2,000,000 retirees of the 
     Armed Forces of the United States who have earned their 
     retirement through career service, a service-connected 
     disability, or both;
       Whereas military retirees show an unrivaled dedication to 
     service, having faithfully served their country and dedicated 
     much of their lives knowing that at any moment they could be 
     sent anywhere in the world and possibly asked to make the 
     ultimate sacrifice to protect and defend the national 
     security of the United States;
       Whereas military retirees, through their perseverance and 
     dedication--
       (1) have proven to be leaders who are resilient, focused, 
     disciplined, well-trained, and well-educated; and
       (2) bring the best qualities of citizenship in the United 
     States to lifelong service within their national and local 
     communities as dependable, responsible citizens and 
     neighbors;
       Whereas the qualities of a military retiree often result in 
     positive contributions to--
       (1) the civilian workforce, as experienced and 
     knowledgeable employees;
       (2) local educational institutions, as teachers, 
     counselors, and coaches;
       (3) local government, as elected public servants; and
       (4) communities, as dedicated and effective volunteers;
       Whereas the dedication and focus of military retirees helps 
     strengthen and stabilize local communities; and
       Whereas the contributions of military retirees to their 
     communities are the manifestation of the desire of the 
     retirees to continue their selfless acts of volunteering and 
     their lifelong service to the United States: Now, therefore, 
     be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) designates April 18, 2018, as ``Military Retiree 
     Appreciation Day''; and
       (2) encourages the people of the United States to honor the 
     past and continued service
