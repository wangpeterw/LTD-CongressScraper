                      FRA ADMINISTRATOR NOMINATION

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on a related matter, in the few days 
since last week's tragedy, yet another fatal train crash has already 
taken place. Two lives were lost yesterday when a passenger train and a 
freight train collided in South Carolina. Last December, three people 
were killed and scores were injured near Seattle when a passenger train 
jumped its tracks and crashed into a busy highway.
  This worrying spate of accidents offers a sobering reminder that 
partisan obstruction has kept the Federal Railroad Administration, the 
top rail regulator, without an Administrator.
  The President's nominee, Ronald Batory, has more than 40 years of 
rail experience. I know of no questions about his qualifications. He 
was reported out of committee by voice vote on August 2 of last year, 
meaning that this important safety regulator has now been sitting on 
the Senate calendar for 6 months--6 months. My Democratic colleagues 
are holding his nomination over a parochial issue that is completely 
unrelated to rail safety. This needs to come to an end.
  The FRA Administrator is the Nation's top rail safety regulator. 
There is an urgent need and a highly qualified candidate. I hope my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle will put a stop to their 
partisan games on this front. We can and should confirm Mr. Batory 
today--today.
