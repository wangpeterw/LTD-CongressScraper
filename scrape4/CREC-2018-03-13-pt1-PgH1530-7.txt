                           EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS

  (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission 
to address the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
against the Right to Try Act.

[[Page H1531]]

  It sounds compassionate, but it only offers fake hope. An FDA process 
already exists to allow terminally ill patients to try experimental 
drugs at no charge. But the difference is that the proposal that we 
just voted on strips consumer protections and charges patients.
  The FDA program receives about 1,000 requests each year and responds 
in a few days, often recommending changes to enhance safety for the 
patient. Removing the FDA from the approval process does not add value 
and could instead be detrimental.
  The bill would open up access to drugs after phase I trials, which 
are very small and, more often than not, unsuccessful. This bill allows 
pharmaceutical companies to profit off of experimental drugs that could 
ruin the quality of life that is left.
  This bill creates the wrong incentives and pushes care for the 
terminally ill in the wrong direction, which is why I join patient and 
consumer advocates in their strong opposition to this bill. This was 
under suspension and, therefore, did not pass. I remain opposed to the 
bill.
