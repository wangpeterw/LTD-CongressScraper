                         FRIENDSHIP CIRCLE WALK

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the annual 
Walking 4 Friendship event.
  This past March 18, friends, families, and neighbors from my 
congressional district walked three kilometers to promote awareness and 
acceptance of children, teens, and young adults with special needs.
  More than 1,000 of my constituents walked to raise support for The 
Friendship Circle of Miami. This volunteer organization provides a 
number of social, recreational, and educational programs for some of 
the most vulnerable members of our society and helps them build lasting 
friendships.
  Mr. Speaker, the positive impact of The Friendship Circle is felt 
widely throughout our community and brings so much joy and comfort to 
young people with special needs and their families.
  I would like to thank the countless volunteers and local sponsors who 
make this organization and this wonderful annual event possible. Let us 
not forget their theme: Together, we can perform miracles.
