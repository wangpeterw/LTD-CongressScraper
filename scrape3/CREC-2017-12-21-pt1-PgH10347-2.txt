                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick J. Conroy, offered the following 
prayer:
  Dear God, we give You thanks for giving us another day.
  Bless the Members of the people's House in these few days before so 
many Americans gather with families and loved ones in a season of good 
will toward all.
  May that spirit pervade these Halls and Chambers, and may the work 
done and being done redound to the benefit of all, most particularly 
those whom You favor: the least among us.
  As always, we pray that all that is done be for Your greater honor 
and glory.
  Amen.
