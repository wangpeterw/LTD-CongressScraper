                    RECOGNIZING DR. TIMOTHY M. BLOCK

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my 
constituent Dr. Timothy M. Block, president of the Hepatitis B 
Foundation, Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, and the Pennsylvania 
Biotechnology Center in my district in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

  Dr. Block was recently named as a fellow of the U.S. National Academy 
of Inventors. Being elected as an NAI fellow is the highest 
professional recognition for academic inventors who have shown a 
lifelong commitment to innovation, specifically by facilitating or 
creating inventions that make a measurable impact on quality of life, 
economic development, and the welfare of society.
  Dr. Block is being recognized for his contributions to therapeutic 
drug and biomarker of disease screening and discovery. Dr. Block also 
holds more than nine patents and has been involved, for more than 30 
years, in viral hepatitis research.
  Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives thanks Dr. Block for the 
work that he has done in this field, which has undoubtedly impacted the 
lives of constituents in my district and people around the world.
