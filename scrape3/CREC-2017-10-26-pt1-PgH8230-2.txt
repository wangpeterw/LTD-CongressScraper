            C.J. RUDOLPH INSPIRES WITH GRIT AND PERSEVERANCE

  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of C.J. 
Rudolph of Sellersville, Pennsylvania. C.J. was born in December 2015, 
at Grand View hospital. Before he was born, he tested positive for the 
Trisomy-21 gene, meaning that he was going to be born with Down 
syndrome. But his parents, Chris and Donna, had faith he would be a 
fighter.
  From day one, C.J. battled just to stay alive. He had two heart 
defects and was immediately put in the neonatal ICU. As the condition 
became more critical, he was transferred to the Children's Hospital of 
Philadelphia and ultimately ended up at the University of Pennsylvania 
hospital.
  After 5 weeks at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, at the age 
of 58 days, C.J. underwent heart surgery performed by a miracle worker 
named Dr. Spray. Four days later, C.J. was finally able to come home 
with his parents.
  Mr. Speaker, at almost 2 years old, C.J. has overcome more obstacles 
than many of us will face in a lifetime. Today, C.J. serves as the 
inspiration of the Sellersville Fire Department and continues to 
inspire all those he encounters with his grit and perseverance.
